(Arbitration) 03 of 2020.\n\n    [ 2 ]              The factual context of the case is as under:\n\n              Appellant, M/s. Engineering Projects ( India) Ltd. (Epil for short) ( a\n\n    Government of India Enterprise) signed an agreement in the form of\n\n    Mou with the Department of Agriculture, Government of Tripura on\n\n    15.11.2007 for construction of the College of Agriculture at Lembucherra. \n\n    Appellant split up the entire project into 3 packages for suitably executing\n\n    the work and floated Notice Inviting Tender (Nit for short) for\n\n    construction of the college building at Lembucherra which was in\n\n    package-1. The Nit was so published on 06.02.2008. Respondent, M/s.\n\n    M.P Khaitan, a registered contractor participated in the tender process\n\n    along with other contractors and submitted its tender. The tender\n\n    submitted by the claimant-respondent M/s. M.P. Khaitan having stood the\n\n    lowest, the General Manager, Epil, Kolkata issued a Letter of Intent (Loi\n\n    for short) in favour of the claimant on 10.03.2008. An agreement was\n\n    thereafter executed between the appellant and respondent, M/s. M.P.\n\n    Khaitan on 25.04.2008. The Loi indicated that date of commencement of\n\n    the work would be reckoned from the 10th day of issuance of the Loi. \n\n    The         contract   between    the    parties    which   was    valued    at\n\n    Rs.22,79,80,148.70/- was stipulated to be completed within a period of\n\n    18 months i.e. by 20.09.2009. The different units which were to be\n\n    constructed under package-1 were to be as under:\n\nArb. A. 3 of 2022\n                                        Page - 3 of 15\n\n\n\n              (i) Boys' hostel, (ii) Guest house, (iii) Workshop, (iv) Auditorium,\n\n    (v) Boys' hostel (Pg), (vi) New college building complex with library and\n\n    canteen, (vii) Local shopping complex, (viii) Mini sports stadium, (ix)\n\n    Dispensary building and (x) Garage.\n\n    [3]             Since completion of the work within time depended on the\n\n    performance of the reciprocal obligations, it was agreed upon between\n\n    the parties that the appellant would hand over the dispute free worksite,\n\n    designs and drawings etc. to the claimant-respondent within the\n\n    stipulated time and the appellant would also make timely payment to the\n\n    claimant-respondent as per the agreement. \n\n    [4]             The claimant-respondent started the work in time and\n\n    applied due diligence for execution of the work in time but due to\n\n    frequent interruptions by the appellant, the claimant-respondent could\n\n    not complete the work within the stipulated period of 20.09.2009. By\n\n    20.09.2009, the claimant completed only one unit i.e. the Pg hostel. \n\n    Seven other units were completed on 19.07.2011 at 22 months' delay. \n\n    Even on 19.07.2011, the garage could not be completed due to non-\n\n    availability of proper site. \n\n    [5]             However, after delayed completion of the work, claimant-\n\n    respondent claimed completion certificate from the appellant but the\n\n    appellant, despite series of communications made by the claimant, did\n\n    not issue the certificate in his favour which deprived the claimant-\n\n    respondent of getting higher ranking from Nbcc and Government \n\nArb.

Aggrieved claimant-respondent moved the\n\n    Gauhati High Court by filing a writ petition seeking direction to the\n\n    appellant for issuing completion certificate. Pursuant to the order of the\n\n    High Court, completion certificate was issued to the claimant-respondent. \n\n    [6]             Having   received    the   completion   certificate   from   the\n\n    appellant, claimant raised bill of a sum of Rs.92,74,632/-. Gross value of\n\n    the work was Rs.22,79,80,148.70/-. After deducting the amount already\n\n    paid to him during the execution of the work, claimant raised the bill of\n\n    Rs.92,74,632/- i.e. the balance payable to him.\n\n    [7]             The appellant disputed the claim by raising various\n\n    objections. Claimant-respondent invoked the arbitration clause of the\n\n    agreement for referring the matter to the arbitrator for adjudication. The\n\n    impugned judgment of the Commercial Court indicates that initially one S.\n\n    Roy Chowdhury was appointed as sole arbitrator. The respondent filed his\n\n    claim statement supported by documents before the said arbitrator. The\n\n    arbitrator having resigned on 30.05.2018, the claimant-respondent\n\n    approached this High Court by filing Arb. Petition No.7 of 2018 seeking \n\n    appointment of the arbitrator and the present arbitrator was appointed by \n\n    this Court by an order dated 20.09.2018 . \n\n    [8]             In the course of arbitration, appellant filed counter claim\n\n    before the arbitrator. In its counter claim, appellant contended that\n\n    despite providing all contractual support, claimant-respondent delayed\n\n    the completion of the work. He took 22 months beyond the scheduled\n\nArb. A. 3 of 2022\n                                            Page - 5 of 15\n\n\n\n    date of completion to complete the work. While granting extension, the\n\n    appellant reserved the right to recover damages as per the agreement\n\n    under Clause 72.1 which provided as under:-\n\n                      \"If the contractor fails to maintain the required progress\n                in terms of Clause 72.4 or relevant clause of Acc to complete\n                the work and clear the site on or before the completion date or\n                extended date of completion, he shall, without prejudice to any\n                other right or remedy available under the law to Epi on\n                account of such breach, pay as agreed compensation the\n                amount calculated at the rates stipulated below or such other\n                smaller amount as the Engineer in Charge (whose decision in\n                writing shall be final and binding) may decide on the amount\n                of tendered value of the work for every completed day/week\n                (as applicable) that the progress remains below that specified\n                in Clause 72.4.1 or the relevant clause in Acc or that the work\n                remains incomplete.

A. 3 of 2022 \n                                          Page - 10 of 15\n\n\n                    the respondent, it surfaces that the issue was very specific, inter alia,\n                    that if the respondent is entitled to get balance payment on the value\n                    of work done amounting to Rs.92,74,663/-. The claim statement of\n                    the respondent so laid before the arbitrator as well as the issue so\n                    framed by the arbitrator make it abundantly clear that the interest is\n                    to be calculated on the value of work done . So the argument so raised\n                    by learned advocate for the petitioner stands not sustainable. As\n                    regards the point so raised as to issue No.3, it was contended that the\n                    petitioner did not get the opportunity to cross-examine the\n                    respondent on the documents on the basis of which the relief was\n                    granted. In this regard, we are of the considered opinion that such a\n                    contention nevertheless brings the matter within the mischief of\n                    section 34 of the Arbitration Act. That apart, the petitioner had the\n                    opportunity to make request to the arbitrator in view of section 24 of\n                    the Arbitration Act, but they omits to do so. \n\n                    8.     Now coming to issue No.9, it is apparent on the claim\n                    statement so submitted by the respondent before the arbitrator that\n                    the respondent specifically had claimed damages being suffered\n                    towards payment of insurance charges for car and Wc Policy. It\n                    follows, therefore, the argument so placed by the learned advocate\n                    for the petitioner, inter alia, that the issue No.9 stands beyond the\n                    submission of arbitration cannot be accepted. Moreover, no relief was\n                    granted by the arbitrator while deciding the issue No.9 on the\n                    reasoning that such claim stands beyond the agreement. \n\n                    9.      Similar to that of the issue No.1 the interest @ 10% per\n                    annum so granted by the arbitrator while deciding issue No.16, the\n                    issue itself is very much clear as to the amount on which such interest\n                    is to be calculated. \n\n                    10.     The scheme and scope of the provisions of Section 34 of\n                    Arbitration Act aims at keeping the supervisory roles of the court at\n                    minimum level, therefore, we cannot correct the errors, if any, done\n                    by the arbitrator by sitting as an Appellate Court and also by re-\n                    appreciating the matters on record, it can only be quashed leaving the\n                    parties to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. The contentions\n                    so raised on behalf of the petitioner do not bring the matter within\n                    the mischief of any of the grounds as enumerated in Section 34(2) or\n                    34(2-A) of the Arbitration Act in view of the law as referred to above. \n\n                           In view of the discussion as we had herein-above I order as\n                    follows.\n                                                   Order\n11. In the result, the application for setting aside the arbitral award dated 21.11.2019 made in Arb/2018(2)/Ss by the sole arbitrator Mr. Subhas Sikdar, Retired District Judge stands rejected......\" \n[23] As stated appellant has challenged the said judgment dated 25.2.2022 of the District Court by filing this appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act mainly on the following grounds:\nArb. A. 3 of 2022 Page - 11 of 15 (i) The District Commercial Court did not appreciate the fact that the sole arbitrator in his award dated 21.11.2019 did not specify the amount of award for which the District Commercial Court should have set aside the award.\n(ii) The sole arbitrator while deciding issue No.16 awarded interest on the award, but it was impossible to ascertain the amount of interest since the amount of award was not specified by the learned Arbitrator.\n(iii) The sole arbitrator travelled beyond the terms of the arbitration agreement for which the learned Commercial Court should have dismissed the award of the arbitrator. The arbitrator should have heard the Director of Agriculture for adjudication of the dispute. The learned Commercial Court overlooked this aspect and erroneously dismissed the petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. \n[24] Heard Mr. P. Majumder, learned advocate appearing alongwith Ms. S. Debbarma, learned advocate for the appellant. Also heard Mr. Somik Deb, learned senior advocate appearing alongwith Mr. A. Baran, Ms. R. Chakraborty, Mr. K. Debnath, and Mr. S. Majumder, learned advocates for the respondents. \n[25] Main contention of the appellant is that no amount of award has been specified in the arbitrator's award and as such, the same should Arb. A. 3 of 2022 Page - 12 of 15 have been dismissed by the learned District Judge (District Commercial Court).\n[26] Mr. Somik Deb, learned senior advocate appearing for the respondent on the other hand, contends that the arbitrator's award is well-founded which does not call for any interference. Counsel contends that by a detailed judgment, the District Commercial Court has rejected appellant's petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act and upheld the award made by the sole arbitrator by assigning good reasons. It is contended by Mr. Deb, learned senior counsel that contention of the appellant's counsel that the arbitrator has not specified the amount of award is not acceptable because, the arbitrator has recorded issue-wise findings and specified the amounts as admissible to the claimant- respondent under the various heads. Learned senior counsel, therefore, urges the Court to dismiss the appeal. \n[27] We have gone through the entire facts and circumstances of the case and the materials placed on record and considered the submissions of learned counsel representing the parties. The arbitral award dated 21.01.2019 is placed in file as Annexure-A. We have also gone through the arbitral award. As stated, the sole arbitrator framed as many as 17 issues in the claim of the present respondent and framed 5 issues in the counter claim filed by the present appellant and recorded issue-wise findings in the claim as well as in the counter claim. In his award, the sole Arbitrator seems to have specified the amounts awarded Arb. A. 3 of 2022 Page - 13 of 15 to the claimant-respondent under various heads. The appellant has failed to establish any patent illegality in the arbitral award. Award of the sole arbitrator is based on evidence and the arbitrator appears to have examined each of the issues in detail and assigned sound reasons for deciding those issues. \n[28] It is a settled position of law that the Court cannot sit in appeal and examine correctness of the arbitrator's award on merit. Court can interfere only on limited grounds. In this regard, we can profitably refer to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of McDermott International INC vs. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. and Others reported in (2006) 11 SCC 181 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as under:\n\"58. In Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. this Court laid down that the arbitral award can be set aside if it is contrary to (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; (b) the interests of India; or (c) justice or morality. A narrower meaning to the expression \"public policy\" was given therein by confining judicial review of the arbitral award only on the aforementioned three grounds. An apparent shift can, however, be noticed from the decision of this Court in ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd. (for short \"ONGC\"). This Court therein referred to an earlier decision of this Court in Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. Ltd. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly wherein the applicability of the expression \"public policy\"\non the touchstone of Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act and Article 14 of the Constitution of India came to be considered. This Court therein was dealing with unequal bargaining power of the workmen and the employer and came to the conclusion that any term of the agreement which is patently arbitrary and/or other wise arrived at because of the unequal bargaining power would not only be ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India but also hit by section 23 of the Indian Contract Act. In ONGC this Court, apart from the three grounds stated in Renusagar, added another ground thereto for exercise of the court's jurisdiction in setting aside the award if it is patently arbitrary. \n59. Such patent illegality, however, must go to the root of the matter. The public policy violation, indisputably, should be so unfair and unreasonable as to shock the conscience of the court. Where the arbitrator, however, has gone contrary to or beyond the expressed Arb. A. 3 of 2022 Page - 14 of 15 law of the contract or granted relief in the matter not in dispute would come within the purview of Section 34 of the Act. However, we would consider the applicability of the aforementioned principles while noticing the merits of the matter. \n60. What would constitute public policy is a matter dependant upon the nature of transaction and nature of statute. For the said purpose, the pleadings of the parties and the materials brought on record would be relevant to enable the court to judge what is in public good or public interest, and what would otherwise be injurious to the public good at the relevant point, as contradistinguished from the policy of a particular Government. (See State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nahata.\")\" \n[29] The Apex Court in the case of Associate Builders vs. Delhi Development Authority reported in (2015) 3 SCC 49 reiterated that Court can interfere only when the findings recorded by the arbitrator are arbitrary, capricious, perverse and suffer from patent illegality. Observation of the Hon'ble Apex Court is as under:\n\"33. It must clearly be understood that when a court is applying the \"public policy\" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court of appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. A possible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. Thus an award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be invalid on this score. Once it is found that the arbitrators approach is not arbitrary or capricious, then he is the last word on facts. In P.R. Shah, Shares & Stock Brokers (P) Ltd. v. B.H.H. Securities (P) Ltd., this Court held: (SCC pp. 601-02, para 21) \"21. A court does not sit in appeal over the award of an Arbitral Tribunal by reassessing or reappreciating the evidence. An award can be challenged only under the grounds mentioned in Section 34(2) of the Act. The Arbitral Tribunal has examined the facts and held that both the second respondent and the appellant are liable. The case as put forward by the first respondent has been accepted. Even the minority view was that the second respondent was liable as claimed by the first respondent, but the appellant was not liable only on the ground that the arbitrators appointed by the Stock Exchange under Bye-law 248, in a claim against a non- member, had no jurisdiction to decide a claim against another member. The finding of the majority is that the appellant did the transaction in the name of the second respondent and is therefore, liable along with the second respondent. Therefore, in the absence of any Arb. A. 3 of 2022 Page - 15 of 15 ground under Section 34(2) of the Act, it is not possible to re-examine the facts to find out whether a different decision can be arrived at.\" \n[30] Having applied the tests laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court to the case in hand, we are of the considered view that the arbitral award impugned before us, does not call for any interference. The District Commercial Court has rightly rejected appellant's petition for setting aside the arbitral award. Resultantly, the appeal stands dismissed. \nIn terms of the above, the case is disposed of. \nPending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of. (S.G.
