This   group   of   petitions   filed   under   the  Arbitration  Act  raise  common   questions  of  facts  and   law   and   hence,   were   heard   together   and   are  dealt   with   by   this   common   order.   The   facts   as  stated in petition under Arbitration Act No.2/17  are made the basis of this order. \n2. The   parties   to   these   petitions   entered   into  different contracts for supply of Indian Rapeseed  Meal   and   more   particularly   the   petitioners   and  respondent no.1 in each of the application.   At  HC-NIC Page 1 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the   outset,   it   deserves   to   be   noted   that   the  other   respondents   in   each   of   the   petitions   are  either partners of the firm or are directors of  the Company. \n3. As   the   dispute   arose   between   the   parties,   the  dispute was referred to Arbitration before GAFTA  Tribunal   in   London.   The   disputes   so   referred  culminated   into   9   original   GAFTA   awards   dated  28.04.2014.   The   respondents   preferred   appeals  challenging the original awards before the Board  of Appeal, GAFTA, London and the appellate board  of GAFTA after hearing the parties was pleased to  uphold   all   the   original   awards   with   some   minor  modification to the amount of damages awarded to  the petitioner on the basis of the calculation of  damages   from   the   exact   date   of   default.     The  record   further   indicates   that   the   respondents  approached   GAFTA   Appeal   Board   seeking  clarification   of   the   awards   which   came   to   be  rejected   by   GAFTA   Appellate   Board   vide  order/communication   dated   26.05.2015.   The  respondents  carried   the  same   further  by  filling  appeals as provided under Sections 68 and 69 of  the English Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996  before the High Court of Justice Queen's Division  Commercial   Court   and   the   Hon'ble   Queen's   Bench  Division of London High Court by an order dated  14.07.2015 refused leave to appeal the awards to  the   respondents.     The   respondents   thereafter  approached the Court of appeal in London against  HC-NIC Page 2 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the   order   passed   by   the   Hon'ble   Queen's   Bench  division   of   London   High   Court   and   by   a   final  order   dated   04.02.2016,   the   Court   of   appeal   in  London refused leave to appeal against the order  dated 14.07.2015 and also disallowed the plea of  the   respondents   to   prefer   an   appeal   before   the  Supreme   Court   of   United   Kingdom.     According   to  the   petitioners,   the   proceedings   attained  finality as per the provisions of UK Arbitration  Act   and   hence,   the   petitioner   filed   individual  applications   for   execution   of   the   awards   as  foreign   awards   before   the   District   Court   at  Gandhidham which came to be registered as Special  Execution   Petitions   No.167/15   to   175/15.     The  record indicates that the learned District Court  at Gandhidham issued notice to the respondents. \n4. At   this   stage,   it   would   be   appropriate   to   note  that   the   petitioner   herein   preferred   petition  under   Section   15(5)   of   the   Commercial   Court,  Commercial   Division   and   Commercial   Appellate  Division of the High Courts Act, 2015 for seeking  clarification   and   appropriate   direction   to  transfer   Special   Execution   Petition   No.167/2015  and allied execution petitions pending before the  District   Court   at   GandhidhamKachchh   either   to  the   High   Court   or   to   appropriate   commercial  courts,   commercial   divisions.   The   Hon'ble  Division Bench of this Court in the case reported  in 2017(1) GLH 383 was pleased to observe thus  HC-NIC Page 3 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER \"11.00.

The record of the petitions indicate that as the  goods were not supplied as per the terms of the  contract, the arbitration clause was invoked and  as   per   the   arbitration   clause,   the   dispute   so  arising was referred to the Arbitration in London  in   accordance   with   GAFTA   125   Rules.     The   same  came  to  be  registered  as  Arbitration  No.14711,  which culminated into award dated 28.04.2014. \n12. Mr.   Thakore,   learned   counsel   submitted   that   as  per   the   award   dated   28.04.2014,   the   learned  arbitrators   have   directed   the   sellers,   i.e.,  respondent no.1 to pay forthwith to the buyers a  sum   of   USD   846,750.00   and   also   passed   further  awards   to   the   effect   that   all   the   fees   and  expenses   of   the   arbitration   be   paid   by   the  sellers and if any sum already paid by the buyers  in this respect to be reimbursed by the sellers  on the same conditions as a principal awards as  above.\n13. Mr.   Thakore   further   submitted   that   the   said  awards   dated   28.04.2014   were   challenged   before  the  appellate   forum  being   Appeal  Award  No.4383,  which   came   to   be   rejected   vide   order   dated  HC-NIC Page 8 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER 16.04.2015,   against   which   the   review   was  preferred   by   the   respondents   which   was   also  rejected on 26.05.2015.\n14. Mr.   Thakore   further   submitted   that   the   orders  passed   by   the   appellate   forum   was   further  challenged   before   the   High   Court   of   Justice,  Queen's   Bench   Division   Commercial   Court   of  England,   which   culminated   into   the   order   dated  14.07.2015,  which  was  also  confirmed  in  further  appeal vide order dated 04.02.2016.\n15. Mr.   Thakore   submitted   that   in   light   of   the  aforesaid facts and considering the provisions of  the   Act,   burden   is   upon   the   respondents   to  satisfy this Court and to show that the awards in  question   are   not   enforceable   as   provided   under  Section 48(1) and/or 48(2) of the Act and relied  upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case  of  Shri   Lal   Mahal   Ltd.   vs.   Progetto   Grano   SPA  reported in (2014) 2 SCC 433.\n16. Mr. Thakore submitted that the present petitions  are execution petitions and this Court will have  to   determine   in   two   parts.   Referring   to   the  provisions   of   the   Act   and   more   particularly  Sections 46, 47, 48, it was contended that this  Court will have to determine whether the awards  which   are   foreign   awards   are   enforceable   and  declare it as decree of this Court. \n17. Mr. Thakore submitted that the second stage can  HC-NIC Page 9 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER be kept pending and only after this Court comes  to   the   conclusion   that   the   awards   become  enforceable, then it would become decree of this  Court and then execute it as provided under Order  21   of   the   Civil   Procedure   Code   and   subsequent  stage   can   be   decided   later   and   therefore,   the  present hearing may be limited to the application  of   Section   48   of   the   Act.     At   this   stage,   Mr.  Thakore also relied upon the judgment of the Apex  Court in the case of M/S. Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd  vs   Jindal   Exports   Ltd.   reported   in   2001(6)   SCC  356.\n18. Mr.  Soparkar,   learned  counsel  appearing  for   the  respective   respondents   raised   the   following  contentions  19. That this Court may decide the issue of Section  47 of the Act first and then decide whether the  awards are enforceable or not. \n20. It was contended that as provided under Section  46   of   the   Act,   the   Arbitration   has   to   be   by   a  party or in relation to contract executed between  whom it is made.  It is not in dispute that only  the   firms   were   party   to   the   contracts.   It   was  contended that Section 47 read with Section 49 of  the   Act   will   have   bearing   on   the   proceedings  inasmuch   as,   individuals   are   not   party   to   the  proceedings   and   therefore   foreign   awards   would  not be binding on them.\nHC -NIC                             Page 10 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017                  O /IAAP/2/2017                                            ORDER 21. It was contended that the provisions of section  49 of the Act provides that the award is to be  made   decree   by   this   Court   which   is   the   first  stage and therefore, the individuals are wrongly  joined and have no locus and even the petitions  do   not   contain   any   averment   to   justify   the  presence of individuals other than the companies.\n22. Referring to the provisions of section 48(2) of  the Act, it was contended by the learned counsel  appearing   for   the   respondent   that   the   damages  would   mean   the   damages   immediate   and   not   for  profiteering. \n23. Referring to the provisions of section 51(3) of  the   U.K.   Sale   of   Goods   Act   as   well   as   section  51(2)   of   the   said   Act,   Mr.   Soparkar   learned  counsel   appearing   for   the   respondent   contended  that it has to be exact damages.   Referring to  the awards in origin as well as the awards passed  by   the   appellate   board   of   GAFTA,   Mr.   Soparkar,  contended   that   the   amount   awarded   is   more   than  its   true   loss   and   it   is   an   unusual   case   which  would shock the conscience of this Court. It was  further   contended   that   even   according   to   the  petitioner,   the   actual   loss   is   much   less   than  what   is   awarded.     It   was   contended   that  approximately,   the   amount   of   13   million   USD   is  awarded for 9 contracts only. \n24. It was also further contended that the High Court  of   England   has   not   confirmed   the   orders   of   the  HC-NIC Page 11 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER Arbitration  awards  passed  by  the  arbitrators  as  well as the appellate arbitration board, but has  refused   to   entertain   the   objections   of   the  respondents by holding that the view taken by the  Arbitration   Tribunal/Board   is   not   obviously  wrong.   By   referring   to   Section   69   of   the   U.K.  Sale of Goods Act and even referring to the order  passed by Court of appeal, it was contended that  the Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal  without hearing and the decision has become final  as per the English law. \n25. Relying   upon   the   judgment   of   the   Apex   Court   in  the   case   of  Shri   Lal   Mahal   Ltd(supra),   Mr.  Soparkar,   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the  respondent contended that the awards in question  have become final only as per English Law and the  provisions   of   section   48   of   the   Act   and   more  particularly   section   48(2)(b)   of   the   Act   would  apply and the respondents have a right to dispute  the   same   as   it   is   against   the   public   policy.  Relying   upon   the   judgment   of   the   Apex   Court   in  the case of Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. vs. General  Electric Co. reported in AIR 1994 SC 860 as well  as   the   judgment   in   the   case   of  Associate  Builders   vs.   Delhi   Development   Authority  reported in (2015) 3 SCC 49 and judgment of the  Calcutta High Court in the case of Gopalchandra  Mukherjee  v.  Food  Corporation  of  India  reported  in   (2017)   SCC   Online   Calcutta   67,   it   was  contended   that   the   awards   would   be   contrary   to  HC-NIC Page 12 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the   public   policy   in   India   and   the   same   are  against fundamental principles of Indian law and  violative   of   morality   and   justice   and   the   same  would shock the conscience of this Court.\n26. It   was   contended   that   mere   violation   of   Indian  law may not satisfy the test that it is against  public policy, but when it is against fundamental  rules   of   legal   system   of   the   country,   such  foreign awards are not enforceable.\n27. Further relying upon the judgment in the case of  Renu   Sagar   (supra)   more   particularly   paragraphs  No.68   to   76,   the   judgment   of   the   Apex   Court  reported in 1994 (suppl.) SCC 465 as well as the  judgment   rendered   in   the   case   of  Laxman   Prasad  v. Prodigy Ele. Ltd. & Anr. reported in (2005) 5  SCC  465   (at   page   477),  it   was   contended   that  test is provided to the effect that whether the  awards in question are violative of Indian law or  whether   it   is   against   the   basic   principles   of  morality   and   justice   and   whether   there   is  flagrant/gross breach of the same.\n28. Explaining   and   elucidating   the   impugned   orders  further, Mr.Soparkar contended that the awards of  the  Arbitration  Tribunal  whereby  as  against   the  direct loss of around 3 million USD, a total loss  including consequential loss of 5 million USD for  14 contracts is being compensated by damages in  sum   exceeding   13   million   USD   for   9   contracts,  which   is   fundamentally   in   violation   of   Indian  HC-NIC Page 13 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER jurisprudence   wherein   compensation   is   always   to  make good damages suffered and not profiteering.\n29. Referring   to   Section   57   of   the   Indian   Sale   of  Goods Act and Section 73 of the Indian Contract  Act,   it   was   contended   by   Mr.   Soparkar   that   the  provision is to pay direct loss and not indirect  loss   and   not   for   profiteering   and   the   parties  cannot be made richer. Mr. Soparkar also further  contended that the parties had entered into back  to back contracts and have adopted the cause and  minimise   the   loss   and   the   petitioners   have  adopted such a cause whereby they have minimised  the loss and therefore the petitioners cannot ask  for more.\n30. Referring   to   Section   73   of   the   Indian   Contract  Act as well as the judgment of the Apex Court in  the case of Messrs. Torjan & Company Vs. RM.N.N.  Nagappa Chettiar reported in AIR 1953 SC 235, it  was   contended   by   Mr.   Soparkar,   learned   counsel  appearing for the respondents that a party cannot  be   awarded   astronomical   profits   that   he   would  have   made.   Mr.   Soparkar   contended   that   if   the  petitioner would have purchased it from the open  market,   to   satisfy   the   back   to   back   contracts  entered into by the petitioner with its proposed  buyer, only in such circumstances, it can claim  for   profit   which   otherwise   is   not   entitled   to.  It was submitted that the petitioner cannot claim  greater amount than penalty which is permissible.\nHC-NIC                             Page 14 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017                   O /IAAP/2/2017                                            ORDER 31. Relying   upon   the   judgments   of   the   Apex   Court  rendered in the cases of  DCM   Decometal   Gmbh   v.  Rohit  Ferro  Tech  Ltd.,  reported in  AIR  1962  SC  366  and  Union of India & Ors. v. Sugauli Sugar  Works Pvt. Ltd.  reported in 1976 (3) SCC 32, it  was   contended   by   Mr.   Soparkar,   learned   counsel  for   the   respondent   that   only   the   loss   due   to  breach   of   contract   and   steps   taken   to   mitigate  such loss can be awarded as damages and nothing  beyond loss. It was contended that it being back  to   back   contract   which   was   known   to   the  petitioner   and   not   having   gone   in   the   market  cannot be permitted to profiteer as if they have  suffered   damage   of   the   profit   as   well   and   this  fundamental basis can be considered only if the  contract   is   performed.     It   was   therefore  contended   that   these   facts   would   shock   the  conscience of the Court and it is against equity  and fairness.\n32. Relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay  High   Court   reported   in  2015   Bombay   CR   204,   it  was   contended   that   in   the   fact   situation,   it  would   be   a   case   of   unjust   enrichment   which   is  against fundamental policy of Indian law and the  petitioner cannot be permitted to make profit out  of the breach of contract.\n33. Relying   upon   the   judgment   of   the   Calcutta   High  Court in the case of Usha Beltron Ltd. v. Nand  Kishore Parasramka & Anr., reported in AIR 2001  HC-NIC Page 15 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER Calcutta   137,   it   was   contended   that   in   these  facts   and   circumstances   this   Court   can   go   into  this   aspect   as   the   same   would   shock   the  conscience of the Court.\n34. Mr.   Soparkar   further   contended   that   the  fundamental  policy  of  the   Indian  Law  prescribes  that no one can profiteer from breach of contract  and breach of contract cannot result into profit  and therefore, there is violation of fundamental  policy of Indian law.\n35. It   was   reiterated   that   even   as   per   the   justice  and morality would it be just if a person would  profit, for example Rs.65 crores, which profit he  would   not   have   made   if   the   contract   would   have  been   executed.   It   was   contended   that   it   is   a  penalty   and   therefore,   this   Court   may   not  entertain   these   petitions   on   the   aforesaid  grounds.     It   was   contended   that   the   awards   are  against the fundamental policy of Indian law and  therefore it is not a fit case wherein this Court  would come to the conclusion that it is a deemed  decree of this Court as provided under section 49  of   the   Act   and   none   of   the   conditions   are  satisfied and the impugned awards are against the  fundamental   policy   of   Indian   law,   morality,  justice   and   profiteering   may   not   be   permitted  under section 49 of the Act and therefore, this  Court may be pleased to reject these petitions.\n36 . Mr.   Mehul   S.   Shah,   learned   Senior   Counsel  HC-NIC Page 16 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER appearing   for   the   respective   respondents   has  taken   this   Court   through   the   judgments   of   the  Apex   Court   in   Renu   Sagar   (supra)   and   has  contended as under  37. That Sections 34 and 48 of the Act were similar  and the judgments of the Apex Court in  Shri Lal  Mahal   Ltd.   (supra)  clarified   the   situation   and  provided   for   test   and   guide   as   well   as   the  parameters   to   be   followed   as   to   what   would   be  against public policy of Indian law, morality and  justice.\n38. It   was   further   contended   that   looking   at   the  awards   as   it   is,   it   cannot   be   said   that   the  respondents   are   liable   under   damages   and   such  damages   could   ever   be   awarded.   It   was   further  contended  that  keeping  in  mind  both  rationality  and   principles   of   damages ,   the   impugned   awards  cannot be executed as the same are not accepted  by the Indian law and in the instant case, the  test   provided   by   the   aforesaid   judgments   are  apparently  not  fulfilled  and   allowing  the  award  as it is, it would be allowing unjust enrichment  of the award once it is deemed to be decree of  this Court and that valid and germane defence is  available   to   the   respondents   before   the   awards  are considered to be decree.\n39. Referring to the emails, which in fact have been  referred   to   by   Mr.   Soparkar,   it   was   contended  that   the   actual   loss   is   lesser   than   what   is  HC-NIC Page 17 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER awarded.     It   was   contended   that   the   award   of  damages   in   such   contract   matter   is   to   mitigate  the   loss   and   on   facts,   it   has   been   found   that  only deposits have been forfeited. \n40. Relying upon the judgments of the Apex Court in  the cases of  Centrotrade   Minerals   &   Metal   Inc.  v.   Hindustan   Copper   Ltd.,  reported in  (2017)   2  SCC 228, Maula Bux v. Union of India reported in  (1969)   2   SCC   554   and   Fateh   Chand   v.   Balkishan  Dass  reported   in  AIR   1963   SC   1405,   Mr.   Shah  contended   that   no   evidence   is   led   for   actual  loss .     It   was   further   contended   by   Mr.   Shah,  learned counsel appearing for the respondent that  it is not permissible for any judicial authority  to award damages by just applying some measures  suggested by the claimants which may be applied  for   in   given   facts   of   the   case   that   there   is  definite  pleading,  evidence  and   finding.  It  was  contended that if that is not  so, the authority  has   to   find   out   actual   damages   from   the   facts  resulting from the breach of the contract. It was  therefore contended that this is not a fit case  for considering the impugned award as decree of  this Court. \n41. Mr. Rashesh S. Sanjanwala learned senior counsel  assisted   by   Mr.   Sahil   M.   Shah,   learned   counsel  has adopted the arguments adopted by Mr. Soparkar  and   Mr.   Mehul   Shah,   learned   senior   counsels  appearing for the respective respondents.\nHC-NIC                            Page 18 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017                  O/IAAP/2/2017                                           ORDER 42. The learned counsels appearing for the respective  respondents  have   also  further  contended  that  it  is   found   from   the   record   that   there   were   13  contracts   for   which   notice   for   arbitration   has  been   given.     It   was   further   pointed   out   that  pursuant   to   the   said   notice,   reference   was   so  made   and   the   Tribunal   was   constituted   and   the  Tribunal   has   proceeded   only   in   reference   to   9  cases   and   other   cases   are   remaining.     It   was  further   contended   that   the   claims   sought   to   be  raised   by   similar   companies   are   common,   but   in  five   cases,   it   has   come   on   record.     It   was  further   contended   that   the   14   cases   could   have  been   simultaneously   decided.   It   was   contended  that there would have been all chances of award,  which  are  likely  to  have  contradictory  findings  on merits as well as in law though arising from  similar contract, stipulation and same date.  It  was apprehended that there would be likelihood of  contradiction   on   merits   and   in   law.     It   was  further   pointed   out   that   the   petitioner   has  sought   for   extension   of   time   for   production   of  documents   and   therefore   pursuant   to   the  extension, if now these cases are taken up, the  resultant effect in law would be that again there  would   be   contradictory   findings   and   therefore,  the present petitions are premature. \n43. Mr.  Mihir  J.  Thakore,  learned  counsel   appearing  for   the   petitioner   in   his   further   reply   has  HC-NIC Page 19 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER contended as under  44. That prima facie, the awards are just and proper. \n45. That the issues which are raised cannot be looked  into. \n46. Referring   to   the   proposal   email   dated  12.06.2012,   16.07.2012   as   well   as   email   dated  21.07.2012,   it   was   contended   that   there   was   no  response.\n47. Referring to the same from the awards in origin,  it was contended that as noted by the Tribunal,  the   proposals   were   given   to   resolve   the   matter  and it was contended that the Tribunal has read  the   same   and   that   all   such   offers   were   without  prejudice   offers   to   resolve   the   issue   and   the  same cannot be seen at the stage of enforcement  of the award . \n48. Mr.   Thakore,   referring   to   the   provisions   of  section 51(2) and 51(3) of the U.K. Sale of Goods  Act, contended that the same has been considered  by the Tribunal as well as in the appeal award  and even the aspect of actual loss in light of  the   provision   of   section   51(3)   has   been  considered by the Arbitral appellate Tribunal and  the same is overruled. Referring to para 10.15 of  the award,  Mr. Thakore contended that the aspect  of   back   to   back   contract   is   concluded   by   the  Tribunal   and   the   Tribunal   has   come   to   the  HC-NIC Page 20 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER definite conclusion that the contract in question  were  not \"inextricably linked\"and  that the  case  is governed by section 51(3)of the U.K. Sale of  Goods   Act.   It   is   further   contended   by   Mr.  Thakore, learned counsel for the petitioner that  these findings given by the Arbitration Tribunal  as   well   as   the   appellate   Tribunal   are   given   on  interpretation of the facts under English law. \n49. It   was   contended   that   as   per   the   provisions   of  the   Act   and   even   as   provided   under   sections   28  and   48   of   the   Act,   this   Court   cannot   entail  review on merits and same is not contemplated by  the Act and this Court also cannot challenge the  validity.     Only   enforcement   can   be   challenged.  Mr. Thakore also relied upon the judgment of the  Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  ONGC   v.   Saw   Pipes  reported in 2003(5) SCC 705.\n50. Mr. Thakore further contended that the issue of  damages   has   been   considered   by   the   Tribunal   in  detail   as   per   the   clauses.   It   was   also   further  contended   that   section   69   of   the   English  Arbitration Act, 1996 provides for an appeal on  the   point   of   law   and   subsection   (2)   thereof  provides for leave of the Court which prescribes  that appeal would be with the leave of the Court  when it found that the award is obviously wrong.  It   was   contended   that   as   held   by   the   Hon'ble  Queen's Division Bench of London High Court, the  first   question   to   be   considered   as   per   the  HC-NIC Page 21 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER English  law  was  whether  requirement  of  sections  69(3)(a)   &   (b)   are   made   out   or   not   and   the  Hon'ble Bench has come to the conclusion that the  decision   of   the   Board   was   not   obviously   wrong.  It   was   therefore   contended   that   on   such  satisfaction   only   High   Court   can   deal   with   the  matter.\n51. Mr.   Thakore   further   contended   that   the   parties  have agreed for applicability of English law and  the seat of arbitration would be London and once  having  accepted  English  law,   challenge  would  be  limited as provided under Sections 68 and 69 of  the   English   Arbitration   Act,   1996.   It   was  contended   that   the   Tribunal   has   come   to   the  conclusion the there are no special circumstances  as to why section 51(3) of the UK Sale of Goods  Act should not be applied and the petitioner has  lost market value of the goods. Referring to the  judgment of the review before the High Court as  well as to the Court of appeal, it was contended  by   Mr.   Thakore   that   the   proceedings   ended   in  England. \n52. Mr.   Thakore   contended   that   the   judgment   of   the  Apex   Court   in   Saw   Pipe   (supra)   clarifies   the  distinct   jurisdiction   between   sections   34   and  section 48 of the Act and the same is in context  with the provisions of section 34 of the Act and  the Hon'ble Court was quite conscious of the fact  that   the   judgment   of   three   judges   cannot   be  overruled. \nHC-NIC                            Page 22 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017                   O / IAAP/2/2017                                            ORDER 53. Referring   to   the   judgment   in   the   case   of   Renu  Sagar   (supra),   Mr.   Thakore   contended   that   the  contention   that   the   award   is   contrary   to   the  English law is not available.   Mr. Thakore also  further  contended  that  whether  section  51(2)  of  the   English   law   or   51(3)   of   the   English   law  should be applied cannot be looked into by this  Court nor it would enable any party to argue the  same. Referring further to the observations made  in   the   case   of   Renu   Sagar   (supra),   it   was  contended that the argument that it is a case of  unjust enrichment is also not permissible.   Mr.  Thakore   also   contended   that   the   parties   have  agreed   to   English   law   and   it   is   analysed  accordingly . \n54. Mr.   Thakore   contended   that   section   21   of   the  Arbitration   Act   is   in   part   I   of   the   Act   and  applies   only   to   domestic   arbitration   and  international   arbitration   in   India   and   no  exceptions are carved out in respect of foreign  awards.   Mr.   Thakore   further   submitted   that  section 48 is to be interpreted narrowly and by  virtue of amendment in section 48 of the Act, now  issues   are   kept   beyond   doubt.   It   was   further  contended   that   this   Court   cannot   go   into   the  correctness   of   the   award   and   the   case   of   the  respondent   that   it   was   back   to   back  contract/order, and that it could have been sold  in open market cannot be examined by this Court.\nHC - NIC                             Page 23 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017                   O /IAAP/2/2017                                            ORDER 55. Mr.   Thakore   further   contended   that   the   other  contentions   raised   as   regards   profiteering   that  the Tribunal has given more than six times than  what is suffered by the petitioner and that the  award is against the fundamental policy of Indian  law,   morality   and   justice,   is   to   be   given   a  narrow   meaning   once   the   Tribunal   has   correctly  examined as per the English law and found that no  further   enquiry   would   be   necessary.     It   was  therefore   submitted   that   this   Court   may   be  pleased to hold that the awards in question are  enforceable and are not against the provisions of  section   48(2)   of   the   Act   and   declare   it   to   be  decree of this Court.\n56. Mr. Mihir Thakore, learned counsel appearing for  the   petitioner   has   also   relied   upon   the  provisions   of   section   51(3)   of   the   UK   Sale   of  Goods Act and the relevant observations made by  the  GAFTA  Appellate  Board   and  more   particularly  paragraphs 10.3 to 10.5, 10.12 to 10.17 and has  contended that the findings given in the awards  cannot be reviewed on the ground of fundamental  policy of Indian law particularly in view of the  explanation 2 of section 48(2) of the Act and has  further   referred   to   and   relied   upon   the   order  passed by the GAFTA appellate board on the plea  of   clarification   by   the   respondents   dated  26.05.2015   as   well   as   the   order   passed   by   the  Queen's Bench, division of London on 14.07.2015.\n57. It was further contended that even the reliance  HC-NIC Page 24 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER placed upon the judgment of Bunge vs. Nidera of  the Queen's Bench was found by the Bench that the  said   case   would   not   apply   to   the   arbitration  proceedings  before  GAFTA.   Referring  to  section  48(1)(a),   48(1)(b)(c)(d)(e)   as   well   as   section  48(2)(a),   section   48(2)(b)   of   the   Act,   it   was  submitted that the scope of inquiry by this Court  would not permit or allow a review on merits of  the   dispute   and   the   scope   of   inquiry   on   the  ground of public policy under section 48 of the  Act in relation to foreign award is much narrower  than public policy as contained under section 34  of the Act, which deals with domestic awards and  not foreign awards. \n58. It   was   also   submitted   that   the   judgment   in   the  case of Saw Pipes (supra) would not apply to the  present   case   as   the   Hon'ble   Apex   Court   has  considered the domestic award and the provisions  of section 34 of the Act for enforcement of such  domestic award. \n59. Relying upon the amendment, whereby explanations  1 and 2 have been inserted w.e.f. 23.10.2015, it  was contended that in view of such amendment, the  scope of inquiry by this Court on the ground of  public policy has further become limited and the  awards which are found to be in conflict with the  public   policy   of   India   where   the   making   of   the  awards was induced by fraud or corruption or is  violative of sections 75 or 81 of the Act, or the  HC-NIC Page 25 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER award   is   in   contravention   of   the   fundamental  policy of Indian law, or is in contravention with  the   most   basic   notions   of   morality   and   justice  can be reviewed by this Court.   It was further  submitted   that   on   the   contrary,   it   has   been  provided  that   whether  there  is  contravention  in  the   public   policy   in   Indian   shall   not   entail   a  review on the merits of the dispute.   Thus, the  scope and purview of section 48 is very limited.\n60. It was further submitted that the awards are in  consonance with the public policy of the India as  provided under section 48(2)(b) of the Act.\n61. It was contended that the parties had agreed that  the English law will apply.   The GAFTA Tribunal  has   correctly   applied   section   51(3)   of   the   UK  Sale of Goods Act and the awards cannot be said  to   be   contrary   to   the   fundamental   policy   of  India.\n62. It   was   further   submitted   that   the   contention  raised by the respondent before this Court that  only direct loss suffered by the petitioner as a  result   of   the   breach   of   contract   as   prescribed  under section 51(2) of the UK Sale of Goods Act  executed   by   it   with   its   Korean   subbuyer   and  other   direct   losses   cannot   be   included   and   the  difference   in   the   value   cannot   be   awarded   as  provided under section 51(3) of the Act cannot be  reagitated   before   this   Court   as   the   same   is   a  question   of   fact   and   the   same   would   amount   to  HC-NIC Page 26 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER review of the merits of the dispute which is not  permissible under section 48(2) of the Act.   It  was  submitted   that  GAFTA  Tribunal  has   correctly  applied as provided under section 51(3) of the UK  Sales of Goods Act, which has become final right  upto   the   Queen's   Bench   as   referred   to  hereinabove, which cannot be reviewed as the same  would amount to review on merits of the dispute.\n63. It was also contended that the contention raised  by   the   respondents   that   the   enforcement   of   the  present   awards   would   lead   to   a   situation   of  unjust enrichment making the awards unenforceable  by this Court as the same would be contrary to  the fundamental policy of Indian law as it is in  violation   of   sections   73   and   74   of   the   Indian  Contract   Act   would   not   amount   to   violation   of  fundamental policy of India.\n64. The learned counsel for the petitioner has relied  upon the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the  case of  Cruz City Mauritius Holdings v. Unitech  Ltd. reported in (2017) SCC Online Del. 7810 and  other decisions of various High Court to buttress  his argument that mere violation of provision of  Indian   law   would   not   amount   to   violation   of  fundamental   policy   of   India.     It   has   been  contended   that   the   respondents   have   failed   to  demonstrate  that   the  awards  amount  to  violation  fundamental   policy   of   India   and   merely   because  the Tribunal has held that section 51(3) of the  HC-NIC Page 27 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER UK   Sale   of   Goods   Act   applies,   which   is   a  different   measure   of   determination   of   loss,   it  cannot   be   said   that   the   awards   are   contrary   to  the fundamental policy of Indian law and the most  basic principles of justice and morality.\n65. Relying  upon  the  provisions  of  section  28(1)(b)  clause (1) of the Act, it was submitted that the  Act itself mandates that an arbitral tribunal of  an international commercial arbitration in India  is   required   to   apply   the   law   governing   the  disputes   as   that   is   chosen   by   the   parties   and  therefore, it was contended that the enforcement  of the award would not be against the most basic  principles of justice and morality.   The learned  counsel   for   the   petitioner   has   further   relied  upon   the   judgments   of   the   Bombay   High   Court   as  well as Delhi High Court in the case of  Etizen  Bulk   &   Ashapura   Minechem   Ltd   (2016(2)   ArbLR  113(Bom),   M/s.   Lois   Dreyfus   Commodities   v.  Sakuma   Exports   Ltd   (2015   6   Bom   CR   258),  Sideralba  S.P.  A v. Shree  Precoated  Steels   Ltd  (Arbitration Petition No.84 of 2013, High Court  of Bombay) and Xstrata Coal Marketing v. Dalmia  Bharat   (Cement)   Ltd   (236   (2017)   DLT   524)  to  buttress his argument that the issue of damages  or unjust enrichment amounts to a review of the  merits of the disputes and is beyond the scope of  purview permitted under section 48 of the Act.\n66. On   the   aforesaid   grounds,   it   was   therefore  HC-NIC Page 28 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER submitted   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the  petitioner   that   9   Arbitration   Awards   are  appropriate,   just   and   proper   and   enforceable  under the Indian law.\n67. Mr. Soparkar, learned counsel for the respondents  has  reiterated  the  arguments   which  were  already  canvassed.   Mr.  Soparkar  further  contended  that  the   present   awards   are   not   merely   violative   of  Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act but it is  also such that it would shock the conscience of  the Court and has given further example, which is  enumerated as below  If A agrees to sell the goods to B at Rs.95   and B would be selling it further to C, to  make   a   profit   of   Rs.3   on   it,   and   deposits   Rs.2 with C as security ; then in the event   of   default   by   A,   B   ought   to   be   awarded   a   maximum   compensation   of   Rs.5   (i.e.   Rs.   3  towards   loss   of   profit   and   Rs.2   towards  forfeiture of deposit by C).  However, if B   is   awarded   a   compensation   of   Rs.105,   by  calculating   the   difference   between   the   market   price   (say   Rs.   200   on   the   date   of  default)   and   the   contract   price   (i.e.   Rs.95),   the   B   would   be   making   a   colossal  profit out of the breach of contract by A,   which   cannot   be   permitted.     Even   if   the  contract   would   have   been   performed   by   A,  then B would have earned profit of Rs.3 and   not Rs.105.  Grant of Rs.105 to B, would be  something   which   would   shock   the   conscience   of this Hon'ble Court and would be against  the public policy of India.  \n68. To buttress the aforesaid argument, Mr. Soparkar  has relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in  the case of  Gherulal Parekh v. Mahadeodas Maiya  HC-NIC Page 29 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER reported  in AIR 1959 SC 781  and in the case of  Murlidhar   Agarwal   vs.   State   of   UP   (1974   2   SCC  472  and  Central   Inlald   Water   vs.   Brojo   Nath  Ganguly reported in 1986 (2) SCC 156.\n69. It   was   also   further   contended   that   the  respondents are not seeking review of the award  passed   by   the   arbitral   tribunal   and   by  explanations 1 and 2 of section 48(2), the only  limitation imposed by the legislature is not to  enter   into   merits   of   the   award.   However,   this  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  determine  whether   the  foreign award is violative of fundamental policy  of India or not and further it was contended that  there   is   no   limitation   imposed   upon   by   the  legislature for entering into the merits of the  award   by   this   Court   and   that   this   Court   has  jurisdiction to test the award on the ground of  morality and justice and this Court has to decide  as to what would be just and moral.\n70. It   was   submitted   that   the   argument   of   the  petitioner   that   if   the   respondent   would   have  supplied goods then they would have breached the  contracts with the Korean buyers and would have  sold the said goods at the market price, thereby  making   a   profit   out   of   it,   is   nothing   but   a  speculative argument and cannot be considered by  this   Court   and   it   was   therefore   submitted   that  execution of the awards deserves to be refused by  this   Court   in   view   of   the   objections   raised   by  HC-NIC Page 30 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the   respondents   in   the   objections   filed   under  sections   47   and   48   of   the   Act   as   well   as   the  submissions made.\n71. No   other   or   further   submissions   have   been   made  and   as   noted   hereinabove,   the   aforesaid  discussion   also   includes   written   submissions  which are submitted by both the sides.\n72. Before reverting to the submissions made by the  learned   counsel   appearing   for   the   parties,   it  would   be   appropriate   to   refer   to   the   relevant  provisions of the Act  The Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 Section 2(1)(f) 'international   commercial   arbitration'  means an arbitration relating to disputes  arising   out   of   legal   relationships,  whether contractual or not, considered as  commercial   under   the   law   in   force   in  Indian   and   where   at   least   one   of   the   parties is (i)an individual who is a national of, or  habitually resident in, any country other  than India; or (ii) a   body   corporate   which   is  incorporated   in   any   country   other   than  India;\n(iii) an   association   or   a   body   of  individuals   whose   central   management   and  control is exercised in any country other  than India; or HC-NIC Page 31 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER (iv) the   Government   of   a   foreign  country;\nSection 47.

In order to understand the controversy with which  this   Court   is   concerned   at   this   stage   is   that,  admittedly   there   were   contracts   between   the  petitioner and the respondent No.1 in particular,  which is described in detail hereinabove. It is  also   an   admitted   position   that   as   per   the   said  contract, the parties have agreed that \"seat of  arbitration would be London\".  Thus,  the  parties  as   per   the   arbitration   clause   provided   in   the  contract,   were   relegated   to   arbitration   as   per  the GAFTA Rules, which culminated into awards in  origin by three arbitrators dated 28.04.2014. It  is also an admitted position that the respondents  preferred appeals challenging the original awards  before the Board of Appeal, GAFTA, London and the  appellate   board   of   GAFTA   after   hearing   the  parties   was   pleased   to   uphold   all   the   original  awards   on   16.04.2015.     Thereafter,   the  respondents approached GAFTA Appeal Board seeking  HC-NIC Page 35 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER clarification   of   the   awards   which   came   to   be  rejected   by   GAFTA   Appellate   Board   vide  order/communication   dated   26.05.2015.   The  respondents   carried   the   same   further   by   filing  appeals as provided under sections 68 and 69 of  the English Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996  before the High Court of Justice Queen's Division  Commercial   Court   and   the   Hon'ble   Queen's   Bench  Division of London High Court by an order dated  14.07.2015 refused leave to appeal the awards to  the   respondents.     The   respondents   thereafter  approached the Court of appeal in London against  the   order   passed   by   the   Hon'ble   Queen's   Bench  division   of   London   High   Court   and   by   a   final  order   dated   04.02.2016,   the   Court   of   appeal   in  London refused the appeal against the order dated  14.07.2015   and   also   disallowed   the   plea   of   the  respondents   to   prefer   an   appeal   before   the  Supreme Court of United Kingdom.\n74. At the outset, it deserves to be noted that the  learned   counsel   for   the   respondents   did   raise  objection  that  the  applications   did  not  satisfy  the requirement of section 47. At this stage, it  deserves   to   be   noted   that   the   petitioner   had  approached   the   Hon'ble   Division   Bench   of   this  Court under section 15(1) of the Commercial Court  Act   and   the   Hon'ble   Division   of   the   this   Court  held   that   the   execution   petitions   which   were  pending  before  the  District  Court  at  Gandhidham  should   be   transferred   to   this   Court   under  HC-NIC Page 36 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER Commercial   Court,   Commercial   Division   and  Commercial Appellate Division of the High Courts  Act, 2015. \n75. It   further   deserves   to   be   noted   that   the  respondent herein contended that the applications  are not maintainable as the conditions of Section  47   of   the   Act   are   not   satisfied,   more  particularly   as   the   petitioner   did   not   produce  the certified copy of the award or notarized copy  of   the   award.   The   applicants   preferred   Civil  Application   (O.J)   NO.400/2017  and   allied  applications  and   have   produced   notarized   copies  of the awards and this Hon'ble Court has passed  the following order: \n\"Heard   learned   counsels   appearing   for  the parties. \nBy   this   application,   the   applicant   has  prayed   for   brining   on   record   the   true  copy of the award passed by the Arbitral   Tribunal. \nHaving   heard   learned   counsels   for   the  parties,   the   applications   are   allowed.  The   true   copy   of   award   in   each   application   is   taken   on   record.  Applications disposed of accordingly.\"\n76. It   may   be   noted   that   section   47   lays   down   the  procedural   requirement,   which   the   party   has  applied   for   enforcement   of   a   foreign   award   and  such   provision   is   based   upon   Article   IV   of  Newyork Convention. It also deserves to be noted  that   before   effective   stage   of   execution,   the  duly notarised copy has been brought on record. \nHC-NIC                              Page 37 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017                   O/IAAP/2/2017                                             ORDER 77. In light of the aforesaid therefore, it cannot be  said that the conditions of the said sections are  not satisfied. \n78. Upon   considering   the   submissions   made   by   the  learned counsel appearing for the parties and on  perusal of the record and proceedings as well as  the   judgments   which   are   relied   upon   by   the  learned   counsel   appearing   for   the   respective  parties,   it   is   an   admitted   position   that   the  parties   entered   into   a   contract   for   supply   of  Indian   Rapeseed   Meal   and   in   the   arbitration  clause , it is clearly provided that the seat of  arbitration   would   be   at   London   and   it   would   be  according to the GAFTA 125 Arbitration Rules and  the same would be governed by English law.\n79. Both   the   sides   have   taken   this   Court   to   the  relevant   observations   made   by   the   learned  Arbitrators   as   well   as   Arbitral   Board.     The  contention  raised  by  the  respondent  that   actual  loss is far less than what is granted is to be  seen and appreciated in light of the provisions  of   section   51   of   the   UK   Sale   Goods   Act   as   the  parties   had   agreed   that   the   English   law   will  apply. It is a matter of record that the findings  arrived   at   by   the   Arbitration   Tribunal   and   the  conclusion   arrived   at   by   the   appellate   board  entirely touches the merits of the case. As far  as merits are concerned, the same cannot be re appreciated by this Court while dealing with the  HC-NIC Page 38 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER execution petitions with the Indian law and the  findings given are on interpretation of facts of  the   case   and   as   per   the   English   law   and   this  Court   cannot   review   the   same   on   merits   and   its  validity   cannot   be   examined   by   this   Court   in  these proceedings and thus, as per the agreement  between the parties, for applicability of English  law,   the   same   is   analysed   by   the   Courts   in  England.\n80. Therefore, in opinion of this Court, the awards  in   question   which   are   foreign   awards   can   be  examined in light of the provisions of section 48  of the Act only. The aforesaid view is also found  from   the   explanation   2   of   section   48(2)   of   the  Act   that   while   examining   whether   there   is  contravention   with   the   fundamental   policy   of  Indian law, the same shall not entail review on  merits.\n81. The learned counsel for the respondents has also  contended that the High Court of Justice Queen's  Division  Commercial   Court  has  not  confirmed   the  findings   of   the   Tribunal   as   well   as   the  arbitration   appellate   board,   but   has   refused  leave as it was found that the Tribunal was not  obviously  wrong.   At  this  juncture,  reference  be  made to the provisions of section 69 of the UK  Arbitration   Act,   which   provides   for   leave   to  appeal.   From bare reading of the order of the  Queen's   Bench   Division   Court   of   appeal,   it   is  observed   that   the   awards   were   not   obviously  HC-NIC Page 39 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER wrong.     Therefore,   it   cannot   be   said   that   the  awards have not become final and thus, the appeal  preferred by the respondent was disallowed and as  per the English law the awards have become final.  The  facts  clearly  establish  that  the  respondent  Company   exhausted   all   remedies   that   were  available   for   challenging   the   awards/orderin origin, available under English law.\n82. The objections raised by the learned counsel for  the respondents are on the following grounds in  light of the provisions of section 48 of the Act 1.   That   the   impugned   awards   are   against   the  fundamental public policy of Indian law.  \n2. The awards are in contravention to the public  policy of Indian law. \n3.   That   the   awards   are   against   the   basic  principles   of   morality   and   justice   and   are   in  flagrant and gross breach of the same.  \n4.   That   it   is   such   that   it   would   shock   the  conscience of this Court.\n5. That the awards are exhaustive in nature and  no one can profit from breach of the contract and  is  against   the  provisions   of  section  73  of  the  Indian Contract Act and violative of fundamental  policy of Indian law.  \n6.  That   the  damages   which  are  awarded  are  more  HC-NIC Page 40 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER than the actual loss.\n7. That by the impugned awards, damages which are  awarded are irrational and against the principles  of damages as are accepted by Indian law.\n83. In   light   of   the   aforesaid   facts   which   arise   in  this group of petitions and as contended by the  learned counsel appearing for the respondents in  particular,  this   Court  is  therefore  called  upon  to examine on the aspect that the enforcement of  the   awards   in   question   would   be   contrary   to  public   policy   of   India.   It   is   also   further  contended   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the  respondents based upon the provisions of section  48(2) Explanation 1 clause (2) that the impugned  awards are in contravention with the fundamental  policy   of   India   and   clause   (3),   that   it   is   in  conflict   with   basic   notion   of   morality   and  justice.   Section   48   came   to   be   amended   and  Explanations   1   and   2   as   it   stands   today,   have  been   substituted   by   Act   3   of   2016   w.e.f.  23.10.2015   and   explanation   2   further   provides  that   the   test   as   to   whether   there   is  contravention   with   the   fundamental   policy   of  Indian law shall not entail a review on merits of  the dispute.  \n84. The first limb of argument which is put forward  by the learned counsel for the respondents is to  the effect that the impugned awards are contrary  to   the   public   policy   of   India.     The   basis   for  HC-NIC Page 41 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER that contention is that the awards prescribe for  more   than   actual   loss.   It   is   also   further  contended that the High Court of Justice Queen's  Division   Commercial   Court   has   only   refused   to  entertain   the   appeal   only   by   holding   that   the  view taken by the arbitral board is not obviously  wrong.     It   is   also   contended   that   the   impugned  awards   are   violative   of   Indian   law   inasmuch   as  that against direct loss of 3 million dollars and  total consequential loss of 5 million dollars for  14 contracts, the petitioner is being compensated  by   damages   in   sum   of   13   million   dollars   for   9  contracts   and   the   same   is   fundamentally   in  violation   of   Indian   jurisprudence   wherein  compensation   is   always   to   make   good   damages  suffered and not profiteering.\n85. In furtherance of the said contention it is also  contended by the respondents that if the impugned  awards are permitted to be implemented then the  same   would   amount   to   unjust   enrichment.   It   was  also further contended that though the petitioner  has   not   gone   to   market,   cannot   be   permitted   to  profiteer   and   as   it   was   back   to   back   contract,  only loss of profit can be awarded and therefore,  it   is   against   the   fundamental   policy   of   Indian  law   and   also   against   morality   and   justice.   The  respondents have also contended that it is also  in   breach   of   section   73   of   the   Indian   Contract  Act   and   therefore   it   is   in   violation   of  fundamental policy of Indian law and the awards  HC-NIC Page 42 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/ IAAP/2/2017 ORDER are   exhaustive   in   nature   which   would   shock   the  conscience   of   this   Court.     Relying   upon   the  judgments which are dealt with in this judgment  separately,   it   is   contended   that   it   is   not  permissible  for  any  judicial   authority  to  award  damages   by   just   applying   the   same   measure  suggested by the claimant which may be applied in  given   facts   of   case   and   in   fact   the   actual  damages   found   on   such   appreciation   of   evidence  only be granted. \n86. Over   and   above,   it   is   evident   from   the  contentions  which  are  raised   by  the  respondents  that they have on basis of the findings arrived  at   by   the   Arbitration   Tribunal   as   well   as  appellate   board,   it   is   contended   that   the  impugned   awards   are   against   the   fundamental  policy   of   Indian   law   and   therefore,   are   not  enforceable and cannot be deemed to be a decree  of   this   Court   and   the   petitions   are   therefore  required to be dismissed. \n87. The   aforesaid   contentions   are   denied   by   the  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   and   it   is  contended that the scope of inquiry under section  48 of the Act is limited and the same does not  allow a review of the merits of the dispute.  It  is also contended that mere violation of sections  73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act would not  amount   to   violation   of   fundamental   policy   of  Indian   law.     It   is   also   contended   that   the  HC-NIC Page 43 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER contentions   raised   by   the   respondents   that   the  awards   would   allow   unjust   enrichment   and   would  allow   review   of   the   merits   is   wholly   misplaced  and therefore, it is contended that 9 arbitration  awards   are   appropriate,   just   and   proper   and  enforceable under Indian law.   Thus, this Court  cannot review the awards on merits. \n88. Learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   has   relied  upon the judgment of the Apex Court rendered in  the   case   of  Fuerst   Day   Lawson   Ltd.   Vs.   Jindal  Exports  Ltd., reported  in   [(2001) 6 SCC 356],  wherein   the   Apex   Court   in   paragraphs   31   and   32  has observed thus:  \"31.   Prior   to   the   enforcement   of   the   Act,  the Law of Arbitration in this country was   substantially contained in three enactments  namely   (1)   The   Arbitration   Act,   1940,   (2)   The   Arbitration   (Protocol   and   Convention)  Act,   1937   and   (3)   The   Foreign   Awards  (Recognition   and   Enforcement)   Act,   1961.   A  party holding a foreign award was required  to   take   recourse   to   these   enactments.  Preamble   of   the   Act   makes   it   abundantly   clear   that   it   aims   at   to   consolidate   and  amend   Indian   laws   relating   to   domestic  arbitration,   international   commercial  arbitration   and   enforcement   of   foreign  arbitral awards. The object of the Act is to   minimize   supervisory   role   of   court   and   to   give speedy justice . In this view, the stage   of approaching court for making award a rule   of   court   as   required   in   Arbitration   Act,  1940 is dispensed with in the present Act.   If   the   argument   of   the   respondent   is  accepted, one of the objects of the Act will   be   frustratedand   defeated.   Under   the   old  Act,   after   making   award   and   prior   to  HC-NIC Page 44 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER execution, there was a procedure for filing   and making an award a rule of court i.e. a   decree.  Since  the object  of  the  act is to  provide   speedy   and   alternative   solution   of  the   dispute,   the   same   procedure   cannot   be   insisted   under   the   new   Act   when   it   is  advisedly   eliminated.   If   separate  proceedings   are   to   be   taken,   one   for  deciding   the   enforceability   of   a   foreign  award   and   the   other   thereafter   for  execution,   it   would   only   contribute   to  protracting the litigation and adding to the  sufferings of a litigant in terms of money,   time and energy. Avoiding such difficulties  is one of the objects of the Act as can be  gathered   from   the   scheme   of   the   Act   and  particularly   looking   to   the   provisions  contained in Sections 46 to 49 in relation   to enforcement of foreign award. In para 40   of   the   Thyssen   judgment   already   extracted  above,   it   is   stated   that   as   a   matter   of   fact, there is not much difference between  the provisions of the 1961 Act and the Act  in   the   matter   of   enforcement   of   foreign   award. The only difference as found is that   while under the Foreign Award Act a decree   follows, under the new Act the foreign award   is already stamped as the decree. Thus, in   our view, a party holding foreign award can   apply   for   enforcement   of   it   but   the   court   before   taking   further   effective   steps   for  the execution of the award has to proceed in   accordance   with   Sections   47   to   49.   In   one   proceeding there may be different stages. In  the first stage the Court may have to decide   about the enforceability of the award having  regard   to   the   requirement   of   the   said  provisions.   Once   the   court   decides   that  foreign award is enforceable, it can proceed  to   take   further   effective   steps   for  execution   of   the   same.   There   arises   no  question of making foreign award as a rule   of   court/decree   again.   If   the   object   and  purpose   can   be   served   in   the   same  proceedings, in our view, there is no need   to   take   two   separate   proceedings   resulting  HC-NIC Page 45 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER in   multiplicity   of   litigation.   It   is   also   clear from objectives contained in para 4 of   the   St   atement   of   Objects   and   Reasons,  Sections 47 to 49 and Scheme of the Act that   every final arbitral award is to be enforced   as   if   it   were   a   decree   of   the   court.   The   submission that the execution petition could  not   be   permitted   to   convert   as   an  application   under   Section   47   is   technical  and is of no consequence in the view we have   taken.   In   our   opinion,   for   enforcement   of   foreign   award   there   is   no   need   to   take  separate   proceedings,   one   for   deciding   the  enforceability of the award to make rule of   the court or decree and the other to take up   execution thereafter. In one proceeding, as  already stated above , the court enforcing a   foreign   award   can   deal   with   the   entire  matter. Even otherwise, this procedure does  not prejudice a party in the light of what  is   stated   in   para   40   of   the   Thyssen  judgment.\n32.   Part   II   of   the   Act   relates   to  enforcement   of   certain   foreign   awards.  Chapter 1 of this Part deals with New York  Convention   Awards.   Section   46   of   the   Act  speaks   as   to   when   a   foreign   award   is   binding.   Section   47   states   as   to   what  evidence   the   party   applying   for   the   enforcement   of   a   foreign   award   should  produce before the court. Section 48 states  as   to   the   conditions   for   enforcement   of  foreign   awards.   As   per   Section   49,   if   the  Court is satisfied that a foreign award is  enforceable   under   this   Chapter,   the   award  shall be deemed to be a decree of that court   and   that   court   has   to   proceed   further   to  execute   the   foreign   award   as   a   decree   of  that   court.   If   the   argument   advanced   on  behalf   of   the   respondent   is   accepted,   the  very purpose of the Act in regard to speedy   and   effective   execution   of   foreign   award  will   be   defeated.   Thus   none   of   the  contentions   urged   on   behalf   of   the  respondent merit acceptance so as to uphold  the impugned judgment and order. We have no  HC-NIC Page 46 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER hesitation or impediment in concluding that   the   impugned   judgment   and   order   cannot   be  sustained.\"\n89. The   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  Renusagar   Power  Co. Ltd. (Supra), has observed thus: \n40. We are, therefore, of the opinion that  the enforcement of the Arbitral award is not  barred   by   S.   7(1)(a)(ii)   of   the   Foreign  Awards Act on the ground that Renusagar was  unable   to   present   its   case   before   the  Arbitral Tribunal.\nIII. Objection to the Enforceability of the  Award on the Ground that it is Contrary to  the Public Policy of the State of New York. \n41.  Shri  Venugopal  has  urged  that   although  under subclause (b) of clause (2) of Art. V  of  the   New   York   Convention  the   recognition  and enforcement of an arbitral award can be  refused   if   the   competent   authority   in   the  country where recognition and enforcement is  sought   finds   that   the   recognition   or  enforcement  of  the   award   would   be   contrary  to the public policy of that country, i.e.,   the country where the award is sought to be   enforced,   a   departure   has   been   made   in   S.  7(i)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act which  prescribes that the foreign award may not be  enforced   under   the   said   Act   if   the   Court  dealing with the case is satisfied that the   enforcement  of  the   award   would   be   contrary  to   public   policy.   The   submission   of   Shri  Venugopal is that in S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the  Act.   the   Parliament   has   deliberately  refrained   from   using   the   words   \"public  policy   of   India\"   which   implies   that   the  words \"public policy\" are not restricted to  the public policy of India but would cover  the public policy of the country whose law  governs   the   contract   or   of   the   country   of  the place of arbitration and the enforcement  of   an   award   would   be   refused   if   it   is   HC-NIC Page 47 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER contrary   to   such   public   policy.   In   this  context   Shri   Venugopal   has   invited   our  attention   to   the   provisions   of   S.   7(1)   of  the   Arbitration   (Protocol   and   Convention)  Act,   1937   wherein   the   words   used   are   \"and  enforcement thereof must not be contrary to  the   public   policy   or   law   of   india\".  According to Shri Venugopal while under the  1937   Act,   objections   to   enforcement   are  limited to the public policy of India or law  of India, there is no such limitation in S.   7(l)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act. Shri  Venugopal   has   also   placed   reliance   on   the  decision   of   this   Court   in   V/o   Tractoroexport. Moscow v. Tarapore and Co.,  (1970) 3 SCR 53 : (AIR  1971 SC 1) wherein  this   Court   has   held   that   there   was   clear  deviation   from   the   rigid   and   strict   rule  that the courts must stay a suit whenever an  international   commercial   arbitration   as  contemplated   by   the   Protocol   and   the  Conventions, was to take place and that it  was open to the legislature to deviate from   the terms of the Protocol and the Convention  and   that   it   appears   to   have   given   only   a  limited effect to the provisions of the 1958  Convention.  We  find   it   difficult  to  accept  this contention. It cannot be held that by  not using the words \"Public policy of India\" \nand only using the words \"public policy\" in  S.   7(l)(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act,  Parliament   intended   to   'deviate   from   the  provisions   of   the   New   York   Convention  contained   in   Art.   V(2)(b)   which   uses   the  words   \"public   policy   of   that   country\" \nimplying public policy of the country where  recognition and enforcement is sought. That   Parliament   did   not   intend   to   deviate   from  the   terms   of   the   New   York   Convention   is  borne   out   by   the   amendment   which   was  introduced   in   the   Act   by   Act   47   of   1973   after   the   decision   of   this   Court   in   Tractoroexport case (supra) whereby S. 3 was  substituted to bring it in accord with the  provisions   of   the  New   York  Convention.  The  Foreign Awards Act has been enacted to give   HC-NIC Page 48 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER effect   to   the   New   York   Convention   which  seeks   to   remedy   the   defects   in   the   Geneva  Convention of 1927 that hampered the speedy  settlement   of   disputes   rough   arbitration.  The   Foreign   Awards   Act   therefore,   intended  to reduce the time taken in recognition and   enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. The   New   York   Contention   seeks   to   achieve   this  objective by dispensing with the requirement  of the leave enforce the award by the Courts  where the ward is made and thereby avoid the  problem   of   \"double   exequatur\".   It   also  restricts   the   cope   of   enquiry   before   the  Court enforcing he award by eliminating the  requirement   that   he   award   should   not   be  contrary to the principals of the law of the  country   in   which   it   sought   to   be   relied  upon.   Enlarging   the   field   of   enquiry   to  include   public   policy   of   the   Courts   whose  law governs the contract or oil he country  of  place  of  arbitration,   would   run   counter  to the expressed intent of the legislation. \n42.   With   regard   to   the   provisions   of   the   Arbitration   (Protocol   and   Convention)   Act,  937,   it   may  be  stated   that  S.  7(1)   of   the  said   Act,   as   originally   enacted.   read   as   under :\n\"7.   Conditions   For   Enforcement   of   Foreign  Awards.   (1)   In   order   that   a   foreign   ward  may   be   enforceable   under   this   Act   it   must  have  (a) been made in pursuance of an agreement   for arbitration which was valid under he law   by which it was governed,\n(b) been made by the tribunal provided for n   the agreement or constituted in manner greed  upon by the parties,\n(c)   been   made   in   conformity   with   the   law  covering with the arbitration procedure.,\n(d) become final the country in which it was   made, HC-NIC Page 49 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER (e)   been  in  respect   of   a  matter   which   may  lawfully   be   referred   to   arbitration   under  the law of British India, and   the   enforcement   thereof   must   not   be   contrary to the public policy or the law of  British India. \n(2) A foreign award shall not be enforceable  under this Act if the Court dealing with the   case is satisfied that   (a)   the   award   has   been   annulled   in   the   country in which it was made, or (b) the party against whom it is sought to  enforce   the   award   was   not   given   notice   of  the   arbitration   proceedings   in   sufficient  time to enable him to present his case, or  was under some legal incapacity and was not   properly represented or,\n(c)   the   award   does   not   deal   with   all   the  questions referred or contains decisions on  matters   beyond   the   scope   of   the   agreement  for arbitration :\nProvided   that,   if   the   award   does   not   deal  with   all  questions   referred   the   Court   may,  if   it   thinks   fit,   either   postpone   the  enforcement   of   the   award   or   order   its  enforcement   subject   to   the   giving   of   such  security by the person seeking to enforce it  as the Court may think fit.\n(3)   If   a   party   seeking   to   resist   the   enforcement  of  a   foreign   award   proves   that  there   is   any   ground   other   than   the   non existence   of   the   conditions   specified   in  clauses (a), (b) and (c) of subsec. (1), or  the existence of the conditions specified in  clauses   (b)   and   (c)   of   subsec.   (2),  entitling him to contest the validity of the  award,   the   Court   may,   if   it   thinks   fit,  either   refuse   to   enforce   the   award   or  adjourn   the   hearing   until   after   the   expiration of such period as appears to the   Court to be reasonably sufficient to enable  HC-NIC Page 50 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER that   party   to   take   the   necessary   steps   to  have   the   award   annulled   by   the   competent  tribunal.\" \n43.   By   Indian   Independence   (Adaptation   of  Central Acts and Ordinances) Order 1948, the  words   \"British   India\"   were   substituted   by  the words \"the Provinces\", which words were  substituted by the words \"the States\" by the  Adaptation   of   Laws   Order,   1950.   By   Part   B  States   (Laws)   Act,   1951,   the   words   \"the  States\"   were   substituted   by   the   word  \"India\". The aforesaid amendments introduced  from   time   to   time   indicate   that   the   words  \"public policy\" and \"the law of India\" are  independent   of   each   other   and   the   words  \"public   policy\"   are   not   qualified   by   the  words \"of India\" which follow the word \"law\"  because there was no separate public policy  for   each   Province   or   State   in   India.   This  means   that   even   in   the   Protocol   and  Convention   Act  of  1937   the  legislature  had  used the words \"Public Policy\" only and by  the said words it was intended to mean \"the   public   policy   of   India\".   The   New   York  Convention   has   further   curtailed   the   scope  of enquiry by excluding contravention of law  of the Court in which the award is sought to   be   enforced   as   a   ground   for   refusing  recognition   and   enforcement   of   a   foreign   award.   The   words   \"law   of   India\"   have,  therefore, been omitted in S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of  the   Foreign   Awards   Act.   It   cannot,  therefore, be said that by using the words  \"Public Policy\" only S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the.  Foreign Awards Act seeks to make a departure  from   the   provisions   contained   in   the  Protocol and Convention Act of 1937 and, by  using the words \"Public Policy\". without any  qualification,   Parliament   intended   to  broaden the scope of enquiry so as to cover   public policy of other countries, i.e., the  country   whose   law   governs   the   contract   or  the country of the place of arbitration. In  the U.K., the Arbitration Act, 1975 has been  enacted to give effect to the provisions of  HC-NIC Page 51 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the New York Convention. Section 5(3) of the  said Act provides as under :\n\"Enforcement of a Convention award may also  be refused if the award is in respect of a  matter which is not capable of settlement by  arbitration, or if it would be contrary to  public policy to enforce the award.\"\n45. We are, therefore, of the view that the   words \"public policy\" used in S. 7(l)(b)(ii)  of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act   refer   to   the  public   policy   of   India   and  the   recognition  and enforcement of the award of the Arbitral  Tribunal cannot be questioned on the ground  that it is contrary to the public policy of   the State of New York.\n47. The need for applying the touchstone of  public policy has been thus explained by Sir  William Holdsworth  \"In fact, a body of law like the common law,   which has grown up gradually with the growth  of   the   nation,   necessarily   acquires   some   fixed principles, and if it is to maintain  these   principles   it   must   be   able,   on   the  ground of public policy or some other like  ground,   to   suppress   practices   which,   under  ever   new   disguises,   seek   to   weaken   or  negative   them\".   (History   of   English   Law,  Vol. III p. 55). \n48. Since the doctrine of public policy is  somewhat opentextured and flexible, judges  in   England   have   shown   certain   degree   of  reluctance   to   invoke   it   in   domestic   law.  There   are   two   conflicting   positions   which  are   referred   as   the   'narrow   view'   and   the  'broad   view'.   According  to  the   narrow   view  Courts   cannot   create   new   heads   of   public  policy   whereas   the   broad   view   countenances  judicial   law   making   in   this   areas.   (See  Chitty on Contracts, 26th Ed. Vol. I, para  1133, pp. 685686). Similar is the trend of  the decision in India. In Gherulal Parakh v.  Mahadeodas   Maiya,   1959   Suppl   (2)   SCR   392: \n(AIR   1959   SC   781)   this   Court   favoured   the  HC-NIC Page 52 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER narrow view when it said :\n\" ..........though the heads are not closed  and   though   theoretically   it   may   be  permissible   to   evolve   a   new   head   under  exceptional   circumstances   of   a   changing  world, it is admissible in the interest of  stability of society not to make any attempt  to   discover   new   heads   in   these   days\"   (p. \n440) (of SCR) : (at p. 795 of AIR). \n49.   In   later   decisions   this   Court   has,  however, leaned towards the broad view. (See  Murlidhar Agarwal v. State of U.P. (1975) 1  SCR 575 at p. 584 : (AIR 1974 SC 1924 at p.   1930)   :   Central   Inland   Water   Transport  Corporation   v.   Brojo   Nath   Ganguly   (supra)  (1986 (2) SCR 278 at p. 373 : (AIR 1986 SC  1571 at p. 1612); Rattanchand Hira Chand v.  Askar Nawaz Jung (1991)3 SCC 67 at pp. 7677  : (1991 AIR SCW 496 at pp. 50203).\n50.   In   the   field   of   private   international  law,   Courts   refuse   to   apply   a   rule   of  foreign law or recognise a foreign judgment  or a foreign arbitral award if it is found  that   the   same   is   contrary   to   the   public  policy of the country in which it is sought   to   be   invoked   or   enforced.   The   English  Courts follow the following principles: \n\"Exceptionally,   the   English   court   will   not  enforce or recognise a right conferred or a  duty imposed by a foreign law where, on the   facts   of   the   particular   case,   enforcement  or, as the case may be, recognition, would  be   contrary   to   a   fundamental   policy   of  English   law.   The   Court   has,   therefore,  refused   in   certain   cases   to   apply   foreign  law where to do so would in the particular  circumstances   be   contrary   to   the   interests  of the united Kingdom or contrary to justice  or   morality\".   (see   Halsbury's   Laws   of  England, IV Ed., vol. 8, para 418).\n57.   In   Deutsche   Schachtbauund  Tiefbohrgesellschaft   m.b.H.   v.   R.As   al Khaimah   National   Oil   Co.   (1987)   2   All   ER  HC-NIC Page 53 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER 769,   decided   by   the   Court   of   Appeal.   Sir  John Donaldson M.R. has said :\n\"Consideration of public policy can never be  exhaustively   defined,   hut   they   should   be  approached with extreme caution. As Burrough  J. remarked in Richardson v. Mellish, (1824)  2 Bing 229 at 252, (182434) All ER Rep 258  at 266. It is never argued at all but when  other points fail. It has to be shown that  there is some element of illegality or that   the   enforcement   of   the   award   would   be  clearly   injurious   to   the   public   good   or,  possibly,   that   enforcement   would   be   wholly  offensive   to   the   ordinary   reasonable   and  fully informed member of the public on whose  behalf   the   powers   of   the   State   are  exercised.\n63.In   view   of   the   absence   of   a   workable   definition of \"international public policy\" \nwe   find   it   difficult   to   construe   the  expression   \"public   policy\"   in   Article   V(2)\n(b)   of   the   New   York   Convention   to   mean  international public policy. In our opinion   the   said   expression   must   be   construed   to  mean   the   doctrine   of   public   policy   as  applied by the Courts in which the foreign  award   is   sought   to   be   enforced. \nConsequently , the expression 'public policy'  in Section 7(l)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards  Act means the doctrine of public policy as  applied by the Courts in India. This raises   the question whether the narrower concept of  public policy as applicable in the field of  public   international   law   should   be   applied  or   the   wider   concept   of   public   policy   as  applicable in the field of municipal law. \n65.   This   would   imply   that   the   defence   of  'public policy which is permissible under S.  7(l)(b)(ii) should be construed narrowly. In  this context, it would also be of relevance  to   mention   that   under   Article   I(e)   of   the  Geneva   Convention   Act   of   1927,   it   is  permissible   to   raise   objection   to   the  enforcement of arbitral award on the ground  HC-NIC Page 54 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER that   the  recognition  or  enforcement  of  the  award is contrary to the public policy or to   the principles of the law of the country in   which it is sought to be relied upon. To the   same effect is the provision in S. 7(1) of  the   Protocol   and   Convention   Act   of   1937  which  requires  that   the  enforcement  of  the  foreign   award   must   not   be   contrary   to   the  public policy or the law of India. Since the  expression \"public policy\" covers the field   not   covered   by   the   words   \"and   the   law   of  India\"   which   follow   the   said   expression,   contravention of law alone will not attract  the bar of public policy and something more  than contravention of law is required. \n66.   Article   V(2)(b)   of   the   New   York   Convention of 1958 and Section 7 (l)(b)(ii)  of the Foreign Awards Act do not postulate  refusal of recognition and enforcement of a  foreign   award   on   the   ground   that   it   is  contrary   to   the   law   of   the   country   of  enforcement  and   the   ground  of  challenge   is  confined to the recognition and enforcement   being contrary to the public policy of the  country   in   which   the   award   is   set   to   be   enforced. There is nothing to indicate that  the   expression   \"public   policy\"   in   Article  V(2)(b)   of   the   New   York   Convention   and  Section   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards  Act is not used in the same sense in which  it   was   used   in   Article   1(c)   of   the   Geneva  Convention of 1927 and Section 7(l) of the  Protocol   and   Convention   Act   of   1937.   This  would  mean   that   \"public  policy\"   in   Section  7(l)(b)(ii)   has   been   used   in   a   narrower  sense   and   in   order   to   attract   the   bar   of  public   policy   the  enforcement  of  the   award  must   invoke   something   more   than   the   violation   of   the   law   of   India.   Since   the  Foreign   Awards   Act   is   concerned   with  recognition   and   enforcement   of   foreign  awards which are governed by the principles  of private international law, the expression  \"public   policy\"   in   Section   7(l)(b)(ii)   of  the   Foreign  Awards   Act   must   necessarily   be  HC-NIC Page 55 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER construed   in   the   sense   the   doctrine   of  public   policy   is   applied   in   the   field   of  private international law. Applying the said  criteria   it   must   be   held   that   the  enforcement   of   a   foreign   award   would   be  refused on the ground that it is contrary to  public   policy   if   such   enforcement   would   be  contrary to (i) fundamental policy of Indian  law or (ii) the interests of India or (iii)   justice or morality.\n99.   In   Indian   law   the   principle   of   unjust  enrichment   finds   recognition   in   the   Indian  Contract Act, 1872 (Ss. 70 and 72). \n100. We do not consider it necessary to go  into   the  question  whether   the  principle   of  unjust   enrichment   is   a   part   of   the   public  policy of India since we are of the opinion   that   even   if   it   be   assumed   that   unjust  enrichment   is   contrary   to   public  policy   of  India, Renusagar cannot succeed because the  unjust   enrichment   must   relate   to   the  enforcement   of   the   award   and   not   to   its  merits   in   view   of   the   limited   scope   of  enquiry   in   proceedings   for   the   enforcement  of a foreign award under the Foreign Awards   Act.   The   objections   raised   by   Renusagar  based on unjust enrichment do not relate to  the enforcement of the award because it is  not   the   case   of   Renusagar   that   General  Electric   has   already   received   the   amount   awarded   under   the  arbitration  award  and   is  seeking   to   obtain  enforcement  of  the   award  to obtain further payment and would thus be  unjustly   enriching   itself.   The   objections  about unjust enrichment raised by Renusagar   go to the merits of the award, that is, with   regard   to   the   quantum   awarded   by   the  and   7,   which   is   beyond   the   scope   of   the   objections   that   can   be   raised  u/S.   7(l)(b)\n(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act.   To   hold  otherwise   would   mean   that   in   every   case  where the arbitrators award an amount which  is higher than the amount that should have  been   awarded,   the   award   would   be   open   to  HC-NIC Page 56 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER challenge   on   the   ground   of   unjust  enrichment. Such a course is not permissible  under   the   New   York   Convention   and   the  Foreign   Awards   Act.   We   have,   however,  examined the objections raised by Renusagar   relating to unjust enrichment even on merits  and   we   are   not   satisfied   that   the   amounts  awarded under items Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 7 are  so   excessive   as   to   result   in   unjust  enrichment of General Electric.\" \n90. Similarly, the Apex Court in the case of Shri Lal  Mahal   Ltd.   (supra),   has   considered   the  provisions of Section 48 of the Act in relation  to foreign award and has observed thus:   \"19.   Having   regard   to   clause   (b)   of   sub section (2) of Section 48 of the 1996 Act,  we   shall   immediately   examine   what   is   the  scope of enquiry before the court in which  foreign award, as defined in Section 44, is  sought   to   be   enforced.   This   has   become  necessary as on behalf of the appellant it  was   vehemently   contended   that   in   light   of  the   two   decisions   of   this   Court   in  Saw  Pipes1 and Phulchand Exports2, the Court can  refuse to enforce a foreign award if it is  contrary to the contract between the parties   and/or is patently illegal. It was argued by  Mr.   Rohinton   F.   Nariman,   learned   senior   counsel   for   the   appellant,   that   the  expression   \"public   policy   of   India\"   in  Section 48(2)(b) is an expression of wider   import   than   the   expression   \"public   policy\"  \nin Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards  (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961. The  expansive   construction   given   by   this   Court   to the term \"public policy of India\" in Saw  Pipes1  must   also   apply   to   the   use   of   the   same   term   \"public   policy   of   India\"   in   Section 48(2)(b). \n20. Mr.   Jayant   K.   Mehta,   learned   counsel  HC-NIC Page 57 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER for   the   respondent,   on   the   other   hand,  placed   heavy   reliance   upon  the   decision   of  this Court in  Renusagar3  and submitted that  what   has   been   stated   by   this   Court   while  interpreting   Section   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the  Foreign Awards Act in that case is equally  applicable   to   Section   48(2)(b)   of   the   1996  Act and the expression 1 Oil and Natural Gas  Corporation  \"public   policy   of   India\"   in  Section 48(2)(b) must receive narrow meaning  than Section 34.  Saw Pipes1  never meant to  give   wider   meaning   to   the   expression,  \"public policy of India\" insofar as Section  48 was concerned.   According to Mr. Jayant  K.  Mehta,  Phulchand  Exports2  does   not  hold  that   all   that   is   found   in   paragraph   74   in  Saw   Pipes1  is   applicable   to   Section   48(2)\n(b).   He   argued   that   in   any   case   both  Saw  Pipes1  and  Phulchand Exports2  are decisions  by a twoJudge Bench of this Court whereas  Renusagar3  is   a   decision   of   threeJudge  Bench and if there is any inconsistency in  the   decisions   of   this   Court   in  Saw   Pipes1  and  Phulchand Exports2  on the one hand and  Renusagar3  on   the   other,  Renusagar3  must  prevail as this is a decision by the larger   Bench. \n21. The   three   decisions   of   this   Court   in  Renusagar3,  Saw Pipes  and  Phulchand Exports  need a careful and close examination by us.   We shall first deal with Renusagar. \n22. It   is   not   necessary   to   narrate   in  detail the facts in Renusagar3 . Suffice it  to   say   that   Arbitral   Tribunal,   GAFTA   in  Paris passed an award in favour of General  Electric   Company   (GEC)   against   Renusagar.  GEC   sought   to   enforce   the   award   passed   in  its favour by filing an arbitration petition  under Section 5 of the Foreign Awards Act in  the   Bombay   High   Court.   Renusagar   contested  the proceedings for enforcement of the award  filed   by   GEC   in   the   Bombay   High   Court   on  diverse   grounds.   Inter   alia ,   one   of   the  objections raised by Renusagar was that the  HC-NIC Page 58 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER enforcement of the award was contrary to the  public policy of India. The Single Judge of  the   Bombay   High  Court   overruled   the  objections   of   Renusagar.   It   was   held   that  the award was enforceable and on that basis   a   decree   in   terms   of   the   award   was   drawn.  Renusagar   filed   an   intracourt   appeal   but  that   was  dismissed   as   not   maintainable.   It  was   from   these   orders   that   the   matter  reached   this   Court.   On   behalf   of   the  parties,   multifold   arguments   were   made.   A  threeJudge   Bench   of   this   Court   noticed  diverse   provisions,   including   Section   7(1)\n(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act   which  provided   that   a   foreign   award   may   not   be  enforced if the court dealing with the case   was   satisfied   that   the   enforcement   of   the  award would be contrary to public policy. \n23. Of   the   many   questions   framed   for   determination,   the   two   questions   under  consideration were; one, \"Does Section 7(1)\n(b)(ii) of the  Foreign Awards Act preclude   enforcement   of   the   award   of   the   Arbitral  Tribunal, GAFTA for the reason that the said  award   is   contrary   to   the   public   policy   of  the State of New York?\" and the other \"what  is meant by public policy in Section 7(1)(b)\n(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act?\". This Court  held that the words \"public policy\" used in   Section   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards  Act   meant   public   policy   of   India.   The  argument   that   the   recognition   and  enforcement   of   the   award   of   the   Arbitral  Tribunal,   GAFTA   can   be   questioned   on   the  ground   that   it   is   contrary   to   the   public  policy of the State of New York was negated.  A   clear   and   fine   distinction   was   drawn   by  this Court while applying the rule of public  policy between a matter governed by domestic  laws   and   a   matter   involving   conflict   of  laws. It has been held in unambiguous terms   that   the   application   of   the   doctrine   of  \"public  policy\"in  the   field  of  conflict  of  laws   is   more   limited   than   that   in   the  domestic   law   and   the   courts   are   slower   to  HC-NIC Page 59 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER invoke   public   policy   in   cases   involving   a  foreign   element   than   when  purely   municipal  legal issues are involved. \n24. Explaining   the   concept   of   \"public  policy\" visavis the enforcement of foreign  awards in Renusagar , this Court in paras 65  and 66 (pgs. 681 682) of the Report stated: \n65.   This   would   imply   that   the   defence   of  public   policy   which   is   permissible   under  Section   7(1)(b)(ii)   should   be   construed  narrowly. In this context, it would also be  of  relevance   to   mention  that   under   Article  I(e) of the Geneva Convention Act of 1927,  it is permissible to raise objection to the   enforcement of arbitral award on the ground  that   the  recognition  or  enforcement  of  the  award is contrary to the public policy or to   the principles of the law of the country in   which it is sought to be relied upon. To the   same effect is the provision in Section 7(1)  of   the   Protocol   &   Convention   Act   of   1937  which  requires  that   the  enforcement  of  the  foreign   award   must   not   be   contrary   to   the  public policy or the law of India. Since the  expression \"public policy\" covers the field  not   covered   by   the   words   \"and   the   law   of   India\"   which   follow   the   said   expression,   contravention of law alone will not attract  the bar of public policy and something more  than contravention of law is required.\n66.  . . . . . . . . This would mean that   \"public policy\" in Section 7(1)( b )( i i )  has   been   used   in   a   narrower   sense   and   in  order   to   attract   the   bar   of   public   policy  the   enforcement   of   the   award     must   invoke  something more than the violation of the law  of   India.   Since   the   Foreign   Awards   Act   is  concerned   with   recognition   and   enforcement  of foreign awards which are governed by the   principles of private international law, the  expression   \"public   policy\"   in   Section   7(1)\n(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act   must  necessarily   be  construed   in   the   sense   the  HC-NIC Page 60 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER doctrine of public policy is applied in the   field of private international law. Applying  the said criteria it must be held that the  enforcement   of   a   foreign   award   would   be  refused on the ground that it is contrary to  public   policy   if   such   enforcement   would   be  contrary   to   (  i  )   fundamenta   lpolicy   of  Indian   law;   or   (  i   i  )   the   interests   of  India; or ( ii i ) justice or morality . \n25. In  Saw   Pipes1,   the   ambit   and   scope   of  the court's jurisdiction under Section 34 of   the   1996   Act   was   under   consideration.   The  issue   was   whether   the   court   would   have  jurisdiction   under   Section   34   to   set   aside  an   award   passed   by   the   Arbitral   Tribunal,  GAFTA   which   was   patently   illegal   or   in  contravention of the provisions of the 1996  Act   or   any   other   substantive   law   governing  the parties or was against the terms of the   contract. This Court considered the meaning   that could be assigned to the phrase \"public   policy of India\" occurring in Section 34(2)\n(b)(ii). Alive to the subtle distinction in  the   concept   of   'enforcement   of   the   award'   and   'jurisdiction   of   the   court   in   setting  aside   the   award'   and   the   decision   of   this  Court in  Renusagar3 , this Court held in  Saw  Pipes1  that   the   term   \"public   policy   of  India\"   in   Section   34   was   required   to   be  interpreted   in   the   context   of   the   jurisdiction of the court where the validity  of the award is challenged before it becomes  final and executable in contradistinction to  the enforcement of an award after it becomes  final. Having that distinction in view, with  regard   to   Section   34   this   Court   said   that   the expression \"public policy of India\" was  required   to   be   given   a   wider   meaning.  Accordingly, for the purposes of Section 34,  this   Court   added   a   new   category   -   patent  illegality   -   for   setting   aside   the   award.  While adding this category for setting aside  the   award   on   the   ground   of   patent  illegality,   the   Court  clarified   that  illegality must go to the root of the matter  HC-NIC Page 61 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER and if the illegality is of trivial nature  it   cannot   be   held   that   award   is   against  public policy. Award could also be set aside  if it was so unfair and unreasonable that it  shocks the conscience of the court. \n26. From the discussion made by this Court  in Saw Pipes in paragraph 18 of the Report,  it   can   be   safely   observed   that   while  accepting   the   narrow   meaning   given   to   the  expression \"public policy\" in  Renusagar3  in  the matters of enforcement of foreign award,  there   was   departure   from   the   said   meaning  for the purposes of the jurisdiction of the   Court   in   setting   aside   the   award   under  Section 34.\n27. In   our   view,   what   has   been   stated   by  this  Court   in  Renusagar3  with  reference  to  Section   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards  Act   must   equally   apply   to   the   ambit   and  scope of Section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 Act.  In  Renusagar3  it   has   been   expressly  exposited   that   the   expression   \"public  policy\"   in   Section   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act   refers   to   the   public  policy   of   India.   The   expression   \"public  policy\" used in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) was held  to   mean   \"public   policy   of   India\".   A   distinction   in   the   rule   of   public   policy  between   a   matter   governed   by   the   domestic  law and a matter involving conflict of laws   has been noticed in Renusagar. For all this  there is no reason why Renusagar  should not  apply as regards the scope of inquiry under   Section   48(2)(b).   Following  Renusagar,   we  think that for the purposes of Section 48(2)\n(b), the expression \"public policy of India\"  \nmust   be   given   narrow   meaning   and   the  enforcement   of   foreign   award   would   be  refused on the ground that it is contrary to  public policy of India if it is covered by  one   of   the   three   categories   enumerated   in  Renusagar3.   Although   the   same   expression  'public   policy   of   India'   is   used   both   in  Section 34(2(b)(ii) and Section 48(2)(b) and  HC-NIC Page 62 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the concept of 'public policy in India' is  same in nature in both the Sections but, in   our view, its application differs in degree  insofar as these two Sections are concerned.  The application of 'public policy of India'  doctrine  for   the   purposes   of   Section   48(2)\n(b) is more limited than the application of  the   same   expression   in   respect   of   the  domestic arbitral award.\n  28. We   are   not   persuaded   to   accept   the  submission   of   Mr.  Rohinton  F.  Nariman   that  the  expression  \"public  policy  of  India\"   in  Section   48(2)(b)   is   an   expression   of   wider  import  than  the  \"public  policy\"  in  Section  7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act.   We  have   no   hesitation   in   holding   that  Renusagar3  must   apply   for   the   purposes   of  Section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 Act. Insofar as  the   proceeding   for   setting   aside   an   award  under   Section   34   is   concerned,   the  principles   laid   down   in  Saw   Pipes1  would  govern the scope of such proceedings. \n29. We accordingly hold that enforcement of  foreign award would be refused under Section  48(2)(b)  only   if   such   enforcement   would   be  contrary to (I) fundamental policy of Indian  law; or (2) the interests of India; or (3)  justice or morality. The wider meaning given  to  the  expression  \"public  policy  of  India\" \noccurring   in   Section   34(2)(b)(ii)   in  Saw  Pipes1  is not applicable where objection is  raised   to   the   enforcement   of   the   foreign  award under Section 48(2)(b).\n30. It is true that in Phulchand Exports, a  twoJudge   Bench   of   this   Court   speaking  through one of us (R.M. Lodha, J.) accepted   the   submission   made   on   behalf   of   the  appellant therein that the meaning given to  the  expression  \"public  policy  of  India\"   in  Section 34 in Saw Pipes1 must be applied to  the   same   expression   occurring   in   Section   48(2)(b) of the 1996 Act. However, in what  we have discussed above it must be held that  HC-NIC Page 63 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the statement in paragraph 16 of the Report   that the expression \"public policy of India  used in Section 48(2)(b) has to be given a  wider   meaning   and   the   award   could   be   set  aside, if it is patently illegal\" does not  lay down correct law and is overruled.\n34.   Mr.   Rohinton   F.   Nariman   vehemently  contended that once parties had agreed that  certification by an inspecting agency would   be   final,   it   was   not   open   to   the   Arbitral  Tribunal, GAFTA as well as Board of Appeal,  to go behind that certificate and disregard  it   even   if   the   certificate   was   inaccurate  (which   was   not   the   case).   In   this   regard,   reliance was placed on two judgments of the  English   courts,   namely,  Agroexport  and  Alfred   C.   Toepfer.  He   submitted   that   House  of Lords in  Gill & Duffus  has affirmed the  decision in Alfred C. Toepfer. It was, thus,  submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal, GAFTA   and   the   Board   of   Appeal   having   disregarded  the   finality   of   the   certificate   issued   by  S.G.S.   India,   the   awards   were   plainly   contrary   to   contract   and,   therefore,   not   enforceable   in   India.   It   was   submitted   on  behalf of the appellant that it was not an  issue   in   dispute   and   not   the   buyers'   case  before   the   Arbitral   Tribunal,   GAFTA   and/or   the   Board   of   Appeal   that   the   procedure  adopted by SGS India was not in conformity  with   the   contract.   It   was,   therefore,   not  open   to   the   Board   of   Appeal   to   render   a   finding which went beyond the scope of the  buyers' very case. Accordingly, it was argued  that   the   Board   of   Appeal   dealt   with   the   questions not referred to it and which were  never   in   dispute   and,   therefore,   award  cannot be enforced because it is contrary to  Section 48(1)(c) of the 1996 Act as well. \n42.   The   challenge   to   the   enforceability   of  the   foreign   awards   passed   by   the   Board   of   Appeal is mainly laid by the sellers on the   ground   that   the   Board   of   Appeal   has   gone  beyond the terms of the contract by ignoring   the   certificate   of   quality   obtained   at   the  HC-NIC Page 64 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER load   port   from   the   buyers'   nominated  certifying agency, i.e., SGS India which was   final   under   the   contract.   The   Board   of  Appeal ,   while   dealing   with   the   question  whether the SGS India certificate was issued   by the contractual party and in contractual  form, noticed the clause in the contract in  respect of quality and condition and it held   that SGS India was an acceptable certifying  party   under   the   contract.   As   regards   the  other   part   of   that   clause   that   provided,  \"certificate   and   quality   showed   in   the  certificate will be the result of an average   samples taken jointly at port of loading by  the   representatives   of   the   sellers   and   the  buyers\",   the   Board   of   Appeal   recorded   its  finding as follows:\n\"The   SGS   India   certificate   shows   that   an  inspection   took   place   at   the   suppliers   godowns   inland,   and   representative   samples  taken. Sealed samples were inspected lotwise   and   the   cargo   meeting   the   contractual  specifications was allowed to be bagged for  dispatch   to   Kandla.   Continuous   supervision  of loading into the vessel was also carried   out   at   the   port.   The   samples   drawn  periodically   were   reduced   and   composite  samples   were   sealed;   one   sealed   sample   of  each   lot   was   handed   over   to   the   supplier,   one sealed sample of each lot was analysed   by   SGS   and   the   remaining   samples   were  retained by SGS for a period of three months  unless   and   until   instructions   to   the  contrary were given.\nThe   analysis   section   of   the   certificate  states   that   \"The   above   samples   have   been  analysed   and   the   weighted   average   Pre shipment and Shipment results are as under:\nWe   find   that   this   procedure   was   not   in  conformity   with   the   requirements   of   the  Contract, which required the result to be of   an average sample taken at port of loading,   not the weighted average of preshipment and   shipment   samples.   Accordingly   the  HC-NIC Page 65 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER certificate is uncontractual and its results   are not final. In consequence the Board is   obliged   to   evaluate   all   the   evidence  presented,   including   the   evidence   of   the  uncontractual   SGS   India   certificate   to  decide whether or not the goods were of the   contractual   description,   i.e.   Durum   wheat  Indian origin.\"\n43. Thus,   having   held   that   SGS   India   was  the contractual agency, the Board of Appeal  further   held   that   the   sellers   failed   to  establish that the SGS India certificate was   in   contractual   form.   Two   fundamental   flaws  in the certification by SGS India were noted   by   the   Board   of   Appeal,   one,   SGS   India's  certification did not follow the contractual   specified   mode   of   sampling   and   the   other,  the analysis done by SGS India was doubtful.   The   Board   of   Appeal   then   sifted   the  documentary   evidence   let   in   by   the   parties  and   finally   concluded   that   wheat   loaded   on  the   vessel   Haci   Resit   Kalkavan   was   soft  wheat and the sellers were in breach of the   description condition of the contract.\n44.   It   is   pertinent   to   state   that   the  sellers had challenged the award (no. 3782)  passed   by   the   Board   of   Appeal   in   the   High  Court   of   Justice   at   London.   The   three  decisions; (i)  Agroexport5  by Queen's Bench  Division, (ii)  Toepfer6  by Court of Appeal,  and (iii) Gill & Duffus7 by House of Lords,  were   holding   the   field   at   the   time   of  consideration of sellers' appeal by the High  Court of Justice at London. In  Agroexport  ,  it   has   been   held   that   an   award   founded   on  evidence   of   analysis   made   other   than   in  accordance with contract terms  cannot stand  and   deserves   to   be   set   aside   as   evidence  relied   upon   was   inadmissible.   The   Court   of  Appeal in  Toepfer  has laid down that where   seller   and   buyer   have   agreed   that   a  certificate at loading as to the quality of  goods   shall   be   final   and   binding   on   them,   the buyer will be precluded from recovering  HC-NIC Page 66 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER damages from the seller, even if, the person   giving the certificate has been negligent in   making it.  Toepfer  has been approved by the  House of Lords in  Gill & Duffus7. The High  Court of Justice at London can be assumed to  have   full   knowledge   of   the   legal   position  exposited in Agroexport5 , Toepfer6 and Gill  &   Duffus7  yet   it   found   no   ground   or  justification   for   setting   aside   the   award   (no. 3782) passed by the Board of Appeal. If  a ground supported by the decisions of that   country   was   not   good   enough   for   setting  aside the award by the court competent to do  so , a fortiori, such ground can hardly be a   good ground for refusing enforcement of the  award. Accordingly, we are not persuaded to  accept   the   submission   of   Mr.   Rohinton   F.  Nariman that Delhi High Court ought to have   refused to enforce the foreign awards as the   Board   of   Appeal   has   wrongly   rejected   the  certificate   of   quality   obtained   from   the  buyers'   nominated   certifying   agency   and  taken   into   consideration   inadmissible  evidence   in   the   nature   of   certificates   obtained by the buyers' for the purposes of  forwarding contract.\n43. Moreover,   Section   48   of   the   1996   Act  does   not   give   an   opportunity   to   have   a  'second   look'   at   the   foreign   award   in   the  award      enforcement   stage.   The   scope   of  inquiry   under   Section   48   does   not   permit  review   of   the   foreign   award   on   merits.  Procedural   defects   (like   taking   into  consideration   inadmissible   evidence   or  ignoring/rejecting the evidence which may be   of binding nature) in the course of foreign   arbitration   do   not   lead   necessarily   to   excuse   an   award   from   enforcement   on   the  ground of public policy.\n47. While considering the enforceability of  foreign awards, the court does not exercise  appellate   jurisdiction   over   the   foreign  award   nor   does   it   enquire   as   to   whether,  while   rendering   foreign   award,   some   error   HC-NIC Page 67 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER has   been   committed.   Under   Section   48(2)(b)  the   enforcement   of   a   foreign   award   can   be   refused only if such enforcement is found to   be   contrary   to   (1)   fundamental   policy   of  Indian law; or (2) the interests of India;   or   (3)   justice   or   morality.   The   objections  raised by the appellant do not fall in any  of   these   categories   and,   therefore,   the  foreign awards cannot be held to be contrary   to   public   policy   of   India   as   contemplated  under Section 48(2)(b).\n48.   The   contention   of   the   learned   senior  counsel for the appellant that the Board of  Appeal dealt with the questions not referred   to it and which were never in dispute and,  therefore,   these   awards   cannot   be   enforced  being contrary to Section 48(1)(c) is devoid   of   any   substance   and   is   noted   to   be  rejected.\"\n91. On the aforesaid aspects, learned counsel for the  petitioner   has   also   relied   upon   the   following  judgments of the Bombay High Court and Calcutta  High Court :  \n(i)  Jaldhi   Overseas   Pvt.   FZC   V.   Vinergy  International Private Ltd. [2016 SCC Online  Cal 2299]. \n(ii) Noble Resources Ltd. V. Twenty First Century  Wire Roads Ltd.

Shriram   EPC   Ltd.   &  Ors. [MANU/TN/0458/2017] HC-NIC Page 68 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER 92. Learned   counsel   for   the   respondents   has   also  relied   upon   the   judgment   passed   in   the   case   of  Hadley   Vs.   Baxendale   [156   Eng.   Rep.   145],  and  contended that as there was back to back contract  which was known to the parties, loss of profits  cannot be awarded as awarded by learned Tribunal.  Firstly,   the   said   aspect   touches   the   merits   of  the awards directly and therefore, it is beyond  the scope of inquiry that this Court is entitled  to make under Section 48 of the Act and secondly,  even   if   the   awards   in   question   are   considered,  there is finding of the fact that there was no  back to back contract and therefore, with respect  to   the   said   judgments,   the   same   will   have   no  application   to   the   facts   of   the   case   on   hand.  Learned   counsel   for   the   respondents   has   relied  upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case  of Union of India & Ors. Vs. Sugauli Sugar Works  (P) Ltd. [(1976) 93 SCC 32], and contended that,  in case of breach of contract, as far as possible  the   injured   party   should   be   placed   in   as   good  situation as if the contract had been performed  and while awarding damages by breach of contract,  the rule as to market price is intended to secure  only   an   indemnity   to   the   purchaser.   Even   this  aspect   would   touch   the   merits   of   the   awards   in  question   and   the   facts   of   that   case   were  different   and   distinct,   whereas   in   the   case   on  hand, the awards being governed by the provisions  of   UK   Sale   of   Goods   Act   with   respect   the  HC-NIC Page 69 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER aforesaid judgment would not be applicable to the  present case. \n93. Similarly,   learned   counsel   for   the   respondents  has also relied upon the judgment rendered in the  case   of  Messrs.   Trojan   &   Company   Vs.   RM.  N.N.Nagappa   Chettiar   [AIR   1953   SC   235]  and has  contended   that   in   case   of   breach   of   contract,  measure of damages cannot be the amount of loss  ultimately  sustained  by  the  represented.  In  the  case on hand, as stated hereinabove, the parties  had agreed for applicability of English law and  the   issues   of   quantum   of   damages   that   were  awarded   by   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   would   not  only   touch   the   merits   of   the   awards,   but   the  awards   are   passed   as   per   the   law   applicable   in  England   and   therefore,   the   aforesaid   judgment  also would not render any assistance to the case  of the respondents. \n94. Learned   counsel   for   the   respondents   has   also  relied   upon   the   judgment   of   Apex   Court   in   the  case of  Murlidhar  Chiranjilal  Vs.  Harishchandra  Dwarkadas   &   Anr.  [AIR   1962   SC   366]  and   has  contended that there is breach of Sections 73 and  74   of   the   Indian   Contract   Act,   as   already   held  above,   the   case   on   hand   is   for   enforcement   of  foreign award and even if, there is any alleged  breach of Indian Law, the same would not amount  to contravention of fundamental policy of Indian  Law and hence, the said judgment would also not  HC-NIC Page 70 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER apply to the facts of the present case. \n95. The   respondents   have   also   relied   upon   the  judgment   of   the   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  Associate   Builders   (supra),   wherein   the   Apex  Court while considering the aspect of fundamental  policy of Indian Law, interest of India, justice  and   morality   and   patently   illegal   i.e  contravention   of   substantial   law   of   India   and  contravention   of   arbitration   and   Conciliation  Act,   1996   and   contravention   of   terms   of   the  contract , has observed thus: \n27. Coming   to   each   of   the   heads   contained   in   the   Saw   Pipes   judgment,   we   will   first  deal   with   the   head   \"fundamental   policy   of  Indian Law\".  It has already been seen from   the Renusagar judgment that violation of the  Foreign Exchange Act and disregarding orders  of   superior   courts   in   India   would   be  regarded   as   being   contrary   to   the  fundamental policy of Indian law. To this it  could   be   added   that   the   binding   effect   of  the   judgment   of   a   superior   court   being  disregarded   would   be   equally   violative   of  the fundamental policy of Indian law.\n28. In   a   recent   judgment,  ONGC   Ltd.   v.  Western   Geco   International   Ltd.,   2014   (9)  SCC   263,   this   Court   added   three   other  distinct and fundamental juristic principles  which   must   be   understood   as   a   part   and   parcel   of   the   fundamental   policy   of   Indian  law. The Court held \"35.  What   then   would   constitute   the  \"fundamental policy of Indian law\" is the  question . The decision in ONGC [ONGC Ltd.  v. Saw Pipes Ltd., (2003) 5 SCC 705] does   not   elaborate   that   aspect.   Even   so,   the  expression must, in our opinion, include  all   such   fundamental   principles   as  HC-NIC Page 71 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER providing   a   basis   for   administration   of  justice   and   enforcement   of   law   in   this  country.   Without   meaning   to   exhaustively  enumerate   the   purport   of   the   expression  \"fundamental   policy   of   Indian   law\",   we  may   refer   to   three   distinct   and   fundamental juristic principles that must  necessarily   be   understood   as   a   part   and  parcel   of   the   fundamental   policy   of  Indian law. The first and foremost is the   principle   that   in   every   determination  whether   by   a   court   or   other   authority  that   affects  the   rights   of   a  citizen  or  leads   to   any   civil   consequences,   the  court or authority concerned is bound to  adopt what is in legal parlance called a  \"judicial   approach\"   in   the   matter.   The  duty to adopt a judicial approach arises  from   the   very   nature   of   the   power  exercised   by   the   court   or   the   authority  does   not   have   to   be   separately   or  additionally   enjoined   upon   the   fora  concerned.   What   must   be   remembered   is  that   the   importance   of   a   judicial  approach   in   judicial   and   quasijudicial  determination   lies   in   the   fact   that   so  long   as   the   court,   tribunal   or   the   authority   exercising   powers   that   affect  the rights or obligations of the parties  before   them   shows   fidelity   to   judicial  approach,   they   cannot   act   in   an  arbitrary,   capricious   or   whimsical  manner.   Judicial   approach   ensures   that  the   authority   acts   bona   fide   and   deals  with   the   subject   in   a   fair,   reasonable  and   objective   manner   and   that   its  decision   is   not   actuated   by   any  extraneous   consideration.   Judicial  approach   in   that   sense   acts   as   a   check  against flaws and faults that can render  the   decision   of   a   court,   tribunal   or  authority vulnerable to challenge. \n38.  Equally   important   and   indeed  fundamental   to   the   policy   of   Indian   law  is the principle that a court and so also   HC-NIC Page 72 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER a   quasijudicial   authority   must,   while  determining the rights and obligations of  parties   before   it,   do   so   in   accordance  with   the   principles   of   natural   justice.  Besides   the   celebrated   audi   alteram  partem   rule   one   of   the   facets   of   the  principles of natural justice is that the  court/authority   deciding   the   matter   must  apply its mind to the attendant facts and  circumstances while taking a view one way  or the other. Nonapplication of mind is  a   defect   that   is   fatal   to   any  adjudication. Application of mind is best  demonstrated   by   disclosure   of   the   mind  and   disclosure   of   mind   is   best   done   by  recording   reasons   in   support   of   the  decision which the court or authority is  taking.   The   requirement   that   an  adjudicatory   authority   must   apply   its  mind is, in that view, so deeply embedded  in   our   jurisprudence   that   it   can   be  described   as   a   fundamental   policy   of   Indian law.\n39. No less important is the principle  now   recognised   as   a   salutary   juristic  fundamental in administrative law that a  decision   which   is   perverse   or   so   irrational   that   no   reasonable   person  would   have   arrived   at   the   same   will   not  be   sustained   in   a   court   of   law. \nPerversity   or   irrationality   of   decisions  is tested on the touchstone of Wednesbury  principle   [Associated   Provincial   Picture  Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corpn., (1948)  1   KB   223:   (1947)   2   All   ER   680   (CA)]   of  reasonableness. Decisions that fall short  of   the   standards   of   reasonableness   are   open to challenge in a court of law often   in   writ   jurisdiction   of   the   superior  courts but no less in statutory processes  wherever the same are available. \n40. It is neither necessary nor proper  for   us   to   attempt   an   exhaustive  enumeration of what would constitute the  fundamental   policy   of   Indian   law   nor   is   HC-NIC Page 73 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER it   possible   to   place   the   expression   in  the straitjacket of a definition. What is   important in the context of the case at  hand   is   that   if   on   facts   proved   before  them   the   arbitrators   fail   to   draw   an  inference which ought to have been drawn  or if they have drawn an inference which  is on the face of it, untenable resulting   in   miscarriage   of   justice,   the  adjudication   even   when   made   by   an   Arbitral   Tribunal   that   enjoys  considerable   latitude   and   play   at   the  joints in making awards will be open to  challenge   and   may   be   cast   away   or  modified   depending   upon   whether   the  offending   part   is   or   is   not   severable   from the rest.\" \n29. It is clear that the juristic principle  of   a   \"judicial   approach\"   demands   that   a  decision be fair, reasonable and objective.  On the obverse side, anything arbitrary and  whimsical   would   obviously   not   be   a  determination   which   would   either   be   fair,  reasonable or objective.\nInterest of India 35. The next ground on which an award may   be set aside is that it is contrary to the  interest of India. Obviously, this concerns  itself with India as a member of the world  community   in   its   relations   with   foreign   powers. As at present advised, we need not  dilate   on   this   aspect   as   this   ground   may  need to evolve on a case by case basis. \nJustice 36. The   third   ground   of   public   policy   is,  if an award is against justice or morality.  These are two different concepts in law. An  award   can   be   said     to   be   against   justice  only   when   it   shocks   the   conscience   of   the  court. An illustration of this can be given.  A claimant  is content with restricting his  claim,   let   us   say   to   Rs.   30   lakhs   in   a  statement of claim before the arbitrator and  HC-NIC Page 74 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER at no point does he seek to claim anything  more.   The   arbitral   award   ultimately   awards   him 45 lakhs without any acceptable reason  or   justification.   Obviously,   this   would  shock   the   conscience   of   the   court   and   the  arbitral   award   would   be   liable   to   be   set  aside on the ground that it is contrary to  \"justice\". \nMorality 37. The other ground is of \"morality\". Just  as   the   expression   \"public   policy\"   also  occurs in Section 23 of the Indian Contract  Act, so does the expression \"morality\". Two  illustrations   to   the   said   section   are  interesting for they explain to us the scope  of the expression \"morality\". \n\"(j)   A,   who   is   B's   Mukhtar,   promises   to  exercise his influence, as such, with B in  favour   of   C,   and   C   promises   to   pay   1,000  rupees to A. The agreement is void, because  it   is   immoral.   (k)   A   agrees   to   let   her   daughter to hire to B for concubinage. The  agreement   is   void,   because   it   is   immoral,   though   the   letting   may   not   be   punishable  under the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860).\" \n39.   This   Court   has   confined   morality   to  sexual morality so far as section 23 of the   Contract   Act   is   concerned,   which   in   the  context of an arbitral award would mean the  enforcement   of   an   award   say   for   specific   performance   of   a   contract   involving  prostitution. \"Morality\" would, if it is to  go beyond sexual morality necessarily cover  such agreements as are not illegal but would  not be enforced given the prevailing mores  of   the   day.   However,   interference   on   this   ground   would   also   be   only   if   something   shocks the court's conscience.\" \n96. At the outset, it deserves to be noted that in  the case of Associates Builders (supra), the case  before the Apex Court was of domestic award and  the Apex Court has examined the aspect of award,  which was contrary to the fundamental policy of  HC-NIC Page 75 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER Indian Law or contrary to the Interest of India,  contrary to Justice or Morality or was Patently  Illegal as provided under Section 34 of the Act,  wherein the scope is wider than Section 48 of the  Act. It is not the case of the respondents that,  the  impugned  awards  are  passed  disregarding   the  order   of   Superior   Court   in   India.   As   per   the  facts revealed in the instant case, the parties  had agreed to the applicability of English law.  All   the   parties   were   heard   before   the   Arbitral  Tribunal   as   well   as   the   appellate   Board   and   in  fact,  the  respondents  carried  the  order  further  before   the   Superior   Courts   in   England   and   have  failed.   It   is   also   not   the   case   of   the  respondents that principle of audi alteram partem  has   been   breached.   As   held   hereinabove,   in  inquiry   under   Section   48   of   the   Act   read   with  Explanations 1 and 2 to Section 48 of the Act,  the respondents have failed to establish that the  awards are in  contravention with the fundamental  policy of the Indian Law or that the same is in  conflict   with   basic   notion   of   morality   or  justice.   Explanation   2   of   Section   48   plays   a  vital role and is an important aspect which has  to be borne in mind by this Court while examining  the foreign awards at the stage of enforcement.  Thus, all the parties were heard at every stage,  more particularly the respondents cannot make any  grievance   that   any   ex   parte   award   is   passed   at  any stage and therefore, considering Explanation  2 to Section 48(2) of the Act, this Court cannot  HC-NIC Page 76 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER entail any inquiry into the review on the merits  of   the   dispute   and   as   stated   earlier,   the   Apex  Court in the case of Associates Builders (supra)  has examined the domestic awards. \n97. In   light   of   the   aforesaid   provisions   of   law  applicable i.e. UK Sale of Goods Act, even if the  principle as held by the Apex Court in the case  of  Associates  Builder  (supra),  are applied, the  grounds   raised   by   the   respondents   do   not  constitute   even   remotely   that   there   is   any  contravention to the fundamental policy of India  or there is basic notion of morality or justice. \n98. Hypothetical   example   which   was   relied   upon   by  learned counsel for the respondents may be good  when Indian Law is to be applied and therefore,  in the instant case, it cannot be said that the  impugned   awards   are   against   public   policy   of  India or that they are against the principles of  morality and justice. \n99. In the facts of this case, it cannot be said that  the   awards   are   such   that   it   would   shock   the  conscience of the Court and the parties are bound  by the agreement and the aspect whether it shocks  conscience of the Court depends on the facts of  each   case   and   when   the   parties   had   agreed   for  applicability   of   English   Law   and   Arbitration  under the GAFTA Rules at London, the contention  that   the   award   is   punitive   award   cannot   now   be  considered   under   Section   48   of   the   Act.   The  HC-NIC Page 77 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER parties   were   aware   about   the   provisions   of  Section 51(1) and 51(3) of UK sale of Goods act  which   has   been   considered   by   learned   Arbitral  Tribunal.\n100. Learned counsel for the respondent has also  relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the  case   of  Oil   &   natural   Gas   Corporation   Ltd.,  [(2003)   5   SCC   705],  wherein the Apex Court has  observed thus:  \"12. Hence, the jurisdiction or the power of  the   Arbitral   Tribunal   is   prescribed   under  the Act and if the award is dehors the said  provisions, it would be, on the face of it,   illegal. The decision of the Tribunal  must  be   within   the   bounds   of   its   jurisdiction   conferred under the Act or the contract. In  exercising   jurisdiction,   the   Arbitral  Tribunal   cannot   act   in   breach   of   some  provision   of   substantive   law   or   the   provisions of the Act.\n13. The question, therefore, which requires  consideration is whether the award could be  set aside, if the Arbitral Tribunal has not  followed the mandatory procedure prescribed  under S. 24, 28 or 31(3), which affects the   rights of the parties? Under subsection (1)\n(a)   of   S.   28   there   is   a   mandate   to   the  Arbitral Tribunal to decide the dispute in  accordance with the substantive law for the  time   being   in   force   in   India.   Admittedly,  substantive   law   would   include   the   Indian  Contract Act,  the Transfer of Property Act  and   other   such   laws   in   force.   Suppose,   if  the   award   is   passed   in   violation   of   the   provisions of  the Transfer of Property Act  or in violation of the Indian Contract Act,  the question would be  whether such award  could   be   set   aside?   Similarly,   under   sub section   (3),   Arbitral   Tribunal   is   directed   HC-NIC Page 78 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER to decide the dispute in accordance with the  terms of the contract and also after taking  into   account   the   usage   of   the   trade  applicable   to   the   transaction.   If   Arbitral   Tribunal ignores  the terms of the contract  or   usage   of   the   trade   applicable   to   the   transaction, whether the said award could be  interfered? Similarly, if the award is non speaking   one   and   is   in   violation   of   S.  31(3), can such award be set aside? In our  view,   reading   S.   34   conjointly   with   other  provisions of the Act, it appears that the  legislative intent could not be that if the  award is in contravention of the provisions  of   the   Act,   still   however,   it   couldn't   be  set aside by the Court. If it is held that  such award could not be interfered, it would  be contrary to basic concept of justice. If  the Arbitral Tribunal has  not followed the  mandatory   procedure   prescribed   under   the  Act, it would mean that it has acted beyond   its jurisdiction and thereby the award would  be patently illegal which could be set aside  under S. 34. \n15. Result is  if the award is contrary to   the   substantive   provisions   of   law   or   the  provisions of the Act or against the terms  of   the   contract,   it   would   be   patently  illegal, which could be interfered under S. \n34.   However,   such   failure   of   procedure  should be patent affecting the rights of the  parties. \n16.   The   next   clause   which   requires  interpretation   is   Cl.   (ii)   of   subsection  (2)(b)   of   S.   34   which   inter   alia   provides  that the Court may set aside arbitral award  if it is in conflict with the 'Public Policy   of   India.'   The   phrase   'Public   Policy   of  India' is not defined under the Act. Hence,  the   said   term   is   required   to   be   given  meaning in context and also considering the  purpose   of   the   section   and   scheme   of   the  Act.   It   has   been   repeatedly   stated   by  various   authorities   that   the   expression  'public   policy'   does   not   admit   of   precise  HC-NIC Page 79 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER definition and may vary from generation to  generation and from time to time. Hence, the  concept 'public policy' is considered to be  vague,   susceptible   to   narrow   or   wider  meaning depending upon the context in which  it is used. Lacking precedent the Court has  to   give   its   meaning   in   the   light   and   principles   underlying   the   Arbitration   Act,  Contract Act and constitutional provisions.\n18. Further, in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v.  General   Electric   Co.   (1994   Supp   (1)   SCC  644), this Court considered S. 7(1) of the  Arbitration   (Protocol   and   Convention)   Act,  1937   which   inter   alia   provided   that   a  foreign award may not be enforced under the  said Act, if the Court dealing with the case  is   satisfied   that   the   enforcement   of   the  award will be contrary to the public policy.  After   elaborate   discussion,   the   Court  arrived at the conclusion that public policy  comprehended   in   S.   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the  Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement)  Act,   1961   is   the   'Public   Policy   of   India'  and does not cover the public policy of any   other   country.   For   giving   meaning   to   the  term   'Public   Policy,'   the   Court   observed  thus : \"66.   Article   5(2)(b)   of   the   New   York   Convention of 1958 and S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the  Foreign Awards Act do not postulate refusal  of recognition and enforcement of a foreign  award on the ground that it is contrary to  the   law   of   the   country   of   enforcement   and  the ground of challenge is confined to the  recognition   and   enforcement   being   contrary  to the public policy of the country in which   the   award   is   set   to   be   enforced.   There   is  nothing   to   indicate   that   the   expression   \"public policy\" in Art. 5(2)(b) of the New  York   Convention   and   S.   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the  Foreign Awards Act is not used in the same  sense in which it was used in Art. 1(c) of  the Geneva Convention of 1927 and S. 7(1) of  the   Protocol   and   Convention   Act   of   1937.  This would mean that \"public policy\" in S.  HC-NIC Page 80 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER 7(1)(b)(ii)   has   been   used   in   a   narrower  sense   and   in   order   to   attract   to   bar   of   public policy  the enforcement of the award  must   invoke   something   more   than   the   violation   of   the   law   of   India.   Since   the  Foreign   Awards   Act   is   concerned   with   recognition   and   enforcement   of   foreign  awards which are governed by the principles  of private international law, the expression  \"public   policy\"   in   S.   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the  Foreign   Awards   Act   must   necessarily   be  construed   in   the   sense   the   doctrine   of   public   policy   is   applied   in   the   field   of  private international law. Applying the said  criteria   it   must   be   held   that   the  enforcement   of   a   foreign   award   would   be  refused on the ground that it is contrary to   public policy  if such enforcement would be  contrary to (i) fundamental policy of Indian  law;   or   (ii)   the   interests   of   India;   or   (iii) justice or morality.\" \n18. The Court finally held that : \"76. Keeping in view the aforesaid  objects  underlying FERA and the principles governing  enforcement   of   exchange   control   laws  followed in other countries, we are of the  view that the provisions contained in  FERA  have been enacted to safeguard the economic  interests of India and any violation of the  said   provisions   would   be   contrary   to   the  public   policy   of   India   as   envisaged   in   S.  7(1)(b)(ii) of the Act.\"\n20.   Mr.   Desai   submitted   that   the   narrow  meaning given to the term 'public policy' in  Renusagar's case is in context of the fact  that   the   question   involved   in   the   said   matter was with regard to the execution of  the   award   which   had   attained   finality.   It  was not a case where validity of the award  is   challenged   before   a   forum   prescribed   under the Act. He submitted that the scheme  of S. 34 which deals with setting aside the   domestic   arbitral   award   and   S.   48   which  deals with enforcement of foreign award are  HC-NIC Page 81 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER not identical. A foreign award by definition  is   subject   to   double   exequatur.   This   is  recognised inter alia by S. 48(1) and there  is no parallel provision to this clause in  S. 34. For this, he referred to Lord Mustill  and   Stewart   C.   Boyd   QC's   \"Commercial   Arbitration\" 2001 wherein (at page 90) it is  stated as under : \"Mutual   recognition   of   awards   is   the   glue  which   holds   the   international   arbitrating  community   together,   and   this   will   only   be  strong if the enforcing Court is willing to  trust, as the convention assumes that  they  will   trust,   the   supervising   authorities   of   the chosen venue. It follows that if, and to  the   extent   that   the   award   has   been   struck  down   in   the   local   Court   it   should   be   a   matter   of   theory   and   practice   be   treated   when   enforcement   is   sought   as   if   to   the   extent it did not exist.\"\n21.   He   further   submitted   that   in   foreign   arbitration, the  award would  be subject to  being   set   aside   or   suspended   by   the  competent   authority   under   the   relevant   law   of   that   country   whereas   in   the   domestic  arbitration the only recourse is to S. 34. The   aforesaid   submission   of   the   learned   senior counsel requires to be accepted. From  the   judgments   discussed   above,   it   can   be  held that the term 'public policy of India'  is required to be interpreted in the context  of the jurisdiction of the Court where the  validity   of   award   is   challenged   before   it   becomes final and executable. The concept of  enforcement   of   the   award   after   it   becomes  final is different and  the jurisdiction of  the   Court   at   that   stage   could   be   limited.  Similar is the position with regard to the  execution of a decree. It is settled law as   well as it is provided under Code of Civil  Procedure that once the decree has attained  finality, in an execution proceeding, it may  be challenged  only on limited grounds  such  as the decree being without jurisdiction or  HC-NIC Page 82 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER nullity.   But   in   a   case   where   the   judgment  and   decree   is   challenged   before   the   appellate   Court   or   the   Court   exercising   revisional jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of  such Court would be wider. Therefore, in a  case   where   the   validity   of   award   is  challenged there is no necessity of giving a  narrower meaning to the term 'public policy  of India.' On the contrary, wider meaning is  required to be given so that the 'patently  illegal   award'   passed   by   the   Arbitral  Tribunal   could   be   set   aside.   If   narrow   meaning as  contended by the learned senior  counsel   Mr.   Dave   is   given,   some   of   the  provisions   of   the   Arbitration   Act   would   become   nugatory.   Take   for   illustration   a  case wherein there is a specific provision  in the contract that for delayed payment of  the   amount   due   and   payable,   no   interest  would   be   payable,   still   however,   if   the  arbitrator   has   passed   an   award   granting   interest, it would be against the terms of  the   contract   and   thereby   against   the   provision   of   S.   28(3)   of   the   Act   which  specifically   provides   that   \"Arbitral  Tribunal shall decide in accordance with the  terms of the contract.\" Further, where there  is a specific usage of the trade that if the  payment   is   made   beyond   a   period   of   one  month, then the party would be required to  pay   the   said   amount   with   interest   at   the  rate   of   15   per   cent.   Despite   the   evidence  being produced on record for such usage, if  the   arbitrator   refuses   to   grant   such   interest on the ground of equity, such award  would also  be in  violation of subsections  (2)   and   (3)   of   S.   28.   Section   28(2)  specifically provides that arbitrator shall  decide ex aequo et bono (according to what  is just and good) only if the parties have  expressly   authorised   him   to   do   so.  Similarly, if the award is patently against  the statutory provisions of substantive law  which   is   in   force   in   India   or   is   passed   without giving an opportunity of hearing to  the   parties   as   provided   under   S.   24   or   HC-NIC Page 83 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER without   giving   any   reason   in   a   case   where  parties have not agreed that no reasons are  to   be   recorded,   it   would   be   against   the   statutory provisions. In all such cases, the  award   is   required   to   be   set   aside   on   the  ground of 'patent illegality.\"\n101. In the above cited judgment, the Apex Court  has considered the aspect relating to enforcement  of domestic award as provided under Section 34 of  the   Act   and   hence,   the   same   would   not   be  applicable to the case on hand. \n102. Learned counsel for the respondents has also  placed reliance on the following judgments : \n(i)   Central   Inland   Water   Transport   Corporation  Limited   &   Anr.   Vs.

Thus,   having   agreed   to   the   applicability   of  English   law   and   the   learned   Tribunal   having  applied the provisions of UK Sale of Goods Act as  well as GAFTA Rules, the same would not mean that  there is any contravention of fundamental policy  of India and as the facts unfold from the record  of the petitions, admittedly the awards have been  upheld   by   the   Appellate   Board   as   well   as   the  Courts in England. \nHC-NIC                              Page 84 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017                    O/IAAP/2/2017                                           ORDER 104. This   group   of   petitions   are   considered   at   this  stage to determine whether the awards in question  are enforceable and whether the awards are deemed  to   be   decree   by   this   Court   as   provided   under  Section 49 of the Act. As far as this aspect is  concerned,  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  have  contended   that   the   aforesaid   first   part   may   be  decided   first   by   this   Court   and   accordingly,  following the ratio laid down by the Apex Court  in   the   case   of  Fuerst   Day   Lawson   Ltd.(supra),  keeping the petitions pending, by this order only  1st part, viz., whether the awards in question are  deemed   to   be   decree   of   this   Court   or   not   as  provided under the Act is hereby decided. \n105. While   considering   the   jurisdiction   of   the  Executing Court to execute the foreign awards as  provided   under   Section   7   (1)(b)(ii)   of   the  Foreign Awards Act, the Apex Court has held that  objections about unjust enrichment may relate to  the   merits   of   the   award,   which   is   beyond   the  scope of the objections that can be raised under  Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act and  it has been accordingly held that such course is  not permissible under the New York Convention and  under   the   Foreign   Awards   Act.   Provisions   of  Section 48 of the Act materially corresponds to  Section 7 of the Foreign Awards Act. In the case  on   hand   also,   the   parties   agreed   for  applicability   of   English   Law   and   Arbitration  HC-NIC Page 85 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER under   the   GAFTA   Rules   at   London.   The   awards  clearly postulate that the Arbitral Tribunal and  the Appellate Board have granted damages as per  the   provisions   of   UK   Sale   of   Goods   Act   while  interpreting Sections 51(1) and 51 (3) of the UK  Sale of Goods Act and therefore, the contention  raised   by   the   respondents   that   the   damages  awarded by learned Tribunal is more than actual  loss   and   therefore,   the   same   would   amount   to  unjust   enrichment,   which   in   turn   would   be   in  contravention   of   the   fundamental   policy   of   the  Indian Law and would mean that this Court has to  go into the merits of the awards with regard to  quantum awarded by  learned Arbitral Tribunal and  following the ratio laid down by the Apex Court  in the case of Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. (supra),  the same would be beyond the scope. \n106. In the case on hand, it is an admitted position  that   the   petitions   relate   to   foreign   awards,  which   have   attained   finality   under   the   English  Law. Thus, as held by the Apex Court in the case  of   Shri   Lal   Mahal   Limited   (supra)   and   more  particularly, even after amendment of 2015, scope  of inquiry is very limited on the aspect that it  is in contravention of the fundamental policy of  the   Indian   Law   or   that   it   is   in   conflict   with  public law and this Court cannot entail review on  merits into the dispute. The contention raised by  the respondents in opinion of this Court, would  amount to inquiry into the merits. It is not the  HC-NIC Page 86 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER case   of   the   respondents   that   the   awards   in  question were induced by fraud or corruption or  is violative of Sections 75 and 84 of the Act. It  is   an   admitted   position   that   the   parties   had  agreed for applicability of English law and all  Appellate  authorities  and  the  Courts  in  England  have   upheld   the   awards   inorigin   passed   by   the  Arbitral Tribunal as well as the Appellate Board  and therefore, considering the ratio laid down by  the   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  Shri   Lal   Mahal  Limited   (supra),  read   with   explanation   2   of  Section 48 even in limited scope of inquiry, in  the facts of the case, none of the grounds raised  by   the   respondents   would   establish   that   the  awards in question are in contravention with the  fundamental policy of the Indian law. \n107. Following   the   ratio   laid   down   by   the   Hon'ble  Supreme   Court,   Bombay   High   Court   and   Calcutta  High Court, scope of inquiry under Section 48 of  the   Act   is   very   limited   and   this   Court   cannot  adjudicate   upon   the   merits   of   the   case   or   to  review the findings on merits rendered by learned  Arbitral   Tribunal   as   well   as   the   Courts   in  England. \n108. Considering   the   facts   of   the   case   on   hand,  learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   as   well   as   the  Appellate Board after hearing all the parties and  after   considering   applicable   law,   more  particularly   provisions   of   Section   51(1)   and  51(3) of the UK Sale of Goods Act, have passed  HC-NIC Page 87 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the awards. Following the ratio laid down by the  Apex Court in the cases of Shri Lal Mahal Limited  (supra), as well as the judgment of Bombay High  Court and Culcutta High Court as referred above,  section   48   of   the   Act   does   not   give   additional  opportunity   to   have   second   look   of   the   foreign  award, at the stage of enforcing of the foreign  award and this Court, therefore, is not empowered  to look into the aspect whether the provisions of  Section 51(2) or Section 51 (3) of the UK Sale of  Goods   Act   would   apply   and   on   that   count,   it  cannot   be   gainsaid   that   the  same   is   in  contravention with the fundamental policy of the  Indian Law or that it is against the morality and  also that the same would shock the conscience of  this Court. \n109. Considering the contention of learned counsel for  the respondents that the impugned awards are in  breach   of   Sections   73   and   74   of   the   Indian  Contract Act and therefore, the same would amount  to contravention of fundamental policy of Indian  Law, deserves to be negatived. At this stage, it  would be appropriate to refer to the judgment of  the Delhi High Court rendered in the case of Cruz  City Mauritius Holdings Vs. Unitech Ltd., [2017  SCC   Online   Del   7810],   wherein   it   has   observed  thus: \"96. It plainly follows from the above that  a   contravention   of   a   provision   of   law   is  insufficient to invoke the defence of public  HC-NIC Page 88 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER policy when it becomes to enforcement of a  foreign   award.   Contravention   of   any  provision of an enactment is not synonymous  to   contravention   of   fundamental   policy   of  Indian   Law.   The   expression   fundamental  policy   of   Indian   laws   refers   to   the  principles   and   the   legislative   policy   of  which Indian statutes and laws are founded.  The expression \"fundamental policy\" connotes   the basic and substratal rationable, values   and   principles   whcih   form   the   bedrock   of  laws in our country.\n97. It is necessary to bear in mind that a  foreign award may be based on foreign law,  which   may   be   at   variance   with   a  corresponding   Indian   statute.   And,   if   the  expression   \"fundamental   policy   of   Indian  law\"   is   considered   as   a   reference   to   a  provision of the Indian statue, as is sought  to   be   contended   on   behalf   of   Unitech,   the  basic purpose of the New York Convention to  enforce   foreign   awards   would   stand  frustrated.   One   of   the   principal   objective  of   the   New   York   Convention   is   to   ensure  enforcement   of   awards   notwithstanding   that  the awards are not rendered in conformity to  the   national   laws.   Thus,   the   objections   to  enforcement  on  the   ground   of   public  policy  must be such that offend the core values of   a   member  state's   national   policy  and   which  it   cannot   be   expected   to   compromise.   The  expression \"fundamental policy of law\" must  be interpreted in that perspective and must  mean   only   the   fundamental   and   substratal  legislative   policy   and   not   a   provision   of  any enactment. \n99. The   explanations   to   section   48(2)   of  the   Act   as   amended   introduced   by   the  Arbitration   adn   Conciliation   (Amendment)  Act,   2015   have   brought   about   a   material  change and further narrowed the scope of the  public policy defence: first, explanation 1  has sought to replace the inclusive scope of  the preamendment provision by an exhaustive  HC-NIC Page 89 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER one; second, interest of India is no longer   included in the scope of public policy; and   third,   it   has   been   expressly   provided,  although   the   same   was   authoritatively  settled   by   the   Supreme   Court   in   Renusagar  Power Co.  Ltd. V. Central Electric Co. That   examiantion   of   whether   the   arbitral   award  offends   the   Fundamental   policy   of   Indian   Law, does not entail a review on merits.\"\n110. Considering the provisions of Section 28(1)(b)(1)  of the Act and the facts of the case on hand, the  parties had agreed that the arbitration would be  as   per   the   GAFTA   rules   and   the   seat   of  arbitration   would   be   at   London   and   the   parties  had also agreed that the English law would apply,  now cannot be permitted to argue again on merits  as is sought to be done indirectly by contending  that the impugned awards are in contravention of  fundamental policy of the Indian Law and morality  and that the same would shock the conscience of  the   Court   on   the   grounds   that   are   contended   by  the   respondents,   more   particularly   the   ground  that   there   is   violation   of   the   provisions   of  Sections   73   and   74   of   the   Indian   Contract   Act.  The parties to the contract were aware about the  contracts   and   the   date   on   which   the   contracts  were   entered   between   the   parties   and   that   they  have   agreed   to   be   governed   by   English   law   and  learned Tribunal having applied the provisions of  UK   Sale   of   Goods   Act,   which   have   attained  finality  in  the  learned  Tribunal,  the   Appellate  Board as well as the Courts in England, the same  cannot be now reexamined on merits by contending  HC-NIC Page 90 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER that   it   is   violative   of   fundamental   policy   of  Indian Law and morality.\n111. Thus, in the case on hand, only because learned  Arbitral Tribunal while applying Section 51(3) of  the UK Sale of Goods Act has awarded a particular  quantum of amount, mere violation of Sections 73  and   74   of   the   Indian   Contract   Act,   therefore,  would not amount to contravention of  fundamental  policy of the Indian Law. \n112. In  light  of  the  aforesaid  contention  therefore,  for examining whether it is in contravention with  the fundamental policy of Indian law, it deserves  to be noted at the outset that by Explanation 2,  which   is   inserted/substituted   by   Act   3   of   2016  w.e.f.   23.10.2015   clearly   postulates   that   such  inquiry   is   very   narrow   and   the   same   shall   not  entail a review on merits of the dispute and it  carries   a   narrow   meaning   in   comparison   to   the  provisions of section 34(2)(b) of the Act.\n113. Government   of   India   in   the   publication   titled  Legal   Glossary   prepared   by   Ministry   of   Law   &  Company   Affairs,   in   1983   Edition   has   defined  expression   \"Public   Policy\"   as   principles   in  accordance   with   which   action   of   men   and  commodities need to be regulated to achieve the  good of entire community or public.   (Reference  to  law  relating  to  Arbitration  and   Conciliation  by Dr. P.C. Markanda, 9th edition). \nHC-NIC                            Page 91 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017                   O /IAAP/2/2017                                            ORDER 114. Again, referring to the facts which arise in this  group   of   petitions,   the   parties   entered   into   a  contract for supply of Indian Rapeseed Meal and  have   determined   and   selected   appropriate   law,  i.e., the parties have agreed for arbitration and  has also agreed for applicability of English law.  The   parties   participated   in   arbitration  proceedings   which  culminated   into   an   award   by  arbitral board and confirmed in appeal under the  GAFTA   Rules   and   the   leave   to   appeal   was   not  granted.     Having   accepted   the   applicability   of  English   law,   the   awards   are   based   on   the  provisions of English law, i.e., UK Sale of Goods  Act. The contention that the actual loss is less  than   the   damages   which   is   awarded   by   the  arbitrator   is   a   matter   of   fact   and   the   merits  which are considered by the arbitrator as per the  English   law   and   further   by   the   English   courts  taking  into  consideration  the  provisions  of  the  UK Sale of Goods Act.  Therefore, the contention  that the awards in question are in contravention  with   section   73   of   the   Contract   Act   would   not  take   the   case   of   the   respondents   any   further.  Considering   the   binding   decision   of   the   Apex  Court in the case of Renu Sagar (supra) and Shri  Lal Mahal Ltd. (supra), the award of damages as  per   the   English   Law   and   the   applicability   of  section   51(3)   of   the   UK   Sale   of   Goods   Act   is  entirely in the arena of the merits of the award  and the same cannot be reopened, reexamined or  reappreciated by this Court.\nHC-NIC                             Page 92 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017                  O/IAAP/2/2017                                            ORDER 115. Having   agreed   to   the   applicability   of   a  particular   law   under   English   law   and   having  participated in the proceedings, the same cannot  be   reopened   by   this   Court   while   deciding   the  issue under sections 47, 48 and 49 of the Act at  the instance of the respondents and following the  explanation 2 of section 48 therefore, even while  examining   the   aspect   whether   the   awards   are   in  contravention   with   the   fundamental   policy   of  India, the same shall not entail a review on the  merits of the dispute.  It is not the case of the  respondents   that   the   contracts   entered   into  between the parties were against any Indian law  or was in contravention of the fundamental policy  of Indian Law, neither there is any other breach  of Indian law for entering into such contracts.  In   opinion   of   this   Court,   the   contracts   were  entered   into   between   the   respondents   who   are  Indian   suppliers   and   the   petitioner   who   was   a  foreign   buyer,   which   is   legal   and   proper.   Both  the   parties   agreed   that   the   English   law   would  apply   and   though   the   transaction   of   contract  cannot be examined by this Court, suffice it to  say   that   such   contracts   did   not   contravene   any  other   law   as   applicable   in   India   or   any  fundamental   policy   of   Indian   law.     In   facts   of  the case, it cannot be said that enforcement of  the awards would be injury to the public good or  possibly,   that   enforcement   would   be   wholly  offensive   to   the   ordinary/reasonable   and   fully  HC-NIC Page 93 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER informed member of the public.\n116. Therefore   on   the   grounds   which   are   raised   to  buttress the contention that the impugned awards  are against the fundamental policy of Indian law,  more or less touches the merits of the award and  enforcement of the award cannot be denied merely  on   the   alleged   ground   that   it   is   against   the  provisions of section 73 of Indian Contract Act.  Even the contention that inspite of actual  loss  occurred,   a   sum   of   Rs.   13   Million   dollars   is  awarded   for   9   contracts   is   based   upon   the  applicability  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  UK   Sale   of   Goods   Act,   which   was   agreed   by   the  parties to be made applicable and on such ground,  it cannot be said that the impugned awards are in  any way violative of fundamental policy of Indian  law.  It is not the case of the respondents that  the enforcement of the awards would result into  breach   of   any   public   policy   of   India   and  therefore,   the   contention   raised   by   the  respondents to say that the impugned awards are  against   the   fundamental   policy   of   Indian   law  deserves   to   be   negatived.     Even   examining   the  other limb of argument that the impugned awards  are   against   the   morality   and   would   shock   the  conscience of this Court, it deserves to be noted  that   the   breach   came   to   be   initiated   with   the  nonsupply   of   goods   agreed   by   the   respondents  themselves.    Having  agreed  for  applicability  of  English law and the awards having been based upon  HC-NIC Page 94 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the provisions of UK Sale of Goods Act and more  particularly   applicability   of   section   51(3)   of  the said Act, it cannot be said that the impugned  awards are against morality or that it shocks the  conscience   of   this   Court.   In   a   commercial  transaction   which  was   entered   into   between   the  parties   as   normal   businessmen   and   both   the  parties having agreed to a particular course and  applicability   of   arbitration   clause     with  applicability of English law, it cannot be said  that   the   impugned   awards   lack   morality   or   it  would shock the conscience of this Court. \n117. Considering the aforesaid as well as taking into  consideration the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble  Apex Court as well as judgments of the other High  Courts, all contentions raised by the respondents  that   the   impugned   awards   are   against   the  fundamental   policy   of   Indian   law   and   that   the  same   lacks   morality   and   that   the   same   is   in  contravention with a particular provision of the  Indian law and that it shocks the conscience of  this   Court   deserve   to   be   negatived.   Even   the  contention   that   other   arbitral   proceedings  relating   to   the   similar   contracts   are   still  pending   wherein   the   petitioners   have   sought  adjournment time and again even for production of  documents   in   opinion   of   this   Court   would   not  affect   the   enforceability   of   the   awards   in  question.\n118. In   facts   of   the   aforesaid   case   therefore,   this  HC-NIC Page 95 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER Court   finds   that   the   awards   in   question   have  become   final   as   per   the   English   law   and   this  Court   is   satisfied   that   the   awards   in   question  are   enforceable   and   it   is   hereby   held   that   the  awards   shall   be   deemed   to   be   decree   of   this  Court. \n119. The parties shall complete the pleadings within a  period of four weeks. The petitions be listed for  further hearing on 11.09.2017. \n(R.M.CHHAYA, J.)  bjoy HC-NIC Page 96 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017",
