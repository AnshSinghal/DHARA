Raghunandan Rao) Rrr,J & Hn,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 Heard Sri Arvind Nayyar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Sri Kiran Kumar Vadlamudi, l earned counsel for the appellant and Sri Vivekananda Virupaksha, learned counsel appearing for the respondent. \n2. The appellant herein, had approached this Court, by way of the present appeal, being aggrieved by certain directions of the Arbitral Tribunal dated 04.07.2024. The respondent herein raised an objection as to the maintainability of the appeal, under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read with the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n3. This Court, by an order dated 30.07.2024, had held that this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal. Thereafter, the appellant has moved the present application under Section 24 of C.P.C. read with Section 151 of C.P.C for transferring the present appeal to the Special Court for Trial and Disposal of Commercial Disputes at Visakhapatnam. There is no dispute that the said Commercial Court has the jurisdiction to hear and decide the subject matter of the present appeal. \n4. The pleadings in the present application and the submissions of Sri Arvind Nayyar, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for Sri Kiran Kumar Vadlamudi, learned counsel for the appellant are as follows:\nRRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 a) In view of the finding of this Court that the present appeal is not maintainable before this Court, it would be appropriate to transfer this appeal to the Commercial Court at Visakhapatnam, by exercising powers under Section 24 of C.P.C read with Section 151 of C.P.C;\nb) In the event of this Court rejecting this application, the appellant would have to file a fresh appeal before the Commercial Court and seek condonation of delay in as much as the period stipulated under the provisions of the Arbitration Act had expired. Consideration of a condone delay petition and subsequently the appeal, if the delay is condoned, would be a long dawn affair which would affect the interest of the appellant. It is submitted that the appellant is spending roughly Rs. 80 lakhs per day in maintaining the Air Separation Plants and every day's delay would cause a loss of the said amount to the appellant;\nc) Though this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, it would still have power, under Section 24 (5) of C.P.C, to transfer this appeal to the Commercial Court at Visakhapatnam;\nd) The contention of the respondent, that Section 24(5) of C.P.C does not empower this Court to transfer appeals filed before RRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 courts without jurisdiction, is incorrect. The various provisions of Section 24 of C.P.C, when read together, would show that the said provision has to be interpreted in an expansive way and the absence of the term appeal', in Section 24(5) of C.P.C would not denude this Court of the power to transfer such appeals to any Court subordinate to this Court.\ne) Section 24(3) makes it clear that the term proceeding is to be understood in an expansive and inclusive manner and as such, the said term should be taken to include an appeal; \nf) Though Section 14 of the Limitation Act is applicable to the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and the time spent in the appeal pending before this Court would have to be excluded. The said process of obtaining such exclusion from the Commercial Court at Visakhapatnam would be long drawn and undue delay would cause immense loss to the appellant. In any event since the right of the appellant to move an appeal before the Commercial Court at Visakhapatnam is not lost, it would only be appropriate and in the interest of justice to transfer this appeal at the earliest, to the Commercial Court. This would enable the Commercial Court to take up the main issue in the appeal at the earliest;\nRRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 g) Learned counsel for the appellant had relied upon the following judgments. \n        i)        Pushpa Kapal vs. Shiv Kumar.1         ii)       Thirmala    Reddy    Mahalakshmamma             vs.    Mulkluri                   Muralidhar Rao.2         iii )      Madhusudan Das Agarwal vs. BHU.3         iv)       Krishna Devi vs. Karta Singh.4         v)        S. Chandra Sekhar Rao (Dr.) vs. VST Constructions,\n\n                  Krishna District5 .\n\n        vi)       Cholasseri Hamza and Ors. Vs. T.V. Udayaraj.6         5)        The respondent has filed his counter. The pleadings in the counter as wells as the submissions made by Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Sri Vivekananda Virupaksha, learned counsel for the respondent can be summarized as follows:\na) Section 24 of C.P.C permits this Court to transfer any suit, appeal or proceeding from any Court subordinate to this Court to any other Court or from this Court to any Court subordinate to this Court. However, such proceeding can only be done in 1988 SCC Online Del 73 1968 SCC Online AP 141 2015 SCC Online ALL 8104 2014 SCC Online Del 1046 2004 SCC Online AP 505 2016(2) KLT 104 RRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 relation to suits, appeals or proceedings which have been filed before a competent Court. In the event of any suit or proceeding pending before a Court which does not have jurisdiction, the same can be transferred by this Court under Section 24(5) of C.P.C. This provision while permitting the transfer of suits and proceedings pending before an incompetent Court has expressly excluded the term appeal. \nConsequently, this Court cannot transfer an appeal pending before a Court which does not have jurisdiction;\nb) In the present case, this Court by its order dated 30.07.2024 had held that it does not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal. In such circumstances, there is no provision in Section 24 of C.P.C permitting the transfer of this appeal from this Court to the Commercial Court at Visakhapatnam; \nc) The term proceeding mentioned in Section 24(5) of C.P.C can only be an original proceeding and not a proceeding in appeal. The fact that the term proceedings is found in conjunction with the term suit makes it clear that the term proceedings can only be understood to mean original proceedings. The explanation given in Section 24(3) of C.P.C, including execution proceedings in the term RRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 proceeding is in line with this interpretation and the inclusive definition of proceeding set out there cannot be expanded to include appeals. \nd) The omission of the term appeal in Section 24(5) while it is present in Section 24(1) and 24(2) of C.P.C makes it clear that it is not a cause of causes omission. The rule of construction expressio unius est exclusio alterus would be applicable in the present case as there is an express exclusion of the term appeal in Section 24(5) of C.P.C.\ne) The provisions of Section 151 of C.P.C are not applicable to the present case as Section 24 of C.P.C regulates the transfer of cases. The provision of Section 151 C.P.C can only be applied where there is no provision in law and this Court would be exercising its inherent jurisdiction;\nf) The contention of the appellant that it was unable to file an appeal before the Commercial Court, during the pendency of the present appeal is incorrect. The order of the Arbitrary Tribunal was passed on 04.07.2024 had time till 04.08.2024 to file the appeal. The order of this Court declining to entertain the appeal was passed on 30.07.2024 and the appellant had four days to file an appeal before the Commercial Court. The RRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 appellant having failed to utilize the said time cannot seek the indulgence of this Court to get out of the difficulties which were created by its own conduct; \ng) Section 24 of C.P.C and Section 25 of C.P.C were both amended with effect from 01.02.1977. In Section 25 of C.P.C relating to the power of Supreme Court to transfer suits, the terms suit, appeal or other proceeding are mentioned. However, the term appeal is missing in Section 24(5). It is obvious that the legislature while amending these two provisions had specifically excluded the term appeal from Section 24(5) of C.P.C and the said intention will have to be given effect; \nh) An application under Section 24 of C.P.C cannot be filed before this Court as the roster for considering applications under Section 24 of C.P.C is with a learned single judge and such applications cannot be filed before this Court.\ni) The learned counsel for the respondent had relied upon the following judgments. \ni) B.

General power of transfer and withdrawal.--(1) On the application of any of the parties and after notice to the parties and after hearing such of them as desired to be heard, or of its own motion without such notice, the High Court or the District Court may at any stage-- (a) transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any Court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same, or (b) withdraw any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending in any Court subordinate to it, and-- (i) try or dispose of the same; or (ii) transfer the same for trial or disposal to any Court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same; or (iii) retransfer the same for trial or disposal to the Court from which it was withdrawn.\n(2) Where any suit or proceeding has been transferred or withdrawn under sub-section (1), the Court which 1 [is thereafter to try or dispose of such suit or proceeding] may, subject to any special directions in the case of an order of transfer, either retry it or proceed from the point at which it was transferred or withdrawn. (3) For the purposes of this section,--\n(a) Courts of Additional and Assistant Judges shall be deemed to be subordinate to the District Court;\n(b) proceeding includes a proceeding for the execution of a decree or order. \nRRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 (4) The Court trying any suit transferred or withdrawn under this section from a Court of Small Causes shall, for the purposes of such suit, be deemed to be a Court of Small Causes. (5) A suit or proceeding may be transferred under this section from a Court which has no jurisdiction to try it. \n8) Section 24(1) of C.P.C confers power on the High Court or the District Court to transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before the High Court or District Court respectively, for trial or disposal to any Court subordinate to the High Court or the District Court respectively, provided such Court is competent to try or dispose of the same. Section 24(2) of C.P.C empowers the High Court or District Court to withdraw any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before any Court, subordinate to the High Court or District Court and transfer or retransfer the same to any other Court which is subordinate to the High Court or District Court. Section 24(2) of C.P.C stipulates that directions can be given, in the order of transfer, either to retry the entire case, to the Court to which the case is transferred, or to proceed from the point at which it was transferred or withdrawn. Section 24(3) of C.P.C clarifies certain aspects of how the transfer is to be done. Section 24(3)(a) of C.P.C explains the meaning of proceeding to include the proceeding of execution of a decree or order. Section 24(5) of C.P.C states that a suit or proceeding may be transferred from a Court which has no jurisdiction to try it. \nRRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 9) The Hon'ble High Court of Kerala in Cholasseri Hamza and Ors. Vs. T.V. Udayaraj, while considering the transfer of an appeal, filed before a Court subordinate to the High Court, which did not have pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal, had invoked Section 24(5) of C.P.C to order such a transfer. The Hon'ble High Court of Kerala held that the power, under Section 24(5), included the power to transfer appeals also. \n10) This view of the Hon'ble High Court of Kerala, which is relied upon by the appellant, is disputed by the respondent. \n11) Section 24(1) of C.P.C, while conferring power on the High Court to transfer any suit, appeal or proceedings restricted such power of transfer, in cases which were before Courts without jurisdiction to suits and proceedings only. Appeals were not mentioned in Section 24(5) of C.P.C.\n12) It may be noticed, prior to the amendment of Section 24 of C.P.C, in 1976, there was no explicit provision in Section 24, conferring power on the High Court to transfer the cases filed before Courts which do not have jurisdiction. Different High Courts, when such issues came up before them, had either held that the power to transfer such cases was available to the High Court or that such power was not available. The erstwhile High Court of Andhra Pradesh had held that any case pending RRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 before any Court which did not have jurisdiction, could be transferred, under unamended section 24 of C.P.C., to any other Court which had such jurisdiction. The legislature, taking into account, this divergence of opinion between various High Courts, had amended Section 24 of C.P.C., granting power to the High Court to transfer suits or proceedings pending before Courts which did not have jurisdiction to take up such suits or proceedings. In the process of this amendment, the term appeal had been omitted in Section 24(5) of C.P.C.\n13) The question before this court is whether, the terms suit or proceeding, mentioned in section 24 (5), can be understood to include appeal. \n14) The Division Bench of the Hon'ble High Court of Kerala, in the case mentioned above, had transferred an incompetent appeal, by holding that section 24 (5) covers incompetent appeals also. However, the issue about the omission of the term appeal had not been considered in that judgment. \n15) In Ram Chandra Aggarwal v. State of U.P.,22, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, while dealing with the question as to proceedings under the Criminal procedure code could be transferred, by using the provisions 1966 SCC OnLine SC 232 : 1966 Supp SCR 393 : AIR 1966 SC 1888 RRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 of the unamended section 24, had interpreted the meaning of the term other proceeding in this manner:\n6. The next contention -- and it was the one pressed strenuously by him -- was that a proceeding upon a reference under Section 146(1) entertained by a civil court not being an original proceeding the provisions of Section 141 CPC are not attracted and that, therefore, those provisions of the Civil Procedure Code which relate to suits are not applicable to a proceeding undertaken by a civil court upon a reference to it under Section 146(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A number of cases dealing with this point were brought to our notice either by him or by Mr Goyal. It seems to us, however, that those cases are not relevant for deciding the point which is before us. In passing, however, we may mention the fact that a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court has held in Maha Ram v. Harbans [ILR 1941 All 193] that the civil court to which an issue on the question of proprietary rights has been submitted by a revenue court under Section 271 of the Agra Tenancy Act, 1926 has jurisdiction to refer the issue to arbitration under para 1 of Schedule II of the CPC. This decision is based upon the view that by virtue of Section 141 CPC the provisions relating to arbitration contained in the second schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure, before the repeal of that schedule, applied to a proceeding of this kind. Similarly recently this Court has held in Munshi Ram v. Banwarilal [AIR 1962 SC 903] that under Section 41 of the Arbitration Act and also under Section 141 CPC it was competent to the court before which an award made by an arbitration tribunal is filed for passing a decree in terms thereof to permit parties to compromise their dispute under Order 23 Rule 3 CPC. Though there is no discussion, this Court has acted upon the view that the expression civil proceeding in Section 141 is not necessarily confined to an original proceeding like a suit or an application for appointment of a guardian etc., but that it applies also to a proceeding which is not an original proceeding. Thus, though we say that it is not necessary to consider in this case whether the proceeding before the civil court is a civil proceeding as contemplated by Section 141 or not there is good authority for saying that it is a civil proceeding. All that we are concerned with in this case is whether the provisions of Section 24(1)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure are available with respect to a proceeding arising out of a reference under Section 146(1) CrPC. The relevant portion of Section 24 may, therefore, be set out. It reads thus:\nOn the application of any of the parties and after notice to the parties and after hearing such of them as desired to be heard, or of its own motion without such notice, the High Court or the District Court may at any stage-- (a) ***\n(b) withdraw any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending in any Court subordinate to it, and RRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 (i) ***\n(ii) transfer the same for trial or disposal to any Court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same;\n(iii) *** It plainly speaks of other proceeding pending in any court subordinate to it and not only to the civil proceeding pending before a subordinate court. The decisions of the Privy Council and one decision of this Court which we have earlier quoted would warrant the application of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure generally to a proceeding before a civil court arising out of a reference to it by a Magistrate under Section 146(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The expression proceeding used in this section is not a term of art which has acquired a definite meaning. \nWhat its meaning is when it occurs in a particular statute or a provision of a statute will have to be ascertained by looking at the relevant statute. Looking to the context in which the word has been used in Section 24(1)(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure it would appear to us to be something going on in a court in relation to the adjudication of a dispute other than a suit or an appeal. Bearing in mind that the term proceeding indicates something in which business is conducted according to a prescribed mode it would be only right to give it, as used in the aforesaid provision, a comprehensive meaning so as to include within it all matters coming up for judicial adjudication and not to confine it to a civil proceeding alone. In a recent case Kochadai Naidu v. Nagavasami Naidu [ILR 1951 Mad 413] Ramachandra Iyer, J., (as he then was) was called upon to consider the very question which arises before us. The learned Judge held that a proceeding before a civil court arising out of a reference to it under Section 146(1) CrPC can be transferred by the High Court or District Court under Section 24 CPC because it is in any case a proceeding. He has also considered this question from the angle of the nature of the proceeding and expressed the view that the proceeding was a civil proceeding to which the procedure for suits could, with the aid of Section 141 CPC be applied. If indeed the term proceeding in Section 24 is not confined to a civil proceeding there is no need whatsoever of taking the aid of Section 141 CPC. Upon this view we dismiss the appeal. \n16) In view of the above interpretation, it must be held that the term proceeding would not include appeals. Consequently, this court RRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 must hold that the present appeal cannot be transferred, under Section 24 (5) of C.P.C., to the Commercial Court at Visakhapatnam. \n17) However, this would not mean that the appellant cannot prefer a fresh appeal to the commercial court, Visakhapatnam or such Court which has jurisdiction. Such a course of action is available. It may also be noted that In Consolidated Engineering Enterprises vs. Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department and Ors.,23 the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the applicability of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, in relation to an application made under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. In this case, an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was made, to a Court, against an arbitral award. Subsequently it was realized that the said Court did not have jurisdiction and the application was moved before the competent Court. This was objected by the respondent, on the ground that Section 14 of the Limitation Act would not be applicable, in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India v. Popular Construction Co., excluding the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that, the language of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, by implication, excluded the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act. However, the said language cannot be extended to exclude the provisions of Section 14 (2008) 7 SCC 169 = 2008 SCC Online SC 618 RRR,J & HN,J I.A.No.7 of 2024 in CMA.No.489 of 2024 of the Limitation Act, as the language in Section 34 does not lend itself to such exclusion. Similar considerations would apply to an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. \n18) In view of the above, this application is dismissed, leaving it open to the petitioner herein, to avail of such remedies as are available to the petitioner. \n__ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ R.
