Mishra, J.      The Writ Petition has been preferred challenging\n\n       the order dated 18.07.2024 in Arbp No.02 of 2024 passed by\n\n       the District Judge, Cuttack, vide which it was ordered that\n\n       the said Court lacks jurisdiction over the subject to entertain\n\n       the application filed under Section 9 of the Arbitration and\n Conciliation Act, 1996, shortly hereinafter, 'the Act, 1996' and\n\nordered to transfer the matter to the Commercial Court, \n\nCuttack. \n\n2.           The factual matrix, which led to filing of the\n\npresent Writ Petition, is that on 17.05.2022, the Petitioner\n\nand the Opposite Party Nos.1 & 2 entered into a Partnership\n\nAgreement for smooth running of the movie business\n\ninherited from their father in the name and style as M/s.\n\nBrajaraj Movies. The said partnership agreement was reduced\n\nto writing in shape of Deed of Agreement and subsequently\n\nregistered with the I.G.R., Odisha, Cuttack on 31.05.2022,\n\nvide registration No.720202200555. The Opposite Party No.1,\n\ninstead of extending his cooperation for smooth running of\n\nthe business of the firm, allegedly violated the terms of the\n\nsaid Deed of Agreement and committed breach of trust, as\n\nhas been detailed in the Writ Petition. When the Petitioner\n\ntried to contact the Opposite Party No.1 to ascertain the fact\n\nand resolve the issue amicably, the Opposite Party No.1 did\n\nnot come forward to resolve the said dispute. Hence, the\n\nPetitioner and the Opposite Party No.2 were constrained to\n\nlodge an F.I.R. against the Opposite Party No.1 in Purighat\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                              Page 2 of 36\n P.S. on 05.02.2024. They also issued a legal notice on\n\n07.02.2024 for appointment of an Arbitrator in terms of\n\nClause-15 of the Deed of Agreement dated 17.05.2022, which\n\nwas received by the Opposite Party No.1 on 08.01.2024. The\n\nPetitioner and the Opposite Party No.2 thereby requested to\n\nextend consent within seven days from the date of receipt of\n\nthe said notice for appointment of an Arbitrator to arbitrate\n\nand resolve the said dispute. However, the Opposite Party\n\nNo.1, after receipt of the said legal notice dated 07.02.2024\n\nfor appointment of an Arbitrator, gave a reply vide letter dated\n\n22.02.2024 expressing his unwillingness for giving his\n\nconsent for appointment of the Arbitrator to resolve the said\n\ndispute. Finding no other way out, the Petitioner preferred an\n\napplication under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 before this\n\nCourt praying for appointment of an Arbitrator in terms of\n\nClause 15 of the Deed of Agreement dated 17.05.2022, which\n\nhas been registered as Arbp No.09 of 2024 and the same is\n\nstill pending for consideration before this Court. As the\n\nOpposite Party No.1 has failed to perform his duties in\n\ncontravention of terms and conditions of Deed of Agreement,\n\nthe Petitioner, pending consideration of his application for\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                              Page 3 of 36\n appointment of an Arbitrator by this Court, was being\n\nconstraint to approach the District Judge, Cuttack by filing\n\nan application under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 for grant of an\n\norder of interim injunction against the Opposite Party No.1,\n\nthereby restraining the Opposite Party No.1 or his agents from\n\ntelecasting the movies and songs of M/s.  Brajaraj Movies in any form through television media, satellite broadcasting,\n\nF.M. channels, mobile operator, cinema halls, DVD & You Tube Channels and to restrain him from proceeding with the production of the Movie \"I Love You-2\" and also using the title and logo of M/s. Brajaraj Movies in any manner till the dispute is resolved through arbitration. \n\n3.           The said petition, registered as ARBP No.02 of 2024, was admitted and notice was issued to the Opposite Parties. Being noticed, the Opposite Party No.1 duly appeared and filed objection/show cause on 27.06.2024. On the very day, the District Judge, Cuttack was pleased to pass an interim order restraining the Opposite Party No.1 from proceeding with the release of the film \"I Love You-2\" and using the logo and banner of M/s. Brajaraj Movies till the next date and the matter stood adjourned to 11.07.2024. On W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                             Page 4 of 36  the said date, the Petitioner filed another application for grant of interim order as well as an application for continuance of the interim order dated 27.06.2024 whereas, the Opposite Party No.1 filed applications under Order 7, Rule11 of C.P.C.\n\nfor rejection of the ARBP No.02 of 2024 and for vacating the stay order dated 27.06.2024. However, the District Judge,\n\nCuttack was pleased to extend the interim order and posted the matter to 18.07.2024. On the said date, the Petitioner filed his Reply in response to the application filed by the Opposite Party No.1 under Order 7 Rule, 11 of C.P.C. so also to the application for vacation of stay. However, the District Judge, Cuttack, though extended the interim order till the next date, but on a wrong noting and misconstruing the provisions enshrined under the Act, 1996 as well as the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, shortly hereinafter, 'CC Act,\n\n2015' and relying on the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Jaycee     Housing         Pvt.   Ltd.   &   others   Vrs.   Registrar (General), Orissa High Court, Cuttack & others, reported in 2022 Live Law (SC) 860, transferred the case to the Court of the Senior Civil Judge (Commercial Court), Cuttack on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. While passing the said order,\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                     Page 5 of 36  the District Judge, Cuttack also directed to dispose of the said matter on or before 23.07.2024 on merit in accordance with law, with an observation not to extend the interim order in a causal manner. Hence this Writ Petition. \n\n4.           The said order passed by the District Judge,\n\nCuttack dated 18.07.2024 passed in ARBP No.02 of 2024 has been challenged on the following grounds: \n\n             (i)     The same is contrary to the provisions of law                      enshrined under the Act, 1996 as well as the                      CC Act, 2015.\n\n             (ii )    The Court below completely misconstrued                      the decision rendered by the Supreme Court                      in Jaycee Housing Pvt. Ltd. (supra).\n\n             (iii)   The Court below misconstrued the facts and                      circumstances of the Petitioner's case and                      wrongly rendered a finding that the case                      involved   is   pertaining   to   violation   of                      intellectual property right and loss and the                      valuation of the same appears to be more                      than five lakhs, forgetting the fact that the                      Petitioner has filed   the application under W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                  Page 6 of 36                      Section 9 of the Act, 1996 for grant of interim                     relief till disposal of the dispute through                     arbitration in which there is no specified                     value, as envisaged under section 3 of the                     Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n\n             (iv)   The order passed by the District Judge,\n\n                    Cuttack is also contrary to Section 6 of the                     CC Act, 2015 which mandates that the CC                     Act shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and                     applications relating to a commercial dispute                     of a specified value, though, in the instant                     case, there is no specified value as on the                     date. \n\n             (v)    The impugned order is also in contravention                     to the provisions enshrined under Sections                     10, 12 & 15 of the CC Act, 2015 and section                     2(1)(e) of the Act, 1996. \n\n             (vi )   Since the dispute has no specified value, as                     required under the provisions of the CC Act,\n\n                    2015, the application under Section 9 of the                     Act, 1996 cannot come under the definition W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                  Page 7 of 36                     of Section 2(b),(c), vii, xv and xvii of the CC                    Act, 2015, as referred to in the impugned                    order, and the said order suffers from                    illegalities and infirmities and is liable to be                    quashed. \n\n5.           Reiterating the grounds agitated in the Writ Petition, Mr. Panda, learned Counsel for the Petitioner,\n\ndrawing attention of this Court to the provisions enshrined under section 2 (1)(e) of the Act, 1996 so also under Section 6,\n\n10 and 15 of the C.C Act, 2015 submitted that the District Judge, Cuttack, being the Principal Civil Court, is only competent to hear the application filed under section 9 of the Act, 1996. The section 9 application being in the nature of interlocutory application, having no valuation, the District Judge should not have transferred the said application to the Commercial Court, Cuttack, which lacks jurisdiction to try the said petition. In view of the provisions enshrined under section 6 read with section 15 of the CC Act, 2015, only suits and applications, including applications under the Act, 1996 relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value can only be tried by the Commercial Court. The specified value, as per W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                Page 8 of 36  the amended provisions under the CC Act, 2015, being Rs.3,00,000/- and admittedly the section 9 application filed by the Petitioner having no valuation and with a prayer for interim injunction, cannot be heard by the           Commercial Court. Only the District Judge, Cuttack, being the Principal Civil Court, is competent to hear and decide the said application. Hence, the Impugned order dated 18.07.2024 passed in ARBP No.02 of 2024, being contrary to the legal provisions enshrined under the Act, 1996 so also the CC Act,\n\n2015, deserves interference and be quashed and direction be given to the District Judge, Cuttack to hear the said application filed under section 9 of the Act, 1996 and dispose of the same on merit in the interest of justice.\n\n6.           To   substantiate   his   submission,   Mr.   Panda,\n\nlearned Counsel for the Petitioner, relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Jaycee Housing Pvt. Ltd. (supra),\n\nsubmitted that though the District Judge, Cuttack relied on the said judgment in the impugned order, but misconstrued the said decision of the Supreme Court. Mr. Panda submitted that, vide the said decision, it was never held by the Supreme Court that all the cases under sections 9, 14, and 24 of the W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                               Page 9 of 36  Act, 1996 have to be filed and adjudicated by the Commercial Court irrespective of the valuation. Mr. Panda, relying on para-10 of the said judgment of the Supreme Court,\n\nsubmitted that it was also held vide the said judgment that as per section 15 of the CC Act, 2015, all suits and applications,\n\nincluding applications under the Act, 1996, relating to a commercial dispute of \"specified value\" shall have to be transferred to the Commercial Court.\n\n7.           Mr. Panda, learned Counsel, referring to para-15 of the order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court at Jabalpur,\n\nreported in 2021 SCC OnLine MP 457 (Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi Vs. District & Sessions Judge and Another)\n\nsubmitted that the Court of District Judge, being the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction, would be competent to decide the matters/disputes filed under the provisions of section 9 , 14, 34 and 36 of the Act, 1996 so also under the provisions of the CC Act, 2015, regardless of the value of claim and it can only distribute such work amongst any of the Additional District Judges under his supervision, but not to any Court of Civil Judge Class-I or Senior Civil Judge, or any Court of Small Causes.\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                             Page 10 of 36  8 .           In response to the argument advanced by Mr.\n\nPanda, learned Counsel for the Petitioner, Mr. Dash, learned Counsel for Opposite Party No.1, drawing attention of this Court to the definition of \"Commercial Court\", \"commercial dispute\" and \"Specified Value\", as defined         under sections 2(1)(b), 2(1)(c) & 2(1)(i) respectively, so also section 3(3), 6 and 10(3) of the C.C. Act, 2015, submitted that in view of the definition of commercial dispute under the CC Act, 2015 read with section 6 and 10(3) of the CC Act, 2015, all applications and appeals, arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Act, 1996, that would ordinarily lie before any principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district (not being High Court), has to be filed in and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration, where such Commercial Court has been constituted. Since ARBP No.02 of 2024 has been preferred under section 9 of the Act, 1996, instead of filing such an application before the Commercial Court,\n\nCuttack, the Petitioner wrongly filed such an application before the District Judge, Cuttack. Hence, the Opposite Party No.1, in addition to filing an application for vacation of stay,\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                Page 11 of 36  also filed an application under Order-7, Rule 11 of C.P.C. for rejection of the said petition on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the District Judge, Cuttack so also on some other grounds. However, the District Judge, Cuttack, instead of hearing such application first, ordered for disposing of all the applications together with section 9 application. However,\n\nthe District Judge ultimately thought it prudent to transfer the said proceeding to the Commercial Court, in terms of the legal provisions under the CC Act, 2015, referring to the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Jaycee Housing Pvt. Ltd.\n\n(supra).\n\n9.           Mr. Dash, learned Counsel for the Opposite Party No.1, drawing attention of this Court to the legal provisions under Section 10(3) of the CC Act, 2015, submitted that any application under the Act, 1996, pertaining to a commercial dispute, has to be moved before the Commercial Court after formation of the Commercial Court and not before the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district and the District Judge, Cuttack should have returned the application filed under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 to the Petitioner. However, on being so pointed out by his client, the W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                             Page 12 of 36  District Judge, Cuttack ordered for transfer of the said proceeding to the Commercial Court, Cuttack. There being no infirmity in the impugned order and the same having been passed in terms of the legal provisions under the CC Act,\n\n2015, the Writ Petition deserves to be dismissed. \n\n10.          From the pleadings made in the Writ Petition,\n\ngrounds urged therein to challenge the impugned order so also submissions made at the Bar, the following points emerge to be answered in the present Writ Petition.\n\n             (i )    In absence of any valuation, in an application                     filed under section 9 of the Act, 1996,\n\n                    whether the Commercial Court, constituted                     under sub-section (1) of section 3 of the CC                     Act,   2015,     is   competent   to   hear     such                     application?\n\n             (ii)   Whether the District Judge was justified to                     transfer the section 9 application, registered                     as ARBP No.02 of 2024, to the Court of                     Senior   Civil    Judge    (Commercial        Court),\n\n                    Cuttack?\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                   Page 13 of 36  11.          Since both points are interrelated, the same are dealt with together for the sake of brevity and clarity.

Though \"Court\" is defined under Section 2(1)(e) of the Act, 1996 to be the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in the district, but in the provisions enshrined under Section 10(3) of the CC Act, 2015, it has been clearly enumerated that, where the subject matter of an arbitration is a \"commercial dispute\" of \"Specified Value\" and such arbitration is other than the         international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Act, 1996, that would ordinarily lie before any principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district (not being a High Court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial Court has been constituted.\n\n13.          The word \"commercial dispute\" has been defined under section 2(1)(c) of the C.C. Act, 2015, which clearly includes a dispute arising out of partnership agreements in terms of sub-clause (xv) under clause (c) of section 2(1) of the C.C Act, 2015. Similarly, the word \"Specified Value\" used in various provisions of the C.C Act, 2015 has been defined under section 2(1)(i). Specified Value, in relation to a W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                              Page 21 of 36  commercial dispute, shall mean the value of the subject matter in respect of a \"suit\", which is to be determined in accordance with section 12 and the same shall not be less than three lakh rupees or such higher value, as may be notified by the Central Government.\n\n14.          So far as the Order of Madhya Pradesh High Court in Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi (supra) cited by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, it was held as follows:\n\n               \"15. In view of the above discussions, the           present petition deserves to succeed. The Entry No.45           of the impugned order dated 20.10.2020 is set aside. \n          It is hereby declared that the Court of District Judge as           the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction would           be competent to decide the matters/disputes filed           under the provisions of Sections 9, 14, 34 & 36 of the           Arbitration Act and also under the provisions of the           Commercial Courts Act regardless of the value of           claim. However, the District Judge by virtue of Section           7 read with Section 15 of the Civil Courts Act would be           entitled to distribute such work amongst any of the           Additional District Judges under his supervision , but           not to any Court of Civil Judge Class-I or Senior Civil           Judge, or any Court of Small Causes.\"\n\n\n\n15.          However, the High Court of Bombay in Gaurang Manguesh       Suctancar       Vs.    Sonia     Gaurang       Suctancar,\n\nreported in MANU/MH/2578/2020, dealing with an issue as to whether the Commercial Court under the CC Act, 2015 was justified to refuse to entertain an application under Section 9 W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                       Page 22 of 36  of the Act, 1996 and return it to the Petitioner/Applicant to be presented before the appropriate Court, held as follows:\n\n             \"Issue:\n\n             2. For adjudicating an application under           Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, which is the           forum: Is it the court as defined under Section 2           (1) (e) of the Arbitration Act, read with Section 5           of the Goa Civil Courts Act 1965 or is it the           Commercial Court under Section 3 (1) of the           Amended Commercial Courts Act 2015? \n\n             92 . Evidently, the Commercial Courts Act is a later           enactment, but it does not work at cross purpose with           the Arbitration Act. In fact, both aim at speedy           adjudication. The Commercial Courts Act covers all the           commercial disputes, whereas the Arbitration Act           covers only those disputes that involve arbitration. As           Kandla Export Corporation has held, both the           enactments call for a harmonious interpretation. If at           all there is any conflict, as to the substantive           provisions, the Arbitration Act prevails; but it has left           the procedural niceties to the Commercial Courts Act.\n          Section 10 (3) of the Commercial Courts act and the           Remote Conditional:\n             93. Let us revisit Section 10 (3) of the Commercial           Courts Act. \"If it is a domestic arbitration, all           applications or appeals arising out of arbitration \"that           would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of           original jurisdiction\" in a district (not being a High           Court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by           the Commercial Court\".\n             94. Sub -section (3) begins with a conditional \"if.\n          Then, it delineates on how \"all applications or appeals\"\n          arising out of arbitration should be adjudicated. They           \"would ordinarily\" lie before the \"principal civil court of           original jurisdiction.\" In that sentence, \"ordinarily\" is           an adverbial emphasiser; let us keep it aside. Now the           sentence is \"they would lie before the principal civil           court of original jurisdiction.\" It is, grammatically           speaking, the 'second conditional' employing the           subjunctive \"would\". If refers to an unlikely or           improbable future event or arrangement. What could           have been an ordinary course of remedial event now           stands altered. This uncertainty or altered course           under sub-section (3) is because of a statutory           development-the advent of the Commercial Courts Act. \n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                         Page 23 of 36            So, to repeat, what could have been the subject of           adjudication before the principal civil court of original           jurisdiction, now \"shall be filed in, and heard and           disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising           territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such           Commercial Court has been constituted.\"\n             95. Because, now, the Commercial Courts have           been established, \"all applications\" under the           Arbitration Act should lock, stock, and barrel go before           the Commercial Courts. So the concept of\" the principal           civil court of original jurisdiction\" no longer applies. \n          Instead, what matters is the \"Commercial Court\". That           accepted, which is the Commercial Court-the Senior           Civil Judge's Court or the District Court? In Goa, the           District Court is no longer the primary Commercial           Court; it is, in fact, a Commercial Appellate Court. \n             96 . In this context, I may once again quote G.P.\n          Singh, G.P. Singh (n 13) 91, who says that \"the words           of a statute are first understood in their natural,\n          ordinary or popular sense and phrases and sentences           are construed according to their grammatical meaning,\n          unless that leads to some absurdity or unless there is           something in the context, or in the object of the statute           to suggest the contrary.\" Here, if sub-section (3) is not           read in its ordinary grammatical sense, it will lead to           absurdity.\n\n          The Decisions:\n\n             97. The respondent wants me to treat co-equal           Bench decisions in D.M. Corporation and Jaiswal           Ashoka Infrastructure as per incuriam. They have           been rendered, as she points out, in ignorance of           Kandla Export Corporation. As the Supreme Court has           held in B. Satyanarayana Rao, the rule of per incuriam           can be applied \"where a Court omits to consider a           binding precedent of the same court or the superior           court rendered on the same issue or where a court           omits to consider any statute while deciding that           issue . \" \n             98. In D.M. Corporation, a learned Single Judge           (Dr. Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi, J.) has, on facts, noted           that the dispute concerns an arbitration agreement,\n          the subject-matter of which is above Rs. 1 crore; it is a           dispute of commercial nature. So even if the relief           claimed is mere injunction, because of Section           10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act, the Principal           District Judge has correctly transferred the           arbitration application to the Commercial Court. \n          The impugned order passed by the District Court W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                       Page 24 of 36            being just, legal, and correct; it warranted no           interference. \n              99. In Jaiswal Ashoka Infrastructure, another           learned Single Judge (A.S. Chandurkar, J) has           observed that because of Section 15(2) of the           Commercial Courts Act, suits and applications in           relation to a commercial dispute pending in any civil           court must be transferred to the Commercial Court.\n          That is, the civil court \"ceases to have jurisdiction to           entertain an application under the provisions of the           [Commercial Courts] Act in relation to a commercial           dispute of a specified value.\" Once the court lacks           inherent jurisdiction, express or implied consent,\n          failure to raise jurisdictional object, or even           acquiescence cannot clothe the court with jurisdiction. \n              100. I have already elaborately discussed           Kandla Export Corporation, and I see no           precedential transgression in D.M. Corporation or           Jaiswal Ashoka Infrastructure. \n\n                    Conclusion: \n\n                    (1) Contrary to the respondent's contentions,\n                   the Notification, dt. 05.05.2020, issued by                    the Government of Goa, is in tune with the                    legislative mandate under Sections 3 and 3A                    of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n\n                   ( 2) In the State of Goa, the designated                    District Courts are the Appellate Commercial                    Courts, and the Senior Civil Judges' Courts                    are the Commercial Courts. \n\n                   (3) Even adjudication of an application                    under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act                    must be before the Commercial Court,\n                   and that Commercial Court need not be                    the principal civil court of original                    jurisdiction. \n\n                   (4) There is no conflict between the                    Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996                    and the Commercial Courts Act 2015. If                    at all we maintain the distinction, the                    former Act deals with the substantive                    rights of the parties to the arbitration,\n                   and the latter Act with the procedural                    essentials, the choice of the forum being                    a part of it.\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                      Page 25 of 36                      (5) As Kandla Export Corporation has held,\n                    regarding any commercial arbitral dispute,\n                    the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996                     determines, among other things, the                     appellate remedies and the Commercial                     Courts Act 2015 provides for the forum and                     adjudicatory procedure. \n          Result: \n\n             As a result, I hold that the Ad-hoc Senior Civil           Judge, \"A\" Court, Panaji, has failed to exercise           the jurisdiction vested in it as the Commercial           Court. Its returning the petitioner's application to be           presented \"before proper court\" is erroneous and           unsustainable, for it is, by itself, the proper court. The           impugned Order, dt. 08.07.2020, is set aside. \n             So the Commercial Court at North Goa, Panaji, will           have the CMA Stamp No. 243/2020 restored to file           and adjudicated on merits, after giving the regular           number.\"\n\n                                            (Emphasis supplied)\n\n16.           The Division Bench of this Court in M.G. Mohanty and others Vs. State of Odisha and others, reported in 2022(III)ILR-CUT-992, while deciding the issue regarding constitutional validity of section 10(3) of the CC Act, 2015 in a batch of cases, took note of both the said Orders of Madhya Pradesh High Court so also Bombay High Court. The Division Bench disagreed with the reasoning of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi (supra),\n\nwhereas, respectfully agreed with the views of Bombay High Court in Gaurang Manguesh Suctancar (supra) and observed as follows:\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                        Page 26 of 36                  \"39. In Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi v.\n          District & Sessions Judge (supra), the Madhya           Pradesh High Court relied on the decision of the           Supreme Court of India in State of Maharashtra,\n          through Executive Engineer v. Atlanta Limited (2014)\n          11 SCC 619 to hold that the Court of superior most           jurisdiction in a district is the Court of the District           Judge. It concluded that: \n                    \" 14...... Segregation of an arbitration                     matters on the basis of a pecuniary                     limit is not what the law provides for. \n                    All      the    arbitration      matters,\n                    irrespective of the value of claim, are                     required to be adjudicated by                     Principal Civil Court of original                     jurisdiction . Therefore, it is clear that                     in respect of commercial disputes                     involving an arbitration dispute only                     the Commercial Court of the status of                     District Judge or Additional District                     Judge would be the competent court                     to entertain the matters under                     Sections 9, 14, 34 & 36 of the                     Arbitration Act.\"\n                42. In any event, this Court is unable to           agree with the reasoning of the High Court of           Madhya Pradesh in Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi           (supra). In particular, the Court would like to refer to           the Parliamentary intent in enacting the CC Act in           2015 much after the A&C Act of 2016 and the SOR not           only of the Bill introduced in 2015 but also the SOR of           the Bill introduced in 2018, amending the said statute.\n          The debates in the Parliament in this regard are           instructive. In defending its decision to expand the           scope of commercial disputes beyond those which           were of high value, three aspects that were mentioned           on behalf of the Government defending the Bill in the           Parliament, which read as under:\n\n                 \"Now, what really has transpired in                  December 2017? As has already been                  mentioned by the hon. Minister , in                  December, 2017, the Government had                  established a total of 247 commercial                  courts across the country. But, the non-                  exhausted list of 22 disputes, termed as                  commercial disputes, has also been                  brought in. To increase the efficiency of the                  system, there are still many enactments                  and many things which we need to correct W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                         Page 27 of 36                   and this is just one part of the correction to                  improve the ease of doing business. By                  bringing the jurisdiction to three lakhs, we                  will    actually   be    bringing     judicial                  accessibility to a wider audience and to a                  larger number of people. By making it                  available to a larger number of people, we                  will be resolving a larger number of                  disputes. It is in this context that the                  jurisdiction has been reduced after                  studying the data in detail. \n\n                This particular amendment has been brought in           with the specific value which was determined under           Section 2 (1) (i), where the minimum pecuniary           jurisdiction is mentioned, which was one crore earlier           before the Ordinance, now it has been brought to three           lakhs. This jurisdiction will initiate more such disputes           to have a faster disposal. \n                As I have mentioned earlier, under the Charter,\n          there are Chartered High Courts and non-Chartered           High Courts. So, certain original jurisdictions are           vested with certain High Courts and not with every           High Court. This was one impediment in establishing           commercial divisions. So, there was a bar of some sort. \n          To do away with the bar, this particular enactment           has been brought in and this is another major change           which has been brought in through this           particular Bill. \n                The third aspect of the commercial           appellate court is that normally at the District           Level, either a District Judge or a Judge below           the level of District Judge, will be notified as the           Commercial Court Judge. Then the appeal need           not go to the High Court. The appeal can go to           the District Judge. That is also a part of this           particular enactment.\"\n                43. The legislature appears to have left it open to           the High Court and the State government either to           appoint a Civil Judge (Senior Division) or an Additional           District Judge as the Commercial Court of first           instance to expedite the adjudication of commercial           disputes. It is interesting to note that there are           several States that have constituted Commercial           Courts both at the District Judge level as well as           below the District Judge level. In Gujarat, the           Courts of the Additional District Judges in Bhuj, Anjar,\n          Gandhidham and Bhachau have been constituted for           hearing arbitration matters whereas the Courts of the           Principal Senior Civil Judge in these places are for W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                          Page 28 of 36            hearing other commercial disputes. In Karnataka, in           some districts, it is the Principal D&SJ and in others           the AD&SJ. In Bihar, depending on the pecuniary           value, it could be the District Judge or the Sub-Judge. \n          In Uttarakhand, it is the Additional District Judge           Commercial Court, Dehradun. The intent clearly           was to expand the power and to bring in more           Courts under the rubric of 'Commercial Courts'. \n          Considering that the specified value was being           lowered, it was but natural to allow Courts below           the rank of the District Judge to be designated           as such.\n                44. Section 10(3) of the CC Act specifically           deals with arbitrations, 'other than international           commercial arbitrations'. The jurisdiction in           respect of such disputes would now be based           with the Commercial Courts, although earlier it           was with a principal Civil Court, which would           ordinarily exercise jurisdiction under Section           2(1)(e) of the A&C Act. The orders passed by the           D&SJ on 7th July 2021, transferring the           arbitration petitions to the Court of the Senior           Civil Judge Commercial Court, was only by way           of implementation of these provisions.\n                46. There might be an anomaly inasmuch as           arbitral disputes of a commercial value of less than           Rs.3 Lacs may have to be dealt with directly by the           D&SJ in terms of the definition under Section 2(1)(e) of           the A&C Act and appeal against which would lie to the           commercial appellate division in the High Court. But           none of the petitions before this Court has that fact           situation. The questions is, therefore, purely academic. \n          Nevertheless, it will be open to the State Government           to revise its notification in view of the above anomaly.\n                48. At this stage, it must be pointed out that this           Court's attention has been drawn to the Judgment of           the Bombay High Court in Gaurang Mangesh           Suctancar v. Sonia Gaurang Suctancar (Supra).\n          The Bombay High Court, on analyzing these very           provisions, came to the conclusion that it is the CC Act           provisions that would prevail. The Court is in           respectful concurrence with the said view. As           rightly noted by the Bombay High Court both Sections           42 of the A&C Act and Section 21 of the CC Act           appeared to be similar provisions inasmuch as they           begin with a non-obstante clause, precluding the           applicability of any other law for the time being in           force. The following observations of the Bombay High           Court in this regards are relevant, which reads as           under:\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                       Page 29 of 36                 \" 60. G.P. Singh, in his cerebral                commentary, Principles of           Statutory                Interpretation (G.P. Singh, Interpretation of                Statutes, (reprint, 14 edn., Lexis Nexis,\n               2018) 403), has explained that \"the                expression 'notwithstanding anything in                any other law' occurring in a section of an                Act cannot be construed to take away the                effect of any provision of the Act in which                that section appears. In other words, 'any                other law' will refer to any law other than                the Act in which that section occurs.\" In                contrast, the expression 'notwithstanding                anything contained in this Act' may be                construed to take away the effect of any                provision of the Act in which the section                occurs but it cannot take away the effect                of any other law. \n               61 . Indeed, a special enactment or Rule                cannot be held     to be overridden by a                later general enactment or simply because                the latter opens up with a non obstante                clause. There should be a clear                inconsistency between the two before                giving an overriding effect to the non                obstante clause. \n               62. The learned author G.P. Singh has                also remarked that sometimes one finds                two or more enactments operating in the                same field and each containing a non                obstante clause. Each clause, in fact,\n               declares that its provisions will have effect                'notwithstanding anything inconsistent                therewith contained in any other law for                the time being in force'. The conflict in such                cases is resolved on consideration of                purpose and policy underlying the                enactments and the language used in                them. Another test applied is that the later                enactment normally prevails over the                earlier one. It is also relevant to consider                as to whether either of the two enactments                can be described a special one; in that                case the special one may prevail over the                more general one notwithstanding that the                general one is later in time. \n               63. In fact, the Arbitration Act and the                Commercial Courts Act, both central                enactments, have employed this 'non-                obstante clause' at more than one place. \n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                        Page 30 of 36                  Precisely for this reason, Kandla Export                 Corporation has harmoniously resolved                 this imbroglio: that the Arbitration Act                 prevails when it concerns the parties'\n                substantive rights, and the Commercial                 Courts Act does when it concerns the                 parties' procedural rights.\"\n                49. The Bombay High Court then undertook an           analysis of the un-amended provisions of the CC Act           and noted that there is a two-tier Court at the district           level. One is the Commercial Court of original           jurisdiction and another at the District Judge level of           the Commercial Appellate Court. The approach in           Kandla Exports (supra) about the CC Act being           procedural     in   nature    and    therefore   having           retrospective effect, found support in the decision in           New India Assurance Company Limited v. Shanti           Misra (1975) 2 SCC 840, where a three-Judge Bench           held that once there was a change not in the           substantive law but in the procedural law, it would           operate retrospectively and 'the person has to go to the           new forum even if his cause of action or right of action           accrued prior to the change of forum'. The relevant           passage of the decision of the Bombay High Court in           Gaurang Mangesh Suctancar v. Sonia Gaurang           Suctancar , reads as under:\n\n                \"92. Evidently, the Commercial Courts Act                 is a later enactment, but it does not work                 at cross purpose with the Arbitration Act. \n                In fact, both aim at speedy adjudication. \n                The Commercial Courts Act covers all the                 commercial      disputes,   whereas     the                 Arbitration Act covers only those disputes                 that involve arbitration. As Kandla Export                 Corporation has held, both the enactments                 call for a harmonious interpretation. If at                 all there is any conflict, as to the                 substantive provisions, the Arbitration Act                 prevails; but it has left the procedural                 niceties to the Commercial Courts Act.\"\n                50. The Court finds merit in the contention on           behalf of the Opposite Parties that the A&C Act must           yield to the CC Act and not vice versa given that the           objective of both enactments is the speedy disposal of           the cases and the CC Act was a later enactment. There           is no apparent conflict between the A&C Act and the           CC Act for being resolved. The objective of both is the           speedy resolution of the disputes . As far as challenge           to the vires of Section 10 of the CC Act is concerned,\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                      Page 31 of 36            indeed no ground has been made out before this Court           to show how Section 10 of the CC Act is ultra vires the           legislative powers of the Parliament or how it is           'manifestly arbitrary'. The         identification   of           commercial disputes as distinct from ordinary           civil disputes is based on an intelligible           differentia and subjecting them to a special           expedited procedure can neither be considered to           be arbitrary nor ultra vires the A&C Act. That           prayer, therefore, has to be rejected.\n                51. Incidentally, there is no challenge to either           Section 15 or 21 of the CC Act. If indeed commercial           cases      involving     arbitral     disputes     have           necessarily to be transferred under Section 10(3)\n          read with Section 15(2) of the CC Act , then as a           natural corollary the Commercial Court alone           will have to decide those disputes and not of the           Court in terms of the A&C Act. In passing the           impugned orders transferring the cases, the D&SJ has           not committed any illegality nor has the Senior Civil           Judge, Commercial Court, Bhubaneswar committed           any illegality in accepting the cases on transfer and           proceeding with them in accordance with law.\" \n\n                                          (Emphasis supplied) \n\n17.          The Judgment of this court in M.G. Mohanty (supra) being challenged before the Supreme Court, the same was upheld in Jaycee Housing Pvt. Ltd. (supra). Paragraphs 6, 10 & 11 of the said judgment, being relevant, are reproduced below: \n\n          \"6. The question of law arising for consideration           in the present appeal is, whether in exercise of           powers under Section 3 of the Commercial Courts           Act, 2015, the State Government can confer           jurisdiction to hear applications under Sections           9, 14 and 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation           Act, 1996, upon Commercial Courts which are           subordinate to the rank of the Principal Civil           Judge in the District, contrary to the provisions           of Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act?\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                     Page 32 of 36            10. Thus, the Objects and Reasons of Commercial           Courts Act, 2015 is to provide for speedy disposal of           the commercial disputes which includes the arbitration           proceedings. To achieve the said Objects, the           legislature in its wisdom has specifically conferred the           jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters as per           Section 10 of the Act, 2015. At this stage, it is           required to be noted that the Act, 2015 is the Act           later in time and therefore when the Act, 2015           has been enacted, more particularly Sections 3 &\n          10, there was already a provision contained in           Section 2(1)(e) of the Act, 1996. As per settled           position of law, it is to be presumed that while           enacting the subsequent law, the legislature is           conscious of the provisions of the Act prior in           time and therefore the later Act shall prevail. It is           also required to be noted that even as per Section 15 of           the Act, 2015, all suits and applications including           applications under the Act, 1996, relating to a           commercial dispute of specified value shall have to be           transferred to the Commercial Court. Even as per           Section 21 of the Act, 2015, Act, 2015 shall have           overriding effect. It provides that save as           otherwise provided, the provisions of this Act           shall have effect, notwithstanding anything           inconsistent therewith contained in any other           law for the time being in force.\n\n          11. Therefore, considering the afore stated provisions           of the Act, 2015 and the Objects and Reasons for           which the Act, 2015 has been enacted and the           Commercial     Courts,    Commercial       Division   and           Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts are           established for speedy disposal of the commercial           disputes including the arbitration disputes, Sections 3           & 10 of the Act, 2015 shall prevail and all           applications or appeals arising out of arbitration           under the provisions of Act, 1996, other than           international commercial arbitration, shall be           filed in and heard and disposed of by the           Commercial Courts, exercising the territorial           jurisdiction over such arbitration where such           commercial courts have been constituted. If the           submission on behalf of the appellants that all           applications/appeals arising out of arbitration under           the provisions of Act, 1996, other than the           international commercial arbitration, shall lie before           the principal civil Court of a district, in that case, not           only the Objects and Reasons of enactment of Act,\n          2015 and establishment of commercial courts shall be W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                        Page 33 of 36            frustrated, even Sections 3, 10 & 15 shall become           otiose and nugatory. If the submission on behalf of           the appellants is accepted, in that case, though           with respect to other commercial disputes, the           applications or appeals shall lie before the           commercial courts established and constituted           under Section 3 of Act, 2015, with respect to           arbitration proceedings, the applications or           appeals shall lie before the principal civil Court           of a district. There cannot be two fora with           respect to different commercial disputes. \n                Under the circumstances, notification issued by           the State of Odisha issued in consultation with the           High Court of Orissa to confer jurisdiction upon the           court of learned Civil Judge (Senior Division)\n          designated as Commercial Court to decide the           applications or appeals arising out of arbitration under           the provisions of Act, 1996 cannot be said to be illegal           and bad in law. On the contrary, the same can be said           to be absolutely in consonance with Sections 3 & 10 of           Act, 2015. We are in complete agreement with the view           taken by the High Court holding so.\"\n\n                                           (Emphasis supplied)\n\n18.          Law is well settled that the Court under section 9 of the Act, 1996 is only to formulate interim measure so as to protect the right under adjudication before the Arbitral Tribunal from being frustrated. In view of the provisions enshrined under section 10(3) read with the definition of \"Commercial Dispute\" and \"Specified Value\", as defined under section 2(1)(c) & (i) of the CC Act, 2015 respectively, in addition to the settled position of law, as detailed above, this Court is of the view that only Suits and Applications, which require to give a declaration regarding the valuation of Suit/Application, which will be further subjected to valuation,\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                      Page 34 of 36  if so required, to be determined in terms of section 12 of the CC Act, 2015, will be the decisive factor to approach the fora under the CC Act, 2015. This Court is of further view that, in view of definition of \"Specified Value\" under section 2(1)(i) of the CC Act, 2015, the same is not applicable to a section 9 application     for   determination   of   the   jurisdiction   of   a Commercial Court to consider such application and the Commercial Courts, where such Courts have been established in the state, are only competent to hear and decide the section 9 application filed under the Act, 1996.\n\n19.           This Court is of further view that section 15 of the CC Act, 2015 regarding transfer of suits and applications being only applicable to pending cases, the District Judge,\n\nCuttack ought to have returned the section 9 application to the Petitioner for its presentation before the Court of the Senior Civil Judge (Commercial Court), Cuttack. However,\n\nduring hearing of the said application, realizing the fact that the said Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the said application,\n\nafter assessing the cost of such application to be more than rupees five lakhs, as is permissible under section 12 of the CC Act, 2015 (though it was not so required in a section 9 W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                 Page 35 of 36  application), it was rightly ordered to transfer the matter to the Commercial Court. \n\n20.          In view of the detailed discussions made in the forgoing paragraphs, this Court is also of the view that the plea of the Petitioner regarding lack of jurisdiction of the Commercial Court to adjudicate an application under section 9 of the Act, 1996, in absence of any valuation, is misconceived. Both the points emerged, detailed above, are answered accordingly. \n\n21.          There being no infirmity in the impugned order passed in ARBP No.02 of 2024, the Writ Petition stands dismissed. No order as to cost. \n\n\n\n\n                                          ................................... \n                                            S.K.
