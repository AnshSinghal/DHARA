In this appeal from order under Order XLIII rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Code\") read with section 13 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015, the appellant has called in question the order dated 1st January, 2019 passed by the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad below applications Exhibit 7 and Exhibit 1 in Commercial Trademark Suit No.1 of 2019. \n2. Certain facts which may be necessary to decide this appeal are:\nThe first respondent - M/s Red Ribbon Entertainment Private Limited (original plaintiff) has come with a case that one Kartik Patel has conceptualized the idea of the disputed song/music composition/video of \"Char Bangadi Wari Gaadi\" in November 2015 with the help of professional team Kathiawadi Kings and turned the idea into a successful music video on 5 th September, 2016. Mr. Kartik Patel became the owner of the said copyright work. The final song was uploaded on YouTube on 29th September, 2016. On 20th December, 2016, the appellant and the respondents No.2 and 3 (original defendants No.1 to 3) copied the wordings and the music and recorded the same song and uploaded the video of the song on YouTube on 20th December, 2016, thereby infringing the copyright of the plaintiff. \nMr. Kartik Patel executed a deed of assignment in respect of the copyright of the song in favour of the plaintiff on 18th April, 2017. On 3rd January, 2017, the plaintiff's predecessor had filed a copyright infringement notice at YouTube claiming that their original work had been copied by the defendants and urging them to remove the same. The defendants filed a counter copyright infringement claiming that their work was original and was sung by Kinjal Dave (the appellant herein) and the lyrics were written by Manu Rabari. On 23rd February, 2017, the plaintiff sent a legal notice to the defendants alleging infringement of copyright. The defendants gave their reply to such notice on 7th March, 2017. It is further the case of the plaintiff that the defendants agreed to settle the matter by way of paying royalty but for one reason or the other, avoided settling the matter. \nThe plaintiff came to know about the dispute between the defendants and his predecessor after the deed of assignment was executed. Thereafter, the plaintiff immediately contacted the defendants to refrain from committing such illegal acts and pay compensation for illegal use of the said copyright work. The second respondent agreed to the same. However, the defendants did not abide by the same and continued to infringe the copyright. \nThe plaintiff, therefore, instituted the suit being Commercial Trademark Suit No.1 of 2019. The plaint and the application under Order XXXIX rules 1 and 2 of the Code came to be verified on 14th November, 2018 and the suit and the interim injunction application were actually moved on 1st January, 2019, on which date the Commercial Court passed the impugned order. \n3. Mr. Harshit Tolia, learned advocate with Mr. J. V. Vaghela, learned advocate for the appellant (original defendant No.1) drew the attention of the court to the provisions of rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code, to submit that the same mandates that if the court proposes to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite party, the court shall record the reasons for its opinion that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by delay. Referring to the impugned order, it was submitted that in the entire order, there is no discussion whatsoever to the effect that non-grant of injunction would be defeated by delay. It was submitted that the Commercial Court has merely considered the aspect of prima facie case and balance of convenience and has granted an ex parte injunction without complying with the requirement of rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code. \n3.1 Reliance was placed upon the decisions of the Supreme Court in Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund v. Kartick Das, (1994) 4 SCC 225 and Shiv Kumar Chadha v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi, (1993) 3 SCC 161, for the proposition that whenever a court considers it necessary in the facts and circumstances of a particular case to pass an order of injunction without notice to other side, it must record the reasons for doing so and should take into consideration, while passing an order of injunction, all relevant factors, including as to how the object of granting injunction itself shall be defeated if an ex parte order is not passed. \n3.2 It was further submitted that in the application under Order XXXIX rules 1 and 2 of the Code, there are no pleadings for ex parte injunction. Moreover, the conduct of the plaintiff was required to be taken into consideration, viz., that though the suit was filed in November, 2018, it was not moved till 1 st January, 2019, which is clearly indicative of the fact that the matter was not just urgent. It was urged that in these circumstances, the Commercial Court was not justified in granting ex parte interim injunction. \n4. Vehemently opposing the appeal, Mr. Sunit Shah, learned counsel with Mr. Virendra Patel, learned advocate for the respondent No.1 (original plaintiff) submitted that while considering the present appeal from order, the conduct of the appellant is also required to be taken into consideration. It was submitted that the Commercial Court issued notice on 1st January, 2019 and the same was served on the appellant on or about 4th January, 2019, but the appellant waited till the returnable date, that is, 22nd January, 2019 before moving the present appeal, instead of filing its response to the plaint and injunction application. Reliance was placed upon the decision of a learned Single Judge of this court in the case of J M S Labs v. Yusufali Eesmail Hadvaid, 1998 (2) GLR 1776, wherein the court despite finding that the reasons given by the trial court did not show how the ends of justice would be defeated by waiting for the grant of ad-interim injunction till the first returnable date, wherein the normal course would be to stay the operation of the ex parte injunction, observed that three cumulative features dissuaded him from granting such stay, the first being that the appeal was filed without filing a reply to the interim injunction application before the trial court though the defendant had nine days time to do so and without making a request before the trial court to vacate the ex parte injunction. It was submitted that the above decision would be squarely applicable to the facts of the present case and that the court may, therefore, not vacate the ex parte injunction, but fix a schedule for filing reply/rejoinder/hearing as has been done in that case. \n4.1 Reliance was also placed upon an unreported decision dated 23.12.2015 of a learned Single Judge of this court in the case of Angur Foods Private Limited v. Patel Chaturbhai Ranchhodbhai and Co. rendered in Appeal from Order No.373 of 2015, wherein while disposing of the appeal, it was observed thus:\n\"6. Only one relevant aspect, I would like to refer is the suit filed on 24.11.2015. Notice was made returnable on 19.12.2015. On filing of the suit, the trial Court has granted ex-parte interim relief. Having granted interim relief ex-parte, Court ought to have made returnable date of some shorter period, but in the present case it is material to note that notice, injunction etc. were served to the appellants within two days i.e. on 28.11.2015. The appellants appeared before the trial Court only on returnable date i.e. on 19.12.2015 and have filed their reply etc. Matter came up before in-charge judge, on that date, hence, it was kept on 22.12.2015. Interim relief was extended till then. The present appeal is filed on 20.12.2015. In the circumstances of the case, submissions of learned counsel for the appellants for vacating the interim relief is not possible to accept.\" \nIt was submitted that considering the conduct of the appellant in waiting till the returnable date before filing the present appeal from order this court may not interfere with the impugned order and relegate the appellant to the Commercial Court for seeking vacation of the ex parte interim injunction.\n5. From the rival contentions noted hereinabove, it is evident that the main plank of the submissions of the learned advocate for the appellant for assailing the impugned order is that it has been passed without following the mandate of the provisions of rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code and is, therefore, invalid. It may, therefore, be apposite to refer to the provisions of rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code which reads thus:\n\"3. Before granting injunction, Court to direct notice to opposite party -The Court shall in all cases, except where it appears that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay, before granting an injunction, direct notice of the application for the same to be given to the opposite party.\nProvided that, where it is proposed to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite party, the Court shall record the reasons for its opinion that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by delay, and require the applicant- (a) to deliver to the opposite party, or to send to him by registered post, immediately after the order granting the injunction has been made, a copy of the application for injunction together with- (i) a copy of the affidavit filed in support of the application;\n(ii) a copy of the plaint; and (iii) copies of documents on which the applicant relies, and (b) to file, on the day on which such injunction is granted or on the day immediately following that day, an affidavit stating that the copies aforesaid have been so delivered or sent.\" \n6. Thus, rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code contemplates issuance of notice of the application to the opposite party before granting an injunction except where the object of granting injunction would be defeated by the delay. In terms of the proviso thereto, the court is required to record the reasons for its opinion that the object of granting injunction would be defeated by delay. The proviso further requires the applicant to take action in terms of clauses (a) and (b) thereunder. The present case is confined to the obligation cast upon the court to record reasons for its opinion that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by delay. \n7. In the light of the above statutory provision, it may be germane to examine the findings recorded by the Commercial Court to ascertain whether the requirements of the proviso to rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code have been complied with. A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the first two paragraphs merely refer to the institution of the suit and the application below Exhibit 7. In the third paragraph, the Commercial Court has referred to the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the plaintiff. In paragraphs 4 and 5 of the order, the Commercial Court has recorded its findings as under:\n\"4. I have considered the submissions of the Learned Counsel for the plaintiff and perused the record and also both the songs played by the Learned Counsel for the plaintiff, before this Court. At this juncture, prima-facie, it appears that the wording and music of both the songs are deceptively similar and the defendants have copied \"Char Bangadi Wari Gadi' from the plaintiff's song. Therefore, at this juncture, in my considered view, the plaintiff has prima-facie case in its favour and balance of convenience also lies in favour of the plaintiff. \nIn these facts and circumstances of the case, issue summons to the suit and notice of the present application upon the defendants, returnable on 22nd January, 2019, on furnishing the complete set of paper- book, with postal cover and A.D. Card duly affixed with requisite postal stamp, within three days from today. \nDirect Service is permitted. Service through e-mail is also permitted. \n5. In the meantime, the defendants, their successors, servant, agents, director and/or partners are hereby restrained from selling, conducting live stage concerts, online download forum, in form of music cassette, CD's and imitating the said copyright work in any manner which is similar to the plaintiff's copyright work in the song having title \"Char Bangadi Wari Gadi\", till the next date of hearing. \nCompliance of Order 39 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, within three days.\" \n8. Thus, in paragraph 4, the Commercial Court has recorded a finding that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case in its favour and that the balance of convenience also lies in its favour and has ordered issuance of notice to the defendants, returnable on 22nd January, 2019, that is, after three weeks from the date of issuance of notice. In paragraph 5, the Commercial Court has granted interim relief against the defendants till the next date of hearing. \n9. On reading the impugned order in its entirety, it is evident that there is no discussion whatsoever as to how the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by delay. The Commercial Court has not referred to the other facts of the case as to when the cause of action had first arisen, the stage at which the plaintiff had instituted the suit and when it had been moved for hearing. Merely on the basis of two findings as regards prima facie case and balance of convenience, without considering the third factor regarding irreparable injury and without complying with the mandate of the proviso to rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code and recording its opinion as to how the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by delay, the Commercial Court has granted ex parte interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff. \n10. Rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code came up for interpretation before the Supreme Court in Shiv Kumar Chadha v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi (supra), wherein it was held thus:\n32. Power to grant injunction is an extraordinary power vested in the court to be exercised taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of a particular case. The courts have to be more cautious when the said power is being exercised without notice or hearing the party who is to be affected by the order so passed. That is why Rule 3 of Order 39 of the Code requires that in all cases the court shall, before grant of an injunction, direct notice of the application to be given to the opposite- party, except where it appears that object of granting injunction itself would be defeated by delay. By the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1976, a proviso has been added to the said rule saying that \"where it is proposed to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite-party, the court shall record the reasons for its opinion that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by delay...\". \n33. It has come to our notice that in spite of the aforesaid statutory requirement, the courts have been passing orders of injunction before issuance of notices or hearing the parties against whom such orders are to operate without recording the reasons for passing such orders. It is said that if the reasons for grant of injunction are mentioned, a grievance can be made by the other side that court has prejudged the issues involved in the suit. According to us, this is a misconception about the nature and the scope of interim orders. It need not be pointed out that any opinion expressed in connection with an interlocutory application has no bearing and shall not affect any party, at the stage of the final adjudication. Apart from that now in view of the proviso to Rule 3 aforesaid, there is no scope for any argument. When the statute itself requires reasons to be recorded, the court cannot ignore that requirement by saying that if reasons are recorded, it may amount to expressing an opinion in favour of the plaintiff before hearing the defendant. \n34. The imperative nature of the proviso has to be judged in the context of Rule 3 of Order 39 of the Code. Before the proviso aforesaid was introduced, Rule 3 said \"the court shall in all cases, except where it appears that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay, before granting an injunction, direct notice of the application for the same to be given to the opposite-party\". The proviso was introduced to provide a condition, where court proposes to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite- party, being of the opinion that the object of granting injunction itself shall be defeated by delay. The condition so introduced is that the court \"shall record the reasons\"\nwhy an ex parte order of injunction was being passed in the facts and circumstances of a particular case. In this background, the requirement for recording the reasons for grant of ex parte injunction, cannot be held to be a mere formality. This requirement is consistent with the principle, that a party to a suit, who is being restrained from exercising a right which such party claims to exercise either under a statute or under the common law, must be informed why instead of following the requirement of Rule 3, the procedure prescribed under the proviso has been followed. The party which invokes the jurisdiction of the court for grant of an order of restraint against a party, without affording an opportunity to him of being heard, must satisfy the court about the gravity of the situation and court has to consider briefly these factors in the ex parte order. We are quite conscious of the fact that there are other statutes which contain similar provisions requiring the court or the authority concerned to record reasons before exercising power vested in them. In respect of some of such provisions it has been held that they are required to be complied with but non-compliance therewith will not vitiate the order so passed. But same cannot be said in respect of the proviso to Rule 3 of Order 39. The Parliament has prescribed a particular procedure for passing of an order of injunction without notice to the other side, under exceptional circumstances. Such ex parte orders have far-reaching effect, as such a condition has been imposed that court must record reasons before passing such order. If it is held that the compliance with the proviso aforesaid is optional and not obligatory, then the introduction of the proviso by the Parliament shall be a futile exercise and that part of Rule 3 will be a surplusage for all practical purposes. Proviso to Rule 3 of Order 39 of the Code, attracts the principle, that if a statute requires a thing to be done in a particular manner, it should be done in that manner or not all. This principle was approved and accepted in well-known cases of Taylor v. Taylor,(1875) 1 Ch. D. 426 and Nazir Ahmed v. Emperor, AIR 1936 PC 253. This Court has also expressed the same view in respect of procedural requirement of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act in the case of Ramchandra Keshav Adke v. Govind Joti Chavare, AIR 1975 SC 915.\n35. As such whenever a court considers it necessary in the facts and circumstances of a particular case to pass an order of injunction without notice to other side, it must record the reasons for doing so and should take into consideration, while passing an order of injunction, all relevant factors, including as to how the object of granting injunction itself shall be defeated if an ex parte order is not passed. But any such ex parte order should be in force up to a particular date before which the plaintiff should be required to serve the notice on the defendant concerned. In the Supreme Court Practice 1993, Vol. 1, at page 514, reference has been made to the views of the English Courts saying:\n\"Ex parte injunctions are for cases of real urgency where there has been a true impossibility of giving notice of motion.... \nAn ex parte injunction should generally be until a certain day, usually the next motion day....\" \n11. In Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund v. Kartick Das (supra), the Supreme Court followed the above decision and also stated the factors which should weigh with the court in the grant of ex parte injunction, the relevant part whereof is extracted hereunder:\n\"\"36. As a principle, ex parte injunction could be granted only under exceptional circumstances. The factors which should weigh with the court in the grant of ex parte injunction are-- (a) whether irreparable or serious mischief will ensue to the plaintiff;\n(b) whether the refusal of ex parte injunction would involve greater injustice than the grant of it would involve;\n(c) the court will also consider the time at which the plaintiff first had notice of the act complained so that the making of improper order against a party in his absence is prevented; \n(d) the court will consider whether the plaintiff had acquiesced for sometime and in such circumstances it will not grant ex parte injunction;\n(e) the court would expect a party applying for ex parte injunction to show utmost good faith in making the application. \n(f) even if granted, the ex parte injunction would be for a limited period of time. \n(g) General principles like prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss would also be considered by the court.\"\n12. Examining the facts of the present case in the light of the above principles, for the purpose of grant of ex parte interim injunction, the following factors, inter alia, were required to be taken into consideration:\n(i) The court would consider the time at which the plaintiff first had notice of the act complained so that the making of improper order against a party in his absence is prevented;\n(ii) the court would expect the party applying for ex parte injunction to show utmost good faith in making the application;\nand,\n(iii) general principles like prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss would also be considered by the court. \n13. Insofar as the first factor is concerned, the facts reveal that the predecessor of the plaintiff had notice of the act complained as early as in January 2017 when he took action against the defendants by filing a \"Copyright infringement notice\". In February 2017, the predecessor of the plaintiff sent a legal notice to the defendants, to which the defendant No.2 replied on 7th March, 2017. The plaintiff's predecessor Mr. Kartik Patel assigned the rights in respect of the copyright work in favour of the plaintiff on 18th April, 2017. The plaintiff appears to be aware of the alleged infringement as can be culled out from the averments made in the plaint namely that the defendant No.2 had agreed to pay compensation and stop using the copyright work, he failed to live up to the promise. However, no action was taken by the plaintiff at the relevant time. Much later, the plaintiff instituted the suit in question being Commercial Trademark Suit No.1 of 2019. The plaint and the application under Order XXXIX rule 1 and 2 of the Code came to be verified on 14th November, 2018 and the suit and injunction application were actually moved after more than a month and came up for hearing on 1st January, 2019, on which date the Commercial Court passed the impugned order. In the opinion of this court, all these factors were relevant factors which should have been taken into consideration by the Commercial Court at the time of passing the ex parte injunction order. Apart from the delay in instituting the suit despite having notice of the alleged infringement of copyright, even after the suit was filed, the same was not moved for over a month. Evidently therefore, there was no urgency in the matter warranting grant of ex parte injunction. Unfortunately, the Commercial Court has failed to examine these aspects which were relevant for the purpose of considering the question of grant of ex parte interim injunction. In the opinion of this court, having regard to the aforesaid glaring facts, neither of the first two factors has been satisfied in the facts of the present case. \n14. Insofar as the third factor is concerned, while the Commercial Court has recorded satisfaction regarding prima facie case and balance of convenience in favour of the plaintiff, however, there is no finding as regards the irreparable loss. Therefore, the ingredients of the third factor have also not been fully satisfied. \n15. Insofar as compliance with the provisions of Order XXXIX rule 3 of the Code is concerned, in the above cited decisions, the Supreme Court has held that the imperative nature of the proviso has to be judged in the context of rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code. Before the proviso aforesaid was introduced, rule 3 said \"the court shall in all cases, except where it appears that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay, before granting an injunction, direct notice of the application for the same to be given to the opposite-party\". The proviso was introduced to provide a condition, where court proposes to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite-party, being of the opinion that the object of granting injunction itself shall be defeated by delay. The condition so introduced is that the court \"shall record the reasons\" why an ex parte order of injunction was being passed in the facts and circumstances of a particular case. In this background, the requirement for recording the reasons for grant of ex parte injunction cannot be held to be a mere formality. This requirement is consistent with the principle, that a party to a suit, who is being restrained from exercising a right which such party claims to exercise either under a statute or under the common law, must be informed why instead of following the requirement of rule 3, the procedure prescribed under the proviso has been followed. The party which invokes the jurisdiction of the court for grant of an order of restraint against a party, without affording an opportunity to him of being heard, must satisfy the court about the gravity of the situation and the court has to consider briefly these factors in the ex parte order. It has been further held that the Parliament has prescribed a particular procedure for passing of an order of injunction without notice to the other side, under exceptional circumstances. Such ex parte orders have far-reaching effect, as such a condition has been imposed that court must record reasons before passing such order. If it is held that the compliance with the proviso aforesaid is optional and not obligatory, then the introduction of the proviso by the Parliament shall be a futile exercise and that part of rule 3 will be a surplusage for all practical purposes. The proviso to rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code, attracts the principle, that if a statute requires a thing to be done in a particular manner, it should be done in that manner or not at all. \n16. Thus, it is mandatory for the court to record its reasons, howsoever briefly, as to why it proposes to grant ex parte interim injunction without giving notice to the opposite party. Moreover, the party which invokes the jurisdiction of the court for grant of order of restraint against a party without affording an opportunity to him of being heard must satisfy the court about the gravity of the situation and the court has to briefly consider these factors in the ex parte order. \n17. The plaintiff who has invoked the jurisdiction of this court has not satisfied the court about the gravity of the situation; moreover, the court has failed to take into consideration the relevant factors prior to granting ex parte interim injunction. The impugned order is totally bereft of any reasoning on this count, which renders it unsustainable. \n18. Besides, a perusal of the impugned order reveals that the Commercial Court is not oblivious to the provisions of the proviso to rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code, inasmuch as it has directed the plaintiff to comply with the provisions thereof; however, to the extent of the obligation cast upon the court under the said proviso, the same has been totally ignored.\n19. Insofar as the two decisions rendered by learned Single Judges of this court on which reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the respondent No.1 are concerned, wherein despite the fact that the proviso to rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code had not been complied with, the court refused to set aside the order granting ex parte injunction because the affected party had come to the court on or about the returnable date, this court is of the considered opinion that having regard to the mandatory nature of the proviso to rule 3 of Order XXXIX of the Code and the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the decisions referred to hereinabove, namely that the requirement for recording the reasons for grant of ex parte injunction cannot be held to be a mere formality and that when the statute requires a thing to be done in a particular manner it has to be done in that manner or not at all, this court is not inclined to non suit the appellant only on the ground that she has approached this court on date on which the notice was made returnable.\n20. In the light of the above discussion, the appeal succeeds and is, accordingly, allowed. The impugned order dated 1st January, 2019 passed by the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad below applications Exhibit 7 and Exhibit 1 in Commercial Trademark Suit No.1 of 2019, is hereby quashed and set aside. It is, however, directed that the appellant/defendant No.1 shall file her reply to the plaint as well as the injunction application within a period of three days from today. The first respondent (original plaintiff) shall file its rejoinder thereto, if any, within a period of two days from the date of receipt of a copy of the reply. The Commercial Court shall thereafter endeavour to hear the application Exhibit 7 and decide the same finally as expeditiously as possible, and preferably within a period of fifteen days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. Rule is made absolute accordingly with no order as to costs. \n21. It is clarified that this court has not entered into the merits of the controversy. The Commercial Court shall decide the interim injunction application independently on the merits of the case without in any manner being influenced by any observation made in this order. \nCivil Application No.1 of 2019 :\nIn the light of the order passed in the main appeal, this application for stay does not survive and is accordingly dismissed. \n(HARSHA DEVANI, J) (A.

common judgment: heard learned senior counsel sri d.prakash reddy for appellant and learned counsel sri trideep pais representing learned counsel for respondent mrs shireen sethna baira. 2. parties are referred to hereunder as arrayed before the commercial court in cop nos. 19 and 18 of 2022 on the file of the court of principal special court in the cadre of district judge for trial and disposal of commercial disputes at hyderabad. 3. petitioner and respondent entered into multi annual agreement (for short, 'maa') on 4.5.2011 for the purpose of purchase and supply of wind turbine generators for the total capacity of 2000 mw during the term from 2011 to 2016. said maa provided for committed minimum volume of 1635 in megawatts which was mandatorily to be off taken by the respondent for each delivery year commencing from 2011 till 2016 and supplied by the petitioner. maa provided that in the event of failure of either party to comply with their mandatory obligations, the breaching party is liable to pay liquidated damages to other party. compliance of maa required petitioner to incur substantial investments towards pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 establishment of factory, cost of raw material, plant and machinery, changes in the inventories, financing costs, warehousing costs etc. 4. according to petitioner, soon after first purchase order was placed by the respondent for delivery in 2011, respondent continued defaulting on its commitments to off take annual volume of wtgs. according to petitioner even the first purchase order was defective and falling short of requirements. having regard to the defaults committed by the respondent, petitioner issued demand letters claiming liquidated damages. as issue was not resolved in spite of several efforts made, petitioner invoked the arbitration clause as provided in maa by raising two independent arbitration claims for liquidated damages covering the period from 2011-2014 and 2015 respectively. arbitral tribunal comprised of hon'ble justice m jagannatha rao, retired judge supreme court of india as presiding arbitrator, mr. justice balasubramaniah, retired judge, madras high court and mr justice c.v.ramulu retired judge, high court of andhra pradesh as co-arbitrators. the arbitral tribunal passed final arbitral awards on 15.7.2021 in dispute nos.1 and 2 separately covering two separate periods, viz., years 2011-2014 and 2015. in arbitration case no.1 of 2018 the arbitral tribunal awarded 295,44,94,116/that include interest component @ 9% per annum from 31.3.2018 to 15.7.2021, after adjusting the counter-claim. the pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 arbitral tribunal also directed return of two bank guarantees and two corporate guarantees. 5. in arbitration case no.2 of 2018 the arbitral tribunal awarded liquidated damages and interest of 141,57,13,562/up to 15.7.2021. the tribunal further granted interest @ 6 % from 15.7.2021. the further claim of petitioner for 438,26,79,452/and counter claim of 129,58,94,884/was rejected. 6. after passing of the awards, petitioner filed c.o.p.no.18 of 2022 (subject matter of comca no.7 of 2023) and c.o.p.no.19 of 2022 (subject matter of comca no.6 of 2023) on the file of the court of principal special court in the cadre of district judge for trial and disposal of commercial disputes at hyderabad under section 9 of the arbitration and conciliation act,1996 ( act,1996). 7.1. in c.o.p.no.19 of 2022 petitioner prayed to grant the following reliefs: \"it is, therefore, most humbly and respectfully prayed that in view of the above facts and circumstances the hon'ble court be pleased to: a) direct the respondent to deposit a sum of inr 141,57,13,562/ (indian rupees one hundred forty-one crore fifty-seven lakhs thirteen thousand five hundred sixty-two only) along with applicable interest @6% from the date of arbitral award till its realisation before this hon'ble court, until the execution of the arbitral award or the award is set-aside by the hon'ble court under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act 1996; b) in the alternative, direct the respondent to furnish security in the form of bank guarantees or cash deposits before this hon'ble court, to pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 the extent of in 141.57,13,562/(indian rupees one hundred forty-one crore fifty-seven lakhs thirteen thousand five hundred sixty two only) along with applicable interest @6% from the date of arbitral award till its realisation; and c) restrain the respondent from alienating, transferring, mortgaging, encumbering, or creating any kind of third-party rights or interests of whatsoever nature on their assets belonging to the respondent company or its subsidiary companies, until the execution of the arbitral award or the award is set-aside by the hon'ble court under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act 1996; d) direct the respondent to declare all its immovable and movable assets

respectfully prayed that in view of the above. facts and circumstances the hon'ble court be pleased to: a) direct the respondent to deposit a sum of in 295,44,94,116/-(indian rupees two hundred

proper to secure the amount mentioned in the arbitral award and all the claims of the petitioner and in the facts and circumstances of the present case.\" pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 8. on due consideration of the respective submissions, by elaborate order, the commercial court partly allowed the petitions. in c.o.p.no.19 of 2022 the commercial court directed to declare all its movable and immovable assets including the assets which are free from any charge, mortgage, pledge or any form of encumbrance or third party rights and to return the bank guarantee and the corporate guarantees given by the petitioner within 30 days from the date of order. in c.o.p.no.18 of 2022, the commercial court directed to declare all its movable and immovable assets including the assets which are free from any charge, mortgage, pledge or any form of encumbrance or third party rights and to return the bank guarantee and the corporate guarantees given by the petitioner within 30 days from the date of order. 9. the legality and validity of the orders passed by the commercial court in cop nos.19 and 18 of 2022 respectively are challenged in these appeals. 10. the learned senior counsel sri d.prakash reddy appearing for respondent contended that the commercial court grossly erred in passing orders impugned in these appeals. in section 9 application, remedy is available only till the award passed by the arbitral tribunal is executable and once award is executable the person in whose favour award is passed has to seek enforcement of the award under section 36 pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 of the act by following the procedure laid down in civil procedure code. this fact was not appreciated by the learned commercial court and grossly erred in granting the relief. according to learned senior counsel, the commercial court has no jurisdiction and competence to pass such orders. by referring to the relief granted in c.o.p.no.19 of 2022 directing the respondent to return the bank guarantee, he would submit that this clearly shows non application of mind by the commercial court. the relief is granted in excess of the reliefs prayed and therefore the said order suffers from jurisdictional error. he would therefore submit that the orders under challenge are liable to be set aside. 11. per contra, according to sri trideep pais, learned counsel for respondent, scope of section 9 application is very wide and it co-exists vis-à-vis the execution proceedings under section 36 of the act. he would submit that merely because award is executable does not take away the application of section 9 at the instance of the decree holder. he would submit that what was available to the decree holder prior to amendment of section 36 of the act, cannot take away by virtue of amendment and decree holder cannot be put to a worse position than what was available then. he would submit that according to section 9 post award also interlocutory reliefs can be sought by the decree holder till award is enforced. the principle of law is well settled and needs no pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 reiteration. he would therefore submit that trial court rightly passed orders granting limited reliefs to the petitioner. 11.1. regarding bank guarantees, he would submit that the bank guarantees have lapsed long ago, therefore they cannot be encashed, but since respondent has not returned the bank guarantees, the petitioner's bankers have kept the accounts as running accounts and penal interest is charged on these accounts causing lot of hardship and suffering to the petitioner. further, since bank guarantees are not closed, the entitlement of the petitioner to secure further bank guarantees/advances is severally affected, therefore keeping the bank guarantees by the respondent is causing grave prejudice and irreparable hardship to the petitioner. 11.2. he would submit that taking recourse to the provisions of civil procedure code for enforcement of the awards is a long drawn process, having regard to the procedural compliances required to be observed. the remedy provided by section 9 of the act enables preservation of concerned assets pending consideration of the applications under section 34 and pending enforcement of the decree by taking recourse to section 36 of the act. further, petitioner does not have the information regarding assets and liabilities of the respondent and unless such information is made available it is difficult to enforce the awards. though pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 petitioner sought larger reliefs only limited reliefs are granted by the court below and unless such measures are enforced, there is every possibility of the respondent alienating the properties frustrating the fruits of the awards obtained by the petitioner. therefore, such measures are required to safeguard the interest of the decree holder. further, the longer bank guarantees are kept by the respondent, more hardship being caused to petitioner and he cannot be compelled to wait till the execution of decrees under section 36. he would submit that there is no overlapping of the provisions in section 36 vis-a-vis section 9 of the act. 11.3. in support of his contention, learned counsel placed reliance on following decisions: i) essar house private limited vs. arcellor mittal nippon steel india limited1; ii) dirk india private limited vs. maharashtra state electricity generation company limited2; iii) wind world (india) ltd., vs. enercon gmbh and others3; iv) a.ashraf vs. kasim v.k.,4; v) mahco monsanto biotech (india) pvt. ltd., vs. nuziveedu seeds ltd.,5; vi) m/s.samson maritime limited vs. m/s. hardy exploration & production (india) inc.,6 2022 scc online sc 1219 2013 scc online bom

authority of india vs. m.hakeem and another7 12. in reply, learned senior counsel sri d.prakash reddy would contend that since main relief was not granted, it was not permissible for the commercial court to grant ancillary relief. petitioner has not come in appeal against refusal to grant main relief. as respondent to these appeals, petitioner cannot seek to expand the scope of order passed by the commercial court as commercial court only granted two reliefs which are ancillary but refused to grant principal reliefs, petitioner has no say in the matter. 13. the issue for consideration is whether the decree holder can take recourse to section 98 of the act, 1996 seeking interlocutory measures 2016 scc online mad 9122 (2021) 9 scc 1 section 9 : interim measures, etc., by court : (1) a party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36, apply to a court-(i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely:-(a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement; (b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration; (c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence; (d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver; (e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient; and the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it. (2) where, before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, a court passes an order for any interim measure of protection under sub-section (1), the arbitral proceedings shall be commenced pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 pending initiation of execution proceedings under section 369 of the act, 1996. 14. from a bare reading of section 9 of the act, it is manifest that at 3 stages aggrieved person can take recourse to section 9 of the act for seeking interlocutory protection/to grant appropriate measures, before initiation of arbitral proceedings on a dispute inter-parties, during the arbitral proceedings, and after the award is passed. 15. section 36 is about enforcement of award. decree-holder can seek to enforce award after expiry of period to avail remedy under section 34 by opposite party or though application is filed under section 34 but the award is not stayed. enforcement of the award has to be as per civil within a period of ninety days from the date of such order or within such further time as the court may determine. (3) once the arbitral tribunal has been constituted, the court shall not entertain an application under sub-section (1), unless the court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under section 17 efficacious. section 36 :enforcement : (1) where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under section 34 has expired, then, subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), such award shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court. (2) where an application to set aside the arbitral award has been filed in the court under section 34, the filing of such an application shall not by itself render that award unenforceable, unless the court grants an order of stay of the operation of the said arbitral award in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3), on a separate application made for that purpose. (3) upon filing of an application under sub-section (2) for stay of the operation of the arbitral award, the court may, subject to such conditions as it may deem fit, grant stay of the operation of such award for reasons to be recorded in writing: provided that the court shall, while considering the application for grant of stay in the case of an arbitral award for payment of money, have due regard to the provisions for grant of stay of a money decree under the provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908. pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 procedure code that requires observing lengthy procedure and may consume good amount of time. section 36 does not envisage interim measures pending enforcement of the award. having obtained award, it is the right of the decree-holder to ensure that fruits of his success are not frustrated by actions/conduct of the opposite party, by resorting to disposal of assets or creating third party interests or moving away movables from the jurisdictional limits of cause of action and, as in this case, there is no clarity on assets and liabilities of the respondent. therefore, a decree-holder can seek interim measures to preserve the assets, movable or immovable, to secure information on assets and liabilities and seek other measures so that the decree secured by him is not frustrated. 16. section 9 of the act is wide in its scope and application and steps in to aid the decree-holder. the decree-holder can take recourse to section 9 seeking interim measures to safeguard his interest till the award is enforced under section 36 of the act. it is step in aid to enforce the award. on cumulative reading of sections 9 and 36 of the act, it is apparent that there is no conflict in these two provisions. they compliment each other. pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 17. the scope of section 9 and its enforceability is no more res integra. in dirk india (p) ltd. v. dirk india (p) ltd.,10, division bench of bombay high court, presided by hon'ble dr. justice d.y.chandrachud, as a judge of bombay high court, as he then was, has analysed in depth scope of section 9 and other provisions of act, 1996. the division bench held as under: \"14. two facets of section 9 merit emphasis. the first relates to the nature of the orders that can be passed under clauses (i) and (ii). clause (i) contemplates an order appointing a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings. clause (ii) contemplates an interim measure of protection for : (a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement; (b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration; and (c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration; (d) an interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver; and (e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient. the underlying theme of each one of the sub-clauses of clause (ii) is the immediate and proximate nexus between the interim measure of protection and the preservation, protection and securing of the subject-matter of the dispute in the arbitral proceedings. in other words, the orders that are contemplated under clause (ii) are regarded as interim measures of protection intended to protect the claim in arbitration from being frustrated. the interim measure is intended to safeguard the subject-matter of the dispute in the course of the arbitral proceedings. the second facet of section 9 is the proximate nexus between the orders that are sought and the arbitral proceedings. when an interim measure of protection is sought before or during arbitral proceedings, such a measure is a step in aid to the fruition of the arbitral proceedings. when sought after an arbitral award is made but before it is enforced, the measure of protection is intended to safeguard the fruit of the proceedings until the eventual enforcement of the award. here again the measure of protection is a step in aid of enforcement. it is intended to ensure that enforcement of the award results in a realisable claim and that the award is not rendered illusory by dealings that would put the subject of the award beyond the pale of enforcement. now it is in this background that it is necessary for the court to impart a purposive interpretation to the meaning of the expression \"at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36\". under section 36, an arbitral award can be enforced under the code of civil procedure in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court. the arbitral award can be enforced where the time for making 2013 scc online bom 481 pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 an application to set aside the arbitral award under section 34 has expired or in the event of such an application having been made, it has been refused. the enforcement of an award enures to the benefit of the party who has secured an award in the arbitral proceedings. that is why the enforceability of an award under section 36 is juxtaposed in the context of two time frames, the first being where an application for setting aside an arbitral award has expired and the second where an application for setting aside an arbitral award was made but was refused. the enforceability of an award, in other words, is defined with reference to the failure of the other side to file an application for setting aside the award within the stipulated time limit or having filed such an application has failed to establish a case for setting aside the arbitral award. once a challenge to the arbitral award has either failed under section 34 having been made within the stipulated period or when no application for setting aside the arbitral award has been made within time, the arbitral award becomes enforceable at the behest of the party for whose benefit the award enures. contextually, therefore, the scheme of section 9 postulates an application for the grant of an interim measure of protection after the making of an arbitral award and before it is enforced for the benefit of the party which seeks enforcement of the award. an interim measure of protection within the meaning of section 9(ii) is intended to protect through the measure, the fruits of a successful conclusion of the arbitral proceedings. a party whose claim has been rejected in the course of the arbitral proceedings cannot obviously have an arbitral award enforced in accordance with section 36. the object and purpose of an interim measure after the passing of the arbitral award but before it is enforced is to secure the property, goods or amount for the benefit of the party which seeks enforcement.\" (emphasis supplied) 17.1. in mahyco monsanto biotech (india) pvt. ltd. (supra), learned single judge of bombay high court observed that it is for the court to protect the decreetal amount of the petitioner, and more so considering the apprehensions of the petitioner from the material on record. according to learned single judge, provisions of section 9 entitle a party who is beneficiary to an award to approach the court and seek interim measures so that the fruits of the award/decree are available to the party in execution of the award/decree and that the award is not rendered illusion or mere paper decree (paragraph 19). pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 17.2. in samson maritime limited (supra), learned single judge of the madras high court observed that exercise of power under section 9 after passing of an award cannot be construed as enforcement of award in any manner. that enforcement is a different action from the action of securing or protecting for effecting such enforcement. learned single judge observed that the decree holder has a right, is entitled to seek protection of his right so that there cannot be a delay in execution of award causing further hardship if respondent takes such action to frustrate or delay the execution of the award. 17.3. the division bench of kerala high court in m.ashraf (supra) observed that the court has to adopt a liberal approach when interim relief is sought after an arbitral award is made but before it is enforced. the measure of protection is intended to safeguard the subject matter of dispute or the fruits of the proceedings till the enforcement of the award. interim measure of protection, then sought, is a step in aid of enforcement of the award. it is intended to ensure that the award is not rendered illusory by the opposite party. (paragraph 12) 17.4. in essar house private limited (supra), the hon'ble supreme court had an occasion to consider scope of section 9 of the act. on detailed analysis of various provisions of the act, view taken by several high courts, the hon'ble supreme court observed as under: pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 \"41. section 9 of the arbitration act provides that a party may apply to a court for an interim measure or protection inter alia to (i) secure the amount in dispute in the arbitration; or (ii) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient, and the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it. 42. as argued by mr. kaul, besides the specific power of securing the amount in dispute, the courts have been empowered to pass any interim measure of protection, keeping in view the purpose of the proceedings before it. the said provision confers a residuary power on the court to pass such other interim measures of protection as may appear to be just and convenient. 43. many high courts have also proceeded on the principle that the powers of a court under section 9 of the arbitration act are wider than the powers under the provisions of the cpc. . 48. section 9 of the arbitration act confers wide power on the court to pass orders securing the amount in dispute in arbitration, whether before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, during the arbitral proceedings or at any time after making of the arbitral award, but before its enforcement in accordance with section 36 of the arbitration act. all that the court is required to see is, whether the applicant for interim measure has a good prima facie case, whether the balance of convenience is in favour of interim relief as prayed for being granted and whether the applicant has approached the court with reasonable expedition. 49. if a strong prima facie case is made out and the balance of convenience is in favour of interim relief being granted, the court exercising power under section 9 of the arbitration act should not withhold relief on the mere technicality of absence of averments, incorporating the grounds for attachment before judgment under order 38 rule 5 of the cpc. 50. proof of actual attempts to deal with, remove or dispose of the property with a view to defeat or delay the realisation of an impending arbitral award is not imperative for grant of relief under section 9 of the arbitration act. a strong possibility of diminution of assets would suffice. to assess the balance of convenience, the court is required to examine and weigh the consequences of refusal of interim relief to the applicant for interim relief in case of success in the proceedings, against the consequence of grant of the interim relief to the opponent in case the proceedings should ultimately fail.\" 17.5. from the decisions referred to above, it is beyond pale of doubt that section 9 vests residuary power in the court to pass interim measures of protection as may appear to be just and equitable and pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 particularly to safeguard the interests of the decree holder. we are in respectful agreement with the views expressed by hon'ble bombay high court, high court of madras and high court of kerala. 18. having regard to the legal position as it stands now, it is necessary to look into the pleadings of the petitioners in the c.o.ps filed under section 9 of the act, 1996. 19. in paragraph-13 of the application, petitioner states that he apprehends that during covid-19 pandemic party respondents were pursuing actions that might completely render the arbitral awards a mere paper decrees and entire arbitral proceedings a fruitless endeavour of petitioner. in paragraph-14, it is stated that his apprehension ensue from various internal reports and information available with the industry sources/news paper reports that respondents are vigorously attempting to sell its unencumbered operational assets and for that purpose hired third party to look for a buyer. according to petitioner reports would also suggest that respondent tried and offered to sell its entire clean energy portfolio and is again trying to sell it in parts. it is further contended that reports further state that they have identified some of the buyers and they have allegedly signed non disclosure agreement and were to submit their bids in september, 2021. the information available in the news paper reports were annexed to the applications. in paragraph 15, it pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 is further contended that verification of financial statements of the respondents would clearly raise grave concern on respondent's capabilities to comply with the award. according to petitioner the last filing of the annual balance sheet was of the year 2019-2020 and thereafter no balance sheet or profit and loss statements were filed by the respondents and the last balance sheet of financial year 2019-2020 would show that respondent's profits were on constant decline. petitioner further apprehends that with a motive to deprive the fruits of the award respondent might sell its clean power assets, especially, assets which are unencumbered. it is further contended that respondent's assets are charged in favour of the lenders/ parties but petitioner was unable to ascertain the exact liability of the respondent to determine the extent of charges created by the respondent from the master data as obtained from the website of ministry of corporate affairs and that it is not discernable from the website of ministry of corporate affairs as to the unencumbered assets of the respondent as on date. having regard to these pleadings, petitioner prayed for the reliefs, extracted above. 20. in substance, petitioner sought for depositing of amount awarded by the arbitral tribunal and in the alternative to direct the respondent to furnish security in the form of bank guarantee or cash deposits for the amount awarded by the arbitrators with interest. petitioner also prayed to restrain the respondent from alienating, transferring, mortgaging, pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 encumbering, or creating any kind of third-party rights or interests of whatsoever nature on their assets belonging to the respondent company or its subsidiary companies, until the execution of the arbitral award or the award is set-aside in an application under section 34 of the act. in paragraph 'd' of the prayer, petitioner prayed to direct the respondent to declare all its immovable and movable assets including the assets which are free from any charge, mortgage, pledge, or any form of encumbrance or third-party rights. 21. though, comprehensive reliefs were sought with the apprehension expressed in the applications filed by the petitioner and the status of assets and liabilities of respondent are not available in public domain, the commercial court had only directed the respondent to declare all its movable and immovable assets including the assets which are free from any charge, mortgage, pledge or any form of encumbrance or third party rights and to return the bank guarantees. 22. the arbitral tribunal passed two awards in two disputes cumulatively awarding 440 crores. so far said amount is not paid by the respondent. respondent has filed applications under section 34 of the act challenging the awards, but no interlocutory orders are granted in his favour. since no interlocutory orders are granted by the commercial court, the awards passed by the arbitral tribunal are enforceable. to seek enforcement of the awards, petitioner has to know pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 the assets and liabilities of the respondent as same are not in the public domain. therefore, petitioner also sought a direction to the respondents to declare movable and immovable assets including the assets which are free from any charge, mortgage or in the form of encumbrance or third party rights. unless this information is available to the petitioner, he will not be able to enforce the awards. 23. as no stay is granted in section 34 applications, the awards are enforceable but they are not enforced so far. in order to seek enforcement of the awards, the measures sought by the petitioner are valid and legal. as noticed from the precedent decisions, in an application filed under section 9 after the awards were passed by the arbitral tribunal and before enforcement of the awards, it is permissible for the commercial court to pass appropriate orders to protect the interest of the decree-holder and to ensure that the decree-holder enjoys the fruits of the arbitral award. since the information on the assets and liabilities are not in the public domain and not available with the petitioner, apprehension expressed by the petitioner for possible liquidation of the assets and difficulty in enforcing the awards is a genuine concern in the facts of this case. the petitioner has made out a strong prima facie case to grant orders under section 9 of the act, 1996 post award. pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7 of 2023 24. it is to be noticed that in cop no.19 of 2022 petitioner has not prayed for return of the bank guarantees as they were not falling for consideration before the arbitral tribunal. however, it is to be noted that the two arbitral claims arise out of maa dated 04-05-2011 praying to grant liquidated damages for two periods, 2011-2014 and 2015. at the time of entering into agreement, the petitioner has submitted bank guarantees. though petitioner has not sought return of bank guarantees in cop no.19 of 2022 and sought such relief in cop no.18 of 2022, merely on this ground the order cannot be nullified when we are convinced that the commercial court has rightly exercised its discretion and at any rate bank guarantees have to be returned. except this minor lapse, the commercial court considered all aspects and on due appreciation of facts and contentions urged by both parties passed orders impugned herein. in the circumstances, we do not see any error committed by the commercial court in granting reliefs in c.o.p.nos.19 and 18 of 2022 respectively. both appeals are dismissed. no order as to costs. pending miscellaneous applications if any shall stand closed. _________________________ p.naveen rao, j ___________________________ nagesh bheemapaka,j date: 21.04.2023 tvk/kkm pnr,j & nbk,j comca nos.6 & 7
