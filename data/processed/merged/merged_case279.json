COMCA Nos.33 and 34 of 2018 are filed by CCS Infotech Limited, COMCA Nos.40, 41, 42, 48, 49 of 2018 and COMCA Nos.4, 17, 18, 19, 20 of 2019 are filed by ESD (Mee Seva) of both States respectively and COMCA Nos. 51 and 52 of 2018 are filed by United Telecoms Ltd. As the issues raised in all the above COMCAs are same, they are heard and considered and common judgment is passed.\n3. With the avowed object of providing various services to the citizens of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, as part of e-Goverance initiative, the Government of the then combined State of Andhra Pradesh proposed to start E-Seva (later called as Mee-Seva) centers. These services were later extended to several other Municipal areas in the combined State. It has sought for expression of interest to be part of the initiative as Technical Partners. Several Software Companies responded to the tender notification. The CMS Computers Limited was the successful bidder in respect of Zone-I, IV, V, VI, United Telecoms PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch Limited was the successful bidder in respect of Zone-II and CCS Infotech Limited and Data Management Corporation was the successful bidder in respect of Zone-III. All of them entered into agreements with the MEE-SEVA Organisation on 19.05.2003. The agreements envisaged to build, operate, maintain and transfer. Under the said agreement, the claimants were to be paid remuneration as per the rates per transaction and other terms and conditions stipulated under Article 3 of the Agreement. The agreements are valid for a period of five years from the effective date defined in Article 4.1. As per the agreement, CMS opened 14 centers in Zone-I, 27 centers in Zone-IV, 12 centers in Zone-V and 7 centers in Zone-VI. Similarly UTL opened 25 centers in Zone-II, whereas CCS opened 15 centers in Zone-III. Subsequently, supplemental agreements were also entered into between the claimants and the MEE-SEVA Organization on 01.12.2003, 18.02.2004 and 10.02.2004 for establishing additional centers in all the six zones. As per the supplemental agreements, CMS opened 16 additional centers in Zone-I, 16 additional centers in Zone-IV, 16 additional cetners in Zone-V and 15 additional centers in Zone-VI. Thus, in all CMS opened 30 centers in Zone-I, 32 centers in Zone-IV, 28 centers in Zone-V and 22 centers in Zone-VI under the original and supplemental agreements put together. Similarly, UTL opened 26 additional centers in all 51 centers. CCS also opened 15 additional centers in addition to the 15 centeres as per the original agreement making in all 30 centers in Zone-III. \nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch 4. Disputes arose between the parties relating to determination of the effective date of the agreements, the downward revision of rates and fixation of the transaction slabs etc. The disputes were referred to arbitration. Hon'ble Justice V.V.N.Sastry (Retired) was appointed as Arbitrator. \n5. The learned Arbitrator formulated following issues for consideration:\n(1) Whether the determination of effective dates by the respondent vide proceedings dated 01.10.2007 is erroneous and contrary to the terms of the agreements ?\n(2) Whether the revision/reduction of rates by the respondent is illegal and unsustainable ?\n(3) Whether the slabs fixed for the transactions have to be proportionately increased with the increase in the number of centers ?\n(4) Whether the claimants are entitled to all or any of the reliefs claimed ?\n6. On considering the oral and documentary evidence, the learned Arbitrator passed a preliminary award holding the issue Nos.1 and 3 against the claimants and issue Nos.2 and 4 in favour of claimants. \n7. In brief, the findings of Arbitrator in his preliminary award are as under:\nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch Issue No.1:\n\"Accordingly, I hold on issue no.1 that the effective dates as determined by the respondent in proceedings dated 01.10.2007 are in accordance with the terms of the contract agreements and they are correct. It, therefore, follows that the contract period of all the claimants have already expired long ago and the respondent is at liberty to finalize the arrangements for further contracts. The interim order granted earlier for maintaining status quo is discharged.\" \nIssue No.2:\n\"I hold on issue No.2 that the claimants are entitled to be paid at the contract rates for all categories of transactions till 01.03.2008 and thereafter at the revised rates for the entire period for which the claimants rendered service. However, with regard to electricity bills, in view of the orders passed by the government in G.O.Rt.No.205, dated 30.06.2009, I am of the view that it is just and proper to direct payment at the rate of 5/- per transaction to the claimants from 01.03.2008 onwards.\" \nIssue No.3:\n\"Arbitrator held that in the absence of a specific provision in the agreement and in the absence of mutual agreement between the parties only the transaction slab as indicated in the agreement alone to be binding.\" \nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch Issue No.4:\n\"For determining the differential amounts if any, to which the claimants are legitimately entitled in the light of findings recorded above, both parties are directed to file calculation memos with full details within four weeks from today.\"\n8. Learned Arbitrator has also awarded interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date on which amount was due till date of payment. \n9. Against the preliminary award of the Arbitrator on issues 2 and 4, Mee-seva preferred O.P.No.1122 of 2012 under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 in the Civil Court, later transferred to Commercial Court and renumbered as C.O.P.No.124 of 2016. \n10. The learned Arbitrator passed two separate final awards quantifying the amount by TRANSCO and directing to determine BSNL transaction amounts due and to pay the dues with interest at 12% per annum from the due date till the date of payment. \n11. Against the final award of the Arbitrator, Mee-seva preferred O.P.No.1121 of 2012 under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 before civil Court, later transferred to the Commercial Court and renumbered as C.O.P.No.119 of 2016. \n12. On issue No.2, the Commercial Court held that Arbitrator erred in applying revision of rates at 5/- per transaction w.e.f. 01.03.2008. \nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch It amounted to applying the revision retrospectively, whereas Government Order dated 30.06.2009 was prospective only. The Commercial Court accordingly modified the decision of the Arbitrator. On issue no.4, the Commercial Court modified the rate of interest from 12% per annum to 6% per annum. \n13. This triggered the present batch of appeals by the claimants, the MEE-SEVA of State of Telangana and MEE-SEVA of the State of Andhra Pradesh. \n14. Learned counsel for claimants made following submissions:\n(a) The remedy under section 34 is not an appeal against the award. Parameters to consider the award are limited to the aspects provided in Section 34. The Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Section 34 can either affirm or set aside the award, but has no competence to modify the award;\n(b) The Commercial Court erred in holding the entitlement to levy 5/- per transaction as prospective from the date of issue of G.O.Rt.No.205, dated 30.06.2009;\n(c) The Commercial Court grossly erred in reducing the rate of interest from 12% to 6% per annum;\n(d) According to learned counsel, the award of learned Arbitrator commends acceptance in toto.\nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch 15. Learned Special Counsel for State of Andhra Pradesh Sri Goverdhan Reddy submitted as under:\n(a) He would submit that the G.O.Rt.No.205 dt.30.06.2009 has no application to the existing contractors. It is applicable to fresh contracts. On electricity bills conclusions recorded by the learned Arbitrator are contrary to his findings on issue no.2. As can be seen from paragraphs 8 and 9 of the preliminary award, all findings are in favour of MEE-SEVA. Thus, the conclusion of Arbitrator is perverse;\n(b) He would submit that there cannot be two awards in the same arbitral proceedings, more so, like preliminary award and final award. As can be seen from Section 32 of the Act, once an award is passed by the Arbitrator, he becomes functus officio and he is no more competent to deal with any aspect of a dispute inter-parties; \n(c) He would further submit that against preliminary award, O.Ps., were filed. As per section 34 of the Act as it stood at the relevant point of time, once O.Ps are filed, it is a deemed stay and, therefore, the Arbitrator could not have passed final award after institution of O.Ps. Though the fact of filing O.Ps., was informed to the learned Arbitrator, he passed final award. It is a patently illegal course adopted by the Arbitrator. \n(d) According to learned counsel, Article 3.1 of the contract specifies the rates per transaction. According to Article 3.2.1 the rates PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch specified are liable to be reviewed at the end of three years which may lead to reduction of transaction cost on due review on various parameters set out therein. The letter dated 31.03.2007 shows that the Technology Partners consented to collect 2/- per transaction instead of 5/- from 01.04.2007. However, later the issue was reviewed and 5/- per transaction was continued upto 01.03.2008; \n(e) He would submit that the term of contract with Technology Partners came to an end between the years 2008 to 2009 on various dates respectively. That being so, by way of interim order, the learned Arbitrator extended the contract. Such course adopted by the Arbitrator is in excess of jurisdiction. By virtue of interim order, the contract continued far beyond the period envisaged in the contract;\n( f ) Learned counsel fairly submits that in an application under Section 34, Commercial Court cannot modify the award. However, as the award is vitiated on several counts, having regard to the findings arrived at, the Commercial Court ought to have remanded to the Arbitrator for passing fresh award. \n16. Learned Government Pleader for Arbitration State of Telangana submitted that entire arbitration proceedings are vitiated on several counts as submitted by the learned Special counsel for Government of Andhra Pradesh. \nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch 17. In reply, learned counsel for claimants submitted that in a Section 34 application re-appreciation of evidence is not permissible. Learned counsel justified passing two awards. According to learned counsel, at the stage of passing award in the first instance the calculations of amounts due were not submitted by parties. Therefore, learned Arbitrator directed the parties to submit actual amounts due and on receiving the details, he passed final award. It is within the competence of the Arbitrator to make assessment of amounts due to the claimants and to award interest. Therefore, merely because the award was split and two separate awards are passed do not vitiate the awards on that ground. \n18. Having regard to the issue involved in these cases, all the counsel have submitted that in the event of the court holding that the matter should go back to the stage of commencement of arbitral proceedings, a new Arbitrator may be appointed. \n19. Following issues arise for consideration:\n(1) Whether the Arbitrator is competent to pass preliminary award and final award ?\n(2) Whether in applications filed under Section 34, can the Commercial Court modify the awards of the Arbitrator ? \n(3) Whether the findings recorded and conclusions arrived at by the Arbitrator on issues 2 and 4 are legal and valid ? \n(4) What relief ? \nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch Issue No.1:\n20. To consider this issue, it is necessary to look into the definition of 'arbitral award' and the provisions in Sections 171, 322, and 333 of the Act, 1996. Section 2(1)(c)4 has not specifically defined what is meant to be an arbitral award but holds that 'arbitral award' includes interim award. Interim award is referable to Section 17. Section 17 vests power in the arbitrator to pass orders as interim measures pending conclusion of arbitral proceedings in various aspects mentioned in Section 17. Section 32 deals with termination of S.17. Interim measures ordered by arbitral tribunal.--\n(1) A party may, during the arbitral proceedings apply to the arbitral tribunal-- (i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely: -- (a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement; (b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration; (c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken, or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence; (d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver; (e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the arbitral tribunal to be just and convenient, and the arbitral tribunal shall have the same power for making orders, as the court has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it. (2) Subject to any orders passed in an appeal under section 37, any order issued by the arbitral tribunal under this section shall be deemed to be an order of the Court for all purposes and shall be enforceable under the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 (5 of 1908), in the same manner as if it were an order of the Court. \nS.32. Termination of proceedings.--(1) The arbitral proceedings shall be terminated by the final arbitral award or by an order of the arbitral tribunal under sub-section (2). (2) The arbitral tribunal shall issue an order for the termination of the arbitral proceedings where -- (a) the claimant withdraws his claim, unless the respondent objects to the order and the arbitral tribunal recognizes a legitimate interest on his part in obtaining a final settlement of the dispute, (b) the parties agree on the termination of the proceedings, or (c) the arbitral tribunal finds that the continuation of the proceedings has for any other reason become unnecessary or impossible. (3) Subject to section 33 and sub-section (4) of section 34, the mandate of the arbitral tribunal shall terminate with the termination of the arbitral proceedings. S.33. Correction and interpretation of award; additional award.--(1) Within thirty days from the receipt of the arbitral award, unless another period of time has been agreed upon by the parties-- (a) a party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to correct any computation errors, any clerical or typographical errors or any other errors of a similar nature occurring in the award; (b) if so agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to give an interpretation of a specific point or part of the award. (2) If the arbitral tribunal considers the request made under sub-section (1) to be justified, it shall make the correction or give the interpretation within thirty days from the receipt of the request and the interpretation shall form part of the arbitral award. (3) The arbitral tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1), on its own initiative, within thirty days from the date of the arbitral award. (4) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party with notice to the other party, may request, within thirty days from the receipt of the arbitral award, the arbitral tribunal to make an additional arbitral award as to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the arbitral award. (5) If the arbitral tribunal considers the request made under sub-section (4) to be justified, it shall make the additional arbitral award within sixty days from the receipt of such request. (6) The arbitral tribunal may extend, if necessary, the period of time within which it shall make a correction, give an interpretation or make an additional arbitral award under sub-section (2) or sub-section (5). (7) Section 31 shall apply to a correction or interpretation of the arbitral award or to an additional arbitral award made under this section. S.2. Definitions:- (1) in this Part, unless the context otherwise requires,- (a)&(b) xxx (c) 'arbitral award' includes an interim award;\nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch proceedings. According to this section, the arbitral proceedings should be terminated by the final arbitral award or by an order of the arbitral Tribunal under sub-section (2). This Section does not envisage passing of more than one award and passing of preliminary award and final award, unlike civil Court passing preliminary decree and final decree in a suit. \n21. Section 33 deals with 'correction' and 'interpretation of award'. According to this provision, within 30 days from the date of receipt of arbitral award, a party can request the Arbitral Tribunal to correct any computation errors, any clerical or typographical errors or other errors of similar nature occurring in the award. The provision also enables a party to request the Arbitrator 'to give an interpretation' of a specific point or part of the award. If the Arbitral Tribunal accepts the request made under sub-section (1), it should make corrections or to give interpretation. The Arbitral Tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1) on its own initiative. Interpretation or correction made shall form part of the arbitral award. \n22. It is permissible to pass such additional award, party to the dispute may make a request within 30 days of the award to pass additional arbitral award. However, both parties should agree for such a course, and it should be confined to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings, but omitted from arbitral award. If the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with such application, it can pass additional arbitral award. From the provision of the Act, the scheme is very clear that it does not PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch envisage passing of preliminary award and final award and it is apparent that only one award can be passed by the Arbitrator. An additional arbitral award can be passed only in case where claim presented in the arbitral proceedings was omitted from the arbitral award. \n23. From the reading of sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 33, it is also apparent that the Arbitrator should resort to computation of entitlement before the award is passed and include in the award. If there are any errors in computation, a party to the dispute can file an application and on filing such application, if errors are noticed the errors can be corrected. The arbitrator can suo-motu correct any clerical errors, but nothing more. The scheme also makes it clear that once an award is passed by the Arbitrator, he becomes functus officio except in the contingencies mentioned in section 33 noted above. That being so, splitting the award and passing preliminary and final awards by the Arbitrator is vitiated on this ground. \nIssue No.2:\n24. Section 345 vests right in a party to a dispute to challenge the award passed by the Arbitrator before the Civil Court or before the S.34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.--(1) Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3). (2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if-- (a) the party making the application establishes on the basis of the record of the arbitral tribunal that-- (i) a party was under some incapacity, or (ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or (iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration: Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch Commercial Court. The Civil Court/Commercial Court can either allow the application setting aside the award or dismiss the application or set aside the award and remand it to the Arbitrator for fresh consideration, but cannot alter or modify the award passed by the Arbitrator. 25.1. In The Project Director, National Highways Nos.45E and 220, National Highways Authority of India vs. M.Hakeem and others6, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:\n\"16. What is important to note is that, far from Section 34 being in the nature of an appellate provision, it provides only for setting aside awards on very limited grounds, such grounds being contained in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 34. Secondly, as the marginal note of Section 34 indicates, \"recourse\" to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-sections (2) and (3). \"Recourse\" is defined by P. Ramanatha Aiyar's Advanced Law Lexicon (3rd Edn.) as the enforcement or method of enforcing a right. Where the right is itself truncated, enforcement of such truncated right can also be only limited in nature. What is clear from a reading of the said provisions is that, given the limited grounds of challenge under sub-sections (2) and (3), an application can only be made to set aside an award. This becomes even clearer when we see sub-section (4) under which, on receipt of an application under sub-section (1) of Section 34, the court may adjourn the Section 34 proceedings and give the Arbitral Tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or take such action as will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. Here again, it is important to note that it is the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal which counts in order to eliminate the grounds for setting aside the award, which may be indicated by the court hearing the Section 34 application. xxx contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or (v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this Part from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this Part; or (b) the Court finds that-- (i) the subject- matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force, or (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India. Explanation 1.--For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India, only if,-- (i) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81; or (ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law; or (iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice. Explanation 2. --For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute. (2A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the Court, if the Court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the award: Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence. (3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal: Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter. (4) On receipt of an application under sub-section (1), the Court may, where it is appropriate and it is so requested by a party, adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of arbitral tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. (5) An application under this section shall be filed by a party only after issuing a prior notice to the other party and such application shall be accompanied by an affidavit by the applicant endorsing compliance with the said requirement. (6) An application under this section shall be disposed of expeditiously, and in any event, within a period of one year from the date on which the notice referred to in sub-section (5) is served upon the other party. \n(2021) 9 SCC 1 PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch 42. It can therefore be said that this question has now been settled finally by at least 3 decisions [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] , [Kinnari Mullick v. Ghanshyam Das Damani, (2018) 11 SCC 328 : (2018) 5 SCC (Civ) 106] , [Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd. v. Navigant Technologies (P) Ltd., (2021) 7 SCC 657] of this Court. Even otherwise, to state that the judicial trend appears to favour an interpretation that would read into Section 34 a power to modify, revise or vary the award would be to ignore the previous law contained in the 1940 Act; as also to ignore the fact that the 1996 Act was enacted based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, 1985 which, as has been pointed out in Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration, makes it clear that, given the limited judicial interference on extremely limited grounds not dealing with the merits of an award, the \"limited remedy\" under Section 34 is coterminous with the \"limited right\", namely, either to set aside an award or remand the matter under the circumstances mentioned in Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. \nxxxx 48. Quite obviously if one were to include the power to modify an award in Section 34, one would be crossing the Lakshman Rekha and doing what, according to the justice of a case, ought to be done. In interpreting a statutory provision, a Judge must put himself in the shoes of Parliament and then ask whether Parliament intended this result. Parliament very clearly intended that no power of modification of an award exists in Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. It is only for Parliament to amend the aforesaid provision in the light of the experience of the courts in the working of the Arbitration Act, 1996, and bring it in line with other legislations the world over.\" 25.2. The Division Bench of this Court in Ragya Bee and others vs. P.S.R. Constructions and others7, held as under:\n\"22. The scope of power of Civil Court under Section 34 is no more res-integra, in view of the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in McDermott International Inc Vs Burn Standard Company Limited8. In the said decision and the decisions that followed, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that in a petition under Section 34 of the Act, 1996, the Court cannot correct errors of Arbitrator. It can only quash the award. Paragraphs 51 and 52 of McDermott International Inc read as under:\n\"52. The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. So, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it.\" \n(emphasis supplied) \n23. The decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.Hakeem (supra) puts the issue beyond pale of doubt. It is affirmation of statement of law that stood the test of times. On review of precedent decisions, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that Section 34 of the Act, 1996 cannot be held to include within it a power to modify the award. ...\" 25.3. In Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd., Hon'ble Court held as under:\n\"28. This Court has in several other judgments interpreted Section 34 of the 1996 Act to stress on the restraint to be shown by Courts while examining the validity of the arbitral awards. The limited grounds available to Courts for annulment of arbitral awards are well known to legally trained minds. However, the difficulty arises in applying the well- established principles for interference to the facts of each case that come up before the 2022 (3) ALD 151 (2006) 11 SCC 181 (2022) 1 SCC 131 PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch Courts. There is a disturbing tendency of Courts setting aside arbitral awards, after dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases to come to a conclusion that the award needs intervention and thereafter, dubbing the award to be vitiated by either perversity or patent illegality, apart from the other grounds available for annulment of the award. This approach would lead to corrosion of the object of the 1996 Act and the endeavours made to preserve this object, which is minimal judicial interference with arbitral awards. That apart, several judicial pronouncements of this Court would become a dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by categorizing them as perverse or patently illegal without appreciating the contours of the said expressions. \n29. Patent illegality should be illegality which goes to the root of the matter. In other words, every error of law committed by the Arbitral Tribunal would not fall within the expression \"patent illegality\". Likewise, erroneous application of law cannot be categorised as patent illegality. In addition, contravention of law not linked to public policy or public interest is beyond the scope of the expression \"patent illegality\". What is prohibited is for Courts to reappreciate evidence to conclude that the award suffers from patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, as Courts do not sit in appeal against the arbitral award. The permissible grounds for interference with a domestic award under Section 34(2-A) on the ground of patent illegality is when the arbitrator takes a view which is not even a possible one, or interprets a clause in the contract in such a manner which no fair-minded or reasonable person would, or if the arbitrator commits an error of jurisdiction by wandering outside the contract and dealing with matters not allotted to them. An arbitral award stating no reasons for its findings would make itself susceptible to challenge on this account. The conclusions of the arbitrator which are based on no evidence or have been arrived at by ignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. Also, consideration of documents which are not supplied to the other party is a facet of perversity falling within the expression \"patent illegality\". \" \n26. Having regard to the provision in Section 34 and the law governing the field, the Court below grossly erred in modifying the award. \n27. As per then provision in Section 34, once application is filed under Section 34, it would be amounting to deemed stay against the award passed by the Arbitrator. The application under section 34 was filed challenging the preliminary award before the final award was passed by the Arbitrator and this fact was informed to the Arbitrator. Though Arbitrator took note of the filing of OP, he proceeds to pass final award. The final award passed by the Arbitrator is in clear violation of the statutory mandate and, therefore, nonest in the eye of law. \nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch 28. In the preliminary award, the Arbitrator has not quantified the amounts claimed by the claimants and payable by the respondents. Thus, excluding the final award, preliminary award is incomplete. In view of the statutory mandate of Section 34 as obtained then, the Arbitrator could not have passed final award after OP was filed under Section 34 of the Act challenging the preliminary award. \n29. Cumulatively, we have noticed that the decision of the Arbitrator to split the award into two awards and passing preliminary award and final award is ex facie illegal and in the application filed under Section 34 the Commercial Court modifying the award is without competence and jurisdiction and, therefore, both are vitiated. These aspects go to the root of the matter. In view of the above conclusion arrived at by us, we restrain from deciding the issue no.3 and leave it open. Issue No.4. To what relief :\n30. As the award of the Arbitrator and the decision of the Commercial Court in application filed under Section 34 are not sustainable the COMCAs are allowed. However, as the dispute requires resolution, we deem it proper to remit the matter to the Arbitral Tribunal. As both parties are in agreement for referring the matter to a new Arbitrator, we are inclined to accept the request of learned counsel to appoint Sri Justice Vilas V.Afzulpurkar, Retired Judge of this Court, as sole Arbitrator. The parties are directed to place all the pleadings and documents forming part of arbitral PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch proceedings before the earlier Arbitrator with Hon'ble Sri Justice Vilas V.Afzulpurkar. As the issue is very old, we request Hon'ble Sri Justice Vilas V.Afzulpurkar to conclude the arbitral proceedings expeditiously, preferably within a period of 16 weeks from the date of submission of all the documents by both parties. The parties are directed to prepare compilation and submit all the documents to the Hon'ble Sri Justice Vilas V.Afzulpurkar within four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order. It is made clear that there is no expression of opinion on merits. Pending miscellaneous petitions if any shall stand closed. \n_______________________ P.NAVEEN RAO, J _______________________ DR.G.RADHA RANI, J Date: 26.08.2022 Kkm /tvk PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch HONOURABLE SRI JUSTICE P.NAVEEN RAO & HONOURABLE DR.

filed under articles 226 and 227 of the constitution of india praying to set aside the order dtd.30.7.2022 in com o.s.no.814/2022 passed by the lxxxv addl city civil and sessions judge bengaluru (cch86) annexure-a; allow the application dated 27.7.2022 annexure-m in com o.s.no.814/2022 filed before lxxxv addl city civil and sessions judge bengaluru (cch-86) as prayed and direct returned of the plaint. this petition, coming on for orders, this day, the court made the following: order the petitioners are the defendants in commercial o.s. no. 814/2022 on the file of the lxxxv additional city civil and sessions judge, bengaluru a designated commercial court under the provisions of the commercial courts act, 2015 [for short, 'the commercial court]. the petitioners have impugned the commercial court's order dated 30.07.2022, and the commercial court by this order has rejected the petitioners' application under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure [for short, 'the cpc']. 2. the respondent's suit in commercial o.s. no.814/2022 is for the petitioners' ejectment from the immovable property bearing bbmp khata no. 78/4/1, bbmp ward no.23, hbr layout, nagavara, bangalore-560045 comprising of stilt, ground and three upper floors [for short, 'the subject property'] and for directions to the petitioners to pay rs.12,31,185/and rs.6,34,86,974/as alleged rental arrears and liquidated damages respectively. the third petitioner has filed the subject application under order vii rule 10 of cpc essentially asserting that the commercial court will not have jurisdiction to entertain the suit because the dispute between the respondent and the petitioners would not be a 'commercial dispute' as contemplated under section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the commercial courts act, 2015 [for short, 'the commercial court's act'] 3. the third petitioner has asserted, relying upon the provisions of section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the commercial courts act, that a dispute to be a 'commercial dispute' will have to be a dispute in relation to an agreement pertaining to an immovable property which is used exclusively for trade or commerce. however the present dispute is between the petitioners and the respondent who are parties to the lease deed dated 01.01.2020, and the subject property is demised under this lease deed to be used exclusively for educational purposes [i.e., for the purposes of running a school]. as the lease deed is an agreement relating to an immovable property that is utilized for running an educational institution [a school] it cannot be construed as an agreement relating to immovable property that is exclusively used for the purposes of either trade or commerce and therefore, the dispute is not a 'commercial dispute'. 4. the respondent has resisted this application contending that there is suppression of facts. the respondent contends that the value of the transaction between the petitioners and the respondent exceeds rs. 1 [one] crore the threshold mentioned in section 6 of the commercial courts act, and a deeper scrutiny of the circumstances would establish the commercial nature of the transaction between them. the respondent has also contended that the dispute is in the context of the landlordtenancy relationship with the petitioners, and the suit, which is filed after issuance of notice under section 106 of the transfer of property act, 1882, in the circumstances of the case, will be maintainable before the commercial court. 5. the facts leading to the present commercial suit stated in brief would be that the first petitioner is constituted as a public charitable trust under the trust deed dated 31.10.2014. the author of this trust [the first petitioner the third defendant in the commercial suit] is mr. r.r. acharya, and he along with mr. k.a. poonacha is also appointed as one of the permanent trustees. mr. u.r.n.murthy, who was the owner of the subject property at the relevant point of time, has executed the lease deed dated 07.11.2015 demising the subject property in favour of the trust the first petitioner. the lease of the subject property under this lease deed dated 07.11.2015 is renewed under the supplementary deed dated 13.09.2017. 6. on 12.10.2018, [the lease of the subject property is cancelled vide a registered surrender of lease deed of the even date], and within three days therefrom, mr. u.r.n.murthy [the owner of the subject property as of such date] has executed sale deed transferring the subject property in favour of the respondent1. on 22.07.2019, the deed of amendment cum restatement of the educational and cultural trust is executed inter se the then trustees. the salient of this amendment-cum-restatement deed is that the trustees, mrs. radhika reddy and mrs. m.s. selvi, who were in the meanwhile appointed as trustees, have agreed to continue as permanent trustees and the other trustees have retired. 7. with these transactions and documents, if mrs. radhika reddy and mrs. m s selvi were representing the trust, their spouses mr. g. sharath reddy and mr. ramalingam mohan owned the subject property as partners of the respondent, and therefore could be a reasonable inference of a certain shared interests in them in the subject property and the establishment the school. a fresh 1 the respondent is a limited liability partnership, and the sale deed by sri u.r. murthy is dated 15.10.2018 lease of the subject property is created in favour of the trust by the respondent under the lease deed dated 01.12.2020, but immediately thereafter on 04.12.2020, mrs. radhika reddy and mrs. m.s. selvi [the trustees], the second petitioner [m/s indian public school private limited] and the third petitioner have entered into the 'deed for appointment of new trustees of dhee educational and cultural trust'. 8. in this deed of amendment dated 04.12.2020, the petitioners are appointed as new trustees with mrs. radhika reddy and mrs. m.s. selvi also continuing as trustees, but again on 11.12.2020, another 'deed for appointment of new trustees of dhee educational and cultural trust' is executed further amending the terms of the original trust deed dated 31.10.2014. 9. after this deed of amendment dated 11.12.2020, which is registered on 21.12.2020 with the concerned sub registrar, and with the subsequent resignation letter dated 21.12.2020, mrs. radhika reddy and mrs. m.s. selvi have retired as trustees with the petitioners continuing as the trustees. thus, there is bifurcation of interests with the petitioners holding leasehold rights to the subject property and the right to run school in the subject property. these are undisputed circumstances in which the petitioners have come into possession of the subject property as lessees under the respondent. 10. on behalf of the respondent the following additional documents are placed on record in the present proceedings. [a] a copy of the email dated 25.11.2020, [b] a copy of the indenture of undertaking dated 21.12.2020 and [c] copies of the notices exchanged on 11.03.20222 and 27.04.2022. 2 the respondent has also caused another notice dated 11.04.2022 as mentioned in the respondent's reply notice 10 the respondent has brought on record these documents to emphasize that it has availed loan from m/s. kotak mahindra bank limited for the purposes of construction in the subject property in the course of its business, and the petitioners have executed indenture of undertaking simultaneously with the execution of the last of the lease deed undertaking to pay the agreed rent as also the security deposit and non-refundable premium. the notice for termination of tenancy is issued because there is an obvious breach of the terms of the lease and therefore the respondent is entitled to terminate the lease and recover rental arrears as also damages as computed in the plaint. 11. the commercial court, in the aforesaid circumstances and the rival contentions, has considered the merits of the petitioners' application to answer the question: whether the third petitioner dated 27.04.2022, but a copy of this notice dated 11.04.2022 is not placed on record. 11 has established that because the lease deed dated 01.12.2020 relates to an immovable property which is used for educational purposes, the dispute would be outside the fold contemplated under section 2[1][c][vii] of the commercial courts act and hence should be returned for want of jurisdiction. the commercial court has answered the question in the negative opining that the suit can be maintained before it for the following reasons. [i] mr. u.r.n. murthy has executed the sale deed dated 15.10.2018 in favour of the respondent describing the subject property as a commercial property and the petitioners have obtained lease of this commercial property. [ii] the tax paid receipts for the subject property for the year 2021-22 are produced, and tax is paid describing the property as being within nonresidential zone. according to the bbmp bye-laws, non-residential buildings will include buildings used by banks, offices and other institutions such as 12 educational institutions. the respondent is therefore paying a higher tax rate. [iii] the petitioners are running a school with about 6,000 students3 and collecting fee from the students. as such, the petitioners' educational institution is not being run as a charitable activity. [iv] though different decisions by the hon'ble supreme court are cited to bolster the submission that running an educational institution would not be either trade or commerce, such decisions are not in the context of a suit for eviction and for recovery of arrears of rent, and therefore, not applicable to the present case. 12. the reason for the dispute between the petitioners and the respondent is because the petitioners are tendering rent at a rate lower than the 3 it is submitted before this court that this is factually incorrect because may be the trust has a wider student strength across the country, but insofar as the school in the subject property, it is far less. 13 agreed rate. it is undisputed that the lease deed dated 01.12.2020 mentions rs.15 lakhs as the monthly rent payable, and the petitioners are paying monthly rent at the rate of rs.10 lakhs contending that the actual area of the subject property is much lesser than the area assured under the lease deed. this court on 21.09.2022 has granted interim orders staying all further proceedings in the commercial suit. 13. the respondent contested the continuation of this interim order asserting that the present application under order vii rule 10 of cpc, and therefore the present petition, is filed only to avoid the consequence of the default in paying the monthly rent at the rate of rs.10 lakhs. this court, in the light of this objection, proposed to hear on the question whether the interim order could be continued if the petitioners, who have agreed to pay 14 monthly rent of rs.15 lakhs, do not dispute that upto-date rents are paid at such rate. 14. it was submitted on behalf of the petitioners that 50% of the arrears at the rate of rs.15 lakhs per month [minus the amount tendered at the rate of rs.10 lakhs per month] would be deposited to show that the petitioners are bona fide and within their rights in tendering rent at the rate of rs.10 lakhs per month. accordingly, rs.50 lakhs is deposited to show that the petitioners are bona fide and within their rights in tendering rent at the rate of rs.10 lakhs per month. the respondent has filed an application for release of this amount of rs.50 lakhs in deposit contending, amongst others, that it has to repay a huge debt and there is default in its emi payment because the petitioners, despite the express terms of the lease deed dated 01.12.2020 and the memorandum of undertaking, are unilaterally paying only a sum of rs.10 lakhs per month. 15 15. sri. t sooryanarayana, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners, and sri ajay govindaraj, the learned counsel for the respondent, are heard, with their consent, for final disposal of the petition as also the order to be made on the respondent's request for payment of rs.50 lakhs in deposit in the backdrop of the petitioners' case, insofar as this amount in deposit, that it is deposited to demonstrate bona fides and this deposit completely undermines the respondent's case that the application under order vii rule 10 of cpc and the present petition are filed only to avoid payment of rs.15 lakhs as rent per month and the consequence of paying, as against the aforesaid amount, rs.10 lakhs. 16. sri. t sooryanarayana, in support of the petition, relies upon two propositions. he argues that the provisions of the commercial courts act must receive strict interpretation, and this flows from the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in ambalal 16 sarabhai enterprises ltd. v. k s infra space llp and another4. he canvasses that the provisions of section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the commercial courts act, as in the present case, were relied upon to file an application under order vii rule 10 of cpc, and the hon'ble supreme court has declared that the expression 'used exclusively' in the aforesaid provision must be narrowly construed to exclude the situations that will be covered by the use of expressions such as 'ready for use' or 'likely to be used' or 'to be used'. 17. sri. t sooryanarayana submits that the provisions of the commercial courts act, and therefore the provisions of section 2(1)(c) thereof, must be interpreted purposefully to ensure that only certain disputes which actually answers the definition of 'commercial disputes' as provided under the aforesaid provisions are entertained lest all class 4 (2020) 15 supreme court cases 585 17 of litigation is brought into the fold of speedy mechanism provided for a specific class of litigation. 18. sri. t sooryanarayana next argues that the consistent view of the courts in india has been that running an educational institution is neither trade nor business nor commerce. the expression 'used exclusively in trade or commerce' in section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the commercial courts act must receive a similar interpretation excluding suits by or against institutions offering education even if based on agreements relating to immovable property/ies. notwithstanding the consistent view across different subjects that running educational institution is neither trade nor business nor commerce, if only for the purposes of the commercial courts act, running educational institutions is construed as trade or business or commerce, that would be adopting a liberal construction as against a narrow and purposive construction exposited by the hon'ble 18 supreme court in ambalal sarabhai enterprises ltd. [supra]. 19. in support of the submission that running of educational institutions is consistently held as not trade or commerce, sri. t sooryanarayana relies upon the following decisions: [i] unnikrishnan j p and others v. state of andhra pradesh and others5: sri. t sooryanarayana argues that a constitutional bench of the hon'ble supreme court while considering, amongst others, whether there is a fundamental right to establish an educational institution under article 19(1)(g) of the constitution of india which enshrines the right to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business, has also considered the meaning to be attributed to 5 (1993) 1 supreme court cases 645 19 the expression such as profession, occupation, trade or business. it is ultimately opined that right to establish an educational institution can neither be a trade or business, nor can it be profession within the meaning of article 19(1)(g), and he draws the attention of this court, amongst others, to the opinion reads as follows6: \"imparting of education has never been treated as a trade or business in this country since the time immemorial. it has been treated as a religious duty. it has been treated as a charitable activity. but never as trade or business\". [ii] sri. t sooryanarayana, relying upon the declaration in paragraph 198 of this judgment, also submits that running of institutions to impart education is declared as something that cannot be allowed to 6 this is part of paragraph 197 of this judgement. 20 become commerce and therefore, it follows that running of an educational institution cannot be commerce and he draws the attention of this court to the following: \"education cannot be allowed to be converted into commerce nor can the petitioners seek to obtain the said result by relying upon the wider meaning of \"occupation\". the content of the expression \"occupation\" has to be ascertained keeping in mind the fact that clause (g) employs all the four expressions viz., profession, occupation, trade and business. their fields may overlap, but each of them does have a content of its own, distinct from others. be that as it may, one thing is clear-imparting of education is not and cannot be allowed to be commerce.\" [iii] nitte education trust, nitte, karkala taluk, dakshina kannada and another 21 v. union of india and another7: sri. t sooryanarayana submits that this court was considering whether the provisions of monopolies and restrictive trade practices act, 1969 would apply to running an educational institution. this court, after referring to the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in unni krishnan j p v. state of andhra pradesh [supra] and to the definition of expressions such as trade, trade practices and services in this enactment, and while considering the question whether charging of a higher fee by itself would render running of an educational institution a trade has opined thus: \"it is a farce to contend that the charging of the higher fee by private educational institution than the fees charged for similar courses in 7 a judgment of this court reported in (1997)5 kant. lj 280 22 government colleges or government aided colleges, but within the ceiling prescribed under the act would make or render the education or establishment of educational institutions to be trade, it is farce and is far from reality.\" [iv] m p electricity board and others v. shiv narayan and another8: sri. t sooryanarayana argues that the hon'ble supreme court in this decision, while considering the difference between the expressions 'profession' and 'commerce', has emphasized that the words 'nondomestic' and 'commercial' are not interchangeable, and 'commercial' is defined as traffic, trade or merchandise in buying and selling of goods with the motive of gaining profit. as such, running of an 8 (2005) 7 supreme court cases 283, and this decision is relied upon to undermine one of the reasons assigned by the commercial court. 23 educational institution, even for a fee, cannot be construed as commerce. 20. sri. ajay govindaraj, without refuting the canvas that the provisions of the commercial courts act, and therefore the provisions of section 2(1)(c)(vii), must receive a purposive interpretation, submits that this court must also consider that it is settled that in construing a statutory provision the first and the foremost rule of interpretation is the rule of literal construction and if the provisions of a statute are unambiguous and the legislative intent is clear, the courts need not call into other rules of interpretation. in this regard he relies upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in b premanand and others v. mohan koikal and others9. 21. sri. ajay govindaraj argues that the provisions of section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the commercial courts act, which refer to both disputes arising out (2011) 4 supreme court cases 266 24 of [a] agreements relating to immovable property and [b] such property being used exclusively in trade or commerce, do not require an interpretation with the assistance of an external aid, and if it is shown that a dispute emanates from an agreement relating to immovable property which is used exclusively for trade or commerce, the suit would be maintainable before a commercial court. the import of this submission is that the expression 'trade or commerce' in section 2(1)(c)(vii) must be considered as understood in common parlance. 22. sri. ajay govindaraj, relying upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in divisional controller, ksrtc v. mahadeva shetty10, distinguishes the applicability of the different decisions relied on by sri. t sooryanarayana to support his case that the expressions 'trade or commerce' in the provisions of section 2(1)(c)(vii) of 10 (2003) 7 supreme court cases 197 25 the commercial courts act must receive strict interpretation to exclude running of educational institution. sri. ajay govindaraj argues that the propositions in the decisions relied upon by sri. t sooryanarayana is in the respective contexts and the declaration therein cannot be expanded beyond the needs of those given situations. he relies upon the following from the aforesaid decision: \"the decision ordinarily is a decision on the case before the court, while the principal underlying the decision would be binding as a precedent in a case which comes up for decision subsequently. therefore, while applying the decision to a later case, the court dealing with it should carefully try to ascertain the principle laid down by the previous decision. a decision often takes its colour from the question involved in the case in which it is rendered. the scope and authority of a precedent should never be expanded unnecessarily beyond the needs of the situation. the only thing binding as an authority upon a subsequent judge is the principle upon which the case was decided.\" 26 23. sri. ajay govindaraj argues that the transaction between the petitioners and the respondent, in the present case where it is undisputed that the petitioners have agreed to pay not just refundable security deposit but also nonrefundable premium executing necessary memorandum of understanding, as also the monthly rentals directly to the respondent's bank, is essentially a commercial transaction. sri. ajay govindaraj, to buttress the respondent's case that the dispute with the respondent is a commercial dispute, also relies upon the transactions commencing with the constitution of the trust with subsequent changes, the execution of the sale deed dated 15.10.2018 and the lease deed dated 01.12.2020. 24. there cannot be any dispute that only a certain class of litigation shall be construed as 'commercial disputes' and that class of litigation 27 would only be those that are listed in section 2(1)(c) of the commercial courts act. at this stage, it is rather settled with the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in ambalal sarabhai enterprises ltd. v. k s infra space llp and another [supra] that not every suit, only because of high value of the subject matter, can be entertained as a 'commercial dispute' and to do so would be to defeat the legislature's intention in bringing about the commercial courts act, which prescribes a specific procedure. the hon'ble supreme court in this decision [per justice a.s.bopanna] has held as follows: \"13. . having taken note of the submission we feel that the very purpose for which the cc act of 2015 has been enacted would be defeated if every other suit merely because it is filed before the commercial court is entertained. this is for the reason that the suits which are not actually relating to commercial dispute but being filed merely because of the high value and with the intention 28 of seeking early disposal would only clog the system and block the way for the genuine commercial disputes which may have to be entertained by the commercial courts as intended by the law makers. in commercial disputes as defined a special procedure is provided for a class of litigation and a strict procedure will have to be followed to entertain only that class of litigation in that jurisdiction. if the same is strictly interpreted it is not as if those excluded will be non-suited without any remedy. the excluded class of litigation will in any event be entertained in the ordinary civil courts wherein the remedy has always existed. 14. in that view it is also necessary to carefully examine and entertain only disputes which actually answers the definition \"commercial disputes\" as provided under the act.\" in fact, the hon'ble supreme court [per justice r. banumathi] has declared that: \"a dispute relating to immovable property per se may not be a commercial dispute. but it becomes a commercial dispute, if it falls under sub-clause (vii) of section 2(1)(c) of the act viz. \"the agreements relating to immovable 29 property used exclusively in trade or commerce\". the words \"used exclusively in trade or commerce\" are to be interpreted purposefully. the word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and it cannot be either \"ready for use\" or \"likely to be used\" or \"to be used\". it should be \"actually used\". such a wide interpretation would defeat the objects of the act and the fast tracking procedure discussed above.\" in the backdrop of this enunciation, this court, despite sri ajay govindaraj's arguments, could only read the expressions 'trade or commerce' in section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the commercial court act without giving each of these expressions a wider interpretation; any interpretation otherwise would fall foul of the enunciation in ambalal sarabhai enterprises ltd. v. k.s. infra space llp and another [supra]. 25. in the facts and circumstances of the case, the rival submissions and the aforesaid settled proposition, the question for consideration would be: 30 whether a dispute arising under an agreement relating to immovable property which is used exclusively for the purposes of running an educational institution would come within the sweep of a 'commercial dispute' as defined under the provisions of section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the commercial courts act. 26. at the outset, this court must observe that though the provisions of section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the commercial courts act employ the expression 'trade or commerce', it does not define either. sri. ajay govindaraj's argument is that because the provisions of section 2(1)(c)(vii)11 of the commercial courts act first stipulate that a dispute arising from an agreement relating to an immovable property must be construed as a commercial dispute when such property is used exclusively for trade or commerce, the expression for 'trade or commerce' must be read 11 (c) \"commercial dispute\" means a dispute arising out of-(i) (vi). (vii) agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce; 31 generally [as per common parlance and therefore, receive a wider interpretation]. indeed it is settled that in the absence of the definition of a particular expression in a statute, the common parlance meaning has to be accepted and this proposition is not confined to tax statutes. this is discernable from a number of decisions by the hon'ble supreme court in a number of cases. a reference in these regards could be made to the decisions in major v.p. singh v. state of up12 and u.suvetha v. state and another13. 27. however, it is equally salient that a statute ousting the jurisdiction of a civil court under section 9 of cpc must be strictly construed, and in this regard, reference could be made to the decision 12 1991 supp (2) supreme court cases 346 wherein it is held that in the absence of a definition of expressions, common parlance meaning must be accepted. 13 (2009) 6 supreme court cases 757, and in this decision the second proposition is invoked in the context of the meaning to be ascribed to the expression 'relative' as found in section 498a of ipc 32 of the hon'ble supreme court in abdul waheed khan v. bhavani14. the commercial courts act in limiting the disputes to be tried as commercial disputes to a certain class of litigation excludes the jurisdiction of a civil court under section 9 of cpc. therefore, the provisions of the commercial courts act, including the definition of commercial disputes, must be strictly interpreted, and this would be in consonance with the declaration in ambalal sarabhai enterprises ltd. v. k s infra space llp and another [supra] that the provisions of section 2(1)(c)(vii) must not receive a wider interpretation lest every litigation is entertained as a 'commercial dispute'. 28. further, this court is of the considered view that it cannot be reasonably opined that running of an educational institution for the purpose of the provisions of the commercial courts act would be 14 air 1966 sc 1718 33 either trade or commerce though it would not be so in the context of the right that is enshrined under article 19(1)(g) of the constitution of india, or for the purposes of other statutes when the common parlance meaning is not ascribed to the expression 'trade or commerce' in section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the commercial courts act and strict interpretation rule is applied. if these expressions, notwithstanding the consistent view, are construed accordingly, it would mean signifying a wider connotation. therefore, the question for consideration is answered in the negative holding that if a dispute arises out of an agreement relating to immovable property which is used exclusively for the purposes of running an educational institution, it cannot be a commercial dispute within the meaning of section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the commercial courts act. 29. in the present case, it is beyond pale of dispute that the subject property is used exclusively 34 for the purposes of running an educational institution a school. when this is undisputed, the other circumstances referred to by the commercial court would be extraneous, and these circumstances would not confer jurisdiction in the commercial court. in that event, the commercial court's order rejecting the petitioner's application under order vii rule 10 cpc cannot be sustained and hence, this court must intervene with necessary orders. this takes this court to the orders that have to follow as regards the amount of rs.50 lakhs in deposit. as the petitioner's application under order vii rule 10 cpc is being allowed with necessary order for return of the plaint before the commercial court and because this amount is deposited to show bona fides, it would only be reasonable to return the same to the petitioners leaving all questions open to be decided after the plaint if re-presented in terms of this order. hence, the following: 35 order [a] the petition is allowed, and the commercial court's impugned order dated 30.07.2022 is quashed. the petitioner's application under order vii rule 10 cpc is allowed directing the commercial court to return the plaint to the respondent to be presented before the competent court of jurisdiction. [b] the commercial court is called upon to intimate to the respondent/its representative, as contemplated under order vii rule 10a of cpc, this order to return plaint with liberty to the respondent to file an application as permissible under order vii rule 10a(2) of cpc within such reasonable time as it may permit. 36 [c] the registry is directed to return the amount of rs.50 lakhs in deposit to the first petitioner subject to compliance as may be required. all pending applications stand disposed of by this order. sd/judge nv"
