Desai) 1 Admit.\n2 This appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, `Act, 1996') arises out of the judgment dated 25.06.202 1 passed below Exh.12 in Commercial Civil Misc. Application No.313 of 2021 (Old Commercial Civil Misc. Application No.11 of 2019) whereby the learned Judge, Commercial Court, Ahmedabad dismissed the application preferred by the present appellant being Commercial Civil Misc. Application No.313 of 2021 for condonation of delay of 51 days in filing application for setting aside the arbitral award under Section 34 of the Act, 1996. Vide order dated 02.09.2021 this Court recorded the agreement arrived at between the parties to the effect that the matter be finally disposed of taking into consideration the written arguments submitted by both the sides and hence in view of that agreement arrived at between C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 the parties while disposing of this appeal, we have taken into consideration the papers supplied by both the sides, which is forming part of the record of the trial court, and not disputed by either side and none of the parties raised any grievance in respect of the fact that any of the paper, which is important to determine the issue involved in this appeal are not placed on record. Accordingly, we have heard and considered the present appeal on the basis of material placed on record by both the sides and in view of the agreement to hear and decide the appeal finally. \n3 By way of the present appeal the appellant has prayed for the following reliefs:\n\"a This Honourable Court may be pleased to quash and set aside the judgment and order dated 25.06.2021 passed by the Hon'ble Commercial Court, Ahmedabad, in Commercial C.M.A. No.313 of 2021;\nc This Honourable Court may be pleased to condone delay caused in filing the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 Conciliation Act, 1996, in challenging the Arbitral Award dated 30.08.2018 passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal comprising of Justice J.C.Upadhyay (Retd.); \nc This Honourable Court may be pleased to direct the Hon'ble Commercial Court, Ahmedabad, to decide the application filed by the Appellant under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, in challenging the Arbitral Award dated 30.08.2018 passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal comprising of Justice J.C.Upadhyay (Retd.); \nd Such other and further order or orders as this Honourable Court may deem fit in the facts and circumstances of the case be passed;\" \n4 The brief facts leading to filing of the present appeal are stated as under. \n4.1 In respect of the disputes between the parties, various claims were raised by the present defendant. Hon'ble retired Judge of this Court was appointed as Sole Arbitrator for resolution of disputes. Learned Sole Arbitrator after hearing both the sides passed an award to the effect, that the C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 present defendant - original claimants shall recover from the present appellant - New India Assurance Company Limited a sum of Rs.2,30,55,170/- (Rupees two crores thirty lakhs fifty five thousand one hundred seventy only) together with interest there on @9% p.a. from 21.11.2016 till realization of the said amount from the present appellant. It was further ordered that the present appellant was directed to pay a sum of Rs.89,60,649/- (Rupees eighty nine lakhs sixty thousand six hundred forty nine only) to the Commissioner of Central Excise, Ahmedabad along with interest thereon in view of direction given by the Principal Commissioner of Central Excise, Ahmedabad-I in his order dated 31.11.2015.\n4.2 The aforesaid award was passed on 30.08.2018. Against the said award, the present appellant preferred appeal under Section 34 of Act, 1996 along with an application for condonation of delay praying for condoning delay of 51 days occurred in filing the appeal under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 before the Commercial Court at Ahmedabad. The said appeal along with application for condonation of C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 delay was filed on 07.02.2019. \n4.3 Since there was delay in filing the appeal, the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad heard the parties on the application for condonation of delay and ultimately vide judgment dated 25.06.2021 below Exh.12 dismissed the application preferred by the present appellant and by way of the present appeal, the appellant challenged the aforesaid judgment dated 25.06.2021 below Exh.12 in Commercial Civil Misc. Application No.313 of 2021 delivered by Judge, Commercial Court, City Civil Court, Ahmedabad. 5 Heard Mr. Vibhuti Nanavati, learned advocate for the appellant and Mr. Apurva Vakil, learned counsel assisted by Mr. Anmol Mehta, learned advocate for the respondent. \n6 Mr. Nanavati, learned advocate for the appellant submitted that in fact the delay in filing the appeal under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 was of 21 days and not of 51 days as stated in the impugned order as well as in the application before the C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 Commercial Court for condonation of delay. Learned advocate Mr. Nanavati by way of a chart tried to explain the delay. The said chart is reproduced hereunder:\nArbitral award pronounced by the 30.08.2018 learned Arbitral Tribunal Advocate forwarded the arbitral 10.09.2018 award to the appellant Arbitral Award received by the 19.09.2018 appellant Meeting with the Chartered 19.11.2018 Accountant Opinion of the Chartered Accountant 29.11.2018 Opinion sought from the advocate to 17.12.2018 file an appeal Approval from the Higher authority January, of the appellant to file an application under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 against Arbitral Award Notice to the original claimant as 28.01.2019 per Section 34(5) of the Act, 1996 Application under Section 34 of the 07.02.2019 Act 6.1 On the basis of the aforesaid chart, learned advocate Mr. Nanavati tried to explain the delay by submitting that the appellant being an insurance company, the delay occurred due to C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 circumstances such as meeting with Chartered Accountant, getting his opinion, etc. and thereafter some time was consumed in getting the opinion from the advocate as to whether appeal against the award of Sole Arbitrator is required to be filed or not. \nOnce the opinion of Chartered Accountant as well as legal opinion from the advocate were received, the approval from the higher authority was sought for filing the appeal before the Commercial Court and thereafter notice to the original claimant was given as per the provisions of Section 34(5) of the Act, 1996 and ultimately on 07.02.2019 appeal under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 was filed before the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad challenging the award dated 30.08.2018 passed by the learned Sole Arbitrator. \n6.2 Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that Section 34(3) of the Act, 1996 provides for period of filing appeal under Section 34 of the Act, 1996, which provides that once arbitral award is passed, an application for setting aside the same must be filed within 3 months from the date of C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 receipt of arbitral award or within a period of 3 months from the date on which such request had been disposed of by the Arbitral Tribunal. In case if such an application could not be filed within a period of 3 months from the date stated herein above, upon showing sufficient cause the court may entertain such application for condonation of delay within a further period of 30 days, but not thereafter. In the instant case, as per the tabular chart produced by learned advocate Mr. Nanavati, the arbitral Tribunal pronounced award on 30.08.2018. The learned advocate forwarded the same on 10.09.2018 and the same was received by the appellant on 19.09.2018. On the basis of the aforesaid facts, learned advocate Mr. Nanavati submits that actually there was delay of only 21 days in filing the appeal under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 challenging the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal before the Commercial Court and not delay of 51 days, as stated in the application for condonation of delay. According to learned advocate Mr. Nanavati, the limitation would start from 19.09.2018 and not prior thereto. \nC/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 6.3 In this regard, in the written submissions made by learned advocate for the appellant Mr. Nanavati drew attention of the Court to the following averments made in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the affidavit in rejoinder filed by the appellant before the commercial court in Civil Misc. Application No.11 of 2019:\n\"10 The advocate thereafter based on the decision of the applicant filed the present application before this Hon'ble Court on 07.02.2019. \n11. The last date to file an application before this Hon'ble Court would be 17.12.2018 as per Section 34 sub section (3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, as the award came to the knowledge of the applicant on 19.09.2018. However, the proviso to the Section 34(3) further provides an extension of 30 days in furtherance to the time period of 3 months and therefore considering the same, the last date to challenge the arbitral award would be 16.01.2019.\"\n6.4 He further submitted that considering the facts of the case and amount involved, the learned C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 Commercial Court ought to have condoned the delay by allowing the application for condonation of delay and accordingly appeal under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 challenging the award dated 30.08.2018 passed by the Sole Arbitrator was required to be heard on its merits.\n6.5 According to Mr. Nanavati, the learned Judge, Commercial Court has committed an error by not condoning delay though delay was sufficiently explained. According to Mr. Nanavati, once sufficient cause is shown, taking into consideration the fact that the actual delay was only 21 days, the Commercial Court was required to take into consideration the object behind the Act, 1996 and condoned the delay. According to Mr. Nanavati, such limitation for filing appeal under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 is provided just to ensure that such appeals are filed and heard expeditiously without there being any unreasonable delay. It was contended that the language of Section 34(3) is of directive nature to ensure that proceedings arising out of award are heard expeditiously and decided within the C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 time bound schedule. Learned advocate Mr.Nanavati relied upon the following judgments in support of his submissions. \n[1] Benarsi Krishna Committee and Ors. vs. Karmyogi Shelters Pvt. Ltd. Reported in (2012)9 SCC 496. [2] The State of Bihar & Ors. vs. Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti reported in (2018)9 SCC 472. [3] Sambhaji & Ors. vs. Gangabhai & Ors. reported in (2008)17 SCC 117. \n[4] Raj Kumar Dey & Ors. vs. Tarapada Dey & Ors.\nreported in (1987)4 SCC 398. \n[5] Sangram Singh vs. Election Tribunal, Kotah & Ors. reported in AIR 1955 SC 425.\n6.4 Learned advocate for the appellant relying upon the judgment in the case of Benarsi Krishna Committee and Ors. (supra), more particularly para 17, submitted that the limitation to challenge the C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 order of Arbitral tribunal would commence from the date on which the copy of the award was delivered to the appellant and in the instant case actual delay in filing the application is of 21 days and not of 51 days in filing the appeal under Section 34 before the Commercial Court.\n6.5 Mr. Nanavati, learned advocate for the appellant relying on the judgment in the case of Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti (supra), submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has liberally interpreted Section 34(5) of the Act, 1996 and similarly the Commercial Court ought to have liberally interpreted the provisions of Section 34(3) of the Act, 1996 while considering the application for delay preferred by the appellant. 6.6 Relying on the judgment in the case of Sambhaji & Ors. (supra), Mr. Nanavati submitted that merely because provision of law is couched in negative language implying mandatory character, the same is not without exception. The procedural law should not ordinarily construed as mandatory and the C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 Commercial Court ought to have condoned the delay occurred in filing the application for condonation of delay. \n6.7 Relying upon the other judgments mentioned herein above, it was submitted by Mr. Nanavati that what is important is to ensure that the ends of justice is met and such technicalities or procedure mentioned in the Act, 1996 should not act as an obstacle in ensuring that the ends of justice is met, and therefore, in respect of condonation of delay, the Commercial Court ought to have taken a liberal view. In view of the aforesaid arguments, it was submitted that the Commercial Court has committed an error by not condoning delay of 51 days and prayed for quashing the order dated 25.06.2021. 7 As against the above, learned counsel Mr. Apurva Vakil assisted by Mr. Mehta, learned advocate appearing for the respondent submitted that the Sole Arbitrator passed the award on 30.08.2018 and same was received by the advocate / authorized representative of the appellant and even if the say C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 of the appellant is accepted that in fact there is a delay of 21 days only, then also the last date to challenge the arbitral award would be 16.01.2019. Even if delay of 21 days is considered, which has occurred in filing the application for condonation of delay, then also in view of the language of section 34(3) of the Act, 1996, such an application for setting aside award was required to be preferred within thirty days in case if there was any sufficient cause available with the appellant after expiry of three months period as per Section 34(3) of the Act, 1996, which was preferred even after that extended period of thirty days. \n7.1 Mr. Vakil, learned counsel for the respondent, further submitted that in view of Section 34(3) of the Act, 1996 an application for setting aside an award may not be made after elapse of 3 months from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or if a request had been made under Section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal. The proviso to Section 34(3) of C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 the Arbitration Act provides that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of 3 months, the court may entertain the application within a further period of 30 days \"but not thereafter\". It was submitted that it is not in dispute that in the present case copy of the arbitral award was received by the advocate for the appellant on 10.09.2018 and the same was received by the applicant on 19.09.2018 and therefore even if 19.09.2018 is taken as the date from which limitation would start, then also the application for condonation of delay was preferred after that period of 30 days over and above three months and hence was beyond the period of limitation.\n7.2 It was next submitted that in the language of Section 34 of the Act, 1996, the crucial words are \"but not thereafter\" used in the proviso to sub- section (3) of Section 34 of the Act, 1996. This phrase would amount to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act and therefore bar the application of Section 5 of the C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 Limitation Act. It was further submitted that to hold that the court could entertain an application to set aside an award beyond the extended period under the proviso would render the phrase \"but not thereafter\"\nwholly otiose. It was further submitted that no principle of interpretation would justify such a result. Apart from the language, express exclusion may follow from the scheme and object of the special law, in the facts of the present case the Act, 1996. \n7.3 It was further submitted that the application under Section 34 was filed by the appellant before the learned Commercial Court, firstly after three months had elapsed from the date on which the appellant had received the arbitral award and secondly the application under Section 34 was not filed even within a further period of 30 days (i.e. after the 3 months had elapsed). It was further submitted that if both the above conditions are satisfied i.e. if the application under Section 34 is filed after the aforesaid maximum permissible period (i.e. 3 months + 30 days) the learned Commercial Court was justified in passing the impugned judgment C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 by dismissing the Commercial Misc. Application for delay. \n7.4 Mr. Vakil, learned counsel for the respondent relied upon the following judgment in support of his above submissions:\n[1] Union of India vs. Popular Construction Company reported in (2001)8 SCC 470.\n[2] State of Himachal Pradesh vs. Himachal Techno Engineers reported in (2010)12 SCC 210. \n[3] Simplex Infrastructure Limited vs. Union of India reported in (2019)2 SCC 455.\n[4] Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Limited vs. Manik Vitthal Kavle & Ors. reported in2014 SCC Online Bom 462.\n[5] State of U.P. vs. M/s. Harman Singh reported in 2015 SCC Online All 9062.\nC/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 [6] Machine Tool (India) Ltd. Vs. Splendor Buildwell Pvt. Ltd. Reported in 2018 SCC Online Del 9551. \n[7] Union of India vs. Rupen Modi reported in (2010)SCC Lnline Guj 6186 (DB).\n7.5 Mr. Vakil, relying upon the above judgments submitted that right from 2001 in the case of Popular Construction Company (supra) till the judgment in the case of Simplex Infrastructure Limited (supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court in catena of decisions held that the statute does not provide for condoning the delay in preferring appeal under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 if it is not preferred within a period of 3 months from the receipt of award or disposal of the application for getting copy of the award and thereafter if there exist a sufficient cause for condoning delay if the application is preferred within 30 days thereafter. However, in the instant case, the appellant has filed the appeal under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 along with application for condonation of delay of 51 days which was filed beyond the period of 3 months + 30 days and the C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 learned Commercial Court has rightly rejected application for condonation of delay. Mr. Vakil, learned counsel for the respondent on the strength of the aforesaid submissions prayed for dismissal of the appeal. \n8 Heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the judgment dated 25.06.2021 passed below Exh.12 in Commercial Civil Misc. Application No.313 of 2021 and other material available on record produced by both the sides. The issue involved in the appeal is whether the Court has power to condone the delay in filing an application challenging the award by preferring appeal under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 after lapse of 3 months and 30 days thereafter. Hence, it is necessary to reproduce Section 34(3) of Act, 1996 to adjudicate the issue involved in the appeal. Section 34(3) reads as under:\n\"Section 34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.\n[1] & [2] xxx C /FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 [3] An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal:\nProvided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application with a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter. \n        [4] to [6]          xxx\"\n\n\n\n8.1              Section   34(3)      of     the    Act      prescribes              the period          of     limitation       for        an     application                for challenging arbitral awards. Having regard to Section 34 of the Act, 1996, which places the limit on the period of condonation of delay by using the word \"may entertain the application within a further period of 30 days but not thereafter\". Therefore, if a petition is not filed within the prescribed period of 3 months, the Court is left to exercise its discretion to condone the delay only to the extent of 30 days C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 and that too if a sufficient cause is shown which would mean that where a petition is filed beyond a period of 3 months + 30 days even if sufficient cause is made out, the delay cannot be condoned. That so far as language of Section 34 of Act, 1996 is concerned, the crucial words are \"but not thereafter\"\nused in proviso to subsection (3) of Section 34 of the Act, 1996 would amount to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, and therefore, the same would bar the application of Section 5 of the Limitation Act. In fact, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Popular Construction Co. (supra) observed from paragraphs 4 to 16 as under:\n\"4 Before us, the appellant has not disputed the position that if the Limitation Act, 1963 and in particular Section 5, did not apply to Section 34 of the 1996 Act, then its objection to the Award was time barred and the appeal would have to be dismissed. The submission however is that Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act makes the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act applicable to special laws like the 1996 Act since the 1996 Act itself did not expressly exclude its applicability and that C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 there was sufficient cause for the delay in filing the application under Section 34. Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, has plainly read, expressly excluded the operation of Section 5 of the Limitation Act and that there was as such no scope for assessing the sufficiency of the cause for the delay beyond the period prescribed in the proviso to Section 34. 5 The issue will have to be resolved with reference to the language used in Sections 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963 and Section 34 of the 1996 Act. Section 29(2) provides that :\n\"29(2) Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the Schedule, the provisions of Section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period prescribed by the Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) shall apply only in so far as, and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law.\"\nC / FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 6 On an analysis of the section, it is clear that the provisions of Sections 4 to 24 will apply when :\n[i] there is a special or local law which prescribes a different period of limitation for any suit, appeal or application; and [ii] the special or local law does not expressly exclude those Sections.\n7 There is no dispute that the 1996 Act is a 'Special law' and that Section 34 provides for a period of limitation different from the prescribed under the Limitation Act. The question then is - is such exclusion expressed in Section 34 of the 1996 Act? The relevant extract of Section 34 reads:\n\"34 Application for setting aside arbitral award - [ 1 ] - [2] xxx [3] An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral Award or, if a request had been made under Section 33, from the date on which that C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal :\nProvided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.\" \n8 Had the proviso to Section 34 merely provided for a period within which the Court could exercise its discretion, that would not have been sufficient to exclude Section 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act because \"mere provision of a period of limitation in howsoever peremptory or imperative language is not sufficient to displace the applicability of Section 5\". 9 That was precisely why in construing Section 116-A of the Representation of People Act, 1951, the Constitution Bench in Vidyacharan Shukla vs. Khubchand Baghel rejected the argument that Section 5 of the Limitation Act had been excluded: (AIR p.1112, para 27) \"27 It was then said that S.116-A of the Act provided an exhaustive and exclusive code of limitation for the purpose of appeals against orders of tribunals and C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 reliance is placed on the proviso to sub-s. (3) of that section, which reads :\n`Every appeal under this Chapter shall be preferred within a period of thirty days from the date of the order of the Tribunal under Section 98 or Section Provided that the High Court may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that the appellant had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within such period.' The contention is that sub-section (3) of Section 116-A of the Act not only provides a period of limitation for such an appeal, but also the circumstances under which the delay can be excused, indicating thereby that the general provisions of the Limitation Act are excluded. There are two answers to this argument. Firstly, Section 29(2)(a) of the Limitation Act speaks of express exclusion but there is no express exclusion of sub-section (3) of Section 116-A of the Act; Secondly, the proviso from which an implied exclusion is sought to be drawn does not lead to any such necessary implication\". \nC/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 10 This decision recognises that it is not essential for the special or local law to, in terms, exclude the provisions of the Limitation Act. It is sufficient if on a consideration of the language of its provisions relating to limitation, the intention to exclude can be necessarily implied. As has been said in Hukumdev Narain Yadav vs. Lalit Narain Mishra :\n(SCC p.146, para17) \"If on an examination of the relevant provisions it is clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act are necessarily excluded, then the benefits conferred therein cannot be called in aid to supplement the provisions of the Act\" \n11 Thus, where the legislature prescribed a special limitation for the purpose of the appeal and the period of limitation of 60 days was to be computed after taking the aid of Sections 4, 5 and 12 of the Limitation Act, the specific inclusion of these sections meant that to that extent only the provisions of the Limitation Act stood extended and the applicability of the other provisions, by necessary implication stood excluded. \n12 As for as the language of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is concerned, the crucial words are C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 'but not thereafter' used in the proviso to sub- section (3). In our opinion, this phrase would amount to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, and would therefore bar the application of Section 5 of that Act. Parliament did not need to go further. To hold that the Court could entertain an application to set aside the Award beyond the extended period under the proviso, would render the phrase 'but not thereafter' wholly otiose. No principle of interpretation would justify such a result. \n13 Apart from the language, 'express exclusion' may follow from the scheme and object of the special or local law. \n\"Even in a case where the special law does not exclude the provisions of Sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act by an express reference, it would nonetheless be open to the Court to examine whether and to what extent the nature of those provisions or the nature of the subject-matter and scheme of the special law exclude their operation.\" (SCC p.146, para 17) \n14 Here the history and scheme of the 1996 Act support the conclusion that the time limit prescribed under Section 34 to challenge an Award is absolute and un-extendable by Court C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. The Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 1995 which preceded the 1996 Act stated as one of its main objectives the need \"to minimise the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral process\". This objective has found expression in Section 5 of the Act which prescribes the extent of judicial intervention in no uncertain terms :\n\"5. Extent of judicial intervention. - Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matter governed by this Part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part.\"\n15 The 'Part' referred to in Section 5 is Part I of the 1996 Act which deals with domestic arbitrations. Section 34 is contained in Part I and is therefore subject to the sweep of the prohibition contained in Section 5 of the 1996 Act. \n16 Furthermore, Section 34(1) itself provides that recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award \"in accordance with\"\nsub-section 2 and sub Section 3. Sub-section 2 relates to grounds for setting aside an award and is not relevant for our purposes. But an application filed beyond the period mentioned in C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 Section 34, sub-section (3) would not be an application \"in accordance with\" that sub section. Consequently by virtue of Section 34 (1), recourse to the court against an arbitral award cannot be made beyond the period prescribed. The importance of the period fixed under Section 34 is emphasised by the provisions of Section 36 which provide that \"where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under Section 34 has expired ... the award shall be enforced and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in the same manner as if it were a decree of a court\"\nThis is a significant departure from the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1940. Under the 1940 Act, after the time to set aside the award expired, the court was required to \"proceed to pronounce judgment according to the award and upon (he judgment so pronounced a decree shall follow\". Now the consequence of the time expiring under Section 34 of the 1996 Act is that the award becomes immediately enforceable without any further act of the Court. If there were any residual doubt on the interpretation of the language used in Section 34, the scheme of the 1996 Act would resolve the issue in favour of curtailment of the Court's C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 powers by the exclusion of the operation of Section 5 of the Limitation Act.\"\n8.2 The aforesaid judgment has time and again been considered thereafter in catena of judgments. Recently the Hon'ble Apex Court considered the same in the case of the M/s. Simplex Infrastructure Limited (supra) . In paragraphs 8 and 9 of the above judgment, the Apex Court observed as under:\n\"8. Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 provides thus:\n\"34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.--\n[1] Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3)...\n[3] An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under Section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 arbitral tribunal:\n           Provided       that        if     the     Court        is     satisfied            that     the       applicant              was        prevented              by            sufficient              cause            from          making             the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.\"\nSection 34 provides that recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award \"in accordance with\" sub-section (2) and sub-section (3). Sub-section (2) relates to the grounds for setting aside an award. An application filed beyond the period mentioned in sub-section 3 of Section 34, would not be an application \"in accordance with\" that sub-section. By virtue of Section 34(3), recourse to the court against an arbitral award cannot be beyond the period prescribed. Sub-section (3) of Section 34, read with the proviso, makes it abundantly clear that the application for setting aside the award on one of the grounds mentioned in sub-section (2) will have to be made within a period of three months from the date on which the party making that application receives the arbitral award. The proviso allows this period to be further extended by another period of thirty days on sufficient cause being shown by the party for C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 filing an application. The intent of the legislature is evinced by the use of the words \"but not thereafter\" in the proviso. These words make it abundantly clear that as far as the limitation for filing an application for setting aside an arbitral award is concerned, the statutory period prescribed is three months which is extendable by another period of upto thirty days (and no more) subject to the satisfaction of the court that sufficient reasons were provided for the delay. 9 Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 provides thus:\n\"5. Extension of prescribed period in certain cases. -- Any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be admitted after the prescribed period if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period. \nExplanation. --The fact that the appellant or the applicant was misled by any order, practice or judgment of the High Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period may be sufficient cause within the C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 meaning of this section.\" \nSection 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 deals with the extension of the prescribed period for any appeal or application subject to the satisfaction of the court that the appellant or applicant had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within the prescribed period. Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 has no application to an application challenging an arbitral award under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. This has been settled by this Court in its decision in Union of India v Popular Construction Company [(2001)8 SCC 470], where it held as follows- \"As far as the language of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is concerned, the crucial words are \"but not thereafter\" used in the proviso to sub-section (3). In our opinion, this phrase would amount to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, and would therefore bar the application of Section 5 of that Act. Parliament did not need to go further. To hold that the court could entertain an application to set aside the award beyond the extended period under the proviso, would render the phrase \"but not thereafter\" wholly otiose. No principle of interpretation would justify such a result. \nC/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 ... Here the history and scheme of the 1996 Act support the conclusion that the time- limit prescribed under Section 34 to challenge an award is absolute and un- extendible by court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act... \"\n8.3 In fact the Hon'ble Apex Court has further observed in paragraph 13 in case of Simplex Infrastructure Limited (supra) as under:\n\"13 A plain reading of sub-section (3) along with the proviso to Section 34 of the 1996 Act, shows that the application for setting aside the award on the grounds mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 34 could be made within three months and the period can only be extended for a further period of thirty days on showing sufficient cause and not thereafter. The use of the words \"but not thereafter\" in the proviso makes it clear that the extension cannot be beyond thirty days. Even if the benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act is given to the respondent, there will still be a delay of 131 days in filing the application. That is beyond the strict timelines prescribed in sub-section (3) C/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 read along with the proviso to Section 34 of the 1996 Act. The delay of 131 days cannot be condoned. To do so, as the High Court did, is to breach a clear statutory mandate.\" \n8.4 The aforesaid being the legal position which clearly establishes that the Court does not have power to condone the delay beyond the period of 30 days after a period of 3 months from the date of receipt of arbitral award or from the date on which the request under Section 33 had been disposed by the Arbitral Tribunal, and therefore, in the instant case, it is an admitted position that the application for condonation of delay was made beyond extended period of 30 days after 3 months period was over. Even if the period of delay is considered to be of 21 days. Since Section 34(3) of the Act, 1996 bars condonation of delay beyond the period of 30 days after the period of 3 months is over as Section 5 of Limitation Act is not applicable to Act, 1996. The Commercial Court has rightly dismissed the application made by the appellant praying for condonation of delay. \nC/FA/1837/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/09/2021 9 In view of the above discussion, we find that the view taken by the learned Judge, Commercial Court, City Civil Court, Ahmedabad while dismissing Commercial Civil Misc. Application No.313 of 2021 is correct and we do not find any reason to interfere with the findings and conclusions arrived at by the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad. Accordingly, the present appeal deserves to be dismissed and the same is dismissed. However, there shall be no order as to costs. Consequently, connected civil applications also stand disposed off. \n(THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE R.M.CHHAYA, J) (NIRZAR S. DESAI,J) P. SUBRAHMANYAM",

dated 03.09.2022 passed by xxii addl. city civil and sessions judge, bengaluru, in o.s.no.5686/2022 on i.a.no.1 filed under order xxxix rules 1 and 2 of cpc, this appeal is filed. 2. appellant herein was defendant no.1, while respondent no.1 herein was plaintiff and respondent no.2 herein was defendant no.2 in suit. they will be referred to as such herein. 3. o.s.no.5686/2022 was filed for judgment and decree against defendants restraining from interfering with plaintiff's peaceful possession and enjoyment of suit schedule property and lawful running of business by plaintiff therein and also restraining defendants from forcibly dispossessing plaintiff from suit schedule property other than under due process of law etc. 4. in said suit plaintiff filed ia no.1 for temporary injunction under order xxxix rules 1 and 2 of cpc in respect of building by name 'swamy legato' constructed over land bearing new sy.no.20./7, old sy.no.20/4, kadubisanahalli village, marthahalli outer ring

basement and 7 car par spaces on ground floor of said building (for short 'suit property'). 5. said application said application was opposed by defendant no.1. on consideration, trial court passed impugned order allowing i.a.no.1 and restraining defendants from interfering with possession of plaintiff over suit property. challenging same this appeal is filed. 6. sri. shravanth arya tandra, learned counsel for defendant no.1 submitted that impugned order passed was contrary to recognized principles of law governing injunction. it was submitted that relief sought for in suit was on basis of lease agreement, wherein suit property was permitted to be used for commercial purpose and therefore, jurisdiction of civil court was barred. elaborating said contention, it was submitted that defendant no.1 was owner of registered trade mark 'the black pearl and the boozy griffin restaurant'. under lease agreement dated 10.12.2015 appellant had taken on lease suit property from defendant no.2 for running said bar and restaurant for a period of 9 years. 7. it was stated that under sub-lease agreement dated 20.12.2021, defendant no.1 had agreed to lease out suit property to plaintiff for running bar and restaurant for a period of 10 years commencing from 21.12.2021. under lease agreement, plaintiff had agreed to give 60% of it's stake in bar and restaurant for consideration of rs.4,80,00,000/payable as non-refundable security deposit on or before 31.03.2022. it was also agreed that sub-lease would be subject to permission from defendant no.2 for continuation of sub-lease, which defendant no.1 was obliged to secure. therefore, subject matter of suit was commercial dispute as defined in section 2 (1)(c)(vii) of commercial courts act, 2015 (referred to as 'cc act' for brevity). therefore, suit was required to be filed before commercial court established under section 3 of cc act with exclusive jurisdiction to try all suit and applications relating to commercial dispute of specified value. it was submitted that section 12 provided for determination of specified value. 8. it was submitted that even section 134 of trade marks act (referred to as 'tm act' for brevity) mandated filing of suit for infringement etc., before a district court under tm act. 9. despite above provisions against entertaining commercial disputes suits, civil court in instant case had failed to verify it's jurisdiction and even justification, granted injunction. 10. it was submitted that plaintiff had in fact, filed two suits for same relief. defendant no.1 had entered caveat, which was put up in o.s.no.5675/2022. on appearance of defendant no.1, said suit was dismissed as withdrawn as sought for by plaintiff without reserving liberty. having bypassed caveat entered by defendant no.1, plaintiff pursued other suit i.e., o.s.5686/2022. but, as both suits were filed before same court and listed on same day. therefore, defendant no.1 became aware of tactic employed by plaintiff to defeat caveat filed by defendant no.1. 11. it was further submitted that even prior to filing of suit, there was settlement between parties as per minutes of meeting dated 12.05.2022 and plaintiff had agreed to run bar and restaurant from 01.05.2022 till recovery of sum of rs.3 crores for it's investment of rs.4.11 crores till october, 2022 and agreed to handover business back to defendant no.1 after recovery of settlement amount of rupees three crores from profits. thereafter defendant no.1 had agreed to pay amount of rupees two crores to plaintiff towards full and final settlement. said minutes of meeting were signed by plaintiff. 12. it was further submitted that relief sought in suit was barred by section 6, 14 (1)(a) and (d), sections 37, 42 and 41 (e) of specific relief act and contract would be unenforceable. therefore, same relief by way of injunction could not either be sought or granted. it was further submitted that as per annexure b payment schedule appended to plaint, amount paid by plaintiff was rs.2,10,00,000/-only. but, pleadings in plaint were as if entire amount of rs.4.33 crores was paid and another sum of rs.1.5 crores was invested for business purposes. 13. above facts would justify settlement arrived at between parties on 12.05.2022. but while passing impugned order, trial court proceeded on incorrect footing that entire amount of rs.4.33 crores was received by defendant no.1, ignoring minutes of meeting dated 12.05.2022 produced by defendant no.1. it was lastly contended that as contract between plaintiff and defendant no.1 was unenforceable, only relief available to plaintiff was to seek damages. without seeking damages, which would be substantial relief, merely seeking consequential relief of bare injunction would be barred by law. 14. referring to unnumbered para no.3, in page 3 of lease agreement dated 20.12.2021, it was submitted that plaintiff was clearly informed that defendant no.1 had taken suit premises on lease from defendant no.2 smt. sayirani. therefore, plaintiff's assertion in plaint that by keeping plaintiff in dark about limited interest of defendant no.1 in suit property, plaintiff was led to invest huge amount would be uncharitable. 15. on other hand, sri dhananjaya, learned counsel for respondent no.1 opposed appeal and supported impugned order. insofar as contention regarding jurisdiction of civil court, it was submitted that as per section 2 (1)(i) of cc act, specified value in relation to commercial dispute was defined to be of value in excess of rs.3,00,000/-. since, plaintiff was seeking for injunction, reliefs were valued under section 26(c) of kcf & sv act at rs.1,000/and court fee of rs.50/was paid. therefore, definition of commercial dispute in section 2(1)(c) of cc act including disputes arising out of agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce would not qualify as commercial dispute without suit value being higher than rs.3,00,000/-. it was also submitted that neither contention regarding lack of jurisdiction was urged by defendant no.1 before trial court nor any application for return or rejection of plaint filed. reliance was placed on decision of learned single judge of this court in case of fine footwear pvt. ltd., vs. sketchers usa inc. and anr.1, to contend that unless both twin requirements i.e., dispute falling within definition of section 2(1)(c) of c.c. act as well as of specified value more than stipulated in section 2(1)(i) of cc act were complied, dispute would not be a commercial dispute. therefore, civil suit for injunction would be maintainable before civil court. 16. it was submitted that while passing impugned order, civil court had taken into account settled legal position that even tenant by holding over or trespasser would be required to be dispossessed only in accordance with law. therefore, no interference was warranted in appeal. (2019) 5 klj 358, 17. heard learned counsel, perused impugned order and record. 18. from contentions urged, only point that arises for consideration is: \"whether impugned order passed by trial court allowing i.a.no.1 filed by plaintiff under order xxxix rules 1 and 2 of cpc calls for interference?\" 19. since, maintainability of suit before civil court as suit would lie before commercial court is urged, same is take up for consideration upfront. there is no dispute about fact that lease agreement between plaintiff and defendant no.1 was for exclusive use of suit premises for commercial purposes. but, this court in fine footwear pvt. ltd. (supra), held that unless both of twin requirements existed, dispute would not be a 'commercial dispute'. therefore, whether 'specified value' as per section 12 is more than rs.3,00,000/-, is required to be determined. 20. section 12 of cc act, reads as follows: \"determination of specified value. (1) the specified value and* of the subject-matter of the commercial dispute in a suit, appeal or application shall be determined in the following manner: (a) where the relief sought in a suit or application is for recovery of money, the money sought to be recovered in the suit or application inclusive of interest, if any, computed up to the date of filing of the suit or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining such specified value; (b) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to movable property or to a right therein, the market value of the movable property as on the date of filing of the suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining such specified value; (c) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to immovable property or to a right therein, the market value of the immovable property, as on the date of filing of the suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining specified value; (d) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to any other intangible right, the market value of the said rights as estimated by the plaintiff shall be taken into account for determining specified value; (e) omitted (2) the aggregate value of the claim and counterclaim, if any as set out in the statement of claim and the counterclaim, if any, in an arbitration of a commercial dispute shall be the basis for determining whether such arbitration is subject to jurisdiction of a commercial division, commercial appellate division or commercial court, as the case may be. (3) no appeal or civil revision application under section 115 of the code of civil procedure, 1908, as the case may be, shall lie from an order of a commercial division or commercial court finding that it has jurisdiction to hear a commercial dispute under this act.\" 21. relief sought in suit herein is permanent and mandatory injunction in respect of plaintiff's possession over immovable property i.e., suit property. in plaint, there is unequivocal assertion that suit property was being used exclusive for commercial purpose. learned division bench of high court of delhi in jagmohan behl v/s state bank of indore2, has held that scope of expressions \"arising out of\" and \"in relation to immovable property\" used in section 2(c)(vii) of cc act would include all suits in relation to immovable property used for commercial purpose, while considering similar question, whether suit for recovery of rent in relation to property let out for being used exclusively for trade and business. though said decision was distinguished and explained by hon'ble supreme court in ambalal sarabhai enterprises ltd. v/s k.s. infraspace llp3, it was with regard to expression \"used\" to mean \"actually used\" and where at time of agreement, property 2017 scc online del 10706 (2020) 15 scc 585. was not already used exclusively for commercial purpose, such cases would not be commercial disputes. 22. in view of clear recital in lease agreement that suit property was being used for running bar and restaurant, first requirement would be met. further as per section 12(1)(c) of c.c. act, specified value of suit in respect of immovable property, would be market value of such immovable property as on date of filing suit. explanation to section 2(1)(c)(a) of c.c. act states that commercial dispute shall not cease to be a commercial dispute merely because it involves \"any other relief pertaining to immovable property.\" 23. admittedly, monthly rental value of suit premises, as per lease agreement is rs.7,88,955/-, which would be more than rs.3,00,000/-, therefore, prima facie both requirements appear to be met. 24. though, contention regarding jurisdiction was not urged, before trial court, same being a question of law and going to root of matter, it could be urged even in appeal against interlocutory orders, as grant of injunction is a discretionary relief subject to several well recognised limitations. one of them, being where suit itself was not maintainable or was beyond jurisdiction. 25. high court of delhi in case of vishal pipes ltd., vs. bhavya pipe industry4, after referring to order passed by this court in fine footwear pvt. ltd. (supra)5, held that all ipr matters should first be instituted before commercial court even where suit valuation was less than rs.3,00,000/-. and if after examination of 'specified value', court would pass appropriate orders either directing plaintiff to amend plaint or pay requisite court fee or to proceed with suit as non-commercial suit. \"54. as there are no specific factors prescribed for calculating court fee/valuation in cases of injunctive/declaratory reliefs or intellectual property matters and it is left to the plaintiff to value the same, it is pertinent to refer to judicial precedents, to ascertain the extent of the plaintiff's discretion. the legal position as to suit valuation, choice of forum, payment of court fee, etc., both before and after the enactment of the cca, as emerging from various judicial decisions, is summarized below: (i) to decide the valuation and court fee payable in a case, the court should look into the allegations in the plaint and examine the substantive reliefs. mere astuteness in drafting the plaint will not be allowed to 2022 scc online del 1730 (2019) 5 klj 358 stand in the way of the court to look into the substance of the relief sought. whimsical valuation is thus not permitted. [shamsher singh v. rajinder prashad, (1973) 2 scc 524]. (ii) valuation of a suit has to be adequate and reasonable. the plaintiff cannot deliberately/arbitrarily undervalue the relief. there must be a genuine effort by the plaintiff to estimate the relief. [meenakshisundaram chettiar v. venkatachalam chettiar, (1980) 1 scc 616]; (iii) if the valuation given by the plaintiff is arbitrary and unreasonable, the court may reject the same and permit the plaintiff to correct the valuation or have the plaint rejected. the valuation must not be arbitrary or manifestly inadequate. [abdul hamid shamsi v. abdul majid, (1988) 2 scc 575] (iv) the plaintiff cannot whimsically choose a ridiculous figure for filing the suit in an arbitrary manner where there are positive materials or objective standards of valuation of the relief, on the face of the plaint. [commercial aviation & travel company v. vimani pannalal, (1988) 3 scc 423] (v) the plaintiff has to give definite reasons for not ascertaining the exact value of the relief. if the exact valuation is not done, on the basis of certain basic requirements, the plaintiff's discretion would become arbitrary. lack of bonafides would also cloud the right of the plaintiff to value the suit as per its own will. the court can then compel the plaintiff to examine the plaint and would require the plaintiff to pay the requisite ad valorem court fee. [bharat sanchar nigam ltd. v. all india bharat sanchar nigam executives' association (regd.), (2006) 130 dlt 195] (vi) the plaintiff being the dominus litis, can choose its forum. however, this prerogative or convenience for the plaintiff cannot eclipse the requirement of justice. the right to choose the forum is not an absolute one and can be taken away. [subhashini malik v. s.k. gandhi, (2016) 233 dlt 83] (vii) a court of a higher grade does not lack inherent jurisdiction to adjudicate a dispute which could have been entertained by a lower court, whereas the same would not hold good in the reverse situation. [kesavarapu venkateswarlu v. sardharala satanaryana, air 1957 ap 49 (fb) and v ramamirthaam v. rama film service, air 1951 mad 93 (fb)] (viii) there are three categories of jurisdiction: (i) territorial jurisdiction; (ii) pecuniary jurisdiction; and (iii) subject matter jurisdiction. it is only if the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, that it would lack inherent jurisdiction. [harshad chiman lal modi v. d.l.f. universal ltd., (2005) 7 scc 791 and mantoo sarkar v. oriental insurance company limited, (2009) 2 scc 244] (ix) the intention of the underlying statutes has to be considered and given effect to, unless it leads to an absurdity. the construction of a statute ought to be such as to advance the intention of the legislation and remedy any mischief. [glaxo laboratories v. presiding officer, (1984) 1 scc 1: air 1984 sc 505] (x) when there are multiple suits which could govern any subject matter, the endeavour of the court ought to be to apply a harmonious construction to the said provisions, especially when there is no repugnancy or inconsistency. [maya mathew v. state of kerala, (2010) 4 scc 498 and lalit babbar (supra)] d. consequences of absolute discretion: undervaluation and forum shopping 55. as per the table of court fees discussed in paragraph 53 above, it is noteworthy that insofar as a decree of declaration and consequential relief or injunction is concerned, the factors to be considered are not provided in the court fees act. as per the legal position captured above, it is the court's duty to ensure that a reasonable estimate is provided by the plaintiff and there is no undervaluation. such an estimate could be arrived at on the basis of the requirements stipulated in the statutory provisions. 56. this is especially important for ipr suits because usually in ipr suits, the plaintiff seeks a decree of interim/permanent injunction or a decree of declaration, coupled with damages/rendition of accounts. whenever reliefs are sought of damages or rendition of accounts, the suit is valued on a monetary basis by the plaintiff using a rough estimate and court fee is paid on the said basis. it is very unlikely that the valuation in suits where one of the reliefs sought is for damages and/or rendition of accounts, is less than rs. 3 lakhs. however, even in some cases where damages or rendition of accounts is sought, the ingenuity of lawyers and litigants does lead to suits being valued at less than rs. 3 lakhs. in such cases, the relief of injunction is also valued at rs. 200/or any other amount less than rs. 3 lakhs and minimal court fee is paid, despite the intellectual property which is the subject matter of the suit being of a very high value. 57. for instance, in the present appeal which is before this court, the mark being sought to be protected is 'vpl india' against the defendant's mark 'bpi'. the turnover of the plaintiff as pleaded in the suit and as per the ca certificate placed on record dated 5 august, 2021, is approximately rs. 67306 lakhs over the last three financial years, i.e., 20182021. moreover, the plaintiff has stated in its plaint that it has \"commanded handsome sales running into billions of rupees\". it is also stated to have spent \"enormous amounts of money\" in advertising and publicity. the said mark, including the label, is stated to have extensive goodwill and reputation, having been adopted in 1988, with copyright and trademark registrations dating back to 2006. the plaintiff has stated that it has reputed clients such as uttar pradesh jal nigam, ntpc, bsnl, mtnl, l&t, etc., across india and worldwide. the plaintiff is also stated to have extensive reach and online presence through both its website and third-party sites like indiamart, facebook, linkedin, etc. the plaintiff also has numerous quality certifications and recognitions, including iso, bis, and one star export house (recognized by the director general of foreign trade). despite all these facts, it is puzzling that the reliefs of injunction as also delivery-up, are valued at rs. 200/each for court fee and jurisdiction, which is much below rs. 3 lakhs. the court fee paid is rs. 100/for such reliefs. additionally, the relief of rendition of accounts is valued at rs. 1000/and court fees of rs. 150/is paid for the same. such a course of action appears to be quite unusual and quixotic, as there is no basis in the suit as to why a trademark suit of a brand having such a huge turnover is sought to be valued at such a low threshold. moreover, the suit in the present case does not mention the 'specified value' at all, but merely the value of reliefs sought. 58. in the opinion of this court, by merely valuing the relief in the suit below rs. 3 lakhs, the plaintiff ought not to be permitted to escape the rigors of the cca or indulge in forum shopping or bench hunting. the practice of forum shopping has been time and again condemned by courts and most recently in vijay kumar ghai v. state of west bengal [slp (crl.) 10951 of 2019, decided on 22 march, 2022], the supreme court held as under: \"7. predominantly, the indian judiciary has time and again reiterated that forum shopping take several hues and shades but the concept of 'forum shopping' has not been rendered an exclusive definition in any indian statute. forum shopping as per merriam webster dictionary is: the practice of choosing the court in which to bring an action from among those courts that could properly exercise jurisdiction based on determination of which court is likely to provide the most favourable outcome. 8. the indian judiciary's observation and obiter dicta has aided in streamlining the concept of forum shopping in the indian legal system. this court has condemned the practice of forum shopping by litigants and termed it as an abuse of law and also deciphered different categories of forum shopping. xxx xxx xxx 10. forum shopping has been termed as disreputable practice by the courts and has no sanction and paramountcy in law. in spite of this court condemning the practice of forum shopping, respondent no. 2 filed two complaints i.e., a complaint under section 156(3) code of criminal procedure before the tis hazari court, new delhi o 06.06.2012 and a complaint which was eventually registered as fir no. 168 under section 406, 420, 120b penal code, 1860 before ps bowbazar, calcutta o 28.03.2013. i.e., one in delhi and one complaint in kolkata. the complaint filed in kolkata was a reproduction of the complaint filed in delhi except with the change of place occurrence in order to create a jurisdiction. 11. a two-judge bench of this court in krishna lal chawla v. state of u.p. (2021) 5 scc 435 observed that multiple complaints by the same party against the same accused in respect of the same incident is impermissible. it held that permitting multiple complaints by the same party in respect of the same incident, whether it involves a cognizable or private complaint offence, will lead to the accused being entangled in numerous criminal proceedings. as such he would be forced to keep surrendering his liberty and precious time before the police and the courts, as and when required in each case.\" 59. it is thus clear to this court that while all ipr disputes irrespective of their 'specified value' may not invoke the provisions of the cca, there ought to be a preliminary exercise required to confirm that the valuation of such suits has not been done arbitrarily. this may be done on the judicial side, as per the scmsc. such examination by the commercial court is essential so as to obviate any attempts of forum shopping. e. the way forward 60. in the backdrop of the above discussed legal position and the statutory provisions, insofar as delhi is concerned, the following facts are of utmost relevance: (i) the pecuniary jurisdiction of the commercial division of the high court is rs. 2 crores and above. (ii) the pecuniary jurisdiction of the district courts (district judges/adjs), is between rs. 3 lakhs to rs. 2 crores. (iii) consequently, suits which are valued below rs. 3 lakhs are filed before lower courts i.e., sub-judge/civil judge (iv) in delhi, commercial courts have been notified vide order no.60, only at the level of the district courts, as the pecuniary jurisdiction of these courts also matches with the lowest threshold fixed by the cca for 'specified value', i.e., rs.3 lakhs. (v) as per the ipr statutes, ipr suits have to be mandatorily filed only in \"district courts having jurisdiction\". 61. the facts being so, there are two pertinent questions before this court: \"(i) can ipr suits be valued below rs. 3 lakhs and be listed before the district judges who are not notified as commercial courts?; and (ii) whether the provisions of cca would be applicable to such disputes?\" 62. to answer the above, first, the discussion in paragraph 25 above is pertinent, as it clearly shows that ipr disputes are a set of disputes which lie only before the district court. thus, in that sense, such disputes are an exception to the rule of institution of cases at the court of the lowest level having jurisdiction. with the enactment of the cca, the subject-matter jurisdiction over ipr disputes now vests with the commercial courts, at the district court level. therefore, can litigants and lawyers escape the rigors of the provisions of the cca by valuing the suits below rs. 3 lakhs? the answer ought to be a clear 'no'. this is due to the following reasons: (i) the application of the judicial principles that the plaintiff is dominus litis and is free to value the suit in the manner it so chooses, has to be in the context of enactment of the cca. the principles cannot be stretched to justify undervaluation of ipr disputes and payment of lower court fee. (ii) not ascribing a 'specified value' in the suit would be contrary to the scheme of the cca which requires every suit to have a 'specified value', if the subject matter of the suit is a 'commercial dispute'. a perusal of section 12(1)(d) of the cca does offer some guidance, that the 'specified value' in case of intangible rights would be the market value of the said rights as estimated by the plaintiff. (iii) in ipr disputes, the relief of injunction or damages may be valued by the plaintiff, at an amount lower than the sum of rs. 3 lakhs and court fee may be paid on that basis. if such valuation is permitted, despite some objective criteria being available for valuing ipr in the cca it would defeat the very purpose of the enactment of special provisions for ipr statutes and the cca. these statutes would have to be harmoniously construed i.e., in a manner so as to further the purpose of the legislation and not to defeat it. thus, it would be mandatory for ipr suits to be ascribed a 'specified value', in the absence of which the valuation of the suit below rs. 3 lakhs would be arbitrary, whimsical and wholly unreasonable. in this view, intellectual property rights being intangible rights, some value would have to be given to the subject matter of the dispute as well. the court would have to take into consideration the 'specified value' based upon not merely the value of the relief sought but also the market value of the intangible right involved in the said dispute. (iv) the subject matter of ipr disputes is usually trademarks, rights in copyrightable works, patents, designs and such other intangible property. the said amount of rs. 3 lakhs is the estimation of the legislature as being the lowest threshold in any 'commercial dispute' in india which deserves to benefit from speedier adjudication, owing to the economic progress in the country. the intention of the legislature in keeping a lower threshold in a 'commercial dispute' of rs. 3 lakhs cannot be rendered meaningless. it would only be in exceptional cases that valuation of ipr disputes below rs. 3 lakhs could be justified. accordingly, section 12(1)(d) has been included in the cca, where the subject matter of \"intellectual property\" has been contemplated by the legislature to be an intangible right, in respect of which the market value has to be estimated by the plaintiff, for determining the 'specified value'. (v) the average court fee paid in delhi in any civil suit is approximately 3% to 1% of the pecuniary value ascribed to the suit. in fact, delhi is one of the territories where ad valorem court fee is paid beyond a particular threshold. when seen from this perspective, i.e., that at rs. 3 lakhs, the court fee payable is minimal, it is apparent that the only reason for which ipr disputes may be valued below rs. 3 lakhs by litigants or lawyers would be to indulge in forum shopping and bench hunting and not merely to exercise the option of the forum where relief is sought. the purpose would also be to escape the rigors of the provisions of the cca. such a practice would constitute abuse by plaintiffs of their rights, at the very least. (vi) usually, ipr disputes are filed by business entities. however, considering the court fee payable even if such suits are valued at a minimum of rs. 3,00,000/-, even individual ipr owners would be easily able to afford the court fee at the rate of 1-3%. there thus appears to be no valid or justifiable cause to value an ipr suit below rs. 3 lakhs except for oblique motives. thus, the discretion vested in the plaintiff to value the suit as it pleases, ought not to be extended or stretched to an extent that it encourages malpractice, misuse, abuse and forum shopping. 63. in view of the above analysis and legal position, since ipr suits have to be instituted in the district courts \"having jurisdiction\", for the territory of delhi, it is held that the district judges notified as commercial courts which have subject matter jurisdiction under the cca, would be the district courts \"having jurisdiction\". 64. therefore, in delhi, in order to avail of its remedies provided under the various ipr statutes, a plaintiff ought to usually institute the suit before the district court having jurisdiction i.e., district judge (commercial) by valuing it at rs. 3 lakhs or above, and pay the basic required court fee to invoke the jurisdiction of the said court. however, acknowledging the plaintiff's reasonable discretion in valuing its suit, it is held that in case a plaintiff values an ipr suit below the threshold of rs. 3 lakhs, such suits would be listed before the district judge (commercial) first, in order to determine as to whether the valuation is arbitrarily whimsical or deliberately undervalued. 65. this court is cognizant of the fact that the valuation of intellectual property is by itself a very complex process. it is clarified that the commercial court is not expected to value the specific ip on the basis of any mathematical formulae but to broadly take into consideration whether the said ip would be worth more than rs.3 lakhs, which is the threshold for the commercial court to exercise jurisdiction. 66. in light of the above discussion, the following directions are issued: (i) usually, in all ipr cases, the valuation ought to be rs.3 lakhs and above and proper court fee would have to be paid accordingly. all ipr suits to be instituted before district courts, would therefore, first be instituted before the district judge (commercial). (ii) in case of any ipr suits valued below rs. 3 lakhs, the commercial court shall examine the specified value and suit valuation to ensure it is not arbitrary or unreasonable and the suit is not undervalued. (iii) upon such examination, the concerned commercial court would pass appropriate orders in accordance with law either directing the plaintiff to amend the plaint and pay the requisite court fee or to proceed with the suit as a noncommercial suit. (iv) in order to however maintain consistency and clarity in adjudication, even such suits which may be valued below rs.3 lakhs and continue as non-commercial suits, shall also continue to be listed before the district judge (commercial), but may not be subjected to the provisions of the cca. (v) all pending ipr suits before the different district judges (non-commercial) in delhi shall be placed before the concerned district judges (commercial) for following the procedure specified above plaintiffs who wish to amend the plaint would be permitted to do so in accordance with law.\" 26. though above directions were issued in relation to all ipr matters falling within section 12 (1) (d) of cc act, whether same would also apply to non-ipr commercial cases falling under clauses (a), (b) and (c) of section 12 (1) of cc act would require examination. 27. one of main concerns addressed in vishal pipes ltd., (supra) was avoiding deliberate undervaluation to maintain suit before civil court and forum hunting, which was sought to be curtailed by directing all matters concerning commercial disputes to be filed only before commercial court, even if 'specified value' was less than rs.3 lakhs and requiring its examination by commercial court. but possibility of such determination process itself, clogging 'commercial courts' affecting timeline for disposal of commercial disputes cannot be lost sight of. hon'ble supreme court in ambalal sarabhai enterprises ltd. has cautioned about ill-effects of clogging of commercial courts. 28. at same time, when cc act does not bar suit with specified value below rupees three lakhs being filed before civil court, instead of compelling all suits involving commercial disputes from being filed before commercial courts, it would be appropriate to adopt procedure evolved by this court in crp.no.545/2022 disposed of on 13.12.2022. 29. in said petition, while deciding legality of rejection of defendant's contention about lack of jurisdiction of civil court, this court directed plaintiff to specifically state in plaint 'specified value' as per provisions of cc act, which trial court would verify while deciding its jurisdiction, before proceeding to entertain suit and to return it for re-presentation before commercial court, in case, it was not. such measure would prevent commercial courts from being clogged with determination of 'specified value' and would also be in tune with fine footwear pvt. ltd. (supra). 30. directions issued in said petition relevant for present case are extracted as follows: \"15. the specified value of the plaint has to be mentioned only to show the jurisdiction in which court the suit should be filed. no where in any statute it is mentioned that if specified value as contemplated under commercial courts act is not mentioned in the plaint, the same is liable to be rejected or suit is liable to be dismissed. if the court comes to the conclusion that the suit has been filed in wrong court, the same requires to be returned as contemplated in order vii rule 10 of cpc, to be presented in the appropriate court. thus, even if the trial court comes to the conclusion that in the instant case it has no jurisdiction to try the case, the plaint requires to be returned and the suit cannot be dismissed. 16. further, in the instant case, the plaintiff has not stated the specified value as contemplated under section 12 of the 11 crp no. 545 of 2022 commercial courts act and it would be appropriate for the court to give an opportunity to the plaintiff to determine the market value of the right, as estimated by him, that he has sought to enforce in the present suit and thereby state as to the specified value and thereafter take a decision whether the trial court has jurisdiction or not to try the case.\" 31. until determination of specified value of subject matter of suit as per section 12 of cc act, suit cannot be held to be not maintainable by referring to rental value etc. of suit premises, which would not be as per method of assessment provided under section 12 of cc act. therefore, answer to point under consideration would be subject to determination of 'specified value' by trial court. 32. hence, point for consideration is answered partly in negative. consequently following: order i. appeal is disposed of directing plaintiff to plead regarding specified value of suit, within 15 days from today. trial court is directed to determine whether same would be below threshold limit specified in cc act and consequently decide on its jurisdiction to entertain suit, as expeditiously as possible therefrom after providing opportunity to defendants also, but not later than 30 days. ii. in case, suit is held not maintainable, interim injunction would stand vacated with liberty to plaintiff to seek said relief before commercial court. iii. impugned order dated 03.09.2022 passed by xxii addl. city civil and sessions judge, bengaluru, in o.s.no.5686/2022 will be subject to such determination as above. sd/judge psg*"
