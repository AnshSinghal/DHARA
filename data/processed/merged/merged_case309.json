The question of law being decided by this order is: whether the mandatory timeline of 120 days for filing a written statement in a Commercial Suit is applicable to suits which were filed prior  to the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (\"Commercial Courts Act\") and have subsequently been 'transferred' as Commercial Suits to be heard by a Commercial Division of this Court ? \n2. For adjudication of the question of law as above, it would be necessary to briefly set-out the legislative background leading to the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act as also the establishment of Commercial Division/s in this Court :\n2.1. The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Ordinance, 2015 was promulgated on 23rd October, 2015. Subsequently, the Commercial Courts Act was enacted on 31st December, 2015 and is deemed to have come into force from 23rd October, 2015. \n2.2. The Commercial Courts Act came to be enacted pursuant to the recommendations made by the Law Commission of India in its 188th Report and 253rd Report. \n2.3. The primary aim and object of the Commercial Courts Act, as can be discerned from its Statement of Objects and Reasons, was to provide speedy disposal of commercial disputes in order to reduce the pendency of cases and improve our country's image from the perspective of ease of doing business in India. 2.4. Under Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act, Commercial Divisions were constituted in this Court for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and powers conferred under the Commercial Courts Act. Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act reads as under:\n\"4. Constitution of Commercial Division of High Court. \n(1) In all High Courts, having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the Chief Justice of the High Court may, by order, constitute Commercial Division having one or more Benches consisting of a single Judge for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under this Act. \n(2) The Chief Justice of the High Court shall nominate such Judges of the High Court who have experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be Judges of the Commercial Division. \"\n2.5. Chapter V, Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act inter alia provides for the transfer of suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value pending before this Court to the Commercial Division of this Court. Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act reads as under :\n\"15. Transfer of pending cases.--\n(1) All suits and applications, including applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value pending in a High Court where a Commercial Division has been constituted, shall be transferred to the Commercial Division. \n(2) All suits and applications, including applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a Commercial Court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such Commercial Court:\nProvided that no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the Court prior to the constitution of the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court shall be transferred either under sub- section (1) or sub-section (2).\n(3) Where any suit or application, including an application under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of Specified Value shall stand transferred to the Commercial Division or Commercial Court under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the provisions of this Act shall apply to those procedures that were not complete at the time of transfer.\n(4) The Commercial Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be, may hold case management hearings in respect of such transferred suit or application in order to prescribe new timelines or issue such further directions as may be necessary for a speedy and efficacious disposal of such suit or application in accordance with Order XV-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908):\nProvided that the proviso to sub-rule (1) of Rule 1 of Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall not apply to such transferred suit or application and the court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which the written statement shall be filed. \n(5) In the event that such suit or application is not transferred in the manner specified in sub-section (1), sub- section (2) or sub-section (3), the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court may, on the application of any of the parties to the suit, withdraw such suit or application from the court before which it is pending and transfer the same for trial or disposal to the Commercial Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be, having territorial jurisdiction over such suit, and such order of transfer shall be final and binding. \"\n2.6 Therefore, pursuant to the aforesaid Section 15, on 3 rd May, 2016, the Ld. Prothonotary & Senior Master of this Court issued the following notification:\n\"\nNOTICE The Advocates and parties appearinginperson are hereby informed that the Government of India has enacted 'Commercial Courts, Commercial Division, Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015' with effect from 23rd October, 2015. \nIn terms of the provisions of the said Act, the Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division have been constituted in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. \nIn accordance with Section 15 of the said Act, all Suits, Applications and matters relating to commercial dispute of a specified value (the value of the subject matter in respect of Suit as determined in accordance with Section 12 which shall not be less than one crore rupees), shall be transferred to the \"Commercial Division\" of Bombay High Court. \nIn accordance with Section 13 of the said Act, with effect from 23rd October, 2015, all Appeals pertaining to decision of Commercial Division shall be heard by Commercial Appellate Division of Bombay High Court. \nIn view thereof, lists of Suits, Applications and matters pertaining to the commercial dispute with a specified value which will be transferred to the Commercial Division or Commercial Appellate Division have been prepared and the same have been notified separately. Advocates and Parties appearing-inperson are hereby directed to go through the said lists and submit their objections / suggestions, if any, for transferring the said matters to the Commercial Division / Commercial Appellate Division on or before 18th June, 2016 in writing to the undersigned, failing which the matter will be transferred and placed before the Commercial Division or Commercial Appellate Division accordingly. \nSimilarly, if there are any other matters, apart from the matters shown in the list, which pertain to Commercial Division or Commercial Appellate Division, the Advocates and parties appearinginperson are hereby requested to furnish particulars of such matters to the undersigned in writing on or before 18th June, 2016, without fail. \nDated this 3rd Day of May, 2016. \n\"\n2.7. By various further orders, the Ld. Prothonotary & Senior Master directed pending suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value to be transferred as Commercial Suits and heard by the Commercial Division of this Court. \n3. In the present Suit, being one such ' transferred suit', Defendant No.1 has not to filed its written statement within the prescribed period of 120 days as mandated under the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act. The Apex Court, in its decision in M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. & Ors . [2019 SCC OnLine SC 226] and this Court, in its decision in Axis Bank Limited vs. Mira Gehani & Ors. [2019 SCC OnLine Bom 358] have held that in Commercial Suits, a written statement by the Defendant cannot be taken on record after the expiry of 120 days from the date of service of the Writ of Summons. However, neither of these two decisions have dealt with the question of law as has been framed in paragraph 1 above. Therefore, this Court, in its decision rendered in Axis Bank Limited vs. Mira Gehani & Ors. (cited supra) has clarified as follows: \n\"114.It is clarified that in so far as the question of applicability of the Commercial Courts Act on Suits transferred from non- commercial Suits to Commercial Suits by the office of this Court is concerned (as has arisen in Commercial Suit No. 29 of 2013 and Commercial IP Suit No. 418 of 2016), a separate Order will be passed. \"\n4. It is therefore clarified that the present Order is restricted only to answering the question of law recorded in paragraph no.1 above. Necessary orders will therefore have to be passed on each application seeking condonation of delay at the time of hearing such applications on their own merits.\n5. Appearing for the Defendants, Ld. Counsel Mr. Sharan Jagtiani submitted that the Commercial Courts Act excludes the applicability of the strict timeline of 120 days to transferred suits and provides this Court with the necessary power to prescribe new timelines for filing a written statement in so far as transferred suits are concerned. In this context, he placed reliance on Chapter V, Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act. He argued that Section 15 (4) empowers this Court to hold case management hearings for such transferred suits in order to prescribe new timelines, with a proviso that excludes the applicability of the strict timeline of 120 days imposed under Order V Rule 1 of the CPC. Although the proviso to Section 15 (4) does not specifically refer to the timeline stipulated in Order VIII Rule 1 for filing written statement, it is obvious that the proviso would exclude this as well. Order V Rule 1 and Order VIII Rule 1 affect substantive and valuable rights and therefore, cannot be applied retrospectively unless there is express language to that effect. Far from there being no language to suggest their retrospective operation, the contraindication in Section 15 (4) is that the strict timeline of 120 days does not apply to transferred suits and it allows this Court to set new timelines for transferred suits. This suggests that there is no outer limit for filing a written statement in a transferred suit. He placed reliance on the decisions in Telefonaktiebolaget L.M. Ericsson vs. Lava International Limited [(2016) 226 DLT 342] and Leitwind Shriram Manufacturing Limited vs. SKF India Limited & Ors. [Chamber Summons Commercial Division No. 336 of 2017 in Commercial Suit No.432 of 2016]. Placing reliance on the decisions in Kailash vs. Nankhu [(2005) 4 SCC 480], Sandeep Thapar vs. SME Technologies Pvt. Ltd. [(2014) 2 SCC 302] and Justice Micheal F. Saldanha (Retd) vs. Sri. M.P. Noronha [ILR 2016 Kar 4700] Mr. Jagtiani therefore concluded that this Court has the power to condone any delay in filing the written statement and that the delay in Defendant No.1 filing its written statement be condoned and its written statement be taken on record. \n6. As opposed to the aforesaid arguments of Mr. Jagtiani, I have heard Ld. Counsel Mr. Zubin Behramkamdin and Mr. Shyam Kapadia appearing for the Plaintiff. The Advocates for the Plaintiff submitted that Section 15 (4) of the Commercial Courts Act would come into play only if Writ of Summons are issued under Order V Rule 1. It is therefore that the proviso to Section 15 (4) excludes reference to the proviso to Order VIII Rule 1. Even if the provision of Section 15 (4) of the Commercial Courts Act was to apply, it does not suspend the operation of the mandatory timeline of 120 days. That the primary aim and object of the Commercial Courts Act is to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes in order to reduce the pendency of cases. It was further argued that if the submission of Defendant No.1 is accepted, it would mean that a defendant in a non-commercial suit, later transferred as a commercial suit, who has not filed its written statement for say 15 years, would get a right to file a written statement upon the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act. In this context, reliance was placed on the Delhi High Court's decision in AIS Glass Solutions vs. Moser Baer Solar Limited [(2017) SCC Online Del 11467]. It was also argued that if the Applicant's submissions are accepted, it would negate the very intent behind the passing of the Commercial Courts Act. Even if a new timeline is to be prescribed, it cannot be in excess of 120 days from (i) 3rd May, 2015 i.e. the date on which the Commercial Division of this Court was constituted; or (ii) 1st June, 2016 i.e. the date on which all fresh suits were to be filed as commercial suits. That in the present case, the period of 120 days ought to commence from 21st September, 2017 when this Court (Coram: K.R. Shriram, J.) passed an order directing Defendant No.1 to file its written statement or the date on which Defendant No.1 waived service of the Writ of Summons, which was much prior to the date of 21st September, 2017. That in the present case, the 30 days, extendable by 90 days commenced on 21st September, 2017 and expired on 19th January, 2018. However, the present Notice of Motion has been filed on 27th February, 2018 i.e. after 120 days and is hence liable to be dismissed. \n7. The Advocates for the Plaintiff also submitted that once a pending suit is transferred to the list of commercial suits, it becomes subject to all the rigors and provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. No discrimination can be permitted between fresh commercial suits and transferred commercial suits. This would lead to a complete divide and a distinction between fresh commercial suits and transferred commercial suits and would lead to an unfair discrimination to Plaintiffs who have filed transferred commercial suits as they would be unable to avail the benefits under the new mandatory provisions. In support of these arguments, reliance was placed on the decisions rendered by the Apex Court in M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. (cited supra) and the decision of this Court in Axis Bank Limited vs. Mira Gehani & Ors. (cited supra). According to them, Section 15 (4) must be read down and interpreted in a manner that would not defeat the scheme, object, intent and purpose of the Commercial Courts Act. Without prejudice, even if this Court were to hold that the time for filing a written statement can be extended under Section 15 (4), in the present matter, such extension was granted by this Court on 21 st September, 2017. The Advocates for the Plaintiff therefore concluded that the present Notice of Motion ought to be dismissed. \n8. I have considered the aforesaid arguments canvassed by the Plaintiff and Defendants. I have also considered the various decisions of the Apex Court, this Court and the Delhi High Court as cited by them. However, prior to dealing with their respective arguments, it would be necessary even at the cost of repetition to once again set-out the subject provision viz. Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act:\n\"15. Transfer of pending cases.--\n(1) All suits and applications, including applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value pending in a High Court where a Commercial Division has been constituted, shall be transferred to the Commercial Division. \n(2) All suits and applications, including applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a Commercial Court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such Commercial Court:\nProvided that no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the Court prior to the constitution of the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court shall be transferred either under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2). \n(3) Where any suit or application, including an application under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of Specified Value shall stand transferred to the Commercial Division or Commercial Court under sub- section (1) or sub-section (2), the provisions of this Act shall apply to those procedures that were not complete at the time of transfer. \n(4) The Commercial Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be, may hold case management hearings in respect of such transferred suit or application in order to prescribe new timelines or issue such further directions as may be necessary for a speedy and efficacious disposal of such suit or application in accordance with Order XV-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908):\nProvided that the proviso to sub-rule (1) of Rule 1 of Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall not apply to such transferred suit or application and the court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which the written statement shall be filed.\n(5) In the event that such suit or application is not transferred in the manner specified in sub-section (1), sub-section (2) or sub- section (3), the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court may, on the application of any of the parties to the suit, withdraw such suit or application from the court before which it is pending and transfer the same for trial or disposal to the Commercial Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be, having territorial jurisdiction over such suit, and such order of transfer shall be final and binding.\"\n9. A bare reading of Section 15 (4) of the Commercial Courts Act begs the interpretation that a Commercial Division, such as the present one, is vested with jurisdiction to hold Case Management Hearings in respect of transferred suits in order to prescribe new timelines or issue such further directions as may be necessary for a speedy and efficacious disposal of transferred suits or applications in accordance with Order XV-A of the CPC. The proviso to Section 15 (4) further provides that the proviso to sub-rule (1) of Rule 1 of Order V of the CPC shall not apply to such transferred suits and the court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which a written statement shall be filed. The important aspect of the language of the proviso is that it specifically states that the Court has \"discretion\" to prescribe new timelines and that it excludes the applicability of the 120 timeline stipulated in Order V Rule 1 of the CPC. \n10. In view of the clear language of the said provision, I do not agree with the Plaintiff's argument that Section 15 (4) of the Commercial Courts Act would come into play only if Writ of Summons' are issued under Order V Rule 1. I do not see any such distinction carved out in Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act. For the same reason, I also cannot accept the argument that even if the provision of Section 15 (4) of the Commercial Courts Act is to apply, it does not suspend the operation of the mandatory timeline of 120 days. I also do not find any merit in the argument that the proviso to Section 15 (4) does not exclude the proviso to Order VIII Rule 1 and therefore, the period of 120 days continues to apply. There can be no doubt, and even the Ld. Counsel for the Plaintiff did not argue otherwise, that the period of 120 days mentioned in Order V Rule 1 of the CPC is the same as mentioned in Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC. Therefore, if the proviso to Section 15 (4) of the Commercial Courts Act excludes the time period as mentioned in Order V Rule 1 of the CPC, it for all purposes has excluded the applicability of the 120 days time period for filing written statements in respect of transferred suits. The interpretation contended by the Ld. Counsel for the Plaintiff, in my opinion, would render Section 15 (4) otiose. Had the legislature intended for the 120 days period to apply to transferred suits (by either referring to the proviso to Order V Rule 1 and/or the proviso to Order VIII Rule 1 and/or the proviso to Order VIII Rule 10) there would have been no requirement of carving out this very exception under Section 15 (4). Whilst I agree that the primary aim and object of the Commercial Courts Act is to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes in order to reduce the pendency of cases, if the submission of the Plaintiff is accepted, it would negate the very intent behind the legislature's introduction of Section 15 (4) of the Commercial Courts Act. In the event the Plaintiff's interpretation is accepted, it would render Section 15 (4) nugatory and otiose. In any event, the Plaintiff itself seems unsure as to whether the period of 120 days is to be calculated from the date of the constitution of this Commercial Division or from the 21st September, 2017 Order or from the date on which service of Writ of Summons was waived. \n11. In my view, Section 15 (4) is a provision specifically introduced by the legislature in its wisdom whilst drafting the Commercial Courts Act. I am therefore, inclined to harmoniously construe Section 15 (4) of the Commercial Courts Act with the other provisions introduced by the Commercial Courts Act including the amendments introduced to Order V and Order VIII. Harmoniously construed, Section 15 (4) vests the Commercial Division / Commercial Court with the necessary jurisdiction to hold Case Management Hearings to prescribe new timelines or issue further directions including prescribing a new time period within which a written statement shall be filed. \n12. In so far as the Plaintiff's argument on waiver is concerned, as has been held by this Court, the delay in filing a written statement within 120 days from the date of waiver of service of writ of summons cannot be condoned in Commercial Suits filed after the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act [see paragraph no. 103 of Axis Bank Limited vs. Mira Gehani & Ors. (cited supra)]. However, such waiver would not divest this Court from the power to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 15 (4) of the Commercial Courts Act in respect of transferred suits. I am also of the opinion that in a transferred suit waiver of Writ of Summons does not amount to a Defendant waiving the applicability of the provisio to Section 15 (4) of the Commercial Courts Act. That is a power or discretion to be exercised by the Court. There is nothing in the scheme or provisions of the Commercial Courts Act to suggest that for transferred suits the strict time limit of 120 days will apply to those cases where service of the Writ of Summons is waived. Also in the facts of the present case, to the extent relevant for deciding the legal issue as set out above, if the period of 120 days was to commence from the date of waiver of the service of the Writ of Summons as noted by the order of the Ld. Prothonotary and Senior Master, then the time period of 4 weeks to file the written statement by the Order dated 27 th September, 2017, which was much after the 120 days from the date of waiver of Writ of Summons, would have no meaning. In fact the Plaintiffs through their Advocate appeared before this Court on 27th September, 2017, and the Order appears to have been passed with their consent. I am therefore of the opinion that there is no clarity on the submission of the Plaintiffs as to when the period of 120 days for filing the written statement in a transferred suit or in this transferred suit is to begin from. The difficulty in identifying such a starting point for determining the 120 days for filing a written statement in transferred suits, especially as there is no such provision made in Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act, is yet another reason to accept and apply the plain language of Section 15 (4) and the proviso that such a time period was not intended to apply in transferred suits. \n13. It was also the argument of the Plaintiff's Advocates that once a pending suit is transferred as a commercial suit, it becomes subject to all the rigors and provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. However, this argument cannot stand the test of scrutiny for, in my opinion, such argument is in conflict with the express provisions of the Commercial Courts Act itself and especially Section 15 thereof. It was also argued that no discrimination must be permitted between fresh commercial suits and transferred commercial suits. This, according to the Advocates for the Plaintiff, would lead to a complete divide and distinction between fresh commercial suits and transferred commercial suits and would lead to an unfair discrimination to Plaintiffs who have filed transferred commercial suits as they would be unable to avail the benefits under the new mandatory provisions. Once again, the interpretation canvassed on behalf of the Plaintiff is in stark contrast to the very difference/distinction carved out under Section 15 (4). In view thereof, I see no reason to read down Section 15 as suggested by the Advocates for the Plaintiff. \n14. I am in respectful agreement with the interpretation of Section 15 as interpreted by this Court in Leitwind Shriram Manufacturing Limited vs. SKF India Limited & Ors. (cited supra) . In the said decision, this Court has held:\n\"By this chamber summons, the applicant seeks condonation of delay of one day in filing written statement. Learned counsel appearing for the applicant invited my attention to the section 15(4) along with proviso thereto of the Commercial Court Act, 2015 and would submit that this suit was transferred from Original Side of this Court to the commercial court in view of the provisions of the said Act. He submits that in fact, there was no delay in filing written statement. He submits that in any event the delay of one day in filing chamber summons is explained in the affidavit in support of the chamber summons. \n2. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff does not dispute that the provisions of section 15(4) of the Commercial Court Act, 2015 would apply to the facts of this case. Statement is accepted. \n3. In my view, delay of one day is sufficiently explained in support of the chamber summons. \n4. Chamber summons is accordingly made absolute in the aforesaid terms. \n5. Office is directed to accept the written statement of the defendant no.1 on record. \n6. There shall be no order as to costs.\" \n15. I am also in agreement with the decision of the Delhi High Court in Telefonaktiebolaget L.M. Ericsson vs. Lava International Limited [(2016) 226 DLT 342] wherein the Delhi High Court interpreted Section 15 as under:\n\"16.The proviso of Section 15(4) of the Ordinance gives the Court discretion to set a new time for filing of written statement in relation to such transferred suit. ... \n17.Thus, there is an exemption provided under the Commercial Courts Ordinance for matters that were filed prior to the notification of the Ordinance, whereby the Court has the discretion to set a case management timeline and extend the time period for completion of pleadings including the written statement. \n23.The present suit squarely falls under the said exemption and this Court has the discretion to provide for extended timelines for completion of pleadings as per the prior statute. \n24.The prescribed period of 120 days' timeline will be applicable in cases filed subsequent to the notification of the Ordinance and the same is not applicable in the present case. \n\"\n16. In addition to the aforesaid decisions, there is another decision of the Delhi High Court in AIS Glass Solutions Limited vs. Moser Baer Solar Limited & Ors. [2017 SCC OnLine Del 11467] that has considered the subject provisions and held as under: \n3.It is pertinent to mention that present application has been filed on behalf of the defendant no. 1 seeking extension of time for filing the written statement. \n4.Mr. K.P.S. Kohli, learned counsel for the defendant no.\n1/applicant submits that after coming into force of Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Court Act, 2015 (for short \"the Act\"), this Court can and should prescribe a new time period within which the defendant can file a written statement. In support of his submissions, he relies upon Proviso to Section 15(4) of the Act, 2015, which is reproduced hereinbelow:--\n\"15. Transfer of pending cases.--\nxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx (4) The Commercial Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be, may hold case management hearings in respect of such transferred suit or application in order to prescribe new timelines or issue such further directions as may be necessary for a speedy and efficacious disposal of such suit or application in accordance with Order XIV-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908):\nProvided that the proviso to sub-rule (1) of Rule 1 of Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall not apply to such transferred suit or application and the court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which the written statement shall be filed.\"\n5.Mr. Kohli relies upon judgment of a Coordinate Bench of this Court inTelefonaktiebolaget L.M. Ericsson v. Lava International Limited, 2015 SCC OnLine Del 13903 wherein it has been held as under:--\n\"17. Thus, there is an exemption provided under the Commercial Courts Ordinance for matters that were filed prior to the notification of the Ordinance, whereby the Court has the discretion to set a case management timeline and extend the time period for completion of pleadings including the written statement.\" \n6.Mr. Kohli points out that present application was filed by the defendant no. 1 within one hundred twenty days period from the date the proceeding filed under Section 22 of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (for short \"SICA\") abated. \n7.A perusal of the paper book reveals that the present suit was filed on 7th May, 2015. On 12th June, 2015, the defendant no. 1 was registered under Section 15(1) of SICA by Board for Industrial & Financial Reconstruction (BIFER) and consequently was entitled for protection under Section 22 of SICA even prior to the date it received summons and the paper book. \n8. On 21s September, 2016, the present suit was re-numbered as a commercial suit. \n9. On 1s February, 2016, proceedings initiated by the defendant no. 1 under the SICA abated and the protection under Section 22 of SICA cease to apply. \n10. Admittedly, after thirty days, extendable upto ninety days period of limitation prescribed for filing of written statement, the defendant no. 1 filed the present application on 16 thMarch, 2017 being I.A. 5923/2017 seeking extension of time by two weeks to file the written statement. It is pertinent to mention that a Coordinate Bench of this Court in OKU Tech Private Limited v. Sangeet Agarwal, CS(OS) 3390/2015 has held that a Court in a commercial suit cannot extend the time for filing the written statement beyond one hundred twenty days after service of summons. \n11. In fact, the written statement was filed on 7 th July, 2017, i.e., more than eight months after the protection under Section 22 of SICA had ceased to apply and ninety eight days after the time of two weeks sought had expired. \n12. This Court is also of the opinion that if the defendant no. 1's submission is accepted, it would mean that a defendant in an ordinary suit who has not filed its written statement for three to four years, would get a right to file the written statement after coming into force of the Act, 2015. \n13. The intention of the Legislature while passing the Act, 2015 was to expedite the hearing and disposal of the commercial suits. If the submission advanced by learned counsel for the defendant no. 1 is accepted it would negate the very intent behind the passing of the Act, 2015. \n14. This Court is also of the view that filing an application seeking extension of time to file a written statement does not stop the clock. \n15. Since in the present case the written statement has been filed eight months after the protection under Section 22 of SICA had lapsed, this Court is of the view that the defendant no. 1's written statement cannot be taken on record. \n16. Consequently, present application for extension of time to file written statement is dismissed and the Registry is directed to return the written statement to defendant no. 1.\" \n17. A close reading of the aforesaid decision reflects that whilst it is true that the Delhi High Court refused to take on record the written statement by exercising any jurisdiction under Section 15 (4) of the Commercial Courts Act, I do not agree that the Delhi High Court has in fact held that a Court cannot, in any given case, exercise such jurisdiction whilst adjudicating upon a transferred suit. I am of the opinion that the Delhi High Court rendered its decision as aforesaid given the facts and circumstances of that particular case. The said decision cannot, in my view, lay down the law to suggest that this Court cannot hold Case Management Hearings in respect of transferred suits or applications in order to prescribe new timelines or issue such further directions as may be necessary including prescribing a new time period within which a written statement can be filed. \n18. In so far as the decisions rendered in M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd.\nvs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. (cited supra) and Axis Bank Limited vs. Mira Gehani & Ors. (cited supra) are concerned, as has been stated above, the said decisions have not considered the question of law being decided herein and therefore, any reliance thereon is misplaced.\n19. In my view, Section 15 (4) and the proviso thereto applies squarely to suits which were filed prior to the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act but have been subsequently 'transferred' as Commercial Suits to be heard by a Commercial Division of this Court. \n20. I therefore hold that the mandatory timeline of 120 days for filing a written statement in a Commercial Suit is not applicable to suits which were filed prior to the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and subsequently 'transferred' as Commercial Suits to be heard by a Commercial Division of this Court. I further hold that a Commercial Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be, may hold Case Management Hearings in respect of such transferred suits under the newly introduced Order XV-A of the CPC to prescribe new timelines or issue further directions including prescribing a new time period within which a written statement shall be filed. The jurisdiction to exercise such discretion is expressly found in Section 15 (4) of the Commercial Courts Act and the proviso thereto. \n21. The question of law is decided as above. \n22. In so far as the present application is concerned, as stated hereinabove, necessary orders will have to be passed on merits by the appropriate bench at the time of hearing the present application. It will be open for the appropriate bench to adjudicate upon whether or not the hearing held on 21st September, 2017 and the order passed on the said date qualified as a 'Case Management Hearing' under Order XV-A of the CPC. \n( S.J.KATHAWALLA, J. )",

while the product under the mark sultica of the appellants/defendants is only available in the form of tablets, the product saltum of the respondent/plaintiff is available not only in the form of tablets but also in the form of injectibles; (b) that the products, under the mark nugermina of the appellants/defendants and under the mark regermina of the respondent/plaintiff, are probiotics; while nugermina of the appellants/defendants is available only in liquid form, regermina of the respondent/plaintiff is available in powder as well as capsule form; both are for treatment of antibiotic induced diarrhea; and, (c) that the product under the mark docomust of the appellants/defendants is available only in liquid form and is for general well-being and development, intended for pediatric use; on the contrary the product under the mark neomust of the respondent/plaintiff is for supporting the treatment of arterial diseases in adults. 7. the counsel for the appellants/defendants has also underlined that all the three products are schedule h drugs, available only against doctors' prescription and which cannot be sold over the counter. 8. the counsel for the appellants/defendants has further argued, (i) that in the pharmaceutical industry, the practice of using the name of the salt i.e. as a prefix or a suffix to the trade mark, is well established and accepted; (ii) that thus there are multiple users using the name or part of the name of the salt or active ingredient of a medicine, as a prefix or a suffix; (iii) that the appellants/defendants, in their reply before the commercial court to the application of the respondent/plaintiff for interim relief, in tabular form, have set out the particulars/comparisons of the marks of the respondent/ plaintiff and the appellants/defendants, to demonstrate that the test of deceptive similarity is not satisfied in any way; attention in this regard is invited to pages 89, 93 and 98 of the file, with respect to the three marks; (iv) that the appellants/defendants, at page 197 onwards of the file, have also filed registrations of trademarks in favour of others, which, on the parameters applied by the commercial court for grant of interim injunction in the impugned order, satisfy the need for grant of injunction against the said trade marks also but against whom the respondent/plaintiff has not taken any action; (v) reliance is placed on paragraphs 3 and 31 to 45 of macleods pharmaceuticals ltd. vs. swisskem healthcare manu/mh/1771/2019; (vi) reliance is also placed on paragraphs 17 to 23 of astrazeneca uk limited supra and on paragraphs 19 to 22 of sun pharmaceutical industries pvt. ltd. supra; (vii) that the commercial court has misapplied the test required to be applied and though the aforesaid judgments were cited, but the same have been disregarded; (viii) that on the contrary the commercial court has relied on m.k. petro products india pvt. ltd. vs. m.k. bitumen products 2011 (182) dlt 86, the defendant wherein was an ex-employee of the plaintiff therein and, while setting up his own business, had copied even the business name of the plaintiff and for which reason was found to be passing off his goods as that of the plaintiff and in which circumstances the injunction was granted and which was/is not the case here; (ix) that the suffix 'germina' in regermina of the respondent/plaintiff and nugermina of the appellants/defendants, though not based on any salt or active ingredient, is an abbreviation for 'germination', in the context of a probiotic and is thus also common to the genre of product and is used by other manufacturers/sellers of probiotics also; (x) that there can be no possibility whatsoever of the doctors, on whose prescription alone the aforesaid products are to be sold, being confused between either of the three sets of trade marks; (xi) that because of the difference in packaging of the products and the differences in form and strength in which the products of the appellants/defendants and the respondent/plaintiff are available, also, there is no possibility whatsoever of any confusion; and, (xii) that the name saltum as well as sultica have been derived by the respondent/plaintiff and the appellants/defendants from sultamicillin tosylate, being the active ingredient of the said product. 9. we have enquired from the counsel for the appellants/defendants, how can the differences in (a) packaging, (b) form i.e. whether tablet or liquid or injectible and (c) strength i.e. whether of 250 mg or 400 mg or 1000 mg, be relevant for arriving at a prima facie view qua similarity/deceptive similarity in trade mark of pharmaceutical products. the said parameters may be relevant qua trade marks for daily/regular use goods like soaps, detergents, shampoo etc. but not for medicines, the second use whereof may be far apart from the first and which may not even be administered by the same person and even if consumed by the patient himself, are consumed while ailing, hardly paying attention to packaging etc. thereof and not expecting to consume it again. 10. before proceeding to record the arguments of the senior counsel for the respondent/plaintiff, it is deemed appropriate to record the reasons which prevailed with the commercial court, for prima facie finding similarity/deceptive similarity and possibility of confusion, in the marks aforesaid of the appellants/defendants with the registered trade marks of the respondent/plaintiff, leading to grant of interim injunction. the commercial court has reasoned, (a) that the names of the medicines of the appellants/defendants were phonetically similar to those of the respondent/plaintiff and were likely to create confusion in the mind of the buyer; (b) that even if the drug is a schedule h drug and can be sold only on prescription, yet the fact of the matter is that even such drugs are sold over the counter; (c) that considering the fact that the appellant/defendant no.2 pawan kumar singh is an ex-employee of the respondent/plaintiff, the burden on the respondent/plaintiff to show likelihood of confusion in the mind of consumer is less; the appellant/defendant no.2 had entered into the same business as of the respondent/plaintiff, with whom he was employed and applied for registration of the impugned marks, even prior to leaving the employment of the respondent/plaintiff; such conduct of the appellant/defendant no.2 showed a dishonest intention; (d) that m.k. petro products india pvt. ltd. supra cited by the respondent/plaintiff squarely applied to the facts of the present case; (e) that the burden was heavy on the appellants/defendants, of which the appellant/defendant no.2 was an exemployee of the respondent/plaintiff, to show that the creation of the impugned trade marks by the appellants/defendants was bona fide vis-à-vis the prior registered trade marks of the respondent/plaintiff; (f) that the principles of law laid down in himalaya drug company vs. s.b.l. limited 2012 (194) dlt 536 and in cadila health care ltd. vs. cadila pharmaceuticals ltd. (2001) 5 scc 73 are applicable to the facts of the case; (g) that the contention of the appellants/defendants, as an ex-employee, that the word 'germina' was publici juris was unacceptable, as the appellant/defendant no.2, being familiar with the dealers and the distribution network of the respondent/plaintiff, by adopting the same/similar mark as the respondent/plaintiff, was attempting to confuse the dealers and distribution network inasmuch as the products were for the same ailments; (h) that astrazeneca uk limited supra and sun pharmaceutical industries pvt. ltd. supra cited by the counsel for the appellants/defendants were not applicable; (i) that though the respondent/plaintiff had also sued to restrain the appellants/defendants from using the mark rythmix, disclosed on the website of the appellants/defendants, on the ground of the respondent/plaintiff being the prior registered user of the same mark but the appellants/defendants had stated that they had not launched the website which disclosed the said mark and that the said website was only a prototype and was never used and that the appellants/defendants had no product under the name rythmix; (j) that the contention of the appellants/defendants, that their trade mark docomust was also registered, was of no avail in view of s. syed mohideen vs. p. sulochana bai (2016) 2 scc 683 and in view of the admitted position of the registration of neomust in favour of the respondent/plaintiff being prior in point of time; and, (k) that the respondent/plaintiff had succeeded in proving that it had a prima facie case and balance of convenience in its favour and would suffer irreparable loss unless the appellants/defendants were restrained. 11. the senior counsel for the respondent/plaintiff has at the outset contended that this court, exercising appellate jurisdiction, would not interfere with the interim order of the court of original jurisdiction, if the view taken by the suit court, is a plausible view and merely substituting its own opinion. reference is made to wander ltd. vs. antox india p. ltd. 1990 supp scc 727. 12. on enquiry, whether what was laid down in wander ltd. supra applied only to intra-court appeals or also to inter-court appeals, it is argued that it matters not whether the appeal is intra-court or inter-court and the principle laid down therein would apply. 13. the senior counsel for the respondent/plaintiff further argued, that it is not even the contention of the counsel for the appellants/defendants that the impugned order is perverse and in the absence whereof, the same does not call for any interference in the interim order granted by the commercial court. reliance, besides on cadila health care ltd. supra and himalaya drug company supra is placed on paragraph 17 of heinz italia vs. dabur india ltd. (2007) 6 scc 1. it is argued, that in relation to pharmaceutical products, difference in packaging and the fact that the products are schedule h drugs, is irrelevant. with reference to the differentiation pleaded by the appellants/defendants in tabular form in their reply before the commercial court to the application for interim relief, it is argued that the appellants/defendants, to differentiate the two marks, have dissected the marks and which is not permissible; the test is of overall similarity of the marks. it is similarly contended that the differences in price are also not relevant as the purchase of medicines is far apart in time and there is remote likelihood of the consumer/patient remembering the price at which the drug was purchased long back. with reference to the products under the name neomust and docomust, it is contended that since the two are meant for different ailments, the consequences of one being confused for the other can be grave and which factor has been kept in mind by the commercial court while granting the interim injunction. 14. the senior counsel for the respondent/plaintiff has also argued that the counsel for the appellants/defendants, in his arguments, while referring to m.k. petro products india pvt. ltd. supra, has conveyed an impression as if the facts of the present case are different and there is no employeremployee relationship. it is contended that in the present case also the appellant/defendant no.2 namely pawan kumar singh was a deputy general manager (marketing) of the respondent/plaintiff and has set up the business in the name and style of appellant/defendant no.1 with the appellant/defendant no.3 and applied for registrations of the impugned marks, while still in employment of the respondent/plaintiff. attention is drawn to the report of the commission issued by the commercial court to the warehouse of the appellant/defendant no.1 and in which the court commissioner appointed, has reported as under: \"7. further the undersigned, took the photographs etc. of the premises and the goods and the accounts etc. the packing material of morepen was also found (the card board boxes inside which the impugned goods were packed were found to be having taped with morepen tapes) it appears the same was done to give an impression that the goods inside are of morepen. the photographs (305 in number) and one dvd are annexed and kept in a separate envelop as annexure-lc6.\" 15. the senior counsel for the respondent/plaintiff has contended, that the counsel for the appellants/defendants, in his arguments, has concealed the aforesaid report and which shows a mala fide intent of the appellants/defendants to pass off their goods as those of the respondent/plaintiff. in this context it is also informed that the appellants/defendants, in the prototype of their website, copied the contents of the website of the respondent/plaintiff, as evident from the prototype of the appellants/defendants website also referring to rythmix, another trade mark and product of the respondent/plaintiff, and qua which the appellants/defendants made a statement that they did not intend to use the said trade mark rythmix and had no such product. it is argued that the adoption by the appellants/defendants of the impugned trade marks has to be considered in the aforesaid light. the senior counsel for the respondent/plaintiff also states that though the annexures to the report of the court commissioner were filed by the court commissioner before the court in a sealed cover and were earlier not available but the said sealed cover has since been opened and copies of the annexures have been made available and the respondent/plaintiff has today emailed the copies thereof. 16. we must record, that having commenced hearing the appeal without having gone through the records thereof, the argument of the counsel for the appellants/defendants that the commercial court wrongly relied on m.k. petro products india pvt. ltd. supra which was a case of an ex-employee, was indeed understood by us as, that the law expounded therein of similarity/deceptive similarity in trade mark when the defendant is an exemployee of the plaintiff, has no application to the present case inasmuch as there is no such relationship in the present case. however, it turns out to be otherwise. all that we would observe is, that the counsel should have underlined that there is such a relationship in the present case also. the explanation as is now given, that the defendant in that case had copied the business name of the plaintiff also, ought to have been given while making the said argument. 17. being of the opinion that the report of the court commissioner has a material bearing to the matter in controversy, we have enquired from the counsel for the appellants/defendants, whether the appellants/defendants, before the commercial court, have preferred any objection to the said report of the court commissioner and/or whether the appellants/defendants, in the memorandum of this appeal, have raised any objection with respect thereto or made any pleas with respect thereto. 18. the counsel for the appellants/defendants states that since the annexures to the report of the court commissioner had not been made available till recently, objections to the report could not be filed but will now be filed. he further states that no mention was made of the report of the court commissioner in the impugned judgment and the appellants/defendants thus were not required to make any plea/ground with respect thereto in the memorandum of appeal. 19. we are unable to agree. the factual finding, reproduced above, in the report dated 28th october, 2020 of the court commissioner, has serious consequences. the appellants/defendants, even if had not received the copies of the annexures, if felt that what was reported was wrong, ought to have immediately filed their objections, reserving the right to make further objections on receiving copies of the annexures. it cannot be lost sight of that what was reported, related to the premises of the appellants/defendants and of which the appellants/defendants were aware and the appellants/defendants did not have to wait for the photographs to object, if had any objection thereto. 20. the counsel for the appellants/defendants now states that the premises where the warehouse of the appellants/defendants is situated, also belong to an ex-employee of the respondent/plaintiff and the packaging material and the tapes of the respondent/plaintiff reported by the court commissioner to have been found, had been brought to the premises when the owner thereof was in the employment of the respondent/plaintiff. it is further stated that the cartons on which the tape of the respondent/plaintiff is reported, are in fact empty and do not contain the products of the appellants/defendants. 21. even if the aforesaid explanation of the appellants/defendants is true, we are unable to understand why could not be made immediately after the court commissioner had submitted his report and why did the appellants/defendants have to wait for receiving the copies of the annexures to the report. such conduct of the appellants/defendants lends us to at least at this stage treat the explanation aforesaid as an afterthought and to read the report of the court commissioner at its face value and as uncontroverted by the appellants/defendants. 22. we are also unable to accept the contention of the counsel for the appellants/defendants, that because the impugned judgment does not refer to the said report, the appellants/defendants in the memorandum of appeal were not required to deal therewith. to say the least, the said argument has no basis in law. even if the court, in its judgment/order, while deciding in favour of the plaintiff, does not place reliance on any material on record though in favour of the plaintiff, it is always open to the plaintiff to, while opposing any appeal from the order/judgment of the court, rely on the said material for supporting the judgment. the plaintiff could not have preferred an appeal from the judgment otherwise in its favour, for making a grievance that other material in his favour was not cited for returning a finding in his favour. we may also mention, that though a judge may form an opinion in favour of a plaintiff on the basis of the entirety of the material on record but a particular part of the said material may accidently be omitted from being referred to in the order/judgment, though having weighed with the judge in forming the opinion. it was thus very much incumbent in law on the appellants/defendant to, in the memorandum of appeal make pleadings with respect to the all the material on record of the suit which can be relied upon by the respondent/plaintiff for supporting the judgment and the appellants/defendants having not done so, have to be presumed to be not objecting to what has been reported by the court commissioner and consequences therefrom have to flow. 23. the consequence of what has been reported by the court commissioner is, that prima facie the appellants/defendants are found to be passing off their goods as that of the respondent/plaintiff. 24. though we are of the view that the appeal is liable to be dismissed for the aforesaid reasons alone but even otherwise are of the view that the prima facie finding of the commercial court, of similarity/deceptive similarity in the trade marks of the appellants/defendants with that of the respondent/plaintiff, cannot be said to be arbitrary, capricious or perverse, which no reasonable person could have arrived at, or having been arrived at, in ignorance of settled principles of law governing grant or refusal of interlocutory injunction. before wander ltd. supra also, in printers (mysore) private ltd. vs. pothan joseph air 1960 sc 1156, it was held that where the discretion vested in the court has been exercised by the trial court, the appellate court will be slow to interfere with the exercise of said discretion and more so, solely on the ground that if had considered the matter at trial stage, it would have come to a contrary conclusion. it was further held that if the discretion has been exercised reasonably and in a judicial manner, the mere fact that the appellate court would have taken a different view, would not justify interference with the trial court's exercise of discretion; only if the trial court, in exercising its discretion has acted unreasonably or capriciously or has ignored relevant facts and has adopted an unjudicial approach, it would be open to the appellate court to interfere in the trial court's exercise of discretion. reiterating the said principle, in wander ltd. supra it was held, that an appeal against exercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. the same view was reiterated in n.r. dongre vs. whirlpool corporation (1996) 5 scc 714, ramdev food products (p) ltd. vs. arvindbhai rambhai patel (2006) 8 scc 726, skyline education institute (india) private limited vs. s.l. vaswani (2010) 2 scc 142, purshottam vishandas raheja vs. srichand vishandas raheja (2011) 6 scc 73, mohd. mehtab khan vs. khushnuma ibrahim khan (2013) 9 scc 221, neon laboratories limited vs. medical technologies limited (2016) 2 scc 672, cadila health care ltd. and heinz italia supra. 25. as far as the judgments relied upon by the counsel for the appellants/defendants are concerned, in astrazeneca uk limited supra, the trademark of the defendant namely meromer was alleged to be deceptively similar to the mark meronem of the plaintiff therein. the division bench of this court held that when taken as whole, the marks were not phonetically or visually or in any manner deceptively similar to each other, though the prefix 'mero' was common to both the marks; it was however held that the said prefix was derived from the molecule 'meropenem' in both the products. it was held that in the trade of drugs, it is a common practice to name the drug by the name of the organ or ailment which it treats or the main ingredient of the drug and such an organ or ailment or ingredient being publici juris or generic cannot be owned by anyone exclusively for use as a trade mark. similarly, in macleods pharmaceuticals ltd. supra of the single judge of the bombay high court, the plaintiff, registered owner of the trade marks panderm and panderm +, sought to restrain the defendant from using the trade mark polyderm +. it was held that both the plaintiff and defendant derived their respective trade marks from the stream of science to which the products belonged, i.e. dermatology. the descriptive suffix 'derm', which was indicative of a dermatological product, was the only similarity between the trade marks, and the plaintiff could not be permitted to monopolize the suffix 'derm' in respect of pharmaceutical preparations. 26. in the present case, on an analysis of the marks of the appellants/defendants and respondent/plaintiff, from the table given by the appellants/defendants in the reply to the application for interim relief filed before the commercial court aforesaid, it appears that the aforesaid reasoning can be applied only to one of the subject trademarks, being the trademark saltum of the respondent/plaintiff and the trademark sultica of the appellants/defendants, both of which are derived from the active ingredient 'sultamicillin tosylate'. on the contrary, the other two impugned trademarks, being nugermina of the appellants/defendants, alleged to be deceptively similar to the trademark regermina of the respondent/plaintiff, as well as the trademark docomust of the appellants/defendants, alleged to be deceptively similar to the trademark neomust of the respondent/plaintiff, both do not satisfy the aforesaid test. the former contains the common suffix 'germina' stated to be derived from the word 'germinate' to relate to the function of probiotics, while the latter contains the common suffix 'must', the english word to signify 'it is necessary'. it is contended by the appellants/defendants that both words being generic are publici juris and cannot be owned by the respondent/plaintiff exclusively for use as a trade mark, but we are not persuaded by the said reasoning as the words are neither derived from the chemical composition of the drugs, nor from any specific organ or ailment targeted by the pharmaceutical product, and hence adaption of those words, is completely arbitrary, and coupled with the fact that the appellant/defendant no.2 was an ex-employee of the respondent/plaintiff, can only lead to the conclusion that the same were adopted dishonestly, in order to create confusion on the minds of the consumers of the said products. we find, in a number of cases before this court pertaining to pharmaceutical products, where the trademarks are not derived from the chemical composition, or the disease they cure, or the organ with which they are related, and are otherwise derived from any other generic word, that this court has found the trademarks to be deceptively similar to the trademarks of the plaintiffs in those cases. reference in this regard may be made to remidex pharma private limited vs. savita pharmaceuticals p. ltd. (2006) 131 dlt 350 (where 'evit' was found to be deceptively similar to 'zevit'), united biotech pvt. ltd. vs. orchid chemicals & pharmaceuticals ltd. 2012 scc online del 2942 (db) (where 'forzid' was found to be deceptively similar to 'orzid'), merck kgaa vs. emil pharmaceutical inds. pvt. ltd. 2014 scc online del 6733 (where 'cozole' was held to be deceptively similar to 'cosome'), merck kgaa vs. hasmukh n. thakkar 2014 scc online del 1938 (where 'eceflam+' was found to be deceptively similar to 'emflam' and 'exflam'), mankind pharma ltd. vs. cadila pharmaceuticals ltd. 2015 scc online del 6914 (where 'mecokind plus' was held to be deceptively similar to 'metrokind') and sun pharma laboratories ltd. vs. intas pharamceuticals limited 2019 scc online del 8899 [fao(os)(comm) no. 170/2019 preferred whereagainst disposed of on 7th august, 2019] (where 'decitas' was held to be deceptively similar to 'decitex'). even the same single judge of the bombay high court as in macleods pharmaceuticals ltd. supra, in other such matters, has justified the grant of interim injunction in favour of the plaintiffs therein. reference, illustratively, in this regard can be made to charak pharma pvt. ltd. vs. glenmark pharmaceuticals ltd. 2014 scc online bom 98 (where 'econova' was found to be deceptively similarly to 'evanova') and lupin limited vs. eris lifesciences pvt. ltd. 2015 scc online bom 6807 (where 'nebistol' was held to be deceptively similar to 'nebistar'). 27. as far as sun pharmaceutical industries pvt. ltd. supra cited by the counsel for the appellants/defendants is concerned, we find that the same went on in appeal to the supreme court vide special leave to appeal (civil) no.33164/2014, which was disposed of as settled on 5th july, 2016 and in terms of order dated 4th april, 2016 therein, it appears that the terms of the settlement included change of name of the impugned trademark therein. in light thereof, we are reluctant to follow sun pharmaceutical industries pvt. ltd. supra. 28. it is also significant that none of the cases cited by the counsel for the appellants/defendants concern a factual matrix wherein the defendant in the suit for infringement of trademark is a former employee of the plaintiff. merit is found in the contention of the counsel for the respondent/plaintiff, affirmed by the commercial court, that the appellant/defendant no.2 being the ex-employee of the respondent/plaintiff, the burden was heavier on the appellant/defendant no.2 to show creation of the trade mark was bona fide, even without considering the damning report of the local commissioner aforesaid. in the british india corporation ltd. vs. khairati ram air 2000 del 289, adoption by an ex-employee, of the mark 'dwmdhariwal' as against the mark 'dhariwal' of the ex-employer, combined with use of the same script, was held to be dishonest and it was held that discretion under section 12(3) of the trade marks act can be exercised only where the parties are unknown to each other, innocently adopt and use similar mark. in midas hygiene industries (p) ltd. vs. sudhir bhatia (2004) 3 scc 90 also, taking note of the fact that the defendants used to work with the plaintiff, the order of the trial court of grant of interim injunction was restored and the order of the appellate court, vacating the injunction, set aside. in m.k. petro products india pvt. ltd. supra it was held that the chances of confusion and deception are enhanced when the defendant is an ex-employee of the plaintiff and was aware of customers, dealers and distributors of the plaintiff and particularly when the defendant gives no justification for adopting a similar mark. the appellants/defendants, if had bona fide intention, while naming their product with the active ingredient sultamicillin tosylate, could have used any part thereof other than \"sult\" and adoption of sultica, when were till shortly prior thereto were marketing saltum of the respondent/plaintiff, prima facie displaces mala fide and dishonesty. mention may also be made of shree sainath industries vs. sainath auto industries 2004 scc online guj 25, sirmour remedies pvt. ltd. vs. kepler healthcare pvt. ltd. 2014 scc online cal 2703, sanofi india ltd. vs. universal neutraceuticals pvt. ltd. 215 (2014) dlt 585 and cadila healthcare ltd. vs. uniza healthcare llp manu/de/0346/2021, in all of which weightage was given to the fact that the defendant was an exemployee of the plaintiff, in granting interim injunction. we may mention that even in heinz italia supra it was held that the principle of similarity cannot be very rigidly applied and if it can be prima facie shown that there was dishonest intention, injunction normally follows. it was further held that similarities, rather than dissimilarities, have to be considered. the appellants/defendants in the present case, if had no dishonest intention, while commencing the same business as of the respondent/plaintiff with which they were earlier employed, ought not to have kept marks similar/deceptively similar to that of the respondent/plaintiff. 29. no merit is found also in the contention of the counsel for the appellants/defendants that the respondent/plaintiff is not entitled to injunction for the reason of others using similar marks. the respondent/plaintiff, as a registered proprietor of the trademark is not expected to run after every infringer and to instead of carrying on business in pharmaceuticals, carry on business in litigations; litigations are to be instituted only against those, use by whom of a similar/deceptively similar mark affects the respondent/plaintiff. reference may be made to national bello vs. metal goods mfg. co. p. ltd. (1970) 3 scc 665, dr. reddy's laboratories ltd. vs. reddy pharmaceuticals ltd. 2004 (76) drj 616, pankaj goel vs. dabur india ltd. 2008 (38) ptc 49 (del) (db), novartis ag vs. crest pharma pvt. ltd. 2009 (41) ptc 57 (del), cadila healthcare ltd. vs. aureate healthcare pvt. ltd. 2012 scc online del 3940 and nuvoco vistas corporation ltd. vs. j.k. laxmi cement ltd. 2019 scc online del 8057. 30. no other argument has been urged by the counsel for the appellants/defendants. 31. no merit is found in the appeal. 32. dismissed. appellants/defendants to pay costs of this appeal of rs.50,000/to the respondent/plaintiff. rajiv sahai endlaw, j. amit bansal, j. april 9, 2021 'bs' (corrected & released on 21st april, 2021)"
