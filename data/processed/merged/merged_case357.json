As per the agreement, the matter was referred to the sole arbitrator. The sole arbitrator passed the award. The petitioner filed the petition for execution of the said award which was numbered as Execution Case No. 29 of 2019 in the Commercial Court, Dhanbad. \n4. Referring to Section 3 (1-A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as amended by the amendment Act of 28 of 2018, which became retrospectively effective from 03.05.2018 which reads as under:-\n\"3. [(1-A) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the State Government may, after consultation with the concerned High Court, by notification, specify such pecuniary value which shall not be less than three lakh rupees or such higher value, for whole or part of the State, as it may consider necessary.]\"(Emphasis Supplied) The learned Court below observed that the said Court below is at present having pecuniary jurisdiction of one crore rupees or such higher value as may be notified by the Central Government as there is no notification of the State in compliance of Section 3 (1-A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as amended by the amendment Act of 28 of 2018, and came to a conclusion that the Court below has no jurisdiction to decide the execution petition and dismissed the same for being non-maintainable. \n5. Mr. Kumar, the learned counsel for the petitioner drawing attention of the Court to Section 2(1) (i) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as amended by the said amendment Act of 28 of 2018 which reads as under:-\n'2(1)(i) \"Specified Value\", in relation to a commercial dispute, shall mean the value of the subject-matter in respect of a suit as determined in accordance with section 12 [which shall not be less than three lakh rupees] or such higher value, as may be notified by the Central Government' (Emphasis Supplied) Submitted that therein the words \"which shall not be less than three lakh rupees\", before 03.05.2018, that before being amended by amendment Act of 28 of 2018 used to be \"which shall not be less than one crore rupees.\"\n6. Drawing attention of this Court to annexure-4 of the brief which is the notification regarding establishment of the Commercial Court inter alia at Dhanbad which reads as under:-\nNotification The 24th may, 2016 S.O. 24 - dated 27th may, 2016 In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3(1) of The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Court Act, 2015, the State Government in consultation with the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand, Ranchi, is pleased to establish one Commercial Court each at Ranchi, Dhanbad & East Singhbhum (Jamshedpur) District.

The earlier Notification no.-1220/J dated 24.05.2016 issued by Law Department is hereby amended to that extent. \n(File No. -B/Vidhi-Court Gathan-Ka-02/2016-1476/J) By the order of the Governor of Jharkhand, Dinesh Kumar Singh Principal Secretary-cum-L.R. Law Department Govt. of Jharkhand, Ranchi. \nIt is submitted by Mr. Kumar, the learned counsel for the petitioner that the said Amendment Act, 28 of 2018 has received Presidential assent on 20.08.2018 though inadvertently due to a printing error, in paragraph no.15 of this instant writ application, the said date has wrongly been mentioned as 20.08.2019 and the said Act has been published in Gazette on 21.08.2018 but the same has been applicable with retrospective effect from 03.05.2018.\n7. Mr. Kumar, the learned counsel for the petitioner also drew the attention of this Court to the statement of objects and reasons of the said amendment Act of 28 of 2018 and submits that conjoint reading of section 2(1)(i) and section 3(1-A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as amended by the amendment Act of 28 of 2018, implies that the Central Government is empowered to notify the \"specified value\" as defined under section 2(1)(i) of the Commercial Courts Act and the notification of the said amendment by way of publishing the same in the official Gazette dated 21.08.2018, in effect has fixed the \"specified value\" for all purposes as not less than rupees three lakhs or in other words an amount of three lakhs rupees or more. It is then submitted that unless and until the State Government after consultation with the High Court, by notification, specify such pecuniary value not less than rupees three lakhs or any higher value for whole or part of the State, the \"Specified Value\" for the Commercial Court established at Dhanbad by the said notification will be not less than rupees three lakhs or in other words an amount of three lakhs rupees or more. It is further submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that section 3(1-A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as amended by the amendment Act of 28 of 2018, confers a discretion with the state government that it may after consultation with the concerned High Court, by notification, specify such \" Specified Value\" which shall not be less than three lakh rupees or such higher value, for whole or part of the State, as it may consider necessary which means that the state government may not specify any \"Specified value\" other than \"not less than three lakh rupees\"\nas fixed by section 2(1)(i) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as amended by the amendment Act of 28 of 2018 and as yet no notification has been published by the State Government by specifying any pecuniary value other than the one of amount not less than rupees three lakhs as mentioned in Section 2(1)(i) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as amended by the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts (Amendment) Act, 2018 (28 of 2018). Hence, it is submitted that in view of the said amended Section 2(1)(i) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as amended by the Act 28 of 2018, for the Commercial Court at Dhanbad, the \"specified value\" to be determined in accordance with Section 12 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 is \"not less than three lakhs rupees\", hence the said execution petition filed is maintainable in the Commercial Court at Dhanbad. \n8. In support of his contention, Mr. Bharat Kumar, the learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the Judgment of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court, in the case of Vijay Cotton And Fiber Company vs. Agarwal Cotton Spinning Pvt. Ltd. dated 11.02.2019, paragraph no.16 of which reads as under:-\n\"16. The sum and substance of the above discussion is that in State of Gujarat where the commercial Courts are constituted at District level, the execution petition would be maintainable in that Court; as contemplated in the notification referred herein above irrespective of its Judge being lower in hierarchy than the District Judge. Since the commercial Court lower in hierarchy that the district level is not contemplated under subsection (1) of Section 3, there would be no question of institution of the execution petition with the District Judge and transfer by him under Section 39 of Cpc to the Court lower in hierarchy than the such District Judge. The Principal Civil Court in the District Court as defined in Section 2 (1) (e) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act read with Section 3 of the Commercial Courts Act, in respect of the commercial disputes, would be the Commercial Court at the district level as constituted under subsection (1) of Section 3 of the later Act and would be the Court competent to execute awards declared under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act other than those relating to international arbitration. By virtue of the notification above referred, as also by C/Ao/216/2018 Order virtue of the provisions referred to herein above, the Court contemplated in the notification, irrespective of the designation of the Judge would be the commercial Court at district level; and in abs ence of contemplation of Commercial Court of the lower hierarchy than the District level, in the Commercial Court Act, it would execute the decree without transferring it under Section 39 CPC.\" \n9. Mr. Bharat Kumar also relied upon the Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Radhey Shyam & Anr. vs. Chhabi Nath & Ors. reported in (2015) 5 SCC 423, in support of its contention that challenges to judicial order can lie by way of a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \n10. Hence, it is submitted by Mr. Kumar that the said impugned order dated 27.04.2019 passed by the District Judge-XIV- cum-Presiding Officer, Commercial Court, Dhanbad in Execution Case No. 29 of 2019 be quashed and set aside and the Commercial Court at Dhanbad be directed to proceed ahead with the said Execution Case no. 29 of 2019 as per law. \n11. Learned counsel for the opposite parties- respondents, Mr. Mitul Kumar, submits that there is no infirmity or illegality in the impugned order, hence, the impugned order does not attract indulgence of this Court. It is further submitted by Mr. Mitul Kumar, that conduct of the petitioner is not fair and the vehicle has forcibly been repossessed by the goons of the petitioner company in Bihar and after repossession, the petitioner company is still running the said vehicle standing in the name of respondent no. 1, hence it is submitted that there is no merit in this Writ Petition nor there is any merit in the execution petition which has rightly been dismissed by the learned court below. It is then submitted that this Writ Petition being without any merit, be dismissed. \n12. Having heard the submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner and after going through the materials in the record, this Court finds force in the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner; as it is crystal clear that after amendment of Section 2(1)(i) of the Commercial Courts Act by the amendment Act 28 of 2018, the \"Specified value\" of the commercial Courts established under section 3(1) of The commercial Courts Act, 2015 to be determined in accordance with Section 12 of the said Act is \"not less than three lakhs rupees\"; which in other words means an amount of rupees three lakhs or more with effect from 03.05.2018. As rightly submitted by Mr. Kumar, in the absence of any notification under section 3 (1-A) of the said Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as amended by the said Act 28 of 2018, the commercial Court at Dhanbad having been established under section 3(1) of the Commercial Courts Act by the notification dated 24th May, 2016 will have its revised \"Specified Value\" of \"not less than three lakhs rupees\" w.r.e.f. 03.05.2018 instead of \"not less than rupees one crore\" as it stood fixed prior to 03.05.2018.\n13. So far as the submission of Mr. Mitul Kumar, learned counsel for the opposite parties- respondents regarding merits of the case of the Execution petition is concerned, learned Commercial Court, Dhanbad has not applied its mind towards the merit of the case, hence, at this stage, this Court expresses no opinion regarding merits of the Execution Petition and the respondents are free to raise all their contentions made in the counter affidavit filed in this case; before Commercial Court, Dhanbad at the appropriate stage.\n14. In view of the position of law as discussed above, this Court is of the considered view that the impugned order dated 27.04.2019 passed by the Presiding Officer, Commercial Court, Dhanbad in Execution Case No. 29 of 2019 by dismissing the said execution petition on the ground that the Commercial Court, Dhanbad has no pecuniary jurisdiction is not sustainable in law and is liable to be set aside. \n15. Accordingly the impugned order dated 27.04.2019 passed by the District Judge-XIV-cum-Presiding Officer, Commercial Court, Dhanbad in Execution Case No. 29 of 2019 is quashed and set aside and this writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the commercial Court at Dhanbad to proceed with Execution Case No. 29 of 2019 in accordance with law, from the stage where it was, on the date said impugned order dismissing the said Execution Case No. 29 of 2019, was passed. \n16. It is made clear that this Court has not expressed any opinion regarding contention raised by the respondents in their counter-affidavit in this case and the Commercial Court, Dhanbad is free to make its own independent order in respect of the said grounds, without being prejudiced by this order of this Court, if and when, the said issues are agitated before it.\n(Anil Kumar Choudhary, J.)

this question essentially falls for consideration in the instant case. 2. the first petitioner is a company. the second petitioner is the chief executive officer and the third petitioner is one of the directors of the first petitioner company. the first respondent is a partnership firm. the second respondent is the managing partner of the first respondent firm. 3. the first and the second respondents filed an application under section 9 of the arbitration act in the district court, ernakulam against the petitioners. this application (ext.p8) was transferred to the commercial court, ernakulam (the principal sub court, ernakulam) and numbered as cma (arb) no.8/2020. 4. the reliefs prayed for in ext.p8 application are the following: \"a. issue a decree of interim injunction restraining the respondent no.1 and the respondents no.2 to 10 or their men, officers and agents, from appointing any persons and/or business establishments as the exclusive global marketer and distributor or marketer or distributor for the distribution, marketing or sales of the products as defined in the agreement dated 26.06.2017; b. issue a decree of interim injunction restraining the respondents no.1 to 10 or their men, officers and agents, from transferring to any person or entity, the product know-how or confidential information of the 'products' as defined in the agreement dated 26.06.2017; c. pass such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient.\" 5. as per ext.p9 judgment dated 14.09.2020, the commercial court, ernakulam allowed ext.p8 application. the operative portion of ext.p9 judgment reads as follows: \"in the result, the civil miscellaneous application is allowed. the respondents are hereby restrained from appointing any persons and/or business establishments as the exclusive global marketer or distributor for the distribution, marketing or sale of the products of the 1 st respondent company and from transferring to any 3rd parties the product know-how or confidential information of the products till arbitration proceedings are commenced in the case. the parties shall bear their respective costs.\" 6. this original petition is filed under article 227 of the constitution of india challenging the legality and propriety of ext.p9 judgment. 7. heard learned counsel for the petitioners and also the first and the second respondents. 8. learned counsel for the respondents raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of this original petition filed under article 227 of the constitution of india. he invited the attention of this court to section 13(1) of the commercial courts act which provides for appeal against the orders passed by a commercial court below the level of a district judge. learned counsel contended that, in view of the alternative and efficacious remedy available to the petitioners as provided under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, the original petition filed by them under article 227 of the constitution of india is not maintainable. 9. learned counsel for the petitioners contended that an appeal under section 13(1) of commercial courts act is maintainable only against a decree or final judgment passed by a commercial court. he would also contend that, an alternative and efficacious statutory remedy available to a person against an order passed by a subordinate court, is not an absolute bar to entertain an application under article 227 of the constitution of india. 10. the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015 came into force on 23.10.2015, in terms of the deeming provision under section 1(3) thereof. the provisions of this statute were amended and the name of this act was changed as 'the commercial courts act' by virtue of act 28 of 2018 which came into force on 03.05.2018. 11. section 13 of the act of 2015, as it stood originally, read as follows: \"13. appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions.--(1) any person aggrieved by the decision of the commercial court or commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order, as the case may be: provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996). (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\" 12. as per section 12 of the amendment act of 2018, section 13 of the act of 2015 was substituted as follows: \"13. appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions.(1) any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court below the level of a district judge may appeal to the commercial appellate court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order. (1a) any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court at the level of district judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order: provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996). (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\" 13. on a plain reading of the provision in the amended section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, it is evident that the judgment or order of a commercial court below the level of a district judge is appealable. the provision is plain and clear. the right of appeal under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act is not restricted to the parties to the litigation. any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court below the level of a district judge may appeal to the commercial appellate court. 14. learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the heading of section 13 of the commercial courts act states \"appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions\" and therefore, an appeal under section 13(1) of the act would lie only from a decree or a final judgment passed by a commercial court and no appeal will lie from an order, especially an interlocutory or interim order, passed by a commercial court. 15. there is no merit in the above contention. if the above contention of the learned counsel is accepted, the word \"order\" in section 13(1) of the commercial courts act would be a surplasage and that word would become otiose or redundant. 16. the first and the primary rule of construction of a statutory provision is that the intention of the legislation must be found in the words used by the legislature itself. it is well settled that the heading given to a section cannot control the plain words of the provision. the heading of a provision cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing the provision when the words and the language used in the provision are clear and unambiguous. seeking assistance from the heading of a provision to interpret the provision can be resorted to only in case of ambiguity or doubt, that too, as an aid in construing the provision. the marginal heading cannot control the interpretation of the words of the section particularly when the language of the section is clear and unambiguous. 17. there is no justification for restricting the section by the marginal note nor does the marginal note control the meaning of the body of the section if the language employed therein is clear and spells out its own meaning (see karnataka rare earth v. senior geologist : air 2004 sc 2915). heading or title of a section has only a limited role to play in the construction of statutes. they may be taken as very broad and general indicators of the nature of the subject-matter dealt with thereunder. the heading or title may also be taken as a condensed name assigned to indicate collectively the characteristics of the subjectmatter dealt with by the enactment. in case of conflict between the plain language of the provision and the meaning of the heading or title, the heading or title would not control the meaning which is clearly and plainly discernible from the language of the provision thereunder (see raichurmatham prabhakar v. rawatmal dugar: air 2004 sc 3625). if the language of the relevant section gives a simple meaning and message, it should be interpreted in such a way and there is no need to give any weightage to headings (see union of india v. national federation of the blind : (2013) 10 scc 772). 18. the title to the provision need not invariably indicate the contents of the provision. if the provision is otherwise clear and unambiguous, the title pales into irrelevance. on the contrary, if the contents of the provision are otherwise ambiguous, an aid can be sought from the title so as to define the provision. in the event of a conflict between the plain expressions in the provision and the indicated title, the title cannot control the contents of the provision. title is only a broad and general indication of the nature of the subject dealt under the provision (see maqbool v. state of u.p : air 2018 sc 5101). 19. section 13(2) of the commercial courts act has restricted the scope of filing appeals by stating that, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the act. this provision also indicates that appeals lie from orders of the commercial courts as provided in section 13(1) of the act. 20. the matter can be considered from another angle. in the instant case, the impugned order is an order of injunction. it is appealable under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908. it is an order passed under section 9 of the arbitration act. it is also appealable under section 37 of the arbitration act. section 37(1)(b) of the arbitration act states that an appeal shall lie from an order granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9 of the said act. right of appeal is the creature of a statute. it is well settled that right of appeal is a substantive right. nothing contained in section 13(1) or section 13(2) of the commercial courts act curtails this right of appeal. 21. at this juncture, it is to be noted that the heading of the unamended section 13 of the commercial courts act also read as \"appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions\". there was a proviso to unamended section 13(1) of the act which now stands as the proviso to section 13(1a) of the act. this proviso restricts the right of appeal from orders that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure and section 37 of the arbitration act. if the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is accepted, the proviso to section 13(1a) of the commercial courts act would be meaningless. 22. the scope of the proviso to the unamended section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, which now stands as the proviso to section 13(1a) of the act, was considered by the supreme court in kandla export corporation v. m/s oci corporation : (2018) 14 scc 715 and it was held as follows: \"section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, with which we are immediately concerned in these appeals, is in two parts. the main provision is, as has been correctly submitted by shri giri, a provision which provides for appeals from judgments, orders and decrees of the commercial division of the high court. to this main provision, an exception is carved out by the proviso. . the proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by the commercial division of the high court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure code, 1908, and section 37 of the arbitration act. it will at once be noticed that orders that are not specifically enumerated under order xliii of the cpc would, therefore, not be appealable, and appeals that are mentioned in section 37 of the arbitration act alone are appeals that can be made to the commercial appellate division of a high court\". 23. moreover, in order to find out whether an appeal against an order passed under section 9 of the arbitration act is maintainable or not, the provisions of the said act have to be looked into. there is no independent right of appeal provided under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. it merely provides the forum of filing appeals. section 37(1) (b) of the arbitration act creates the right to file an appeal against an order granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9 of the said act. it is the parameters of section 37(1) of the arbitration act alone which have to be looked at in order to determine whether an appeal against an order under section 9 of the said act is maintainable or not (see bgs sgs soma jv v. nhpc limited : (2020) 4 scc 234). 24. the question whether the proviso in section 13 of the commercial courts act applies only to section 13(1a) or whether it applies to section 13(1) also, does not arise for consideration in the instant case. the reason is that, the order impugned in this original petition, is an order passed under section 9 of the arbitration act and therefore, appealable under section 37 of the said act, which is specifically mentioned in the proviso. 25. the discussion above leads to the conclusion that an order under section 9 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 passed by a commercial court below the level of a district judge is appealable under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. 26. however, the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents that, the remedy of appeal against an order provided under a statute is an absolute bar in entertaining an application or petition under article 227 of the constitution of india, cannot be accepted. 27. the power vested in the high court to exercise judicial superintendence over the decisions of all courts and tribunals within its respective jurisdiction is part of the basic structure of the constitution, forming its integral and essential feature, which cannot be tampered with much less taken away even by constitutional amendment, not to speak of a parliamentary legislation (see chandra kumar v. union of india : air 1997 sc 1125). 28. the high court in exercise of its jurisdiction of superintendence can interfere in order to keep the tribunals and the courts subordinate to it 'within the bounds of their authority'. the high court can interfere in exercise of its power of superintendence when there has been a patent perversity in the orders of tribunals and courts subordinate to it or where there has been a gross and manifest failure of justice or the basic principles of natural justice have been flouted. the power may be exercised in cases occasioning grave injustice or failure of justice such as when (i) the court or tribunal has assumed a jurisdiction which it does not have, (ii) has failed to exercise a jurisdiction which it does have, such failure occasioning a failure of justice, and (iii) the jurisdiction though available is being exercised in a manner which tantamounts to overstepping the limits of jurisdiction. 29. however, when there is a remedy of appeal before a civil court available to an aggrieved person and such remedy is not availed of by him, it would deter the high court, not merely as a measure of self imposed restriction, but as a matter of discipline and prudence, from exercising its power of superintendence under article 227 of the constitution (see v.h.n.d.p.sabai v. tuticorin educational society : (2019) 9 scc 538). 30. learned counsel for the petitioners contended that, in view of the provision contained in section 8 of the commercial courts act, no appeal would lie against an interlocutory order passed by a commercial court and the petitioners would be able to challenge such an order only in an appeal filed against the decree or a final judgment. 31. the above contention is misconceived. section 8 of the commercial courts act states that, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the commercial court. what is barred under section 8 of the commercial courts act is civil revision application or petition against an interlocutory order passed by a commercial court. an appeal against an order passed by a commercial court is not barred under section 8 of the said act. it is specifically provided under section 8 of the commercial courts act that the said provision is subject to the remedy of appeal provided under section 13 of the act. 32. in the instant case, the petitioners have not shown any reason for not availing the remedy of appeal against the order impugned in this original petition. in such circumstances, this court is not inclined to interfere with the impugned order by invoking the power under article 227 of the constitution of india. 33. consequently, the original petition is dismissed. it is made clear that this court has not considered the merits of the order impugned in this original petition. the dismissal of this original petition will not preclude the petitioners from availing the remedy of appeal provided under law. if the period prescribed by the statute for filing the appeal is over, the petitioners may bring to the notice of the appellate court concerned the fact that the original petition filed by them was pending before this court for the period from 29.09.2020 till this date and seek from that court appropriate relief, if any, available under law.
