(F) Be pleased to pass any other and further order as may be deemed just, fit and proper.\" \n2. The brief facts leading to the filing of the present petition reads thus:\n2.1 The petitioner firm was awarded the work of construction of Railway Over Bridge at Gotegaon Bypass Road in Narsinghpur, District - Narsinghpur by the Government of Madhya Pradesh through the Executive NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined Engineer, PWD Bridge Construction Division, Jabalpur, which was valued at Rs.893.05 lakh. The said work was awarded on 4.1.2016, which was to be completed within the stipulated period of 18 months and therefore the work was required to be completed on or before 3.7.2017 The time was extended and presently the work is in progress. \nThe respondent herein belongs to Patan District and had acquaintance with the Petitioner as the respondent is also doing business of construction. It is stated that the respondent herein wanted to join the petitioner in the midst of the said work and therefore, approached the Petitioner at Mehsana and entered into a sub-let agreement dated 10.3.2018.\n2.2 It is stated that there is no jurisdiction clause in the agreement between the parties. It is further stated that the work in question was too big for the respondent and the respondent was not able to manage for funds, etc. and as such he was not able to execute the work as per the time schedule and therefore the respondent requested the petitioner to execute by ratio of 50% each, NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined inter alia, each party was to invest 50%and the profit earned out of the project after deduction qua purchases, expenses and administrative charges and taxes, the net profit was to be shared 50% of each party. 2.3 It is stated that the respondent abandoned the work half-way and in fact committed breach of the agreement dated 10.3.2018. It is further stated that even by accommodating the respondent to share 50% profit by making investment for the purchase of construction material and sharing profit by the same ratio, the respondent though initially brought a sum of Rs. 15 lakh, but later on could not bring the funds and completely stopped working. The petitioner being under contract with the Government proceeded with the work by terminating the agreement dated 10.3.2018 by his letter dated 27.11.2019. It is stated that the respondent did not like that the petitioner had proceeded with the work with his own men, material and machinery and therefore raised the dispute and subsequently filed a Special Civil Suit No.33 of 2019 on 6.11.2019. On service of process NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined on 26.11.2019, the petitioner gave an application seeking time and on 13.1.2020 another application was given by the petitioner under Section 12-A, chapter III-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 seeking direction from the Court upon the defendant to exhaust the remedy of pre- institution mediation. The petitioner also filed written statement along with 6 documents on 13.1.2020 itself specifically raising the issue of jurisdiction of the Court on the strength of averments made in the plaint. 2.4 It is stated that on 20.2.2020, the petitioner gave an application at Exh-18 requesting the Court to decide the issue of jurisdiction as Preliminary issue and subsequently on 23.9.2020, the petitioner had pointed out to the Court that his application at Exh-18 is not decided so also the respondent with a view to pressurize the Petitioner, moved an application vide Exh-21 under the provisions of O.39, R. 1 & 2 on 15.9.2020 to which the petitioner pointed out that before respondent's application the Petitioner's application about jurisdiction is required to be decided first. \nNEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined 2.5 The trial Court rejected the respondent's stay application on execution of work on merits. The application below Exh-18 with regard to the jurisdiction of the Court which came to be filed by the petitioner herein came to be rejected. It is further stated that there are no outstanding dues of the respondent but on the contrary the petitioner has claimed against the respondent which could not be settled in mediation ordered through the Court and the petitioner is in the process of filing suit before the competent Court at Mehsana for recovering his dues. It is against this order passed below Exh-18 the petitioner is approaching this Hon'ble Court by way of filing the present petition. The Paras-5 and 6 of the said order rejecting the application below Exh-18 for deciding the Preliminary issue of jurisdiction dated 27.10.2020 read thus:\n\"(5) In the present case, both the parties have relied on Section-20. Further, in the drafting and pleadings of the present suit, the jurisdiction is stated to be Patan only because the payment has been made through R.T.G.S. and the Plaintiff is residing in the jurisdiction of Patan. The jurisdiction cannot be determined only on the basis of drafting and pleadings. If jurisdiction is determined in this NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined manner, there would a number of litigation among the parties. Further, the documentary evidence produced by the Respondent himself is produced at Mark-12/2. Considering the same, at the heading of the document it is mentioned as \"Jurisdiction - Subject to Patan\". Which means, there is a reason to believe that whatever communication is made in name of his firm, the jurisdiction is subject to Patan, because he has consented that the suit be tried in jurisdiction of Patan and if the suit is tried in the jurisdiction of Patan, no loss is likely to be caused either to the plaintiff or the respondent.\nFurther, in the agreement between the two parties in the present case which is produced at Mark-12/1, it is not agreed between the parties as to which court is having jurisdiction. Further, the respondent in the present case has rendered a payment to the plaintiff through R.T.G.S. within the jurisdiction of Patan District. An R.T.G.S. transaction can be executed only if the bank, its address and its code is known. Moreover, the Respondent does not deny the fact that he had rendered a payment through R.T.G.S. to the Plaintiff. Therefore, there is no reason for not admitting the fact as to the R.T.G.S. transaction. As the payment is made in such a manner and the Respondent has rendered the payment through R.T.G.S. it is in his knowledge that the bank is located in the jurisdiction of Patan District. Id est, the rendering of payment itself can be said to be a Cause of Action, partly. Moreover, when the Respondent's place of occupation, its office and the Respondent's permanent residential address is located in the jurisdiction of Patan District and as both the parties have relied on Section-20 of C.P.C., which reads, NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined \"20. Other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action arises.- Subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction- (a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the leave of the Court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution; or (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.\nConsidering the above stated Section , Section-20(C) reads the expression \"the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises\"\nwhich interprets that the court under whose jurisdiction the cause of action, whether fully or party, has arisen is competent to try the suit. In the present case, the D-List produced by the Respondent at Mark-12/2, it is mentioned, \"subject to Patan jurisdiction\". I d est, the letter which is addressed to the Plaintiff was sent in such a manner that the jurisdiction is Patan. Moreover, the address of Head Office shown in this document reads \"Lakhibhano Madh, Sander, NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined Taluka & District Patan\". Further, the letter is signed at the bottom with a seal which reads \"M/s. Amar Construction Co.\"\nand \"Patan\" is mentioned below it. This document has been produced by the Respondent. Therefore, there is no reason to not rely on it. On the basis of this document, the fact emerges on record that, the office of the Respondent in the present case is located within the jurisdiction of Patan District and as per Section-20, the jurisdiction can be the place of permanent residence or the place from a business is operated. Moreover, the payment which was rendered by the Respondent to the Plaintiff was rendered through RTGS and in the jurisdiction of Patan. As the amount has been remitted to an account in the bank located in Patan, on that basis too, this Court at Patan is having jurisdiction with regard to the present suit. As discussed above, the jurisdiction is vested in this court as per Section-20(C) of C.P.C. In the same manner, when the Respondent's Head Office is located in the jurisdiction of Patan and the same fact is evident in the document produced by the Respondent, the jurisdiction is vested in this Court as per Section-20(a). Further, with regard to Section-20(a), it can be said that;\n\"Actually and voluntarily resides\" or \"personally works for gain\" - Meaning of. - Each of the clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 20 is disjunctive and makes provision for a distinct and different situation. In so far as clause (a) is concerned the requirement is that the time of commencement defendants than one, each of the defendants, at the time of commencement of the suit must be actually and voluntarily residing or carrying on business or personally working for gain NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court before which the suit is laid. The expressions \"actually and voluntarily resides\" or \"personally works for gain\"\ncan have reference to natural only and not to legal entities. \nThe crucial question hence is whether at the time of commencement of suit the petitioner herein did \"actually and voluntarily reside\" within the jurisdiction of the court at Attingal. This, in turn calls for a construction of the words 'actually and voluntarily resides' appearing in Section 20(a) of the CPC. The expression 'residence' has to be distinguished from mere stay or presence. The expression 'residence' carried with it the concept of continuity. A person resides at such, a place where he eats, drinks, sleeps and lives. In language that is the, concept of 'residence. But the expression 'residence' would certainly admit different meanings depending on the context. There can be permanent residence and temporary residence. There can be actual residence and constructive residence. There can be voluntary residence and involuntary residence. The Legislature was conscious of these nice distinctions' evidently when it employed the expression 'actually and voluntarily' to qualify 'the word 'resides' in Section 20(a) of the CPC to' confer jurisdiction on a Court. \nThe purpose of Section 20(a) which confers jurisdiction on a plaintiff to file the suit at a place where the NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined defendant resides did come up for consideration of the Supreme Court in the decision reported in Union of India v. Ladulal. The principle appears to be clear and wholesome that is to facilitate convenient opportunity to the defendant to resist the suit to enable him to resist the suit without undue jurisdiction must rest at convenient trouble. Normally, jurisdiction must rest at that place where the Clause of action arose. Section 20 incorporates a rule by which suits can be filed not merely at the place where the cause of action wholly or in part arose but also at other venues. The provisions of Section 20(a) and (b) have to be understood in this background. At a place where the defendant a. oo gt, actually - and voluntarily resides or where he carries on business or where he personally works for gain it should be easy for the defendant to conduct his defence without undue trouble and that appears to be the rationale underlying. Section 20(a) and (b)\" which permit the suits be filed not only at the place where the cause of action arose as stipulated in clause C but also at the place where defendant so resides or carries on. business or personally works for gain. If the expression 'resides' were not qualified with the expressions 'actually and voluntarily', the court would have been been obliged to ascertain the meaning of the word 'resides'. Court had occasion to consider the sweep of the expression 'resides'. The Supreme Court had occasion to consider the sweep of the expression 'resides' in the context of Section 19(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act and the following passages NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined appearing in paras 12 and 13 appear in the decision reported in Jeewanti v. Kishan Chandra, to be relevant extract them below:\n12. In order to give jurisdiction on the ground of 'residence' something more than a temporary stay is required. It must be more or less of a permanent character, and of such a nature that the Court in which the respondent is: sued, is his 'natural 'forum. The word 'reside\" is by no means free from all ambiguity and is capable of a variety of meanings according to the circumstances to which it is made applicable and the context in which it is found. It is capable of being understood in its ordinary sense of having one's own dwelling permanently as well as in its extended sense. In its ordinary sense 'residence' is mor or less of a permanent character. the expression 'resides' means to make an abode for a considerable time to dwell permanently or for a for a length of time; to have a settled abode for a time. It is the place where a person has a fixed home or abode. In Webster's Dictionary, 'to reside' has been defined as meaning 'to dwell permanently or for any length of time' and words like 'dwelling place' or 'abode' are held to be synonymous. Where there is such fixed home or such abode at one place the person cannot be said to reside at any other place where he had gone on a casual or temporary visit e.g. for health or business or for a change. If a person lives with NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined his wife and children, in an established home, his legal and actual place of residence is the same. If a person has no established home and is compelled to live in hotels, boarding houses or houses of others his actual and physical habitation is the place where, actually or personally resides. \n(6) Perusing Section-20(a) and 20(c) of C.P.C., within the meaning of this section, the Plaintiff in the present case has instituted the suit in the jurisdiction of Patan. Further, the Respondent himself has mentioned \"subject to Patan Jurisdiction\" on the documentary evidence produced by him, his head office is in the jurisdiction of Patan District and the respondent has rendered the payment through R.T.G.S. within the jurisdiction of Patan. Further, for last two adjournments, the negotiation as to settlement between both the parties is going on, but the could not reached a settlement. Therefore, with a view to ensure that the precious time of the Court is utilized for a purpose, the order is passed today. As this court is vested with the jurisdiction to try the present suit, the following order is passed in the larger interest of justice.\" \n3. Heard Mr. N.L. Ramnani, learned advocate appearing for Mr. Dayani, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner and Mr. Siddharth Dave, learned advocate appearing for the respondent herein.\n4. Learned advocate Mr. N.L.Ramnani vehemently NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined submitted that the Court below has erred in rejecting the said application below Exh-18. The said order is required to be quashed and set aside, as the basis that the respondent's action is sub-let agreement dated 3.10.2018, which was admittedly executed at Mehsana and that there is no averment as to how the Court at Patan could have the jurisdiction in view of the settled position of law. 4.1 it was submitted that the agreement between the parties is executed at Mehsana, all the terms were settled at Mehsana, the work is done at Jabalpur M.P. Therefore, in absence of any pleadings or averments legally sustainable showing cause of action under Sub-clause (C) of Section 20 at Patan, the order impugned is erroneous. 4.2 It was submitted that the trial Court failed to appreciate that for deciding the preliminary issue the jurisdiction, only the pleadings of the plaint and cause of action are required to be considered and considering the same, it is clear that no cause of action, as alleged, said to have been arisen in the territorial jurisdiction of Patan. \nNEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined Considering Para-8 of the plaint, which pertains to jurisdiction, it is averred that the plaintiff is residing in Patan at Village: Sarsav and since he is having Account with Corporation Bank, Patan, he received the money through RTGS at Patan and therefore the Court at Patan has jurisdiction, is erroneous. \n4.3 It was submitted that the trial Court ignored the admitted position that the RTGS has been done by the petitioner from the bank at Mehsana and thereby committed serious error in law by ignoring the facts of the case and has relied upon the letter head produced as a document by which the petitioner along with the written statement wherein the petitioner's Mehsana address is shown and also the Head Office is shown at village Sandhel of Patan District, which cannot be considered as working place of the petitioner firm. 4.4 It was submitted that in respondent's reply to application at Exh-18 filed below Exh-25 dated 28.9.2020 there is no reference by the respondent to the letter head NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined which mentioned head-office of the petitioner being at Patan and it was only during the arguments the respondent pointed out this fact, which was explained and replied by the Petitioner that no averments are made in the plaint, agreement is executed at Mehsana, no cause of action has arisen and averred by the respondent at Patan either about the Head Office or subject to Patan jurisdiction as on the date of commencement of the suit, nothing has been done at Patan and all this was irrelevant.\n4.5 It was submitted that there is no averment that the petitioner firm is operating from the Head Office from Patan. It is not even alleged by the respondent that activity of any kind is done at Patan relating to the suit transaction. The respondent was aware about the fact that sub-let contract is executed at Mehsana, the petitioner firm is operating from Mehsana office since many years and merely because partners of the petitioner firm originally belonged to Patan, which was shown in the past, as their operating office as per the letter head and it NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined is for this reason that no averment of any kind, alleging any act having been done at Patan is made in the pleadings. Placing reliance on the aforesaid submissions, it was submitted that the Court below committed an error in reading the letter dated 8.11.2019 in which while stamping as \"M/s. Amar Construction Co.\" and signing as \"Partner\" has been misconstrued and resulted in error in passing the aforesaid order. Merely mentioning of \"Subject to Patan Jurisdiction\" in the past and incidentally using the letter head would not give any jurisdiction to the Court as the same is also not averred by the respondent in the plaint. Placing reliance on the aforesaid submission, it was submitted by the learned advocate appearing for the petitioner that the order passed by the trial Court dated 27.12.2020 wherein application filed below Exh-18 under Order 7 Rue 10 came to be rejected by the Court below, is required to be quashed and set- aside. \n5. Mr. Ramnani, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner placed reliance on:\nNEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined (1) In the case of A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. and another v. A.P. Agencies, Salem, reported in AIR 1989 SC 1239;\n(2) In the case of Shridhar Vyapaar Pvt. Ltd. v.\nGammon India Ltd., passed by Division Bench in of 2016 of the Calcutta High Court.\n6. Placing reliance on the aforesaid judgment, it was submitted that the transfer of the amount by RTGS at Patan would not confer Patan Court the jurisdiction to hear the suit. \n7. Heard Mr. Siddharth Dave, learned advocate appearing for the respondents. Mr. Dave, learned advocate submitted that the present Suit in question is a Commercial Suit. The parties relegated themselves to Pre-Institution Mediation under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and, therefore, the said Suit is pending at Commercial Court, Patan. The Mediation, however, failed and thereafter the petitioner filed NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined application below Order 7 Rule 10 on the ground that no cause of action or any part of the cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the concerned trial Court at Patan. \n8. It was submitted that the respondent herein i.e. defendant has entered his appearance and filed reply. Along with the same as well as along with the present petition filed by the petitioner, the petitioner has annexed a communication dated 8.11.2019, which is annexed at Annexure-'E'- (Page-23) of the petition. The said communication as well as the admission on the part of the defendant, clearly go to show that the Head Office of the defendant is at Lakhibhano Madh, Sander, Ta. & Dist - Patan. The letter head also clearly envisages that the same was issued, clearly reflecting that the same is subject to the Patan Jurisdiction. It was submitted that the petitioner herein has tried to mislead the Hon'ble Court by submitting that the said letter head which is dated 8.11.2019, is old letter head which is used by the NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined defendant otherwise the defendant does not have an Office at Patan. The said letter head clearly go to show that the same was issued on 8.11.2019 and it cannot be said that the said letter-head duly produced on record by the petitioner is an old letter head and that the Suit was filed by respondent herein in the month of November, 2019 only. In view of the above, it is not the contention of the petitioner that it is an old letter-head, is with an intention to mislead the Court. It was submitted that the petitioner having not placed true facts on record, the petition be dismissed on the said ground alone. \n9. Placing reliance on Section 13 of the Commercial Court Act, 2015, learned advocate Mr. Dave submitted that the petition is not maintainable against the order passed by the Commercial Court. Mr. Dave has placed reliance on the decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, reported in (2021) 4 SCC 379 and relevant would be para-53, to substantiate the aforesaid submission. \nNEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined 10. It was submitted that it is undisputed that the petitioner had completed work as per the agreed terms of Contract and the respondent-original plaintiff had carried out work as per the agreed terms of contract dated 10.3.2018 entered into between the petitioner and respondent, which is duly placed at Annexure 'B' at Page- 14 of the petition and placed reliance on the same. It was submitted that the petitioner- original defendant was required to pay the due amount to the plaintiff to the tune of Rs .2,21,02,693.23. It was submitted that in absence of any specific clause regards the jurisdiction, wherein reliance was placed on the terms and conditions which are duly produced at Page Nos. 15 and 16 of the contract agreement. It was submitted that when no place of payment is fixed and therefore in absence of any such jurisdiction clause as well as in absence of any such specification of the place of payment, in view of the settled proposition of law, the doctrine of \"The debtor must seek creditor\" would apply and therefore, in view of the aforesaid doctrine, there is a specific averment made NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined by the plaintiff in the para-8 of the suit (which is at page- 20 of the petition), since the plaintiff has received some of the part amount in its bank account at Patan and therefore, the partly cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of Patan Court. Therefore, the Court at Patan would have the jurisdiction. \nANALYSIS 11. At this stage, it is pertinent to note that the order under challenge is passed by the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Patan in Application below Exh-18 in Special Civil Suit No.33 of 2019. The parties have exhausted remedy of pre-institution mediation under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The petitioner herein has filed the application below Exh-18, which is duly produced at Annexure 'A', page-13A before the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Commercial Court at Patan and the order impugned, as referred to above, is passed by the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Patan by order dated 27.10.2020 wherein it was held that the said Court has NEUTRAL CITATION C/SCA/15744/2021 ORDER DATED: 19/01/2023 undefined jurisdiction to try the suit. It is apposite to refer to Notification No. B.16/1/ADM/11 of 2021 conferring the jurisdiction to Principal Senior Civil Judge, Patan for Head-quarter Patan and for dealing with the commercial dispute having specified value of not less than 3 lakh except application preferred under Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and Intellectual Property Rights relating to Suits and Properties. Admittedly, in the facts of the present case, the order impugned is passed by the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Patan wherein the application below Exh-18 came to be filed undisputedly under the Commercial Courts Act.

(4 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] per contra, learned senior counsel for the claimant would submit that the learned commercial court did not err in allowing the application filed by it seeking leave of the court to raise additional grounds in support of the objection application. inviting attention of this court towards the contents of civil miscellaneous application filed by the claimant, learned senior counsel submitted that it contains additional grounds based only on the admitted facts and thus, being pure questions of law, it is permissible to raise the same at any stage of proceeding. he submitted that it is settled law that even if the applicant does not rely upon the grounds mentioned in section 34(2)(b), the court is under an obligation to examine the validity of the award and to set it aside on any of the grounds mentioned therein. he submitted that there is no change in cause of action as it is bundle of the facts which entitles a party to make a claim against the other party and by raising additional grounds, it cannot be held that there has been change in it as no new fact has been raised/pleaded in the application. shri rajendra prasad, learned senior counsel submitted that jurisdiction of this court under article 227 of the constitution of india, while hearing a writ petition against an order passed by the learned commercial court, is confined to examining as to whether it suffers from any patent jurisdictional error and not beyond that. he submitted that order impugned has been passed by the learned commercial court well within its jurisdiction and warrants no interference. he, in support of his submission, relies upon following judgments:(5 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] 1. deep industries ltd. vs. oil and natural gas corporation ltd. & anr.: (2020) 15 scc 706 2. fiza developers and inter-trade pvt. ltd. vs. amci (india) private ltd. and anr.: (2009) 17 scc 796 3. chittoori subbanna vs. kudappa subbanna & ors.: air 1965 supreme court 1325 4. mahboob pasha vs. syed zaheeruddin & ors.: air 1998 karnataka 83 5. state of maharashtra vs. hindustan construction company ltd.: (2010) 4 scc 518 6. state of chhattisgarh & anr. vs. sal udyog pvt. ltd.: (2022) 2 scc 275 he, therefore, prays that the writ petition be dismissed. heard. considered. the first and foremost submission of learned senior counsel for the petitioner is that the additional grounds tantamount to change in the cause of action as pleaded by the claimant in its claim petition which is impermissible in the eye of law. the cause of action in the present case is non-payment of price of the notified seeds supplied by the claimant to the petitioner and it does not get changed by the additional grounds which do not involve introduction of any new fact; rather, remains as such. the claimant only wants examination of the issue of limitation from a new angle based on the admitted facts. this view gains support from a three-judges bench judgment of the hon'ble supreme court of india in the case of a.k. gupta & sons ltd. vs. (6 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] damodar valley corporation air 1967 sc 96, wherein, while interpreting the 'cause of action', their lordships held as under: \"(6) now, the appellant had in view of the high court's decision as to the maintainability of the suit, sought its leave to amend the plaint by adding an extra relief in the following words : \"that a decree for rs. 65,000 or such other amount which may be found due on proper account being taken may be passed in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant\". the amendment having been refused the present appeal has been preferred. (7) it is not in dispute that at the date of the application for amendment, a suit for a money claim under the contract was barred. the general rule, no doubt, is that a party is not allowed by amendment to set up a new case or a new cause of action particularly when a suit on the new case or cause of action is barred : weldon v. neale, (1887) 19 qbd 394. but it is also well recognised that where the amendment does not constitute the addition of a new cause of action or raise a different case, but amounts to no more than a different or additional approach to the same facts, the amendment will be allowed even after the expiry of the statutory period of limitation : see charan das v. amir khan, 47 ind app 255 (air 1921 pc 50) and l. j. leach & company ltd. v. jardine skinner and co., 1957 scr 438: (air 1957 sc 357). (8) the principal reasons that have led to the rule last mentioned are, first, that the object of courts and rules of procedure is to decide the rights of the parties and not to punish them for their mistakes (cropper v. smith, (1884) 26 ch. d 700 (710-711) and secondly, that a party is strictly not entitled to rely on the statute of limitation when what is sought to be brought in by the amendment can be said in substance to be already in the pleading sought to be amended kisandas rupchand v. rachappa vithoba(1909) ilr 33 bom 644 at p.651, approved in pirgonda hongonda patil (7 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] v. kalgonda shidgonda patil, 1957 scr 595 (603): (air 1957 sc 363 at p.366). (9) the expression \"cause of action\" in the present context does not mean \"every fact which it is material to be proved to entitle the plaintiff to succeed\" as was said in cooke v. gill (1873) 8 cpc 107 (116), in a different context, for if it were so, no material fact could ever be amended or added and, of course, no one would want to change or add an immaterial allegation by amendment. that expression for the present purpose only means, a new claim made on a new basis constituted by new facts. such a view was taken in robinson v. unicos property corporation ltd., 1962-2 all er 24, and it seems to us to be the only possible view to take. any other view would make the rule futile. the words \"new case\" have been understood to mean \"new set of ideas\" : dornan v. j. w. ellis & co. ltd., 1962-1 all er 303. this also seems to us to be a reasonable view to take. no amendment will be allowed to introduce a new set of ideas to the prejudice of any right acquired by any party by lapse of time. (10) now, how does the present case stand on these principles? does the amendment introduce a new cause of action or a new case? we do not think it does. the suit was on the contract. it sought the interpretation of a clause in the contract only for a decision of the rights of the parties under it and for no other purpose. it was the contract which formed the cause of action on which the suit was based. the amendment seeks to introduce a claim based on the same cause of action, that is, the same contract. it introduces no new case or facts. indeed the facts on which the money claim sought to be added is based are not in dispute. even the amount of the claim now sought to be made by amendment, was mentioned in the plaint in stating the valuation of the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction. the respondent had notice of it. it is quite clear that the interpretation of the clause was sought only for quantifying (8 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] the money claim. in the written statement the respondent specifically expressed its willingness to pay the appellant's legitimate dues which could only mean such amount as might be due according to the rates applicable on a proper interpretation of the clause. the respondent was fully aware that the ultimate object of the appellant in filing the suit was to obtain the payment of that amount. it was equally aware that the amount had not been specifically claimed in the suit because the respondent had led the appellant to believe that it would pay whatever the court legitimately found to be due. it in fact said so in the written statement. if there was any case where the respondent was not entitled to the benefit of the law of limitation, the present is that one. the respondent cannot legitimately claim that the amendment will prejudicially effect his right under that law for really be had no such right. it is a case in which the claim for money was in substance in the plaint from the beginning though it had not formally been made.\" the judgements relied upon by the petitioner in this regard are of little assistance to it inasmuch as the same have no applicability in the present case. in the case of ma. shwe mya (supra), the privy council held that one distinct cause of action cannot be substituted for another by way of an amendment in the facts wherein the learned trial judge found that the verbal agreement based upon which the suit for specific performance was filed could not be established in the evidence and the judicial commissioner to whom the appeal was taken thereagainst affirming the view, granted a liberty to the plaintiff to amend enabling compensation to be assessed for the alleged breach of the contract. however, as already observed, in the present case, (9 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] the additional grounds have been permitted to be raised by the learned commercial court without introduction of any new fact. similarly, in the case of t.l. muddukrishana & anr. (supra), the hon'ble supreme court held that in a suit filed for mandatory injunction, amendment seeking to introduce the relief of specific performance after expiry of period of limitation is not permissible. however, in the present case, no such situation obtains. contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that while adjudicating the question of limitation, the court has to see pleadings of the plaintiff/claimant only, is misconceived. section 3 of the act of 1963 mandates a court to adjudicate maintainability of a suit/appeal/application qua the limitation irrespective of whether a defence in this regard is taken or not; but, the provision cannot be interpreted in the manner that the averments in the plaint/appeal/application only are to be considered to decide this issue and pleading/defence of the defendant cannot be looked into at all for this purpose. the court is duty bound to ponder upon the issue of limitation taking a holistic consideration of the pleadings of the parties as also the evidence led by them in support thereof. indisputably, in the present case, the claimant has sought to raise additional grounds to reassert that the claim filed by it before the learned arbitrator was within limitation based on the admitted facts which are already on record and no new fact has been introduced. in these circumstances, it amounts to raising a pure question of law which can be raised at any stage of proceeding. this court finds support from the following judgments in its view. (10 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] their lordships have held in the case of chittoori subbanna (supra) as under: \"4. chitturi subbanna, appellant, applied to the high court for permission to raise an additional ground of appeal to the effect that the trial court was not entitled to grant mesne profits for more than 3 years from the date of the decree of the high court. the high court disallowed that prayer for the reasons that he had not taken such a ground in the memorandum of appeal and had, on the other hand, conceded before the commissioner and the trial court that accounts could be taken upto 1943 in respect of a and c schedule properties, that he had elected to have the profits determined by the trial court upto the date of delivery of possession and that if he had taken the objection earlier, it would have been open to the second plaintiff-respondent to file a suit for the recovery of mesne profits beyond the three years upto the date of delivery of possession. it is urged before us for the appellant that the high court was in error in not allowing the appellant to have raised the objection based on the provisions of o .20, r. 12, c.p.c. we agree with this contention. the question sought to be raised was a pure question of law and was not dependent on the determination of any question of fact. the first appellate court ought to have allowed it. such pure questions of law are allowed for the first time at later stages too. 5. the appellant could not have claimed-and did not claima right to urge the new point which had not been taken in the grounds of appeal. he made a separate application for permission to take up that point. the procedure followed was in full conformity with what had been suggested in wilson v. united counties bank, ltd. 1920 ac 102 pg.106, to the effect: \"if in exceptional cases parties desire to add new grounds to those of which they have given notice, it will (11 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] usually be convenient, by a substantive application, to apply to the indulgence of the court which is to hear the appeal.\" 6. in yeswant deorao deshmukh v. walchand ramchand kothari(1950) scr 852; (air 1951 sc 16) this court allowed a question of law to be raised at the hearing of the appeal even though no reference to it had been made in the courts below or in the grounds of appeal to this court. this court said : \"if the facts proved and found as established are sufficient to make out a case of fraud within the meaning of section 18, this objection may not be serious, as the question of the applicability of the section will be only a question of law and such a question could be raised at any stage of the case and also in the final court of appeal. the following observations of lord watson in connecticut fire insurance co. v. kavanagh, 1892 a.c. 473, are relevant. he said : 'when a question of law is raised for the first time in a court of last resort upon the construction of a document or upon facts either admitted or proved beyond controversy, it is not only competent but expedient in the interests of justice to entertain the plea. the expediency of adopting that course may be doubted when the plea cannot be disposed of without deciding nice questions of fact in considering which the court of ultimate review is placed in a much less advantageous position than the courts below.\" again, it was said in m. k. ranganathan v. government of madras (1955) 2 scr 374 at p.381: ((s) air 1955 sc 604 at p.607): \"the high court had allowed the respondent 3 to raise the question even at that late stage inasmuch as it was a pure question of law and the learned solicitorgeneral, therefore, rightly did not press the first contention before us.\" a division bench of hon'ble karnataka high court has, in the case of mahboob pasha (supra), decided as under: (12 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] \"6. we are of the view that the approach made by the learned trial judge is on the face of it erroneous. it is the duty of the court to decide the question as to when the limitation commences, depending upon the nature of the suit. the decision on such question shall have to be of the court. it cannot be founded on the submission made by the counsel for the parties. limitation affects the jurisdiction of the court. if the suit is barred by limitation, the court has no jurisdiction to entertain it. therefore, as the parties cannot confer jurisdiction on the court by consent, the question of limitation as to the original cause of action cannot be decided on the concession made by the parties. s. 5 of the limitation act does not apply to the original cause of action so as to extend the period of limitation by concession made by the parties. the expression 'prescribed period' as per cl. (j) of s. 2 of the act means, the period of limitation computed in accordance with the provisions of the act. sub-sec. (1) of s. 3 of the act further provides that subject to the provisions contained in ss. 4 to 24 (inclusive), every suit instituted, appeal preferred, and application made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed although limitation has not been set up as a defence. therefore, it is the duty of the court to decide the question of limitation. 7. thus the trial court ought to have decided on its own reasoning as to when the period of limitation commenced for the purpose of filing the suit in question instead of acting upon the concessions made by both parties, as the decision on such question had a bearing on the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the suit.\" the judgements relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner in the case of hindustan construction company ltd. (supra) is of no help to him wherein, it was held that by way of an amendment in the memorandum of arbitration appeal filed (13 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] under section 37 of the act of 1996, absolutely new ground for which there is no factual foundation in the application for setting aside the award is impermissible which contains new material/facts when admittedly these grounds were not originally raised in the arbitration petition filed under section 34 for setting aside the award. as already held, in the present case, the claim filed by the claimant was dismissed by the learned arbitrator being hit by the law of limitation which is subject matter of challenge in the objection application filed by the claimant under section 34 of the act and the additional grounds are based on the admitted facts already on record. contention of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that in absence of an amendment in the memo of objection application, the learned commercial court erred in permitting the claimant to raise additional ground, does not merit acceptance. as already held, the additional grounds are in the nature of legal issues and can be raised by making an application at any stage of litigation without amendment in the memo of objection application. section 3 of the act of 1963 also mandates the court to decide the issue of limitation even in the absence of any defence as it goes to the very root of the court's jurisdiction to entertain and decide a matter. as already seen, their lordships have held in case chittoori subbanna (supra) that the pure questions of law can be raised at any stage of the proceeding. further, in the case of fiza developers and inter-trade private ltd. (supra), it was held as under: (14 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] \"28. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx an application under section 34 in that sense is adversarial in nature. but the proceedings under section 34 differ from regular civil suits in a significant aspect.\" 29. in a regular civil suit, in the event of failure to file a defence, it will be lawful for the court to pronounce the judgment on the basis of facts contained in the plaint [vide order 8 rule 5(2) of the code]. but in an application under section 34, even if there is no contest, the court cannot, on the basis of the averments contained in the application, set aside the award. whether there is contest or not, the applicant has to prove one of the grounds set out in section 34(2)(a) and (b). even if the applicant does not rely upon the grounds under clause (b), the court, on its own initiative, may examine the award to find out whether it is liable to be set aside on either of the two grounds mentioned in section 34(2)(b). it is perhaps in this sense, the high court has stated that the proceedings may not be adversarial. be that as it may.\" submission of learned senior counsel for the petitioner as to additional grounds being hit by the provisions of order 6 rule 7 cpc is wholly misconceived inasmuch as, it has already been held that these are in the nature of legal issues with introduction of no new fact and examination of the issue of limitation from a new angle on the admitted facts. contention of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that additional grounds permitted to be raised fly in the face of clause 27 of the agreement executed between the parties merits no consideration as this court is not supposed to examine the merits of the additional grounds at this stage which is to be (15 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] appreciated by the learned commercial court as and when required. the judgement of the hon'ble supreme court of india in the case of rajkumar gurawara (dead) through lrs. (supra) is of no assistance to the petitioner wherein, while explaining the scope of order 6 rule 17 cpc, it was held that if the amendment results in introduction of new cause of action, it should not be permitted. however, in the present case, it has been held by this court that the additional grounds do not introduce a new cause of action. in the case of shakti bhog food industries ltd. (supra), their lordships have held that while examining the question of limitation under order 7 rule 11 cpc, the averments in the written statement as also the contention of the defendants are wholly immaterial. this proposition is of no help to the petitioner. similarly, in the case of srihari hanumandas totala (supra), the hon'ble supreme court was dealing with an issue under order 7 rule 11 cpc which is not the issue obtaining in the present case. in view of aforesaid discussion, this court is not satisfied that order dated 4.12.2021 passed by the learned commercial court in its judicious discretion appreciating the material on record in the light of well settled legal principles suffers from any patent jurisdictional error so as to warrant interference of this court under its limited supervisory jurisdiction vide article 227 of the constitution of india. the hon'ble supreme court has, in the case of deep industries ltd. (supra), while entertaining an appeal against the judgement of the high court under article 227 of the (16 of 16) [cw-3379/2022] constitution of india interfering with the order passed by the appellate authority under section 37 of the act of 1996, held as under: \"17. this being the case, there is no doubt whatsoever that if petitions were to be filed under articles 226/227 of the constitution against orders passed in appeals under section 37, the entire arbitral process would be derailed and would not come to fruition for many years. at the same time, we cannot forget that article 227 is a constitutional provision which remains untouched by the non-obstante clause of section 5 of the act. in these circumstances, what is important to note is that though petitions can be filed under article 227 against judgments allowing or dismissing first appeals under section 37 of the act, yet the high court would be extremely circumspect in interfering with the same, taking into account the statutory policy as adumbrated by us herein above so that interference is restricted to orders that are passed which are patently lacking in inherent jurisdiction.\" resultantly, this writ petition is dismissed being devoid of merit.
