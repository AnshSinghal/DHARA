The 2nd appellant is its M anaging Director . The 1st respondent is a Company dealing in construction of civil works. \n2. First appellant was awarded contract by M/s. Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) to execute Part-I (RG-I Area) for construction of quarters with Civil, Electrical, Plumbing and all other required accessories on back to back basis and also works pertaining to RG-II Area on back to back basis as per designs and drawings provided by SCCL. Appellant appointed 1st respondent as sub- contractor to execute the RG-I area work. The work was awarded on 15.02.2005 with a completion period of 18 months. Later it was also entrusted with RG-II works. \n3. While appellants allege that 1st respondent delayed completion of work, the 1st respondent alleges that 1st appellant was responsible for delay in executing the work. According to 1st respondent, the work was completed in May, 2007 and the defect liability period expired in May, 2008. First respondent alleges that he was subjected to several PNR,J & NBK,J impediments and delays due to lack of cooperation and coordination by the 1st appellant, illegally withheld amounts, due and payable to 1st respondent. \n4. On refusal by the 1st appellant to release the payments, 1st respondent issued legal notice dated 12.09.2011 initiating dispute resolution process by invoking arbitration clause, clause-24 of the additional conditions of contract. The 1st respondent raised 17 claims. \n5. The 2nd appellant appointed Mr. S.Rajiv, General Manager of 1st appellant as Sole Arbitrator. The proceedings commenced on 10.02.2012 and prolonged. Aggrieved by the conduct of the arbitrator, the 1st respondent lodged complaint before the 2nd appellant. At that stage, the Arbitrator resigned. Consequently, the 2nd appellant appointed 3rd respondent as an Arbitrator on 05.11.2015. First respondent also had grievance against 3rd respondent. First respondent protested before the 2nd appellant against continuation of 3rd respondent as Arbitrator. \n6. As there was no response, 1st respondent filed Arb.Application No.75 of 2018 under Section 14(1)(a) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, 'Act, 1996') before this Court. After receiving notices, the 2nd appellant informed the 1st respondent that the 3rd respondent resigned as Arbitrator. During the hearing of Arb.Application No.75 of 2018, issue of maintainability of the PNR,J & NBK,J application under Section 14(1) of the Act before the High Court was raised. Having regard to legal position, the 1st respondent withdrew the application with liberty to go before appropriate Court. \n7. Accordingly, the 1st respondent filed instant Arb.O.P., before the Commercial Court. It is the case of 1st respondent that given the consistent conduct of the nominee arbitrators appointed by the 2nd appellant, who were biased towards the 1st appellant, it has lost confidence in their impartiality. Having regard to their conduct and amendments carried out to the Act in the year 2015, it has prayed to declare the actions of Arbitrators appointed by the 2nd appellant would constitute willful failure to act without undue delay; that appointment of 2nd respondent as Arbitrator when Arb.Appln.No.75 of 2018 was pending in the High Court is invalid and illegal; that appointment of sole Arbitrator by the 2nd appellant is violative of Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996; and consequently to terminate the mandate of 2nd respondent and substitute with another respondent in terms of Section 14 read with Section 15 of the Act, 1996.\n8. On due consideration of respective submissions, scope of the various provisions of the Act and the precedent decisions, the Commercial Court recorded its conclusions as under:\n\"(i) The appointment of the arbitrators by the respondent no.2 is not valid in view of the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in TRF Limited Vs. Energy Engineer Projects Ltd., [(2017) 8 SCC 377] and Ellora Paper Mills Ltd., vs. State of M.P., [2022 (3) SCC 1].\nPNR,J & NBK,J (ii) The arbitrators appointed by the respondent no.2 including respondent no.3 were negligent and did not conduct the arbitral proceedings within the timelines as assumed by them and thus they became defacto unable to perform their functions, within the meaning of Section 14(1)(a) of the ACA. \n(iii) There is undue delay by each of the arbitrators appointed by the respondent no.2 and none of them could proceed with the arbitral proceedings and this 'undue delay' can be considered as the delay mentioned in Section 14(1)(a) of the ACA and it also can be considered as bias on the part of the arbitrators.\n(iv) The contention that the petitioner is responsible for delaying the arbitral proceedings does not commend acceptance as it is the petitioner who is interested in arbitral proceedings and outcome of adjudication.\n(v) The grievance of the petitioner is well founded and the petitioner deserves to be allowed for substitution of the arbitrator.\" \n9. The Commercial Court held that the mandate of 2nd respondent be terminated and in his place, another Arbitrator be appointed. Accordingly, allowed the petition, terminated the mandate of 2nd respondent and in his place, appointed retired District Judge Sri Y.Govind Reddy as sole Arbitrator. Aggrieved thereby, this Appeal is preferred. \n10. Heard learned counsel Sri K.Srinivas Rao for the appellants and the learned counsel Sri SVS Chowdary for the respondent no.1.\n11. Learned counsel for appellants contended that the Commercial Court has no jurisdiction to appoint a substitute Arbitrator. He would submit that under Section 11 of the Act only the High Court can appoint an Arbitrator. \n11.1. He would submit that Commercial Court erred in terminating the mandate of the Arbitrator at the stage of final submissions. \nPNR,J & NBK,J 11.2. He would submit that the Commercial Court erred in not appreciating that the 2nd respondent was appointed strictly in accord with the agreed terms and in strict compliance with Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996. As appointment of Arbitrator by 2nd petitioner was in compliance of Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996, there is no cause to appoint another Arbitrator. \n11.3. He would further submit that the Commercial Court erred in not appreciating that if 1st respondent has objection on appointment of an Arbitrator, such objection ought to have been raised within the time specified in Section 13, whereas no such objection was raised at any time and participated in arbitral proceedings. \n11.4. He would submit that the Commercial Court erred in not appreciating that the 2nd respondent is no way concerned with the 1st petitioner and the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Perkins Eastman Architects vs. HSCC (India) Ltd.,1 has no application to this case. If 1st respondent had any apprehension on impartiality of the 2nd respondent he could have elicited information as prescribed in Sixth Schedule to the Act. \n11.5. He would contend that the Commercial Court has no jurisdiction to deal with the arbitration matter. 1 2019 SCC Online SC 1517 PNR,J & NBK,J 12. Learned counsel for 1st respondent would contend that appellants being parties to the agreement, the Managing Director of the 1st appellant cannot act as an arbitrator nor can he appoint an arbitrator unilaterally. As 2nd respondent was appointed as Arbitrator by 2nd appellant, his appointment is illegal. \n12.1. He would submit that the issue pertains to the year 2011 and as the arbitrators were associated with 1st appellant, they were dragging on the matter compelling the first respondent to lodge complaints. On filing complaints they coolly withdraw from arbitral proceedings. Thus, for no fault of first respondent, matter is dragged on causing grave prejudice and hardship to first respondent. \n12.2. He would submit that having regard to facts of the case, the Commercial court justified in setting aside appointment of second respondent as Arbitrator and appointing a retired Judicial Officer as Arbitrator. \n12.3. On the issue of jurisdiction, learned counsel contends that the dispute is a Commercial dispute and as per Section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, the Commercial Court alone has jurisdiction to decide the dispute raised by the first respondent. 12.4. Learned counsel relied on the following decisions:\nPNR,J & NBK,J i) Jaycee Housing Private Limited Vs Registrar (General) Orissa High Court, Cuttack2; and ii) TRF Limited Vs Energo Engineering Projects Limited3.\n13. The following issues arise for consideration:\n1) Whether the Commercial Court has jurisdiction to entertain COP No.8 of 2021 ?;\n2) Whether appointment of an outsider as arbitrator by Chairman and Managing Director is legal and valid ?;\n3) Whether the Commercial Court is competent to substitute another arbitrator?\nISSUE NO.1:\n14. The inter se dispute leading to taking recourse to arbitral proceedings is a commercial dispute. In a civil dispute, if a party to the dispute has grievance on appointment of arbitrator by opposite party, the said party can file application before a Civil Court. However, if the dispute is a commercial dispute, such applications have to be filed before the Commercial Court only as per Section 10(3)4 of the 2 (2023) 1 SCC 549 3 (2017) 8 SCC 377 S.10. Jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters. Where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a Specified Value and-- (1) & (2) xxxx (3) If such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of PNR,J & NBK,J Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Therefore, the Special Court in the cadre of District Judge for Trial and Disposal of Commercial Disputes at Hyderabad has jurisdiction to entertain C.O.P.No.8 of 2021. \n15. At this stage, it is apposite to note the opinion expressed by Hon'ble Supreme Court on jurisdiction of Commercial Court in Jaycee Housing Pvt. Ltd. (supra). Hon'ble Supreme Court held:\n\"16. It is the case on behalf of the appellants, relying upon Section 2(1)(e) of the 1996 Act that in case of arbitration other than the international commercial arbitration, the Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction in a district only have the jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration, but does not include any civil court of a grade inferior to such Principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes. Therefore, it is the case on behalf of the appellants that therefore conferring the jurisdiction upon the Court of learned Civil Judge (Senior Division) as Commercial Court to hear applications under Sections 9, 14 and 34 of the 1996 Act shall be directly in conflict with Section 2(1)(e) of the 1996 Act and therefore the notification of the State Government conferring such powers upon the Court of learned Civil Judge (Senior Division) which is subordinate to the rank of Principal Civil Judge in a district shall be bad in law. \n...... \n28. If the submission on behalf of the appellants is accepted, in that case, though with respect to other commercial disputes, the applications or appeals shall lie before the Commercial Courts established and constituted under Section 3 of the 2015 Act, with respect to arbitration proceedings, the applications or appeals shall lie before the Principal Civil Court of a district. There cannot be two fora with respect to different commercial disputes.\" \nISSUE NO.2:\n16. The relevant clause in the agreement provides that if there are any disputes or differences, they should be referred to the sole Arbitrator, the Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of Engineering original jurisdiction in a district (not being a High Court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial Court has been constituted. \nPNR,J & NBK,J Projects (India) Limited, the first appellant. It also provides that Chairman and Managing Director can appoint any other person as an arbitrator. Two times the Chairman and managing Director has appointed officers of the first appellant and on third occasion an outsider.\n17. The relevant provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 are, Sections 12 (5)5, 136, 147 and 158.\n5 S.12 Grounds for challenge:\n(1) to (4) xxxxx (5) :Notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship, with the parties or counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute, falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator:\nProvided that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub-section by an express agreement in writing. \n6 S.13. Challenge procedure. \n(1) Subject to sub-section (4), the parties are free to agree on a procedure for challenging an arbitrator. (2) Failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (1), a party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within fifteen days after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or after becoming aware of any circumstances referred to in sub-section(3) of section 12, send a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal. (3) Unless the arbitrator challenged under sub-section (2) withdraws from his office or the other party agrees to the challenge, the arbitral tribunal shall decide on the challenge. (4) If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the procedure under subsection (2) is not successful, the arbitral tribunal shall continue the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award. \n(5) Where an arbitral award is made under sub-section (4), the party challenging the arbitrator may make an application for setting aside such an arbitral award in accordance with section 34. (6) Where an arbitral award is set aside on an application made under sub-section (5), the Court may decide as to whether the arbitrator who is challenged is entitled to any fees. 7 S.14. Failure or impossibility to act.--(1) [The mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate and he shall be substituted by another arbitrator, if] --\n(a) he becomes de jure or de facto unable to perform his functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay; and (b) he withdraws from his office or the parties agree to the termination of his mandate. (2) If a controversy remains concerning any of the grounds referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1), a party may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, apply to the Court to decide on the termination of the mandate. \n(3) If, under this section or sub-section (3) of section 13, an arbitrator withdraws from his office or a party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, it shall not imply acceptance of the validity of any ground referred to in this section or sub-section(3) of section 12. 8 S.15. Termination of mandate and substitution of arbitrator.--(1) In addition to the circumstances referred to in section 13 or section 14,the mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate-- (a) where he withdraws from office for any reason; or (b) by or pursuant to agreement of the parties. (2) Where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed according to the rules that were applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator being replaced. (3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where an arbitrator is replaced under sub-section (2), any hearings previously held maybe repeated at the discretion of the arbitral tribunal. 1. Ins. by Act 3 of 2016, s. 8 (w.e.f. 23-10-2015). 2. Subs. by s. 9, ibid., for \"The mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate if\" (w.e.f. 23-10-2015). 14 ( 4) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an order or ruling of the arbitral tribunal made prior to the replacement of PNR,J & NBK,J 18. According to Section 13 of the Act, 1996, a party who intends to challenge an arbitrator should do so within 15 days after becoming aware of the constitution of arbitral Tribunal by sending a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral Tribunal. \n19. The Arbitral Tribunal is competent to decide the challenge. If it rejects the challenge, it is competent to commence the arbitral proceedings. In the case on hand, no challenge was made before the Arbitrator. C.O.P is filed under Section 14 of the Act, 1996 praying to grant comprehensive reliefs. \n20. Section 14 of the Act, 1996 is on failure or impossibility of conducting arbitral proceedings. According to Sub-section (1) the mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate and he should be substituted by another arbitrator if he becomes de-jure and de facto unable to perform his functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay. According to sub section (2) if the controversy concerning any of the grounds referred to in sub section (1) (a) remain, a party may apply to the Court to decide on the termination of the mandate. \n21. Section 15 of the Act, 1996 also envisages termination of mandate and substitution of arbitrator. Circumstances mentioned therein are in addition to situations envisaged in Sections 13 and 14 of the Act, 1996. \nan arbitrator under this section shall not be invalid solely because there has been a change in the composition of the arbitral tribunal. \nPNR,J & NBK,J 22. It is not in dispute that the arbitration clause in the agreement requires Chairman and Managing Director to conduct arbitral proceedings or by a person appointed by him. The three arbitrators, one after the other, are appointed by Chairman and Managing Director. The first two are from the first appellant and third is an outsider. \n23. Learned counsel for appellant contended that the third arbitrator is a neutral person and he has complied mandate of Section 12 (5) and therefore there is no impediment in conducting arbitration proceedings by the second respondent. This issue is no more res-integra. \n24. In TRF Limited (supra) as per the terms of purchase order, the Managing Director appointed a retired Judge of the Supreme Court as arbitrator. This was challenged in an application filed under Section 11(5) read with Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996. The question that fell for consideration was whether once a person required to arbitrate upon the disputes arising under the terms and conditions of the contract becomes ineligible by operation of law, he would not be eligible to nominate a person as an arbitrator. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held:\n\"50. First, we shall deal with Clause (d). There is no quarrel that by virtue of Section 12(5) of the Act, if any person who falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule shall be ineligible to be appointed as the arbitrator. There is no doubt and cannot be, for the language employed in the Seventh Schedule, the Managing Director of the Corporation has become ineligible by operation of law. It is the stand of the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant that once the Managing Director becomes ineligible, he also becomes ineligible to nominate. Refuting the said stand, it is canvassed by the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent that the ineligibility cannot extend to a nominee if he is not from the Corporation and more so when there is apposite and requisite disclosure. We think it appropriate to make it clear that in the case at hand we are neither concerned with the disclosure nor objectivity PNR,J & NBK,J nor impartiality nor any such other circumstance. We are singularly concerned with the issue, whether the Managing Director, after becoming ineligible by operation of law, is he still eligible to nominate an arbitrator. At the cost of repetition, we may state that when there are two parties, one may nominate an arbitrator and the other may appoint another. That is altogether a different situation. If there is a clause requiring the parties to nominate their respective arbitrator, their authority to nominate cannot be questioned. What really in that circumstance can be called in question is the procedural compliance and the eligibility of their arbitrator depending upon the norms provided under the Act and the Schedules appended thereto. But, here is a case where the Managing Director is the \"named sole arbitrator\" and he has also been conferred with the power to nominate one who can be the arbitrator in his place. Thus, there is subtle distinction.............\nxxx 53. The aforesaid authorities have been commended to us to establish the proposition that if the nomination of an arbitrator by an ineligible arbitrator is allowed, it would tantamount to carrying on the proceeding of arbitration by himself. According to the learned counsel for the appellant, ineligibility strikes at the root of his power to arbitrate or get it arbitrated upon by a nominee. \n54. In such a context, the fulcrum of the controversy would be, can an ineligible arbitrator, like the Managing Director, nominate an arbitrator, who may be otherwise eligible and a respectable person. As stated earlier, we are neither concerned with the objectivity nor the individual respectability. We are only concerned with the authority or the power of the Managing Director. By our analysis, we are obligated to arrive at the conclusion that once the arbitrator has become ineligible by operation of law, he cannot nominate another as an arbitrator. The arbitrator becomes ineligible as per prescription contained in Section 12(5) of the Act. It is inconceivable in law that person who is statutorily ineligible can nominate a person. Needless to say, once the infrastructure collapses, the superstructure is bound to collapse. One cannot have a building without the plinth. Or to put it differently, once the identity of the Managing Director as the sole arbitrator is lost, the power to nominate someone else as an arbitrator is obliterated. Therefore, the view expressed by the High Court is not sustainable and we say so.\" (emphasis supplied) \n25. Thus, the appointment of second respondent as arbitrator by the second appellant is ex-facie illegal. The second respondent becomes de-jure unable to perform his functions. Therefore, the Commercial Court rightly terminated the appointment of 2nd respondent as arbitrator. The issue is answered accordingly. \nPNR,J & NBK,J ISSUE NO.3:\n26. Further question is, as a consequences to declaration given by the commercial Court holding that appointment of second respondent as arbitrator is illegal whether the Commercial Court can substitute another arbitrator. \n27. The arbitration clause envisaged the Chairman and Managing Director or his nominee as the arbitrator. In view of Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996 and the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in TRF Limited (supra), the appointment of second respondent as arbitrator by Chairman and Managing Director is wholly illegal and second respondent becomes de-jure unable to perform as an arbitrator. After termination of mandate of second respondent as arbitrator, power to appoint another arbitrator, which is nothing but substitution of earlier arbitrator, is traceable to Section 14(1)(a) of the Act, 1996. Section 14(1)(a) clearly envisages substitution of arbitrator in place of earlier arbitrator where the earlier arbitrator became de-jure unable to function as arbitrator and his appointment is terminated. \n28. In Swadesh Kumar Agarwal vs. Dinesh Kumar Agarwal9, Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:\n\"21. Therefore, on a conjoint reading of Sections 13, 14 and 15 of the Act, if the challenge to the arbitrator is made on any of the grounds mentioned in Section 12 of the Act, the party aggrieved has to submit an appropriate application before the Arbitral Tribunal 9 (2022) 10 SCC 235 PNR,J & NBK,J itself. However, in case of any of the eventualities mentioned in Section 14(1)(a) of the 1996 Act and the mandate of the arbitrator is sought to be terminated on the ground that the sole arbitrator has become de jure and/or de facto unable to perform his functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay, the aggrieved party has to approach the \"court\" concerned as defined under Section 2(1)(e) of the 1996 Act. The court concerned has to adjudicate on whether, in fact, the sole arbitrator/arbitrators has/have become de jure and de facto unable to perform his/their functions or for other reasons he fails to act without undue delay. The reason why such a dispute is to be raised before the court is that eventualities mentioned in Section 14(1)(a) can be said to be a disqualification of the sole arbitrator and therefore, such a dispute/controversy will have to be adjudicated before the court concerned as provided under Section 14(2) of the 1996 Act. \n22. So far as the termination of the mandate of the arbitrator and/or termination of the proceedings mentioned in other provisions like in Section 15(1)(a) where he withdraws from office for any reason; or (b) by or pursuant to an agreement of the parties, the dispute need not be raised before the court concerned. For example, where the sole arbitrator himself withdraws from office for any reason or when both the parties agree to terminate the mandate of the arbitrator and for substitution of the arbitrator, thereafter, there is no further controversy as either the sole arbitrator himself has withdrawn from office and/or the parties themselves have agreed to terminate the mandate of the arbitrator and to substitute the arbitrator. Thus, there is no question of raising such a dispute before the court. Therefore, the legislation has deliberately provided that the dispute with respect to the termination of the mandate of the arbitrator under Section 14(1)(a) alone will have to be raised before the \"court\". Hence, whenever there is a dispute and/or controversy that the mandate of the arbitrator is to be terminated on the grounds mentioned in Section 14(1)(a), such a controversy/dispute has to be raised before the \"court\" concerned only and after the decision by the \"court\" concerned as defined under Section 2(1)(e) of the 1996 Act and ultimately it is held that the mandate of the arbitrator is terminated, thereafter, the arbitrator is to be substituted accordingly, that too, according to the rules that were applicable to the initial appointment of the arbitrator. Therefore, normally and generally, the same procedure is required to be followed which was followed at the time of appointment of the sole arbitrator whose mandate is terminated and/or who is replaced. \nxxxx 32.5. In a case where there is a dispute/controversy on the mandate of the arbitrator being terminated on the ground mentioned in Section 14(1)(a), such a dispute has to be raised before the \"court\", defined under Section 2(1)(e) of the 1996 Act and such a dispute cannot be decided on an application filed under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act.\"\n(emphasis supplied) PNR,J & NBK,J 29. The arbitration clause requires the CMD or his nominee to be an arbitrator which procedure is held to be illegal. The termination of arbitrator appointed by CMD is valid. Therefore, the CMD cannot appoint an arbitrator. Thus, only recourse is under Section 14(1)(a) of the Act, 1996 and the Court should appoint a substituted arbitrator. Further, there has been unreasonably long delay in resolving the dispute. In view of the same, we do not see any illegality in appointing another arbitrator in the place of 2nd respondent, which is nothing but substitution of earlier arbitrator whose mandate is terminated. Thus, following the above dicta, the Order of the Commercial Court is valid. The issue is answered accordingly. \n30. In view of the above findings, the Appeal fails. It is accordingly dismissed. No order as to costs. Pending Miscellaneous Applications if any shall stand closed. \n__________________________ P.NAVEEN RAO, J ___________________________ NAGESH BHEEMAPAKA,J Date: 28.04.2023 Kkm/ tvk PNR,J & NBK,J HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE P.NAVEEN RAO AND HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE NAGESH BHEEMAPAKA COMMERCIAL COURT APPEAL NO.13 OF 2023 Date: 28.04.2023 kkm",

[2.0] facts leading to the present first appeal in nut­shell are as under: [2.1] that the original plaintiff oil & natural gas corporation, vadodara instituted special civil suit no.426/1993 initially before the learned civil court for the recovery of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise with interest at the rate of 21% per annum from the date of filing of the suit till realization of the decreetal amount. that on establishment of the commercial court, vadodara, the aforesaid special civil suit no.426/1993 came to be transferred to the commercial court, vadodara which was numbered as commercial civil suit no.10/2016. [2.2] it was the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that the original defendant was in need of natural gas as fuel for its unit at naroda, ahmedabad and therefore, the original plaintiff and the original defendant executed a contract on 03.10.1985 at vadodara for the period of 5 years i.e. commencing with effect from 01.06.1986 to 31.05.1991 containing the terms and conditions, definitions and interpretations therein. as per the said agreement, the natural gas was to be supplied from the field of the original plaintiff to the unit of original defendant at hc-nic page 2 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 naroda, ahmedabad. that the defendant agreed to purchase 50,000 standard m3 of gas per day and it was also agreed that if the original defendant purchase the gas less than 45,000 standard m3 per day on any day, it shall have to pay to the original plaintiff for this minimum quantity. thus, quantity of 45,000 m3 of gas was termed as minimum guaranteed off­take for the each day. the price of the gas was to be charged and payable as provided in annexure­i to the agreement and according to that the price of 1000 m3 of gas delivered at the central gas metering station, shall be rs.2878.87 paise inclusive of royalty and exclusive of sales tax, duties, levies, cess, fees etc. as applicable and payable. it was also mentioned in the annexure­i of the said agreement that the price of the gas mentioned will automatically be adjusted and stand revised on pro­rata basis from the date of ex refinery price of furnace oil for non­fertilizer use charges which was considered as rs.2903.06 per kilo liter. it was also the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that as per annexure­i of the said agreement, the price agreed upon was subject to revision in accordance with the principles as may be laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in civil appeal no.8530/1983 filed by the ongc against the association of natural gas consuming industries of gujarat. in the said appeal, the hon'ble supreme court passed an interim order to recover price at rs.1000 per 1000 m3 for the gas supplied to those industries. it was the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that thereafter the issue of the price was decided by the mop, ng and by its notification dated 10.01.1987, the price of the gas was declared at rs.1400 per 1000 m3 of the gas at landfall points and for onshore gas was fixed. that the said price was exclusive of royalty, taxes, duties and other statutory levies and the said price was applicable with immediate effect from the date of the notification. [2.3] it was the case on behalf of the plaintiff that as provided in the hc-nic page 3 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 agreement dated 03.10.1985 the supply of gas was to be commenced from 01.06.1986, but due to certain reasons the said supply was not affected and the gas supply was started from 22.04.1989 and therefore, a new agreement was executed on 29.07.1988 between the parties, amending only certain clauses of the original contract and all other terms and conditions of the agreement dated 03.10.1985 remained unchanged. it was the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that when the supply of gas was started to the original defendant, the notification of the government of india, fixing the price of natural gas was in force and even the civil appeals pending before the hon'ble supreme court were also not decided and therefore, the original defendant made the payment of the gas supplied to them at the price fixed by the government. according to the original plaintiff it was clearly provided in the notification that for expired contract between the ongc and the consumer with specified price, the consumers will have to pay the price mentioned in the agreement and price notified in the notification will be applicable on expiry of the said contract / agreement. [2.4] according to the original plaintiff, on 04.05.1990 the hon'ble supreme court delivered the verdict in civil appeal no.8530/1983 and other civil appeals and upheld the right of the ongc to fix the price and also upheld that for fixing the price the ongc can also consider the price of the furnace oil. that according to the original plaintiff, therefore the original plaintiff was entitled to charge the price of gas as mentioned in the agreement dated 03.10.1985 and the original defendant was also required to make payment of the gas at the price agreed in the said agreement. it was the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that despite number of telex messages and the communication dated 23.08.1990 to the original defendant to make the payment at the contractual rates and also informed regarding the outstanding huge amount because of hc-nic page 4 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 difference in the government rates and the contractual rates, but the original defendant neglected their request to make the payment. therefore, the plaintiff instituted the aforesaid suit for recovery of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise (to recover rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise towards amount of difference between the contractual price and the actual payment made by the original defendant and rs.3,94,60,185.53 paise towards amount of interest at the rate of 21% from the original defendant). [2.5] the suit was resisted by the original defendant by filing the written statement at exh.22. it was the case on behalf of the original defendant that the suit for recovery in respect of the amount alleged to be due was barred by law of limitation. [2.6] it was the case on behalf of the original defendant that as per the contract the original plaintiff was to start the gas supply from 01.06.1986, but plaintiff did not supply the gas to the original defendant from the said date and thereby committed breach of fundamental terms thereof. it was also contended on behalf of the original defendant that as the original plaintiff commenced the supply of natural gas to the original defendant on 22.04.1989 and on that day the notification dated 31.01.1987 issued by the government of india was in force, the price of the natural gas chargeable from the original defendant to the original plaintiff and payable to the original plaintiff by the original defendant was rs.1400 for 1000 standard m3. it was also denied by the original defendant that under the new agreement dated 30.07.1988, the provisions relating to price contained in the said original contract or unamended agreement dated 03.10.1987 remained unchanged. it was contended that the jurisdiction to fix the prices of the natural gas came to be vested in or exercised by the government of india from 30.01.1987 hc-nic page 5 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 and therefore, no power, authority or jurisdiction vested in the original plaintiff to charge or recover with effect from 30.01.1987 or in respect of natural gas supplied from 30.01.1987, any price other than that fixed by the government of india by the said notification dated 30.01.1987 and which may be fixed thereafter by the government of india from time to time. therefore, it was contended on behalf of the original defendant that as the plaintiff started supplying gas to the original defendant with effect from 22.04.1989, the original defendant was liable to pay the price for supply of natural gas as per the notification dated 30.01.1987 only and therefore, the only price which the original plaintiff could charge or recover from the consumer including the original defendant was as per the notification dated 30.01.1987 issued by the government of india. the original defendant also disputed the liability to pay the interest on the delayed payment. therefore, it was requested to dismiss the suit. [2.7] that the learned trial court framed the following issues at exh.25. 1. whether the plaintiff proves that he is entitled to get relief prays for? 2. whether the plaintiff proves that he is entitled to get interest as prays for ? 3. whether the defendant proves that the plaintiff's suit is barred by the provisions of the limitation act ? 4. what order and decree ?

[2.10] that after considering the submissions made by the learned counsel for respective parties and on appreciation of evidence, both oral as well as documentary the learned commercial court has held that the original defendant is liable to pay the price for the natural gas supplied as per the original contract entered into between the parties and as per the specified terms and conditions mentioned in the hc-nic page 9 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 contract/agreement entered into between the parties and the price fixed as per the said government of india notification dated 30.01.1987 shall not be applicable with respect to the unexpired contracts / agreements. the learned commercial court also held that the suit filed by the original plaintiff is not barred by law of limitation as contended on behalf of the original defendant. that, by impugned judgment and decree the learned commercial court has partly decreed the suit and has passed a decree of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise, however with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of filing of the suit till the date of decree and 9% per annum from the date of decree till realization of the amount. [2.11] feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned commercial court, vadodara the original defendant has preferred the present first appeal. [3.0] shri mihir thakore, learned senior advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant and shri ajay mehta, learned advocate, who is on caveat, has appeared on behalf of the respondent herein original plaintiff. record & proceedings of the case is received from the learned commercial court. learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant has also placed on record separate paper­book. [4.0] shri mihir thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case the learned commercial court has materially erred in decreeing the suit. [4.1] it is vehemently submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the learned hc-nic page 10 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 commercial court has materially erred in holding that the original defendant is liable to pay the price for supply of natural gas as per the original contract and not as per the notification issued by the government of india dated 30.01.1987. [4.2] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that admittedly as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985 the ongc was required to supply the natural gas at the price mentioned in the said agreement from 01.06.1986. however the plaintiff did not start the supply of gas as per the agreement dated 03.10.1985 and gas supply was started from 22.04.1989. it is submitted that in the meantime the government of india determined the price for supply of gas vide notification dated 30.01.1987 to be supplied at the rate of rs.1400 and therefore, the ongc could have charged for supply of gas at the rate of rs.1400 only and therefore, the original defendant was liable to pay the price for supply of gas at rs.1400/­ for 1000 standard m3 only, which the original defendant paid. it is submitted that therefore the learned commercial court as such ought not to have decreed the suit. [4.3] it is submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the learned commercial court has materially erred in not properly appreciating the fact that the original contract dated 03.10.1985 (exh.40) never came into effect or commenced, since ongc did not commence supply of gas from 01.06.1986. it is submitted that even the ongc did not commence supply of gas until much after the price order dated 30.01.1987 (exh.57). it is submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that therefore as such the original contract / agreement did not come into effect, more particularly hc-nic page 11 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 when the price order dated 30.01.1987 was issued. it is submitted that therefore, the original contract could not have been termed as an \"unexpired contract\" as on the date of the price order dated 30.01.1987. it is submitted that therefore clause 4 of the price order shall not be applicable to the present case and the gas price would be governed by the price order. [4.4] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that as such the intent and purpose of the clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987 was only to allow ongc to charge the contractual price where it was already supplying gas under a contract which was already in effect. it is submitted that intention behind the aforesaid clause in the price order dated 30.01.1987 was to allow ongc to complete its contracts which were in the course of being performed at the time of issuance of the price order. it is submitted that in the present case the original contract was not in effect as on the date of the price order dated 30.01.1987 and therefore, it would be de hors the intent and purpose of the price order dated 30.01.1987 to allow ongc to charge any price over and above the government of india fixed price in respect of the supplies made under a contract which did not come into effect until much after the said price order. it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the term \"unexpired contracts\" in the context in which it has been placed in clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987 has to mean only those contracts which were, as on 30.01.1987, being performed or in other words under performance or in the course of the performance and some period of performance was still remaining to be completed. it is submitted that the words \"unexpired contracts\" cannot refer to the period remaining in the total period of contract even when such contract and its performance hc-nic page 12 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 had actually not commenced. [4.5] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that even otherwise in view of and by virtue of the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988, original contract cannot be said to have been in existence and/or the same was not to be acted upon. it is submitted that the original contract executed was for the sole purpose of supplying natural gas by ongc to the original defendant from the field ramol baola and in the manner stipulated therein. it is submitted that consideration for the same was the price payable to ongc by the original defendant in terms of clause 10 read with annexure­i thereto. that the gas price in the original contract was mutually agreed upon as consideration for the duration, place and manner of supply of gas under the original contract and the said gas price agreed upon cannot be delinked from what it stood for in the original contract. it is submitted that by virtue of the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988 (exh.39), the terms of the original contract underwent substantial and fundamental changes going to the root of the contract. it is submitted that as per the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988 (exh.39), (a) duration of supply of gas, i.e., instead of supply commencing from 01.06.1986, it was to commence from 31.12.1988, and by virtue of this change, more than 2 and 1⁄2 years of gas supply got canceled; (b) the gas field from which gas was to be supplied underwent a complete change, i.e. from ramol baola field, it was changed to kalol field; (c) the manner and place of delivery of gas changed, by virtue of which the passing of the title to the gas would get altered; (d) the provisions regarding gas transportation were changed. it is submitted that therefore considering section 62 of the indian contract act, on account of alteration or substitution in the original contract, the original contract does not continue or remain in existence any more and hc-nic page 13 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 need not be performed and therefore, the original contract could not have been said to be an \"unexpired contract\" as contained in clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987. it is submitted that therefore clause 4 of price order dated 30.01.1987 which applies only to \"unexpired contract\", would not apply in the present case, once the original contract got substituted or altered. [4.6] it is submitted that therefore the learned judge has materially erred in treating the term \"unexpired contracts\" as meaning \"contracts in existence\" and in holding, in effect, that the contracts which were merely in existence by virtue of their having been signed by the parties, even though not in effect and not being performed, were to be neglected within clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987. it is submitted that therefore, the learned commercial court has materially erred in not properly appreciating the applicability of principle of section 62 of the indian contract act and hence, has failed to appreciate that, when a contract is substantially and fundamentally altered, it is a case of novation and the original contract cannot be treated as valid and existing. [4.7] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that even otherwise part of the plaintiff's claim was clearly barred by law of limitation. it is submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the suit was filed on 02.05.1993 in regard to a claim in respect of the gas supply period from 22.04.1989 to 31.05.1991. it is submitted that the invoices in respect to the said period were issued from 13.05.1989 to 04.06.1991 (exh.70 to exh.100). it is submitted that as per the terms of the contracts the payment was to be made within 10 days of the receipt of the said invoices. it is submitted hc-nic page 14 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 that as such the learned commercial court has rightly held that article 15 of the limitation act would not apply to the claim, as there was no stay or injunction against the original plaintiff restraining it from instituting the suit. it is submitted that therefore as on the date of the suit i.e. as on 02.05.1993, all the invoices issued prior to 22.04.1990 were certainly barred by limitation. it is submitted that therefore the invoices from exh.70 to exh.83 were clearly time barred. [4.8] it is vehemently submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the learned commercial court has materially erred in holding that the extension of bank guarantee on 03.08.1990 and the letter dated 17.08.1990 amounts to acknowledgment of liability in writing by the original defendant and therefore, would extend the period of limitation. [4.9] it is vehemently submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the learned commercial court has overlooked the fact that section 18 of the limitation act which pertains to extension of limitation on account of the acknowledgment would not apply in the present case. it is submitted that section 18 of the limitation act would apply only if there is an \"acknowledgment of liability\" in respect of any property and right. it is submitted that an \"acknowledgment of liability\" means a conscious admission of a jural relationship between parties and a subsisting liability (of the person making such acknowledgment) flowing from the same. moreover, such acknowledgment or liability has to be made in writing, signed by the party against whom the right is claimed or by an agent duly authorized in this behalf. in support of his above submission, shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant has relied on the hc-nic page 15 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of krishnappa chettiar v. somiali reported in air 1964 sc 227 (para 14) and in the case of tilak ram vs. nathu reported in air 1967 sc 935 (para 10) and in the case of state of kerala vs. t.m. chacko reported in (2000) 9 scc 722 (para 10). [4.10] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that insofar as the bank guarantee on 03.08.1990 (exh.113) is concerned, it was issued under specific terms of the contract which required issuance of a bank guarantee and hence, (1) it cannot constitute an \"acknowledgment of liability\", (2) if the said bank guarantee is perused, it, in fact, does not contain any \"acknowledgment of liability\", (3) it was issued guaranteeing payment in respect of 62 days of gas supply and not for the full contract and hence, it cannot constitute \"acknowledgment of liability\" in regard to the full claim under the contract, (4) it was issued by syndicate bank (guarantor) to the original plaintiff on a principle to principle basis and is recognized in law as an independent contract and therefore, it is not an acknowledgment of liability made in writing and signed by the original defendant or its agent duly authorized in this behalf. in light of the aforesaid it is submitted that the said bank guarantee cannot extend the period of limitation. [4.11] now, so far as the letter dated 17.08.1990 (exh.114) is concerned, it is submitted that it only encloses the bank guarantees to be sent to the original plaintiff and does not contain any \"acknowledgment of liability\" and it is not issued by any person authorized on behalf of the original defendant to issue an \"acknowledgment of liability\" and hence, it is submitted that it does not contain any words which can be considered as an \"acknowledgment of hc-nic page 16 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 liability\". it is submitted that the said letter is still not an acknowledgment of liability made by the original defendant or its agent duly authorized in this behalf. [4.12] shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant has further submitted that it is not the case (as pleaded or as proved) of the original plaintiff that any documents on record constitutes an acknowledgment of liability or that the period of limitation got extended under section 18 of the limitation act. it is submitted that therefore the learned commercial court could not have arrived at such a finding which was not supported by pleadings and evidence. [4.13] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that even the learned commercial court has materially erred in awarding the interest at the rate of 21% per annum till the date of the suit even though no evidence was led in this regard by the original plaintiff. it is submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the principal sum claimed was rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise and the total claim of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise is made in the suit inclusive of interest at the rate of 21% per annum on the principal sum of rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise. [4.14] it is submitted that as per clause 11.02 of the original contract (exh.40), the original defendant was required to pay the interest on delayed payment at the rate of 1% higher than the rate of interest payable by the original plaintiff on its cash credit agreement with state bank of india from time to time. it is submitted that however the original plaintiff had not led any evidence as to what was the rate of interest chargeable by state bank of india. hc-nic page 17 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 [4.15] it is submitted that therefore the learned commercial court has materially erred in awarding interest at the rate of 21% till the filing of the suit, as claimed by the original plaintiff. it is submitted that as such the court has no jurisdiction to award pre­suit interest. it is submitted that in any case, even assuming without admitting the court has jurisdiction to award pre­suit interest even though as no evidence was led, the pre­suit interest awarded by the learned commercial court is grossly excessive. [4.16] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that even otherwise the learned commercial court has materially erred in awarding the interest on interest. [4.17] it is vehemently submitted that section 34 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 confers jurisdiction on the court to only award the interest on the principal sum adjudged and not interest on interest. it is submitted that in the present case the principal sum claimed was rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise and the total claim of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise as made in the suit was inclusive of the interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the principal sum of rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise. it is submitted that as such there was no provision in the original contract or the contract 29.07.1988 for capitalization interest so as to make it part of the principal sum. it is submitted that therefore the learned commercial court has materially erred in awarding interest on interest more particularly interest on rs.3,94,60,185.53 paise. making above submissions and relying upon the above decisions, it is requested to allow the present appeal. [5.0] present first appeal is vehemently opposed by shri ajay mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff. hc-nic page 18 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 [5.1] it is submitted by shri mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned commercial court has not committed any error in decreeing the suit (partly). it is submitted that the finding recorded by the learned commercial court that the original defendant is liable to pay the price for supply of gas as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985 and that the original contract dated 03.10.1985 can be said to be \"unexpired contracts\" and therefore, considering clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987, the price mentioned in the government notification price order dated 30.01.1987 shall not be applicable, is based on appreciation of evidence more particularly on interpretation of the documentary evidence on record more particularly the original contract dated 03.10.1985 (exh.40); the government notification / price order dated 30.01.1987 and the modified contract dated 29.07.1998. it is submitted that therefore, finding recorded by the learned commercial court cannot be said to be either perverse and/or contrary to the evidence on record. [5.2] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that the learned commercial court has rightly directed the original defendant to pay the price for the gas supplied as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985. it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that even the learned commercial court has rightly decreed the suit by awarding the interest (pre­suit) at the rate of 21%. it is submitted that awarding the interest at the rate of 21% at pre­suit is absolutely in consonance with the terms and conditions of the original contract dated 03.10.1985. it is submitted that as such the original defendant never disputed before the learned commercial court that the rate of interest at the rate of 21% would be 1% more than the rate of hc-nic page 19 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 interest charged by the state bank of india. it is submitted that when there were specific pleadings in the suit claiming the interest at the rate of 21% for pre­suit period and the same was not disputed and/or denied by the original defendant and/or no other contrary evidence was led, the learned commercial court has rightly awarded the interest at the rate of 21% for pre­suit period. [5.3] it is vehemently submitted by shri mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned commercial court has rightly held the suit within the period of limitation. it is submitted that the learned commercial court has rightly held that the suit is not barred by law of limitation as contended on behalf of the original defendant. [5.4] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that in the facts and circumstances of the case the learned commercial court has not committed any error in awarding the interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of filing of the suit till the judgment and decree and at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of judgment and decree till the realization of the amount. making above submissions, it is requested to dismiss the present first appeal. [6.0] heard learned counsel appearing for respective parties at length. we have perused and considered the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned commercial court. we have also re­appreciated the entire evidence on record from the record & proceedings received from the learned commercial court as well as from the paper­book produced by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant. hc-nic page 20 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 [6.1] the main dispute between the original plaintiff and the original defendant is whether the original plaintiff is entitled to recover and/or whether the original defendant is liable to pay the price for supply of natural gas at the rate of rs.2903.06 per 100 standard m3 as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985 (exh.40) or as per the price order / government of india notification dated 30.01.1987 (exh.57). it is not in dispute that as per the contract / agreement executed between the original plaintiff and original defendant (exh.40) the price for supply of natural gas was fixed at rs.2903.06 paise per kilo liter. as per clause 2.01 of the original contract dated 03.10.1985 the contract shall commence into force from 01.06.1986 i.e. the date of commencement of supply of gas and the validity period was 5 years ending upto 31.05.1991. however, subsequently, the government of india issued the notification / price order dated 30.01.1987 determining the price for supply of natural gas on rs.1400 per kilo liter. however, as per clause 4 the determination of price as per the price order / notification dated 30.01.1987 shall not be applicable to the \"unexpired contracts\". clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987 reads as under: \"4. there are some unexpired contracts between ongc / oil and some consumers with specified prices. these contracts will have to run their course and the prices now fixed will apply after the contract period expires.\" it is true that as per the original contract the date of commencement of the supply was 01.06.1986 (as per clause 2.01 of the original contract). it is also true that there was no supply of gas from 01.06.1986 and infact the supply of gas started from 22.04.1989. however, it is required to be noted that some terms and conditions mentioned in the original contract dated 03.10.1985 came to be modified / substituted by the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988 and hc-nic page 21 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 in article 2.01 the words i.e. \"date of commencement of supply\" was substituted by \"gas supply shall commence from 31.12.1988\". there were other some changes in para 2. therefore, it is the case on behalf of the original defendant that in view of the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988, the original contract dated 03.10.1985 was not acted upon and there was no supply of gas even on the date of on which the price order dated 30.01.1987 was issued by the government of india and therefore, it cannot be said that the original contract was unexpired contract as per clause 4 of the price order and therefore, the original defendant was liable to pay the price for supply of natural gas at the rate of rs.1400 per 1000 standard m3 as per the price order dated 30.01.1987. it is also the case on behalf of the original defendant that considering section 62 of the indian contract act there was novation of contract more particularly in view of the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988 and therefore, the original contract / agreement was not to be acted upon and therefore, it cannot be said to be a continued contract more particularly at the time when the price order dated 30.01.1987 was issued by the government of india. the aforesaid submission seems to be attractive but has no substance. at the outset it is required to be noted that by the subsequent contract executed on 29.07.1988 it cannot be said that a new contract came into existence and/or the original contract (exh.40) came to be an end and/or was not to be acted upon. by the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988, some of the terms and conditions only came to be substituted and the rest of the terms and conditions mentioned in the original contract continued to operate. in para 12 of the subsequent agreement / contract dated 29.07.1988, it is specifically mentioned that the amendment in the contract dated 29.07.1988 shall form part of the original contract dated 03.10.1985 and that all other terms and hc-nic page 22 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 conditions of the contract dated 03.10.1985 shall remain unchanged and binding on the parties. clause 12 of the contract dated 29.07.1988 reads as under: \"12. the above amendment shall form part of the contract dated 3rd day of october, one thousand nine hundred and eighty five and all other terms and conditions of the contract dated 3rd day of october, one thousand nine hundred and eighty five shall remain unchanged and binding on the parties.\" in light of the above it cannot be said that the case will fall under section 62 of the indian contract act and it cannot be said that there was novation of the original contract, in light of the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988 as sought to be contended on behalf of the original defendant. [6.2] under the circumstances, it cannot be said that the original contract / agreement dated 03.10.1985 shall come to an end and/or was not to be acted upon and/or the same can be said to be a fresh agreement / contract. under the circumstances, as on 30.01.1987, i.e. when the price order came to be issued by the government of india the original contract / agreement can be said to be \"unexpired agreement / contract\" and therefore, as per clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987, the price determined / mentioned in the price order shall not affect the price mentioned in the original contract dated 03.10.1985 and therefore, the original defendant was liable to pay the price for supply of gas as per the original contract / agreement dated 03.10.1985 and the parties shall be governed by the original contract dated 03.10.1985. [6.3] now, so far as the submission on behalf of the original defendant that as, as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985, the date of commencement of supply was 01.06.1986 and admittedly the gas supply hc-nic page 23 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 was commenced much later i.e. on 22.04.1989 after two years of the price order dated 30.01.1987 and the ongc did not start supplying gas on 31.12.1988 (as per the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988) and therefore, there was a breach of the terms of the original contract and the submission on behalf of the appellant that as the day on which the price order was issued on 30.01.1987, there was no supply of natural gas and consequently the contract was not performed and therefore, the original contract cannot be said to be \"unexpired contracts\" is concerned, the aforesaid has no substance. as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985 more particularly clause 2.01, the period of contract mentioned is for a period of 5 years commencing from 01.06.1986 ending upto 31.05.1991. therefore, as per clause 2.01, the contract shall come into force from 01.06.1986, which was the date of commencement of the supply of gas and shall remain in force over a period of 5 years ending upto 31.05.1991. as per the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988, the date of commencement of supply of gas was substituted from 01.06.1986 to 31.12.1988. clause 4 of the price order, which is reproduced hereinabove, provides that the prices mentioned in the said price order / notification shall be applicable after existing contract period expires. if the submission on behalf of the original defendant as mentioned hereinabove is accepted, it would be adding something in para 4 of the price order, which is not there. under the circumstances, contract / agreement executed between the original plaintiff and the original defendant can be said to be \"unexpired contracts\" within clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987 and therefore, the price determined / mentioned in the price order dated 30.01.1987 shall not be applicable with respect to the contract dated 03.10.1985 and the original defendant is liable to pay the supply of natural gas at the rate mentioned in the original contract / agreement dated 03.10.1985. under the circumstances, no error has been hc-nic page 24 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 committed by the learned commercial court in holding so more particularly in holding that the original defendant is liable to pay the price or supply of gas as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985 and not as per the price order dated 30.01.1987. we are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned commercial court. [6.4] now, so far as the submission on behalf of the original defendant that part of the ongc's claim was barred by law of limitation more particularly the invoices from exh.70 to exh.83 were time barred is concerned, it is required to be noted that applying section 18 of the limitation act, which pertains to extension period of limitation on account of acknowledgment, the learned commercial court has held the claim in the suit within the period of limitation. while applying section 18 of the limitation act and holding that the suit claim is within the period of limitation, the learned commercial court has considered the extension of bank guarantee/s which were furnished as per the original contract and/or subsequent contract, as an acknowledgment of the dues and therefore, considering the date of extension of bank guarantee as an acknowledgment of the dues, applying section 18 of the limitation act, the learned commercial court has held the suit within the period of limitation. while deciding the issue with respect to the limitation and while dealing with issue no.3, the learned commercial court has observed in paras 17 and 18 as under: \"17. i have considered the rival submissions of the ld. counsel for the parties. the plaintiff herein claimed payment of bills with effect from the date of 13/05/1989 till 04/06/1991. admittedly, the suit has been instituted on 03/05/1993. now the question arises as to whether the cause of action to file the present suit arose when the hon'ble supreme court declared the judgment in civil appeal no. 8530/1983 on 4.5.1990. at this juncture, it would not be out of context (at the cost of repetition) to refer the clauses of annexrue ­i of the agreement­contract at exh. 40. hc-nic page 25 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 pricing \"1. the price of 1000 (one thousand only ) standard cubic meters of gas delivered at the central gas metering station / sub station located in the seller's premises shall be 2878.87. (rupees two thousand eight seventy eight and paise eighty seven only). 2. the price of the gas mentioned above will automatically be adjusted and stand revised on pro­rata basis from the date of the ex. refinery price of furnace oil considred is rs. 2903.06 per kl as advised by the govt. of india. 3. the price now agreed upon is subject to the revision in accordance with the principle as may be laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in civil appeal no. 8530/83 ongc vs association of natural gas consuming industries of gujarat and others pending disposal before the supreme court.\" 17.1 considering all the three clauses, it is apparent that the price of the gas was already fixed by the parties and the said price had to be adjusted in accordance to the judgment in civil appeal no. 8530/83. meaning thereby, if the price fixed between the parties is higher than the price approved by the hon'ble supreme court in the aforesaid appeal, then defendant to to made to additional payment to the plaintiff on account of differential amount but if the hon'ble suprreme court determined the price below the price fixed by the contract, than plaintiff has to made the adjustment of the excess amount paid by the defendant. thus, the judgment of the hon'ble supreme court has nothing to do with the right of the plaintiff to recover the price of the gas in accordance to the aforesaid clause 1 of the annexure. thus, the cause of action had arisen in the favour since the date of each bill and not from the date of pronouncement of the judgment of the hon'ble apex court on 4.5.1990. 17.2 as far the plea as to whether in the present case, the article 1 or the article 15 the limitation act shall be applicable is concerned, the plaintiff has not filed any statement of account on records, however, the suit has been instituted on the basis of the bills/ invoces placed on paper book at exh 70 to 101. article 1 of the limitation act applies in the cases where the parties maintained the running account, therefore, in the present case, article 1 of the limitation act is not applicable. as per agreement, the period of credit was 10 days to make the payment of the amount due and payable under the invoices. article 15 deals with the cases where the goods sold on credit. as per article 15 of the limitation act, the period of limitation in respect of payment due against the bills is 3 (three) years from the date of period of credit expires. the article 15 of the limitation act is hc-nic page 26 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 reproduced herein for the sake of convenience. description of suit period of time from which period limitation begins to run 15. for the price of three years when the period of goods sold and credit expires, delivered to be paid for after the expiry of a fixed period of credit 17.3 in the present case, the clause 11.01 deals with the period of credit. the same is reproduced herein. \"11.01. the seller shall issue and send to the buyer invoices covering the total quantity of gas delivered by the seller in accordance with relevant provisions of this contract during each fortnight for payment. the buyer shall pay in full within ten (10) days of the receipt of such invoices the amount so mentioned in such invoices. for this purpose the fortnight would commence at 0700 hours of first (1st) day to 0700 hours of sixteenth (16th) day and 0700 hours of sixteenth (16th) day to 0700 hours of 1st day of the succeeding calender month. in case there is any dispute regarding billing the buyer shall not withhold payment. after making full payment, the buyer shall lodge the claims to the seller giving full particulars within a period of fourteen days (14) from the date of making the payment, and such claims if found correct, the seller shall adjust against the next invoice of supply of gas. no interest shall accrue on such refunds by the seller to the buyer.\" the perusal of the aforesaid clause of the agreement at exh. 40 clearly transpires that the period of credit was 10 days. the case of the plaintiff falls under article 15 of the limitation act. i have also considered the judgment of the hon'ble madaras high court in the case of a. l. a. r. r. m arunachallam chetti (supra), wherein the hon'ble court held that in ordinary suit upon accounts the limitation period to recover the money is three years. 18. in the present case, the defendant had also furnished the bank guarantee at exh.101, in pursuance to the terms and conditions of the agreement­contract at exh. 40, for a sum of rs. 89,24,497/­ . the said bank guarantee was extended by the defendant time to time and lastly extended on 03.08.1990 vide exh. 113. not only this, the defendant sent the said extension of bank guarantee to the plaintiff alongwith the letter dated 17.08.1990 at exh. 114. the said extension of bank guarantee took place within the period of hc-nic page 27 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 limitation at the behest of the defendant. thus, in view of section 18 of the limitation act, said extension of bank guarantee and letter dated 17.08.1990 at exh. 114 amounts the acknowledgement of liability in writing by the defendant with in the period of limitation, therefore it extend the period of limitation. thus, i am of the considered view that the suit of the plaintiff is not barred by limitation. thus, the present issue is decided against the defendant and in favour of the plaintiff.\" [6.5] from the aforesaid it appears that extension of bank gurarantee on 03.08.1990 (exh.113) is considered to be the \"acknowledgment of liability\" in writing by the original defendant. there the learned commercial court has committed an error. the extension of bank guarantee which was furnished earlier as per the original contract, subsequently after the validity period of the bank guarantee had expired, by no stretch of imagination can be said to be \"acknowledgment of the liability\" in writing by the original defendant. extension of the original bank guarantee which was initially furnished as per the original contract cannot be said to be \"acknowledgment of the liability\" and it will not extend the period of limitation as per section 18 of the limitation act. therefore, we are of the opinion that the learned commercial court has committed a grave error in applying section 18 of the limitation act treating and/or considering the extension of the bank guarantee on 03.08.1990 as an \"acknowledgment of the liability\" in writing by the original defendant and in holding the suit claim within the period of limitation and consequently has materially erred in holding that the suit of the plaintiff is not barred by limitation. [6.6] as observed by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of tilak ram vs. nathu reported in air 1967 sc 935 (1), mere statement expressing jural relationship between the parties does not constitute acknowledgment. therefore, the extension of the bank guarantee hc-nic page 28 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 cannot be said to be one made with intention of admitting the jural relationship and/or acknowledging the debt. in the case of state of kerala vs. t.m. chacko reported in (2000) 9 scc 722 while considering the scope and ambit of section 18 of the limitation act and while considering the issue with respect to acknowledgment vis­a­vis section 18 of the limitation act, it is observed by the hon'ble supreme court in para 10 as under: \"10. it may be noted that for treating a writing signed by the party as an acknowledgment, the person acknowledging must be conscious of his liability and the commitment should be made towards that liability. it need not be specific but if necessary facts which constitute the liability are admitted an acknowledgment may be inferred from such an admission.\" [6.7] it is the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that as the dispute with respect to the pricing was pending before the hon'ble supreme court in civil appeal no.8530/1983 and therefore, the cause of action to file the suit can be said to have arisen when the hon'ble supreme court declared the judgment in civil appeal no.8530/1983 on 04.05.1990 which was in favour of the ongc and therefore, the suit can be said to be within the period of limitation. however, the aforesaid is not accepted by the learned commercial court by observing that considering section 15 of the limitation act, as there was no injunction restraining the original plaintiff from filing the suit for recovery, the original plaintiff cannot get the benefit of the dispute pending before the hon'ble supreme court. however, it is required to be noted that while deciding the issue with respect to limitation, what has been mainly weighed with the learned commercial court is the extension of bank guarantee and treating the extension of bank guarantee as \"acknowledgment of liability\" in writing by the original defendant within the period of limitation and applying section 18 of the limitation act, the learned commercial court has decided the issue of limitation in favour of the hc-nic page 29 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 original plaintiff and against the original defendant. no other discussion is there with respect to the case on behalf of the original defendant that claim with respect to some of the invoices more particularly invoice at exh.70 to exh.83 were barred by limitation, more particularly considering specific terms and conditions of the original contract dated 03.10.1985, that the payment was required to be made within a period of 10 days from the date of issuance of the invoices. under the circumstances, while quashing and setting aside the finding recorded by the learned commercial court on the issue of limitation, the matter is required to be remanded to the learned commercial court to consider the issue with respect to the limitation afresh and in accordance with law and on merits and on the basis of the evidence already led. therefore, the finding recorded by the learned commercial court holding the issue with respect to the limitation in favour of the original plaintiff deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside and the matter is remanded to the learned commercial court to decide the issue with respect to the limitation afresh in accordance with law and on merits and on the basis of the evidence already led. [6.8] now, so far as the submission on behalf of the original defendant that the learned commercial court has materially erred in awarding interest at the rate of 21% per annum for the pre­suit period is concerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that as per the terms and conditions mentioned in original contract dated 03.10.1985, on delayed payment the ongc was entitled to the interest at the rate of 1% higher than the rate of interest payable by the ongc on its cash credit agreement with the state bank of india from time to time. clause 11.02 of the contract / agreement reads as under: \"11.02 the buyer shall pay interest on all delayed payments at the hc-nic page 30 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 rate of one percent (1%) higher than the rate of interest payable by the seller on its cash credit arrangement with the state bank of india from time to time. delayed payment means any payment not received within the period provided in clause 11.01 above. the right of seller will be independent to the right as per clause 11.04 hereinabove.\" [6.9] in the examination in chief the witness examined on behalf of the original plaintiff has specifically deposed that as per clause 11.02 of the agreement, the original plaintiff is also entitled for interest on all the delayed payment @ 1% over and above the rate of interest payable by the ongc on its cash credit agreement with the state bank of india and that the original plaintiff has calculated the interest on the principal amount till the date of filing the suit. no question is asked by the original defendant in the cross. even in the written statement also there is no specific denial with respect to the charging of the interest for the pre­suit period, at the rate of 21% as claimed by the original plaintiff. under the circumstances and in the facts and circumstances of the case and more particularly, considering the evidence on record, it cannot be said that the learned commercial court has committed any error in allowing the claim of the original plaintiff claiming interest at the rate of 21% per annum i.e. at the rate of 1% over and above the interest payable by the ongc on its cash credit agreement with the state bank of india for pre­suit period. under the circumstances, the learned commercial court has rightly decreed the suit awarding the interest on the delayed payment for the pre­suit period as claimed by the original plaintiff. [6.10] now, so far as awarding interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of suit till the judgment and decree and at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of passing the decree till the amount is realized on the entire amount of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise is concerned, hc-nic page 31 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant is justified in making a grievance that the learned commercial court ought not to have awarded the interest on interest. it is required to be noted that in the suit the claim of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise was bifurcated into two parts i.e. rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise towards amount of difference between the contractual price and the actual payment made by the original defendant and rs.3,94,60,185.53 paise towards amount of interest at the rate of 21% from the original defendant and therefore, considering section 34 of the code of civil procedure, 1908, the learned commercial court has committed an error in awarding interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the entire amount of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise. considering section 34 of the code of civil procedure, 1908, the learned commercial court ought to have awarded the interest at the rate of 12% per annum only on the principal sum of rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise towards amount of difference between the contractual price and the actual payment made by the original defendant only. to the aforesaid extent, the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned commercial court is required to be modified. [7.0] in view of the above and for the reasons stated above, present first appeal succeeds in part. impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned commercial court, vadodara insofar as holding that the party shall be governed by original contract dated 03.10.1985 (exh.40) and that the original defendant is liable to pay price for supply of natural gas at the rate mentioned in the original contract dated 03.10.1985 and not as per the price order dated 30.01.1987 treating the original contract / agreement as \"unexpired contracts\" is hereby confirmed. however, for the reasons stated above, the finding recorded by the learned commercial court on the issue of limitation is hereby quashed and set aside and the matter is remanded to the learned hc-nic page 32 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 commercial court, vadodara to consider the issue with respect to limitation afresh in accordance with law and on merits and on the basis of the evidence already led. for the reasons stated above the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned commercial court awarding the interest at the rate of 21% per annum on the delayed payment for pre­suit period is hereby confirmed. for the reasons stated above, the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned commercial court, vadodara awarding interest at the rate of 12% from the date of filing of the suit till the date of the decree, on the entire amount of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise is hereby modified to the extent and it is held that the original plaintiff shall be entitled to the interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the principal sum of rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise. present first appeal is partly allowed to the aforesaid extent. in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs. civil application no.3091/2017 in view of disposal of main first appeal, civil application no.3091/2017 also stands disposed of. sd/­ (m.r. shah, j.) sd/­ (b.n. karia, j.) ajay hc-nic page 33 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017"
