The brief facts of the case which are required to be enumerated, reads hereunder as :-\nThe Government of Jharkhand intended to provide convenient and speedy Government Services to the citizens, using Information and Technologies Communication through Common Services Centers (CSCs). The CSCs will be utilized as efficient distribution channels through which the Government of Jharkhand can offer its services, information and schemes etc. to citizens in a cost effective, sustainable and efficient manner. To undertake the delivery of Government Services on a Public Private Partnership basis, the Government of Jharkhand intends to appoint Service Centre Agencies (SCAs) to roll out and manage the CSCs in the State of Jharkhand and offer revenue support to the Scas, as mutually agreed and accepted by the State Designated Agency (Sda) through the SCA's Financial Bid. \nTherefore for the purpose of providing the said services, such as issuance and preparation of Aadhar Card, Voter Id, Caste Certificates, residential certificates etc., the Sca was required to be engaged for the setting up such CSCs, at least one Csc in a Panchayat, in the different districts / division of the State. The Common Services Centers are also known as Pragya Kendra. \nTherefore, a tender for rolling out and operation of around 4500 Common Service Centres in 5 divisions of the State of Jharkhand was floated. Accordingly, M/s Alternative For India Development, respondent herein, submitted its technical and commercial bid for 600 CSCs in Palamau Division in response to the tender and the said bid was accepted by the SDA. \nThereafter, the Master Service Agreement (MSA) was entered into on 11th April, 2007 for establishing 600 CSCs in Palamau Division. It has been mentioned in the Request for Proposal (RFP) that in each Panchayat of the Palamau Division at least one CSC was to be established, roll out and made operational. There were 600 Panchayats in the entire Palamau Division. As such, at least / minimum 600 nos. of CSCs were essentially required to be rolled out and operated by the SCA in the Palamau Division in accordance with RFP, the bid documents and the Agreement. \nClause-2.3 of the MSA provided for roll out of CSCs, the schedule for completion of Rollout with cumulative percentage of minimum number of CSCS in each division to be rolled out. As per the said clause of MSA, the 100% of the CSCs i.e. 600 in numbers, were to be rolled out within 12 months. It has also been mentioned at Clause 2.3(a) that the SCA shall set up and operationalize the CSCs at its own cost and expense within 12 months from the Effective Date. \nClause-3.1(f) clearly mentions that the SCA would not be eligible for the revenue of GOJ, support unless the CSCs have been rolled out within the specified timeframe and are certified as operational by the SDA. Clause 3.1 (f) also provides that only upon setting up CSCS and making operational 50% of the said CSCs, the SCA shall be eligible for 50% of the revenue support for the said operational CSCs and the balance 50% shall be deferred till the roll out of 100% CSCs. \nAs per the Master Service Agreement (MSA) executed on 11th April, 2007, Alternative for India Development, the respondent herein, was to roll out all the 600 CSCs within 12 months with effect from 11th April, 2007 but the respondent failed to meet the target. \nThereafter, vide Supplementary agreement dated 03.09.2012 wherein maximum period of completion of roll out of CSCs by the SCA was extended to 66 months from the effective date which was completed on 10th October, 2012. The respondent failed to complete 100% roll out, i.e. roll out of 600 CSCs in Palamau division, till the date of termination of agreement. \nIt is the case of the appellant that since M/s. Alternative For India Development failed to set up and made operational at least 50% of the CSCs during the stipulated period, as such, was not eligible for any revenue support since the Government of Jharkhand has incurred heavy loss due to failure in roll out of required number of CSCs in Palamau division. \nThe Revenue support for operational CSCs were calculated and the non-roll out penalty, non-operational penalty were imposed as per the provisions of MSA. The JAP-IT had paid revenue support to the respondent for the period September 2012 to March 2013. It was found that Non Rollout and Non-operational penalty amount for period of April, 2013 to December, 2013 was higher than the payable revenue support amount, thus, no revenue support amount found to be due for payment to the respondent. \nIt is the case of the appellant that non-performance of the contractual obligation by the SCA was the reason for the termination of the MSA vide order dated 27.06.2016. However, said termination of MSA, forfeiture of bank guarantee and blacklisting is not related to revenue support. \nThe revenue support was main issue in the arbitration proceedings. The prayer of the claimant (present respondent) for additional award in relation to the forfeiture of bank guarantee, termination of MSA by placing reliance upon the order passed by the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand in W.P. (C) No. 3103 of 2016 dated 22.06.2017 was having no relevancy in the matter in context. Therefore, the prayer of the claimant for an additional award has been rejected by the Sole Arbitrator on 11.08.2017. \nIt is the case of the appellant that L.P.A. No. 405 of 2017 filed on behalf of JAP-IT before this Court against the order dated 22.06.2017 passed in W.P. (C) No. 3103 of 2016 has been disposed of on 19.03.2018. \nThe claimant (present respondent) moved the Hon'ble High Court in Arbitration Application No. 01 of 2016 in which final order dated 15.07.2016 was passed and the sole Arbitrator was appointed. \nThereafter the claimant filed statement of claim along with documents before the Arbitrator. The appellants, being the opposite parties, filed their statement of defense dated 07.10.2016 alongwith all relevant documents also giving point wise reply of the claim petition. \nIt is the further case of the appellants that since considerable amount was to be realized from M/s Alternative for India Development on account of non-roll out, non-operational penalty and also towards liquidated damages for not confirming and not performing in terms of the MSA, therefore, a counter claim also made by JAP-IT dated 07.10.2016 before the learned Sole Arbitrator claiming an amount of Rs. 13,40,63,107/- including liquidated damages of Rs. 1,16,16,000/-. \nAfter hearing the parties, an Arbitral Award has been passed on 02.06.2017 in Arbitration Case No. 01 of 2016 by the Sole Arbitrator holding the respondents (the appellant herein) entitled for an amount of Rs.9,47,706/- towards the claim made under the head of the 70% share of the amount received by the Claimant from the citizens by offering the government services plus a lump sum amount of Rs. 2,00,000/- for the delay caused in disbursement of the said amount of the share of the State Government. Further, the respondent has been awarded with right to impose non-roll out penalty for the total 6 number of CSCs for the period from 26th November, 2012, the date when Claimant had rolled out 594 CSCs to 26th June, 2016, the date of termination of the MSA, which comes to Rs.7,84,800/-. \nFurther, direction has been given that after the deduction of the amounts awarded to the Respondents as well as after deduction of the amount already paid to the Claimant by way of Revenue Support, i.e. Rs. 60, 66,912 for the period from October, 2012 till March, 2013, the Claimant is awarded with Revenue Support for the total number of 594 CSCs @ of Rs. 3284/- per CSC per month calculated from 26th November, 2012 to 25th June, 2016, i.e., Rs.7,58,80,510/- plus interest upon the same within a period of two months. \nThereafter, an application was filed under Section 33 (1) (a) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 on behalf of the claimant, in which the learned Arbitrator passed a supplementary award dated 07.07.2017 by adding an amount of Rs. 32,80,541/- observing that the awarded amount be read as Rs.7,91,61,051/- and the amount awarded has been modified to the said extent. \nThe claimant filed another application under Section 33(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to pass additional award for refund of Rs.47,28,960/- towards the bank guarantee submitted by the claimant which was forfeited which has been held to be not maintainable and accordingly dismissed. \nBeing aggrieved and dissatisfied with the said part of the arbitral award dated 02.06.2017 passed by the learned Arbitrator an Arbitration Case No. 01 of 2016, whereby the claimant awarded with revenue support for total number of 594 Common Service Centres as well as Supplementary Award dated 07.07.2017 as also against the rejection of the part of the counter claim and against the order dated 11.08.2017 passed in the said Arbitration Case No. 01 of 2016 by the learned Sole Arbitrator, the appellant filed an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and conciliation Act, 1996 being the Commercial (REVOC) Case No. 05 of 2017 before the learned Commercial Court, Ranchi. \nThe learned Commercial Court heard the application learned Commercial Court, Ranchi has passed the judgment on 25.06.2018 dismissing the said petition. \nBeing aggrieved with the judgment dated 25.06.2018 passed in Commercial (REVOC) Case No. 05 of 2017 by the learned Commercial Court, Ranchi, the instant Commercial Appeal has been preferred. \n3. Mr. Sachin Kumar, learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the appellant State, has submitted that the work in question, i.e., 600 Common Service Centres was ought to be completed and had to be made operative and to that effect a certificate was required to be given by the authority concerned and it is only thereafter the revenue support was to be given to the claimant, as would appear from the condition stipulated under Condition No.3.1(f) of the Master Service Agreement. \nBut, herein, the centre has not been completed in entirety, rather only 594 centres have been installed and it has not been made operative since no revenue has been transmitted to the State Exchequer and, therefore, there was no certificate of making the centres operational as was required to be given in view of the condition stipulated for the purpose of providing revenue support. \nBut the learned Arbitrator, without taking into consideration the aforesaid aspect of the matter, has passed the Award in favour of the respondent concerned and hence the very issue of the condition as contained under Condition No.3.1(f) has been given go-bye and, therefore, it is against the public policy and the Award suffers from perversity. \nThe further contention has been raised that the learned Arbitrator has further erred in passing the Award in the counter claim by holding the appellant State entitled to meager amount of Rs.9,47,706/-\nAccording to the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned Arbitrator ought to have decided the counter claim by passing an Award commanding upon the claimant to compensate the State Exchequer by making payment of the amount which ought to have been collected through the people at large way of extending the benefit from the centres. But, instead of doing so, the Award has been passed in favour of the claimant directing the State appellant to make payment of Rs.7,91,61,051/- and hence, the very aspect of the matter of putting State Exchequer at loss has not been appreciated. \nThe contention has been made that on these grounds the Award has been challenged before the forum available under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, but the learned court has also not appreciated the aforesaid fact and merely on the basis of the reason that the forum available under Section 34 is having very little scope to exercise the power of judicial review so far as the finding recorded by the Arbitral Tribunal is concerned. But the issue which is being raised as a ground, as referred hereinabove, ought to have been considered by the forum exercising the power conferred under Section 34 of the Act, 1996. \nLearned counsel for the appellant, in support of his argument, has relied upon the judgment rendered by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Company Limited v. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) reported in (2019) 15 SCC 131. \nLearned counsel for the appellant, in the backdrop of the aforesaid premise, coupled with the reliance put upon the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Company Limited v. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) (Supra) has contended that the order impugned dated judgment dated 25.06.2018 passed in Commercial (REVOC) Case No. 05 of 2017 suffers from patent illegality and, hence, not sustainable in the eyes of law. \n4. Per contra, Mr. Harendra Kr. Mahato, learned counsel appearing for the claimant, the respondent herein, has submitted that the learned Arbitrator has considered each and every aspect of the matter, if the Award will be looked into, more particularly paragraph 12 and 27 thereof.\nAccording to the learned counsel for the claimant, the respondent herein, the learned Arbitrator has considered the condition stipulated at Condition No. 2.1(a) i.e. (i) for completion of 600 centres; and Condition No.3.2(a)(i) that a certificate is to be given of making the centres operational.\nThe learned Arbitrator has considered the aforesaid condition and considering the fact that 594 centres have already been installed out of 600 which is near about 99% and hence only because 1% of the centre has not been installed the benefit of revenue support cannot be denied to be given to the respondent. \nThe learned Arbitrator has further considered the second condition of certificate to be given by the agency making the centres operational but the said certificate was to be given by the S.D.A., the agency concerned and hence, giving the certificate with respect to making the centre operational was the duty of the agency and if such certificate was not given by the agency for which the claimant cannot be made to suffer. \nLearned Arbitrator has further considered the stand of the claimant as referred at paragraph 12 of the Award wherein it has been admitted by the State that in order to make out the operational process more easier and transparent OMT/E-Nagrick/E-Taal systems have been adopted. \nThe State has taken the plea that aforesaid software system since has been found to be faulty and hence the certificate could not be given. \nLearned counsel for the claimant, therefore, has taken the ground that if the learned Tribunal has considered the very condition as contained in Condition No. 2.1(a) i.e. (i) for completion of 600 centres; and Condition No.3.2(a)(i) that a certificate is to be given of making the centres operational. However, learned Tribunal has passed the Award by taking into consideration the fact that 99% of the centres has been installed and the Certificate of making the centre operational since has not been given due to the faulty software system, as per the admission made by the agency, as would appear from the discussion made in paragraph 12 of the Award and in that view of the matter if the Award has been passed in favour of the claimant, the same cannot be said to suffer from an error. \nin that view of the matter, it cannot be said that the Award is against the public policy. \nThe further contention has been made that the scope of judicial review either under Section 34 or the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or under Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act is very limited and the same can only be exercised if the Award is found to be contrary to the public policy and the Award suffers from perversity. But, none of the condition is available herein and by taking into consideration the aforesaid fact the learned court while exercising the power under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 if has declined to interfere with the arbitral Award, the same cannot be said to suffer from an error. \nLearned counsel appearing for the respondent has relied upon the judgment Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority reported in (2015) 3 SCC 49, Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. V. Saw Pipes Ltd. reported in (2003) 5 SCC 705 and Navodaya Mass Entertainment Limited v. J.M. Combines reported in (2015) 5 SCC 698.\n5. We have heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the documents available on record as also the finding recorded by the learned Arbitrator and the learned court while exercising the power under Section 34 of the Act, 1996. \n6. This Court, before appreciating the argument advanced on behalf of the parties, deems it fit and proper to refer the position of law regarding the power of judicial review in the arbitral Award. \nIn the case of Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority reported in (2015) 3 SCC 49, the Hon'ble Apex Court while dealing with the scope of judicial review in the matter of an arbitral Award has taken into consideration the judgment passed in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181 and has held at para 22 which is required to be referred herein which reads hereunder as :-\n22. In McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co.\nLtd. [(2006) 11 SCC 181] , this Court held:\n\"58. In Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. [1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] this Court laid down that the arbitral award can be set aside if it is contrary to (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; (b) the interests of India; or (c) justice or morality. A narrower meaning to the expression 'public policy' was given therein by confining judicial review of the arbitral award only on the aforementioned three grounds. An apparent shift can, however, be noticed from the decision of this Court in ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd. [(2003) 5 SCC 705] (for short 'ONGC'). This Court therein referred to an earlier decision of this Court in Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. Ltd. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly [(1986) 3 SCC 156] wherein the applicability of the expression 'public policy' on the touchstone of Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872 and Article 14 of the Constitution of India came to be considered. This Court therein was dealing with unequal bargaining power of the workmen and the employer and came to the conclusion that any term of the agreement which is patently arbitrary and/or otherwise arrived at because of the unequal bargaining power would not only be ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India but also hit by Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872. In ONGC [(2003) 5 SCC 705] this Court, apart from the three grounds stated in Renusagar [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] , added another ground thereto for exercise of the court's jurisdiction in setting aside the award if it is patently arbitrary. \n59. Such patent illegality, however, must go to the root of the matter. The public policy violation, indisputably, should be so unfair and unreasonable as to shock the conscience of the court. Where the arbitrator, however, has gone contrary to or beyond the expressed law of the contract or granted relief in the matter not in dispute would come within the purview of Section 34 of the Act. However, we would consider the applicability of the aforementioned principles while noticing the merits of the matter. \n60. What would constitute public policy is a matter dependent upon the nature of transaction and nature of statute. For the said purpose, the pleadings of the parties and the materials brought on record would be relevant to enable the court to judge what is in public good or public interest, and what would otherwise be injurious to the public good at the relevant point, as contradistinguished from the policy of a particular Government. \nFurther, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of PSA SICAL Terminals Pvt. Ltd. Vs Board of Trustees of V.O. Chidambranar Port Trust Tuticorin and Others reported in 2021 SCC OnLine SC 508, has taken the similar view which has been observed at paragraph 43 of the judgment which is being referred hereunder as:-\n43. It will thus appear to be a more than settled legal position, that in an application under Section 34, the court is not expected to act as an appellate court and reappreciate the evidence. The scope of interference would be limited to grounds provided under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. The interference would be so warranted when the award is in violation of \"public policy of India\", which has been held to mean \"the fundamental policy of Indian law\". A judicial intervention on account of interfering on the merits of the award would not be permissible. However, the principles of natural justice as contained in Section 18 and 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Arbitration Act would continue to be the grounds of challenge of an award. The ground for interference on the basis that the award is in conflict with justice or morality is now to be understood as a conflict with the \"most basic notions of morality or justice\". It is only such arbitral awards that shock the conscience of the court, that can be set aside on the said ground. An award would be set aside on the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award and as such, which goes to the roots of the matter. However, an illegality with regard to a mere erroneous application of law would not be a ground for interference. Equally, reappreciation of evidence would not be permissible on the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. \nIn a recent judgment passed in Reliance Infrastructure Ltd. Vs State of Goa reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 604, the Hon'ble Apex Court has reiterated its view and has observed at paragraph 48 which reads hereunder as :-\n\"48. In MMTC Limited (supra), this Court took note of various decisions including that in the case of Associate Builders (supra) and exposited on the limited scope of interference under Section 34 and further narrower scope of appeal under Section 37 of the Act of 1996, particularly when dealing with the concurrent findings (of the Arbitrator and then of the Court). This Court, inter alia , held as under:--\n\"11. As far as Section 34 is concerned, the position is well-settled by now that the Court does not sit in appeal over the arbitral award and may interfere on merits on the limited ground provided under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) i.e. if the award is against the public policy of India. As per the legal position clarified through decisions of this Court prior to the amendments to the 1996 Act in 2015, a violation of Indian public policy, in turn, includes a violation of the fundamental policy of Indian law, a violation of the interest of India, conflict with justice or morality, and the existence of patent illegality in the arbitral award. Additionally, the concept of the \"fundamental policy of Indian law\" would cover compliance with statutes and judicial precedents, adopting a judicial approach, compliance with the principles of natural justice, and Wednesbury [Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corpn., [1948] 1 K.B. 223 (CA)] reasonableness. Furthermore, \"patent illegality\" itself has been held to mean contravention of the substantive law of India, contravention of the 1996 Act, and contravention of the terms of the contract. \n12. It is only if one of these conditions is met that the Court may interfere with an arbitral award in terms of Section 34(2)(b)(ii), but such interference does not entail a review of the merits of the dispute, and is limited to situations where the findings of the arbitrator are arbitrary, capricious or perverse, or when the conscience of the Court is shocked, or when the illegality is not trivial but goes to the root of the matter. An arbitral award may not be interfered with if the view taken by the arbitrator is a possible view based on facts. \n13. It is relevant to note that after the 2015 Amendment to Section 34, the above position stands somewhat modified. Pursuant to the insertion of Explanation 1 to Section 34(2), the scope of contravention of Indian public policy has been modified to the extent that it now means fraud or corruption in the making of the award, violation of Section 75 or Section 81 of the Act, contravention of the fundamental policy of Indian law, and conflict with the most basic notions of justice or morality. Additionally, sub-section (2-A) has been inserted in Section 34, which provides that in case of domestic arbitrations, violation of Indian public policy also includes patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. The proviso to the same states that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence. \n14. As far as interference with an order made under Section 34, as per Section 37, is concerned, it cannot be disputed that such interference under Section 37 cannot travel beyond the restrictions laid down under Section 34. In other words, the court cannot undertake an independent assessment of the merits of the award, and must only ascertain that the exercise of power by the court under Section 34 has not exceeded the scope of the provision. Thus, it is evident that in case an arbitral award has been confirmed by the court under Section 34 and by the court in an appeal under Section 37, this Court must be extremely cautious and slow to disturb such concurrent findings.\" \nIt is evident from the judicial pronouncements referred hereinabove, that the appellate court while exercising the power regarding the illegality and propriety of the arbitral Award is not supposed to reappraise the evidence as also interference to the arbitral Award does not intend a review of the merits of the dispute, rather, it is limited to the situations whether the findings of the Arbitrator are arbitrary or capricious or perverse or when the conscience of the court shocks or when the illegality is not trivial but goes to the root of the matter. \nFurther, an arbitral Award may not be interfered with if the view taken by the Arbitrator is a possible view based on facts.\n7. So far as the fact of the given case is concerned, the Government of Jharkhand, for convenient and speedy Government Services to the citizens, through Common Services Centers (CSCs) such as issuance and preparation of Aadhar Card, Voter ID, Caste Certificates, residential certificates etc., decided that at least one CSC in a Panchayat, in the different districts / division of the State should be established and, therefore, a tender for rolling out and operation of around 4500 Common Service Centres in 5 divisions of the State of Jharkhand was floated. Accordingly, M/s Alternative For India Development, respondent herein, submitted its technical and commercial bid for 600 CSCs in Palamau Division in response to the tender and the said bid was accepted by the SDA. \nThereafter, Agreement was entered into on 11th April, 2007 for establishing 600 CSCs in Palamau Division. There were 600 Panchayats in the entire Palamau Division. As such, at least / minimum 600 nos. of CSCs were essentially required to be rolled out and operated by the SCA in the Palamau Division. \nClause-3.1(f) of the contract stipulates that the SCA would not be eligible for the revenue support of Government of Jharkhand, unless the CSCs have been rolled out within the specified timeframe and are certified as operational by the SDA. Clause 3.1 (f) also provides that only upon setting up CSCs and making operational 50% of the said CSCs, the SCA shall be eligible for 50% of the revenue support for the said operational CSCs and the balance 50% shall be deferred till the roll out of 100% CSCs. \nAs per the Agreement, Alternative for India Development, the respondent herein, was to roll out all the 600 CSCs within 12 months with effect from 11th April, 2007 but the respondent failed to meet the target. \nThereafter, vide Supplementary agreement dated 03.09.2012 wherein maximum period of completion of roll out of CSCs by the SCA was extended to 66 months from the effective date which was completed on 10th October, 2012. The respondent failed to complete 100% roll out, i.e. roll out of 600 CSCs in Palamau division, till the date of termination of agreement. \nIt is the case of the appellant that since M/s. Alternative For India Development failed to set up and made operational at least 50% of the CSCs during the stipulated period, as such, was not eligible for any revenue support since the Government of Jharkhand has incurred heavy loss due to failure in roll out of required number of CSCs in Palamau division. \nThe Revenue support for operational CSCs was calculated and the non-roll out penalty, non-operational penalty were imposed as per the provisions of the Agreement. The JAP-IT had paid revenue support to the respondent for the period September 2012 to March 2013. It was found that Non Rollout and Non-operational penalty amount for period of April, 2013 to December, 2013 was higher than the payable revenue support amount, thus, no revenue support amount found to be due for payment to the respondent. \nThe revenue support was main issue in the arbitration proceedings wherein prayer was made by the claimant for additional award has been rejected by the Sole Arbitrator on 11.08.2017. \nThe claimant (respondent herein) moved before this Court in Arbitration Application No. 01 of 2016 in which final order dated 15.07.2016 was passed and the sole Arbitrator was appointed. \nThereafter the claimant filed statement of claim along with documents before the Arbitrator. The appellants, being the opposite parties, filed their statement of defense dated 07.10.2016 alongwith all relevant documents. \nAfter hearing the parties, the Arbitral Award has been passed on 02.06.2017 in Arbitration Case No. 01 of 2016 by the Sole Arbitrator holding the respondents (the appellant herein) entitled for an amount of Rs.9,47,706/- towards the claim made under the head of the 70% share of the amount received by the Claimant from the citizens by offering the government services plus a lump sum amount of Rs. 2,00,000/- for the delay caused in disbursement of the said amount of the share of the State Government. Further, the respondent has been awarded with right to impose non-roll out penalty for the total 6 number of CSCs for the period from 26th November, 2012, the date when Claimant had rolled out 594 CSCs to 26th June, 2016, the date of termination of the MSA, which comes to Rs.7,84,800/-. \nFurther, direction has been given that after the deduction of the amounts awarded to the Respondents as well as after deduction of the amount already paid to the Claimant by way of Revenue Support, i.e. Rs. 60, 66,912 for the period from October, 2012 till March, 2013, the Claimant is awarded with Revenue Support for the total number of 594 CSCS @ of Rs. 3284/- per CSC per month calculated from 26th November, 2012 to 25th June, 2016, i.e., Rs.7,58,80,510/- plus interest upon the same within a period of two months. \nThereafter, an application was filed under Section 33 (1) (a) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 on behalf of the claimant, in which the learned Arbitrator passed a supplementary award dated 07.07.2017 by adding an amount of Rs. 32,80,541/- observing that the awarded amount be read as Rs.7,91,61,051/- and the amount awarded has been modified to the said extent. \nThe claimant filed another application under Section 33(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to pass additional award for refund of Rs.47,28,960/- towards the bank guarantee submitted by the claimant which was forfeited which has been held to be not maintainable and accordingly dismissed. \nBeing aggrieved and dissatisfied with the said part of the arbitral award dated 02.06.2017 passed by the learned Arbitrator an Arbitration Case No. 01 of 2016, whereby the claimant awarded with revenue support for total number of 594 Common Service Centres as well as Supplementary Award dated 07.07.2017 as also against the rejection of the part of the counter claim and against the order dated 11.08.2017 passed in the said Arbitration Case No. 01 of 2016 by the learned Sole Arbitrator, the appellant filed an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and conciliation Act, 1996 being the Commercial (REVOC) Case No. 05 of 2017 before the learned Commercial Court, Ranchi. \nThe learned Commercial Court heard the application and passed the judgment on 25.06.2018 dismissing the said petition. \nBeing aggrieved with the judgment dated 25.06.2018 passed in Commercial (REVOC) Case No. 05 of 2017 by the learned Commercial Court, Ranchi, the instant Commercial Appeal has been preferred. \nIt is evident from the record that the agreement has been entered which contains several conditions. One of the conditions is for the purpose of giving revenue support to the claimant. \n8. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant since is questioning the arbitral Award as also the order passed by the learned court in exercise of power conferred under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 that the Award so passed by casting liability upon the State appellant due to the negligence in not giving the revenue support even after completion of the entire centres and the centres have not become operational. \nTherefore, this Court, instead of dealing with other conditions, is now confining to deal with the condition which pertains to extending the benefit of revenue support in favour of the claimant which is available at Condition No.2.1 of the Agreement which is being referred hereunder as :-\n\"2.1 Scope of the MSA a) The SCA mandated to establish around 600 number of CSCs in Palamu Division of the State of Jharkhand. The GoJ will provide a variety of Government Services through the CSCs. These centres are proposed to be set up in the panchayat bhawans or suitable spaces available or at alternate locations preferably near the same. The SCA shall be responsible for identifying such locations with the guidance of the SDA. \nb) The GoJ will extend revenue support to the SCA as agreed mutually under this MSA. \nc) The details of the Palamu division and the revenue support sought is as follows :\nSl. Name of Approx Revenue Support Required No. Division No. of from JAP-IT in Indian CSCs Rupees per CSC per proposed month over the 4 year period 1 Palamu 600 3284 It is evident that for the purpose of giving revenue support, two conditions have been stipulated in the condition as referred hereinabove. The first is that the centre, 600 in number, is to be set up and the second condition is that the centre is to be made operational and to that effect a certificate is to be given by the S.D.A., the agency concerned, the State functionary herein. \nThe claim of the claimant is that out of 600 centres, 594 centres have been set up, however, it was not within the period as agreed in pursuance to the agreement dated 11th April, 2007 but subsequent thereto, a supplementary agreement has been enreached in between the parties whereby extension of 66 months have been granted under which out of 600 centres, 594 centres have been set up. But no revenue support has been given and a dispute arose which was finally referred to the Arbitrator by appointing Arbitrator by the High Court in exercise of power conferred under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. \nThe claimant has taken the plea that there is no laches on his part and out of 600 centres, 594 centres have been set up and the operation certificate which was to be given by the S.D.A. has not been given and, therefore, the revenue support, which, as per the agreement the claimant was entitled, since has not been given, the claimant has been made to suffer and hence the Award is prayed to be passed in his favour.\n9. While on the other hand, the State appellant has also filed counter claim on the pretext of the fact that the revenue which was to be generated by virtue of setting up of the agency has not been transmitted to the State Exchequer due to the laches committed on the part of the claimant and, hence they are entitled for the damages. \n10. The learned Tribunal has considered various aspect of the matter. The documents have been adduced. The learned Tribunal, in order to adjudicate the issue, has formulated following issues :-\n(i) Whether the Claimant is entitled to the claim raised by it in the petition of Claim and whether the same is payable in law or on facts in terms of the Master Service Agreement and the Supplementary Agreement?\n(ii) Whether the Supplementary Agreement dated 03.09.2012 has merged with the main Master Service Agreement dated 11.04.2007 and whether the parties are bound by the terms of the Master Service Agreement as well as the Supplementary Agreement dated 03.09.2012?\n(iii) Whether the Respondents have relinquished or waived the provisions of the Master Service Agreement in relation to the payment of the revenue support amount by the Respondent to the Claimant? \n(iv) Whether the Respondents are barred by Principle of estoppels from relying on the provisions of Master Service Agreement relating to the payment of the revenue support amount by the Respondent to the Claimant? \n(v) Whether the Claimant has performed its part of the contract and / or whether it has breached / violated any of the terms of the contract entered into between the parties particularly Clause 4.2(b) of the Contract as alleged by the Respondent? \n(vi) Whether an amount of Rs.8,52,07,100/- is payable by the Respondents to the Claimant towards the revenue support as claimed by it? \n(vii) Whether an amount of Rs. 2,79,62,132/- is payable by the Respondents to the Claimant as Escalation Cost as claimed by the Claimant? \n(viii) Whether the Claimant is entitled to interest @ 15% on delayed payment i.e. Rs. 3,97,92,689/- till the date of filing of the Claim Petition as claimed by it? \n(ix) Whether an amount of Rs.13,40,63,107/- is payable by the Claimant to the Respondent by way of Counter Claim on account of revenue collected from the citizens for government services, non-rollout penalty amount, non-operational penalty amount, offsetting amount, liquidated damages as claimed by the Respondent in terms of the Master Service Agreement read with Supplementary Agreement dated 03.09.2012 and whether the amount aforesaid is at all admissible to be paid by the Claimant to the Respondent and whether the Claimant was required to roll out 600 Common Service Centers in accordance with the provisions of Master Service Agreement dated 11.04.2007 read with Supplementary Agreement dated 03.09.2012? \nThe State appellant is only concerned with issue No.(ix) which pertains to revenue support in the light of non-compliance of the condition stipulated under Condition No.2.1(a) of the Master Service Agreement. \nThe learned Tribunal has considered the aforesaid condition and by taking note of the fact that out of 600 centres, 594 centres have been installed which is almost 99% of the work in entirety and hence came to the conclusion that if 1% of the centres has not been set up, the claimant cannot be denied the benefit of revenue support.\nThe learned Arbitrator has considered the second condition regarding certificate to be given of making the centres operational, that is the ground taken by the State appellant that in absence of certificate of making the centres operational, there cannot be revenue support to be given to be claimant.\nThe learned Arbitrator has considered the stand of the State appellant in order to assess that by whom the operational certificate was to be given, whether it was to be given by the State or if the State has not given, whether the claimant can be held responsible for that so as to put him at financial loss by not giving the benefit of revenue support.\nThe learned Arbitrator has further considered the stand of the appellant wherein it has been admitted that the operational certificate could not be given due to change in the system, as would appear from the discussion so made at paragraph 12 of the Award passed by the learned Arbitrator, for ready reference, paragraph 12 is quoted hereunder as :-\n\"12. Further, the Learned Senior Counsel for the Claimant, arguing upon the penal provisions under the MSA emphasized on the point that, as a consequence of the execution of the Supplementary Agreement, the entire Clause 2.3(b) stood deleted and thereby no penal provisions remained enforceable under the MSA. Therefore, non-operational penalty and or non-roll out penalty cannot be levied as there is no provision in the MSA regarding penalty for the same and therefore the schedule to the MSA which speaks about penalty is of no avail. Further he contended that, the Respondent has calculated the non-operational penalty on the basis of reports of E- Nagrik software which in itself was faulty and not provided for in the MSA. Accordingly the Claimant is not liable to pay any amount towards penalty for non- roll out or non operationality of any CSCs. Therefore, Respondent cannot rely on the penalty clause which stood deleted after the execution of the Supplementary Agreement; therefore the Respondent cannot bank upon something which does not exist in the MSA. Further by citing Clause 3.2(a)(i) of the MSA, the Claimant stated that, it had to submit certificate from JAP-IT or designated agency certifying that all the CSCs have been rolled out and are operational but the Respondent never issued a single certificate in respect of the same rather they alternatively introduced Online Monitoring Tool for certifying CSCs. He further submitted that, the fact that the OMT/E- Nagrick/E- Taal systems introduced by the Respondent at subsequent stages of Agreement period were non- functioning and not reliable, was also recorded in the internal CSC review meeting held on 14.05.2017 in the chamber of the Principal Secretary, Department of IT.\" \nThe learned Arbitrator, after taking into consideration the admission on the part of the State, that due to the glitch in the software, the operational certificate could not be given, has given specific finding at paragraph 27 of the Award wherein it has been held that if it is the admission on the part of the State appellant that the operational certificate could not be given due to introduction of the new software which has been found to be faulty, therefore, for the fault on the part of the State, the claimant cannot be allowed to suffer, for ready reference paragraph 27 of the Award is being quoted and referred hereunder as :-\n\"27. Further, under Clause 2(a) which provides for the scope of the MSA states that, the SCA is mandated to establish 600 numbers of CSCs in the Palamu Division of State of Jharkhand. Further the Clause 2(c) goes on to provide the details of the Palamu Division and the revenue support sought for the same. The 3rd row of the table provided in the said clause which deals with the number of CSCs reads as - \"approx no of CSC's proposed\". Therefore, after analysing the MSA in its entirety, I am of the view that, under various clauses in the said MSA the roll-out and operations of the CSCs are indicated in percentile calculation and the same is not practically possible without the figures being certain or exact. I am therefore certain that, it is evidently clear from the wordings and interpretation of the terms of the MSA in total that, the SCA was required to roll-out a total of 600 CSCs, since all the calculations made under the MSA, may it be for revenue support or for imposition of penalty was provided in percentage manner and the same percentile figure cannot be obtained unless and until the figure out of which it has to be derived is certain or exact.\" \nThe learned Arbitrator on the basis of the aforesaid fact, has passed the Award holding therein that the appellant itself is at fault in not giving operation certificate who is only to give certificate as per the stipulation made under Condition No.3.2(a)(i) and, therefore, for the fault committed by the Agency, the claimant cannot be allowed to suffer and, accordingly, passed the Award in favour the claimant. \n11. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that the Award is contrary to the public policy and suffers from perversity, which according to our considered view, cannot be said to have substance, reason being that if the condition has been enshrined in the agreement, it is incumbent upon the parties to comply it in strict sense. Either of the parties, if do not comply with the condition and due to such non-compliance no relief can be sought for by such party who is at fault.\nHerein, the condition stipulated at Condition No. 2.1(a) i.e., for completion of 600 centres; and Condition No.3.2(a)(i) that a certificate is to be given of making the centres operational. \n12. So far as the completion of 600 centres are concerned, out of 600 centres, 594 centres have already been installed, i.e., 99% of the work and hence denial of the revenue support only if 1% centres have not been set up, the same has been held to be not justified by the learned Arbitrator as also the learned court while refusing to interfere with the Award in exercise of power conferred under Section 34 of the Act, 1996, which according to our considered view, cannot be said to suffer from an error, it is for the reason that there cannot be any deviation from the agreement and if condition has been stipulated, the same has to be adhered to. \nThe plea is being taken on behalf of the State appellant that the operational certificate is not available and hence the learned Arbitrator or the forum under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 ought to have taken into consideration the aforesaid fact. \n13. There is no denial that it ought to have been considered but the fact herein is that the operational certificate if was required to be given by the State and when the State is admitting the fact that due to the technical glitch in the new software introduced for giving operation certificate which establishes that the laches is on the part of the State and the law is well settled that if the laches is on the part of the party, such party cannot be allowed to take advantage of its wrong/illegality as has been held by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Kusheshwar Prasad Singh vs. State of Bihar and Ors., (2007) 11 SCC 447, wherein at paragraphs-14, 15 and 16, the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed as under:\n\"14. In this connection, our attention has been invited by the learned counsel for the appellant to a decision of this Court in Mrutunjay Pani v. Narmada Bala Sasmal [AIR 1961 SC 1353] wherein it was held by this Court that where an obligation is cast on a party and he commits a breach of such obligation, he cannot be permitted to take advantage of such situation. This is based on the Latin maxim commodum ex injuria sua nemo habere debet (no party can take undue advantage of his own wrong). \n15. ... This Court (at SCC p. 142, para 28) referred to Broom's Legal Maxims (10th Edn.), p. 191 wherein it was stated:\n\"It is a maxim of law, recognised and established, that no man shall take advantage of his own wrong; and this maxim, which is based on elementary principles, is fully recognised in courts of law and of equity, and, indeed, admits of illustration from every branch of legal procedure.\" \n16. It is settled principle of law that a man cannot be permitted to take undue and unfair advantage of his own wrong to gain favourable interpretation of law. It is sound principle that he who prevents a thing from being done shall not avail himself of the non-performance he has occasioned. To put it differently, \"a wrongdoer ought not to be permitted to make a profit out of his own wrong\".\" So far as the question of public policy is concerned, there is not dispute that the interference would be warranted if the Award is in violation of the public policy of India. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd. (Supra), has been pleased to observe as under paragraph 31 that the expression public policy of India, as contained in Section 34, would now be the fundamental policy of Indian Law, as explained in para 18 and 27 of Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority reported in (2015) 3 SCC 49, i.e., the fundamental policy of Indian Law would be related to Renusagar [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. general Electric Co. (1994) Supp (1) SCC 644] understanding of this expression. Paragraph 31 of the judgment rendered in public policy of India. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd.(Supra) is quoted hereunder as :-\n\"31. Therefore, in our view, the phrase \"public policy of India\" used in Section 34 in context is required to be given a wider meaning. It can be stated that the concept of public policy connotes some matter which concerns public good and the public interest. What is for public good or in public interest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public good or public interest has varied from time to time. However, the award which is, on the face of it, patently in violation of statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public interest. Such award/judgment/decision is likely to adversely affect the administration of justice. Hence, in our view in addition to narrower meaning given to the term \"public policy\" in Renusagar case [1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] it is required to be held that the award could be set aside if it is patently illegal. The result would be -- award could be set aside if it is contrary to:\n(a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (b) the interest of India; or (c) justice or morality, or (d) in addition, if it is patently illegal. \nIllegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality is of trivial nature it cannot be held that award is against the public policy. Award could also be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of the court. Such award is opposed to public policy and is required to be adjudged void.\" \nIt has further been observed that the public policy of India is now constricted to be first; Award is contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian Law as understood in paragraph 28 of the Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority (Supra), which reads hereunder as:-\n28. In a recent judgment, ONGC Ltd. v. Western Geco International Ltd. [(2014) 9 SCC 263 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 12] , this Court added three other distinct and fundamental juristic principles which must be understood as a part and parcel of the fundamental policy of Indian law. The Court held: (SCC pp. 278-80, paras 35 & 38-40) \"35. What then would constitute the 'fundamental policy of Indian law' is the question. \nThe decision in ONGC [(2003) 5 SCC 705 : AIR 2003 SC 2629] does not elaborate that aspect. Even so, the expression must, in our opinion, include all such fundamental principles as providing a basis for administration of justice and enforcement of law in this country. Without meaning to exhaustively enumerate the purport of the expression 'fundamental policy of Indian law', we may refer to three distinct and fundamental juristic principles that must necessarily be understood as a part and parcel of the fundamental policy of Indian law. The first and foremost is the principle that in every determination whether by a court or other authority that affects the rights of a citizen or leads to any civil consequences, the court or authority concerned is bound to adopt what is in legal parlance called a 'judicial approach' in the matter. The duty to adopt a judicial approach arises from the very nature of the power exercised by the court or the authority does not have to be separately or additionally enjoined upon the fora concerned. What must be remembered is that the importance of a judicial approach in judicial and quasi-judicial determination lies in the fact that so long as the court, tribunal or the authority exercising powers that affect the rights or obligations of the parties before them shows fidelity to judicial approach, they cannot act in an arbitrary, capricious or whimsical manner. Judicial approach ensures that the authority acts bona fide and deals with the subject in a fair, reasonable and objective manner and that its decision is not actuated by any extraneous consideration. Judicial approach in that sense acts as a check against flaws and faults that can render the decision of a court, tribunal or authority vulnerable to challenge. \n***\n38. Equally important and indeed fundamental to the policy of Indian law is the principle that a court and so also a quasi-judicial authority must, while determining the rights and obligations of parties before it, do so in accordance with the principles of natural justice. Besides the celebrated audi alteram partem rule one of the facets of the principles of natural justice is that the court/authority deciding the matter must apply its mind to the attendant facts and circumstances while taking a view one way or the other. Non- application of mind is a defect that is fatal to any adjudication. Application of mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of the mind and disclosure of mind is best done by recording reasons in support of the decision which the court or authority is taking. The requirement that an adjudicatory authority must apply its mind is, in that view, so deeply embedded in our jurisprudence that it can be described as a fundamental policy of Indian law. \n39. No less important is the principle now recognised as a salutary juristic fundamental in administrative law that a decision which is perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would have arrived at the same will not be sustained in a court of law. Perversity or irrationality of decisions is tested on the touchstone of Wednesbury [Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corpn., (1948) 1 KB 223 :\n(1947) 2 All ER 680 (CA)] principle of reasonableness. Decisions that fall short of the standards of reasonableness are open to challenge in a court of law often in writ jurisdiction of the superior courts but no less in statutory processes wherever the same are available. \n40. It is neither necessary nor proper for us to attempt an exhaustive enumeration of what would constitute the fundamental policy of Indian law nor is it possible to place the expression in the straitjacket of a definition. What is important in the context of the case at hand is that if on facts proved before them the arbitrators fail to draw an inference which ought to have been drawn or if they have drawn an inference which is on the face of it, untenable resulting in miscarriage of justice, the adjudication even when made by an Arbitral Tribunal that enjoys considerable latitude and play at the joints in making awards will be open to challenge and may be cast away or modified depending upon whether the offending part is or is not severable from the rest.\" \n(emphasis in original) It requires to refer herein the paragraph 33 of the judgment rendered in the case of Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority (Supra) for the purpose of consideration of the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant in order to assess as to whether the learned Arbitrator or the learned court exercising the power under Section 34 of the Act, has acted contrary to the public policy of India , for ready reference, paragraph 33 is quoted hereunder as :-\n\"33. It must clearly be understood that when a court is applying the \"public policy\" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court of appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. A possible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. Thus an award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be invalid on this score [ Very often an arbitrator is a lay person not necessarily trained in law. Lord Mansfield, a famous English Judge, once advised a high military officer in Jamaica who needed to act as a Judge as follows:\"General, you have a sound head, and a good heart; take courage and you will do very well, in your occupation, in a court of equity. My advice is, to make your decrees as your head and your heart dictate, to hear both sides patiently, to decide with firmness in the best manner you can; but be careful not to assign your reasons, since your determination may be substantially right, although your reasons may be very bad, or essentially wrong\". It is very important to bear this in mind when awards of lay arbitrators are challenged.] . Once it is found that the arbitrators approach is not arbitrary or capricious, then he is the last word on facts. In P.R. Shah, Shares & Stock Brokers (P) Ltd. v. B.H.H. Securities (P) Ltd. [(2012) 1 SCC 594] , this Court held:\n\"21. A court does not sit in appeal over the award of an Arbitral Tribunal by reassessing or reappreciating the evidence. An award can be challenged only under the grounds mentioned in Section 34(2) of the Act. The Arbitral Tribunal has examined the facts and held that both the second respondent and the appellant are liable. The case as put forward by the first respondent has been accepted. Even the minority view was that the second respondent was liable as claimed by the first respondent, but the appellant was not liable only on the ground that the arbitrators appointed by the Stock Exchange under Bye-law 248, in a claim against a non-member, had no jurisdiction to decide a claim against another member. The finding of the majority is that the appellant did the transaction in the name of the second respondent and is therefore, liable along with the second respondent. Therefore, in the absence of any ground under Section 34(2) of the Act, it is not possible to re-examine the facts to find out whether a different decision can be arrived at.\" \nIn this regard, paragraph 42.3 and paragraphs 43 to 45 of the aforesaid judgment are also relevant which are quoted hereunder as :-\n\"42.3. (c) Equally, the third subhead of patent illegality is really a contravention of Section 28(3) of the Arbitration Act, which reads as under:\n\"28.Rules applicable to substance of dispute.--(1)-(2)*** (3) In all cases, the Arbitral Tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract and shall take into account the usages of the trade applicable to the transaction.\" \nThis last contravention must be understood with a caveat. An Arbitral Tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract, but if an arbitrator construes a term of the contract in a reasonable manner, it will not mean that the award can be set aside on this ground. Construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide unless the arbitrator construes the contract in such a way that it could be said to be something that no fair-minded or reasonable person could do. \n43. In McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. [(2006) 11 SCC 181] , this Court held as under:\n\"112. It is trite that the terms of the contract can be express or implied. The conduct of the parties would also be a relevant factor in the matter of construction of a contract. The construction of the contract agreement is within the jurisdiction of the arbitrators having regard to the wide nature, scope and ambit of the arbitration agreement and they cannot be said to have misdirected themselves in passing the award by taking into consideration the conduct of the parties. It is also trite that correspondences exchanged by the parties are required to be taken into consideration for the purpose of construction of a contract. Interpretation of a contract is a matter for the arbitrator to determine, even if it gives rise to determination of a question of law. \n113. Once, thus, it is held that the arbitrator had the jurisdiction, no further question shall be raised and the court will not exercise its jurisdiction unless it is found that there exists any bar on the face of the award.\" \n44. In MSK Projects (I) (JV) Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan [(2011) 10 SCC 573] , the Court held:\n\"17. If the arbitrator commits an error in the construction of the contract, that is an error within his jurisdiction. But if he wanders outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits a jurisdictional error. Extrinsic evidence is admissible in such cases because the dispute is not something which arises under or in relation to the contract or dependent on the construction of the contract or to be determined within the award. The ambiguity of the award can, in such cases, be resolved by admitting extrinsic evidence. The rationale of this rule is that the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined outside and independent of what appears in the award. Such a jurisdictional error needs to be proved by evidence extrinsic to the award. \n45. In Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. v. Dewan Chand Ram Saran [(2012) 5 SCC 306], the Court held:\n\"43. In any case, assuming that Clause 9.3 was capable of two interpretations, the view taken by the arbitrator was clearly a possible if not a plausible one. It is not possible to say that the arbitrator had travelled outside his jurisdiction, or that the view taken by him was against the terms of contract. That being the position, the High Court had no reason to interfere with the award and substitute its view in place of the interpretation accepted by the arbitrator. \n44. The legal position in this behalf has been summarised in para 18 of the judgment of this Court in SAIL v. Gupta Brother Steel Tubes Ltd. [(2009) 10 SCC 63] and which has been referred to above. Similar view has been taken later in Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. v. ONGC Ltd. [(2010) 11 SCC 296] to which one of us (Gokhale, J.) was a party. The observations in para 43 thereof are instructive in this behalf. \n45. This para 43 reads as follows: (Sumitomo case [(2010) 11 SCC 296] '43. ... The umpire has considered the fact situation and placed a construction on the clauses of the agreement which according to him was the correct one. One may at the highest say that one would have preferred another construction of Clause 17.3 but that cannot make the award in any way perverse. Nor can one substitute one's own view in such a situation, in place of the one taken by the umpire, which would amount to sitting in appeal. As held by this Court in Kwality Mfg. Corpn. v. Central Warehousing Corpn. [(2009) 5 SCC 142] the Court while considering challenge to arbitral award does not sit in appeal over the findings and decision of the arbitrator, which is what the High Court has practically done in this matter. The umpire is legitimately entitled to take the view which he holds to be the correct one after considering the material before him and after interpreting the provisions of the agreement. If he does so, the decision of the umpire has to be accepted as final and binding.'\"\n14. It is evident from the aforesaid judgment that the construction of the terms of the contract is primarily for an Arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes the contract in such a manner that no fair-minded or reasonable person would, in short, that the Arbitrator's view is not even a possible view to take. If the Arbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits an error of jurisdiction. \nThis ground of challenge will now fall within the new ground under Section 34(2-A). \nFurther, re-appreciation of evidence which is what an appellate court is permitted to do, cannot be permitted under the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of Award. \nThe paragraph 42.1 of the judgment rendered in the case of Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority (Supra) laid down that mere contravention of the substantive law in India itself is no longer a ground available to set aside an arbitral Award. Paragraph 42.2 of the aforesaid judgment, however, would remain for an Arbitrator gives no reason for an Award and contravenes Section 31(3) of the 1996 Act that would certainly amount to patent illegality on the face of the Award. \nThe Hon'ble Apex Court has further observed therein that a decision which is perverse, as understood in paragraph 31 and 32 of the Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority (Supra), will no longer being a ground for challenge a public policy of India would certainly amount to patent illegality appearing on the face of the Award. \nThus, a finding based on no evidence at all or an Award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. \nAdditionally, the finding based on documents taken behind the back of the parties by the Arbitrator, would also qualify as a decision based on no evidence in as much as such decision is not based on evidence laid by the parties, therefore, would also have to be categorized as perverse. \n15. It is, thus, evident that the settled legal position is that in an application under Section 34 of the Act, 1996, the court is not expected to act as an appellate court and re-appreciate the evidence. The scope of interference would be limited to the ground provided under Section 34 of the Act, 1996. The interference would be so warranted when the Award is in violation of the public policy of India which has been held to be a fundamental policy of Indian law. \nFurther, the arbitral Award can also be interfered with if it shocks the conscience of the court as also the Award would be set aside on the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the Award and if the decision is perverse.\n16. This Court, having considered the proposition laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the aforesaid judgment and coming back to the Award passed by the learned Tribunal, has found that the Award has not been passed by giving go-bye to the condition stipulated in the agreement, rather, thoughtful consideration has been given by the learned Tribunal regarding the condition stipulated under Condition No. 2 and having discussed the same at paragraph 27, the Award has been passed on 02.06.2017. \n17. This Court, thus, is of the view after going through the Award passed by the learned Arbitrator that there is no error on the face of it, it does not suffer from perversity and it is not against the public policy. \n18. This Court, after considering the order passed by the court exercising the power under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 has found therefrom that the learned court has considered the fact in entirety as also has considered the scope of judicial review by taking note of the judgment rendered in the case of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd. (Supra) which pertains to interference to be shown in a case of violation of public policy/perversity or if there is any error on the face of the Award, but the learned court has not found any error on the face of the Award and the Award having not been found contrary to the public policy and does not suffer from the perversity, rather, the learned court, by taking note of the consideration so made by the learned Arbitrator, has given specific finding that the Award suffers from no error. \n19. This Court, on the basis of the discussion made hereinabove, is of the view that the Award passed by the learned Tribunal as also the order passed by the learned court in exercise of power under Section 34 of the Act, 1996, suffer from no error. \n20. So far as the ground agitated that the Award of counter claim awarding meager amount is concerned, according to the considered view of this Court, the learned sole Arbitrator has awarded Rs.9,47,706/- towards the claim made under the head of the 70% share of the amount received by the Claimant from the citizens by offering the government services plus a lump sum amount of Rs.2,00,000/- towards the delay caused in disbursement of the said amount of the share of the State Government. \nThe aforesaid finding, therefore, suggests that it is not that there is no order on counter claim, as has been argued, rather, the order has been passed on the counter claim awarding Rs.9,47,706/- towards the claim made under the head of the 70% share of the amount received by the Claimant from the citizens by offering the government services plus a lump sum amount of Rs.2,00,000/- towards the delay caused in disbursement of the said amount of the share of the State Government, therefore, the counter claim has also been considered and Award has been passed holding the State entitled for the aforesaid amount of Rs.9,47,706/- plus Rs.2,00,000/-. \n21. This Court, taking into consideration the fact that the Award passed by the learned sole Arbitrator since suffers from no error, having not found to be contrary to public policy, therefore, is of the view that the order passed by the learned court under Section 34 of the act, 1996 requires no interference in exercise of power of judicial review. \n22. Accordingly, the instant appeal fails and is dismissed. \n23. Consequently, pending interlocutory applications also stand dismissed. \n(Sujit Narayan Prasad, J.) I agree (Ratnaker Bhengra, J.)

(ii) it is further alleged in the plaint that when the plaintiff demanded the defendant to repay the debt, the defendant issued cheques on 08-05-2021 dated 21-7-2021 for a sum of rs.20,00,000/and cheque dated 25-06-2021 for a sum of rs 25,00,000/and two cheques dated 267-2021 for a sum of rs.50,00,000/each. it is stated in the plaint that when the cheques were presented, it was dishonoured under the endorsement either funds insufficient or exceeds, thereby, entitling the plaintiff to send a statutory legal notice on 10-8-2021 demanding the cheque amounts. though the notice was received on 11-8-2021 instead of honouring the cheque, the defendant seems to have sent a reply on 16-8-2021 to which the plaintiff sent a rejoinder notice on 21-8-2021 that was received by the defendant and the defendant seems to have issued reply to the rejoinder notice sent by the plaintiff. (iii) thereafter, the plaintiff has initiated criminal proceedings before the judicial magistrate v, salem on 20-9-2021 for an offence under section 138 negotiable instruments act. however, reserving his right to file civil suit against the defendant. therefore the plaintiff, who is the respondent herein has held the defendant / petitioner herein in the first above three revision petitions liable to pay rs.2,34,00,000/alongwith https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 interest at the rate of rs.1/per 100 per month to the plaintiff. thus, the plaintiff has invoked the commercial courts act 2015 and filed the same before the commercial court at salem, district judge of salem. (iv) pending suit, immediately after the receipt of the suit summons, the defendant/the petitioner in the 1st three above referred revisions has filed i.a. no. 2 of 2022 invoking order 7 rule 11(a) and (d) of cpc seeking rejection of plaint on the ground that the commercial court has no jurisdiction to try the money suit, which is otherwise capriciously drafted to attract the commercial courts act 2015, apart from various among other grounds raised in this petition. though, the petition under order 7 rule 11 cpc was filed and arguments were heard from both the sides, the learned district judge, commercial court, salem has dismissed i.a no. 2 of 2022 in a one line order without specifying any reasons on merits and discussing the same which is fervous and hence c.r.p.no. 3672 of 2022 is filed challenging the same. (v) as far as c.r.p.no.3800 of 2022 is concerned, an application was filed in i.a.no. 4 of 2022 by the respondent / plaintiff seeking to amend the plaint filed in commercial original suit in no.9 of 2022 under order 6 rule 17 of cpc and the same was allowed by order dated 3-9-2022 and the same is challenged in this revision petition. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 (vi) further, c.r.p.no. 2123 of 2023, is filed by the petitioner / defendant to strike off the plaint in c.o.s.no.10 of 2023 on the file of district judge, commercial court, salem. the said suit was filed by the respondent, viz., niranjani, wife of madhanraj invoking commercial court jurisdiction at salem seeking a decree in favour of her directing the petitioners / defendants to pay a sum of rs.2,84,85.962/along with the accrued interest on rs.2,16,00,000/at rs.1 per 100 per month from the date of institution of suit. (vii) the c.r.p.no.338 of 2023 is filed by the petitioner / plaintiff as against the order made in i.a.no.6 of 2022 dated 20.10.2022 [which was preferred by the respondent / defendant to file statement of truth under order 6 rule 15-a of cpc], on the ground that the statement of truth ought to have been filed within 120 days i.e., 13-2-2022 and has been filed with a delay of 249 days, which according to the plaintiff is an erroneous order passed by the district judge, commercial court at salem and the court below allowed the said pettion by permitting the statement of truth. 3. the learned senior counsel appearing for revision petitioner in c.r.p.3672 of 2022 and c.r.p. no. 3800 of 2022 would contend that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 dismissal of the petition filed under order 7 rule 11(a) and (d) seeks intervention of this court, in as much as the learned district judge dismissed the same in one line order, despite the petitioner had taken earnest effort to convince the court that the suit itself is not maintainable invoking commercial courts act, 2015 and if at all the same is maintained, the suit is barred by limitation, as contemplated under the commercial courts act 2015 and the limitation act. thatapart, the learned senior counsel also urged upon this court that the commercial courts act is not intended from the suits of ordinary money claim on alleged promissory note to invoke the commercial courts act and the jurisdiction of the court which the very purpose of the act will be defeated. he would further contend that that the claim made by the plaintiff in this suit does not fall under any one of the 22 categories, as mentioned under section 2(1)(c) of the act. the plaintiff has pouched his pleadings to fit in the jurisdiction of the commercial courts act, which in otherwise would ordinarily be a money suit rather than being filed under commercial courts act, 2015. the learned counsel further submitted that the promissory notes have not authorized to file under the commercial courts and commercial division, as the same are not mercantile documents as defined in section 2(1) of the commercial courts act, hence, pleaded the dismissal of the suit in c.o.s.no.9 of 2022 and allow c.r.p.nos 3672 and 3800 of 2022. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 4. lastly, the learned senior counsel appearing for revision petitioner in c.r.p.3672 of 2022 and c.r.p. no. 3800 of 2022 would contend that when the suit itself is not maintainable, as not arising under the commercial courts act, the question of permitting the plaintiff to amend the plaint, after filing of the petition under order 7 rule 11 (a) and (d) of cpc would not arise and the learned district judge ought to have dismissed the petition seeking amendment of plaint. 5. the learned senior counsel for the petitioner in c.r.p.no. 2123 of 2023 submitted that the suit in c.o.s.no.10 of 2023 is breft of the jurisdiction of the court for invoking the commercial courts act 2015, when the act clearly specifies that pre-institutions mediation and settlement under section 12(a) of the commercial courts act, 2015, the suit ought not to have been taken on file for want of compliance under section 12(a) of commercial courts act, 2015. the learned senior counsel relied upon the following judgments to support his contention. a. judgment of the hon'ble supreme court reported in (2020) 7 supreme court cases 366 [dahiben vs. arvindbhai kalyanji bhanus ali (gajra) dead through legal representatives and others] b. judgment of the hon'ble supreme

2023 and petitioner in c.r.p. no.338 of 2023 would contend that the crp filed by the petitioner / defendant in crp nos.3672, 3800 and 2123 of 2023 is not maintainable, as there is a specific bar in approaching this court, as she ought to have filed only appeal as specified under section 13 of commercial courts act, 2015. the respondent counsel contended that the transaction between the respondent and the petitioner are the commercial transaction, which is clearly covered under section 2(1)(c)(i) of commercial courts act. that apart, the learned counsel also contended that the respondent is a licensed money lender and the petitioner borrowed money from the respondent for his business and family expenses by executing promissory notes agreeing to repay the debts with interest. apart from the same, the learned senior counsel traversing through the plaint averments would state that the documents produced viz., the promissory notes and communications between the plaintiff and the defendant would itself establish the commercial transaction between the plaintiff and the defendants. further, the defendant continues to borrow money from the plaintiff for commercial purpose and the plaintiff periodically renewed his lending license will also https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 established the transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant is commercial in nature that would attract the jurisdiction under commercial courts act, 2015 and hence the suit filed invoking the commercial courts act 2015 is maintainable. as far as the revision petition in crp no.338 of 2023 is concerned, the learned senior counsel emphasized more upon order 6 rule 15(a)(4) of cpc, where the learned senior cousel submitted that the defendant was continuously aware that the statement of truth, ought to have been filed within 150 days from the date of service of summon and on an expiry of 120 days, the defendant forfeit the such right to file the written statement. the district court allowed the i.a. no.6 of 2022, thereby accepted the statement of truth, which cannot be sustained as the same is beyond the competency of the court to accept such statement of truth when the statute prohibits such receival after 120 days. hence, revision petition filed in crp no. 338 of 2023 has to be allowed and order passed in i.a. no. 7. the learned senior counsel further submitted as against the argument made by the learned senior counsel, mr.n. jothi in crp no. 2123 of 2022 that section 12(a) of the commercial courts act is only a procedural aspect, which is curable even pending suits. section 12(a) of the commercial courts act is only a conciliated procedure which can even be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 undertaken for pending suit referring the parties of the suit for mediation as contemplated under section 12(a) of the commercial courts act. hence, the suit filed by niranjani in cos no. 10 of 2023 before the district judge commercial court, salem cannot be rejected that has to be sustained and proceeded for further trial. the learned senior counsel sought dismissal of c.r.p.no. 2123 of 2023. 8. further, the learned counsel for the petitioner in crp no.3672 of 2022 in support of her contention has relied upon the judgment of the delhi high court reported in 2022 scc online del 3636 [ihhr hospitality (andhra) pvt., ltd., vs. seems swami and others] at paragraph nos.10 to 12, wherein it is held as follows:10. in the case of lady moon towers pvt. ltd. vs. mahindra investment advisors pvt. ltd. manu/wb/0547/2021 it was observed by the high court of calcutta that the definition contemplates a commercial dispute and not any other form of dispute where the basis of disagreement between the parties has a non-commercial cause. the gradation of disputes in section 2(i)(c) takes into account all possible forms of agreements from which a commercial dispute may arise; it makes it clear that the framers of the statute gave emphasis on the commercial flavour of the transaction as opposed to agreements entered into between the parties without a commercial purpose. the commercial purpose would generally mean a transaction by which a person's commercial or economic interest may be advanced and would result in an economic benefit to that person. it would not include an agreement where profit making is an incidental outcome of the transaction or may happen by accident. home loan for example is given by a person or entity to another with the expected outcome of principle sum being returned with interest. the essential commercial flavour in such a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisloan may be lost by way of informal terms under which the money is c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 lent and advanced and the digitally signed by:priyanka aneja signing date:04.11.2022 13:23:37 2022/dhc/004647 consequent uncertainty which may result therefrom. it was further observed that in terms of section 2(i)(c) ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents implies ordinary transactions between the named persons and the \"mercantile documents\" indicates that all transactions between the specified classes of persons will not result in a commercial dispute where the transaction does not relate to mercantile documents. only those disputes arising out of a transaction between the named classes of persons which has been formalised by way of a mercantile document would be termed as a commercial dispute. in the said suit, a loan of rs. 50 lakhs had been given by the plaintiff company to the defendant since the directors of the plaintiff company were known to the defendant since long. it was held that simplicitor because a loan transaction was involved would not attract a commercial flavour to it and was held to be not a commercial dispute. 11. this court in kailash devi khanna vs. dd global capital ltd. 2019 scc online del 9954 held that all suits for recovery of monies cannot brought under section 2(1)(c)(i) of the act where the suit is not based on any transaction relating to mercantile documents. the bombay high court in bharat huddanna shetty vs. ahuja properties & developers (interim application (l) no.14350 of 2021; decided on 13 th july, 2021) rejected the contention that the suit should be treated as a commercial summary suit on the mandate that the transaction had occurred between merchants, bankers, financiers and traders and further clarified that transactions between individuals where the plaintiff gives a friendly loan to a needy friend will not be seen as a transaction in the course of ordinary business. the madras high court in r. kumar vs. t.a.s jawahar ayya manu/tn/4159/2020 was digitally signed by:priyanka aneja signing date:04.11.2022 13:23:37 2022/dhc/004647 of the view that since the plaintiffs did not transact in the capacity of financiers, the dispute was not a \"commercial dispute\" and that an ordinary transaction of the four classes of persons mentioned in 2(1)(c)(i) arising out of mercantile documents alone would fall within the definition of a commercial dispute. the calcutta high court in associated power co. ltd. vs. ram taran roy air 1970 cal 75 focused its gaze on a \"mercantile document\" within the meaning of the first schedule of the city civil court act, 1953 as a document between merchants and traders where the construction, interpretation and meanings of words and clauses of the mercantile documents would assume significance. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 12. it should also be pointed out that the words used in subclause (i) of clause(c) are \"ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents.\". the placement of the underlined words between ordinary transactions of the named persons and the mercantile documents indicates that all transactions between the specified classes of persons will not result in a \"commercial dispute\" where the transaction does not relate to mercantile documents. hence, only a dispute arising out of a transaction between the named classes of persons which has been formalised by way of a mercantile document will be a \"commercial dispute\" under section 2(1)(c)(i) of the 2015 act. 9. that apart, the learned counsel for the petitioner in crp no.3672 of 2022 in support of her contention has relied upon the judgment of the high court of calcutta reported in 2022 scc online cal 3010 [venkatesh vincom pvt., ltd., vs. spice of joy, multicuisine restaurant cum bar and others] \"7. reverting to the core issue the eventuality enshrined in clause (i) of section 2(1)(c) of the said act postulates that a dispute arising out of the ordinary transaction of financer relating to mercantile documents including its enforceability and interpretation are the important factors to be borne in mind. the said clause can be segregated into 3 parts. firstly, the dispute must arise out of ordinary transaction of financer and secondly, such ordinary transaction must relate to a mercantile document and thirdly, the enforceability and the interpretation of such document is involved. admittedly, the appellant is a non banking financial corporation which would be evident from the averments made in the plaint and the certificate of incorporation annexed thereto. the primary function of the non banking corporation is to extend financial supports and can be regarded as an fmat 20 of 2022 page-8 ordinary https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judistransaction of the financer. we find no ambiguity in this regard that c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 lending money by the appellant is fundamentally the transactions which it does and can be regarded as the ordinary transaction. the parties are not ad idem on the expression \"mercantile document\" appearing in the said clause for the reason that there was no agreement in writing nor any document evincing the money given as loan to the respondents. the mercantile document is not defined in the said act. however, the said act defines 'document' in section 2(1)(f) to mean any matter expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures, or marks, or electronic means or, by more than one of those means, intended to be used, or which may be used, for the purpose of recording that manner. the definition of a document is expansive and is not restricted to any agreement to be executed by and between the parties recording the transactions at the beginning thereof. the definition is wide enough to include any expression or a description of any substance by means of letters, marks or figures or electronic means which would be sufficient enough to bring clarity of the matter. the word 'mercantile' in ordinary parlance means a document relating to a merchant or trading or a document which is commercial in nature. in black's law dictionary, 8th edition 'mercantile' is defined as in \"bld\" 8. since the word 'mercantile' includes the transaction which is of commercial nature the \"commercial paper\" is also defined in the black's law dictionary as an instrument other than the cash for the payment of money and include negotiable instrument of a particular kind in the following: fmat 20 of 2022 page-9 \"commercial paper: 1. an instrument, other than cash, for the payment of money. commercial paper typically existing in the form of a draft (such as a check) or a note (such as a certificate of deposit) is governed by article 3 of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 ucc. but even though the ucc uses the term commercial paper when referring to negotiable instruments of a particular kind (drafts, checks, certificates of deposit, and notes as defined by article 3), the term long predates the ucc as a business and legal term in common use. before the ucc, it was generally viewed as synonymous with negotiable paper or bills and notes. it was sometimes applied even to nonnegotiable instruments. also termed mercantile paper; company's paper. see negotiable instrument.\" \" 'commercial paper' is rather a popular than a technical expression, often used, however, both in statutes and in decisions of courts, to designate those simple forms of contract long recognized in the world's commerce and governed by the law merchant.\" \"defined most broadly, commercial paper refers to any writing embodying rights that are customarily conveyed by transferring the writing. a large subset of commercial paper consists of such writings that are negotiable, which means that the law enables a transferee to acquire the embodied rights free of claims and defences against the transferor.\" fmat 20 of 2022 page-10 \"sec. 2 (c) \"commercial dispute\" means a dispute arising out of (ii) ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents, including enforcement and interpretation of such documents. 9. the stroud's judicial dictionary defines the commercial action to mean and include any cause arising out of ordinary transactions of merchants and traders and without prejudice to generosity of the following words: any cause relating to construction of a mercantile document, the export or import of mercantile, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 insurance, banking, mercantile agency and mercantile uses. it, thus, engulfed within itself any action or undertaking with an object to make a profit therefrom (see punjab university vs. unit trust of india & ors., (2015) 2 scc 669). in ladymoon towers pvt. ltd. (supra) the single bench of this court has relied upon various judgments of the delhi high court, bombay high court and madras high court as well as the calcutta high court to ascertain the meaning of a mercantile document. it has been held therein that all suits of recovery of money may not come within the purview of section 2(1)(c)(i) of the act if not based on any transaction relating to mercantile document. the view of the bombay high court has also been noticed to the effect that the suit cannot be treated as a commercial suit unless the transaction has occurred between the merchants, traders, bankers and financers and, therefore, any transaction of two individuals in extending a friendly loan cannot be regarded as a commercial transaction or a transaction in an ordinary course of business. the view of the madras high court as relied on by the single fmat 20 of 2022 page-11 bench in ladymoon towers pvt. ltd. (supra) was that if the plaintiffs have not transacted in a capacity of a financer it cannot come within the purview of the aforesaid definition clause. so far as the calcutta high court view as noticed by the single bench in the above noted decision was based on the definition of a mercantile document appearing in the first schedule of city civil courts act, 1953 to be a document between merchant and traders and the construction, interpretation and meaning of the words and clause of the mercantile document would assume a greater significance. though the aforesaid judgments were noticed by the single bench in the above referred cases but ultimately it was held that the suit for recovery of money lend and advanced as friendly loan does not satisfy the definition of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 a commercial dispute. it is no doubt true that every nature of the monetary transaction cannot come within the ambit of a commercial dispute defined in the said act. such monetary transaction in an ordinary course of business transacted by the merchants, bankers, financers and traders based upon a mercantile documents are regarded as a commercial transactions and a suit before the commercial court is maintainable. taking a clue from the definition of a 'merchant', what was a conservative view at one point of time have seen a radical change with the varied varieties of transaction which can be manifestly seen from the expansive definition of a commercial dispute under section 2(1)(c) of the said act. by advancement of technology the mode and the nature of transactions have also been changed and what was earlier known as a negotiable instrument in a primitive stage has been gradually taken out of practice and the mode of the transaction has been well accepted in electronic form. the interpretative tool fmat 20 of 2022 page-12 is an evolving process and changes with the behavioural pattern of the society more particularly in commercial transactions and, therefore, any rudimentary form of the interpretation may not be compatible with the changing pattern of the commercial transactions.\" 12. it leads to another question whether the loan extended to one of the partners for and on behalf of the firm can be regarded as a transaction with the firm. the answer can be traced from the provisions contained in chapter iv of the indian partnership act, 1932. section 18 of the said act postulates that the partner is an agent of a firm for the purpose of business of the firm. section 19 contemplates the implied authority of the partner as an agent of the firm and section 22 thereof binds the firm for any act of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisinstrument done or executed by the partner or other persons on c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 behalf of the farm to be regarded as done or executed by the firm. undisputedly, the cheque was issued by the appellant to the respondent no. 2 and the receipt or a note evincing such transaction, was issued by the respondent no. 1 firm. it is not a case where the respondent no. 2 utilised the money for his individual purposes but in fact the money given by the appellant was used and utilised by the respondent no. 1 firm and the tds certificate also corroborate the same. even the interest is paid by the respondent no. 1 firm and, therefore, even if the cheque covering the loan amount was issued in the name of one of the partners but shall be regarded as a payment to the firm. as indicated above, there is no condition laid down in the said definition 'commercial dispute' that the mercantile document must be executed at the beginning or before the transaction having affected rather the document defined in section 2(1)(f) of the act includes any matter expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures or marks or electronic means intended to be used or which may be used for the purpose of recording the fmat 20 of 2022 page-16 matter. we, therefore, find no difficulty in considering that the mercantile document as an instrument by any other means coming within the ambit of the definition of a document executed by a merchant in an ordinary course of business and any restrictive interpretation would frustrate the legislative intent and the object and purpose underlying the promulgation of the commercial courts act, 2015. we, therefore, have no hesitation to hold that the dispute involved in the instant pattern satisfies the definition of a commercial dispute and the order of the commercial court cannot be sustained.\" https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 10. heard the learned senior counsels and learned counsels for the c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 appropriate parties and perused the records carefully. 11. though the parties to the c.r.p. nos. 3672 of 2022, 3800 of 2022 and 338 of 2023 are madanraj, hindu undivided family, as plaintiff and radha alias ramalingam, as defendants arising out of c.o.s. no. 9 of 2022 are taken up along with crp no. 2123 of 2023, arising out of t.niranjani as plaintiff and r. radha as defendant in c.o.s. no.10 of 2023 on the file of district judge, commercial court salem and the parties are described to their respective rank as placed in the suits. 12. on the perusal of the records it is seen that the plaintiff, viz., madanraj seems to have filed c.o.s.no.118 of 2021, which was subsequently renumbered as c.o.s.no.9 of 2022 on the file of commercial district court, salem. the plaintiff had approached the district court invoking jurisdiction under commercial act, 2015, claiming for a decree in favour of the plaintiff directing the defendant to pay rs.2,86,67,748/with accrued interest on rs.2,34,00,000/at rs.1/per 100 per month from the date of suit till the date of realisation of amount that on the ground that the defendant one radha ramalingam bororrwed money from the plaintiff on various dates starting from 21.11.2013 by way of cash or by way of bank account of transfer. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 13. the plaintiff has further averred that the defendant was liable to pay rs.2,09,72,300/to the plaintiff towards principal and interest on 07.12.2019. however, after negotiation with the defendant, the plaintiff and defendant had arrived an amount of rs.2,05,00,000/and thereby waiving a sum of rs.4,72,300/to satisfy the above amount claimed, which is a debt to be paid by the defendant, he had executed a promissory note dated 07.12.2019 for the above said sum of rs.2,05,00,000/apart from he has issued various cheques dating from 08.05.2021 to 26.07.2021. when the cheque was presented for clearing, the defendant had failed to honour the cheque, either it was for want of sufficient funds or returned with an endorsement of 'exceeds insufficient'. the cheques were returned and the same is evident from the series of exchange of notices between the plaintiff and the defendant and when the amount were not been received by the plaintiff, the plaintiff had initiated criminal proceedings under section 138 of negotiable instruments act. 14. it is further seen from the records available that the defendant had invoked order 7 rule 11(a) and (d) of cpc seeking the court's intervention to reject the plaint in c.o.s. no.118 of 2021 by way of i.a.no.2 of 2022, which was filed on 07.02.2022, for the said i.a., a counter was also filed by the plaintiff as early as 11.02.2022. pending the said i.a., the defendant https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 has also filed a written statement on 01.06.2022. the said i.a.no.2 of 2022 came to be decided by the learned district judge, commercial district court, salem on hearing the arguments on both the sides, finally an one line order and decreetal order came to be passed on 28.07.2022 and the said order reads as follows:\"orders pronounced in open court. in the result, the petition is hereby dismissed with costs\" and the decreetal order which reads as follows: (1)that the petition be and the same is hereby dismissed. (2)that the petitioner do pay a sum of rs.1,000/to the respondents to the cost of the petition\". it is seen from the records that the defendant have raised several grounds in the affidavit in support of the petition filed under order 7 rule 11(a) and (d) of cpc, which was primarily on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, maintainability of the suit under the commercial courts act, 2019 and not following the mandatory provisions under commecial courts act, 2015. when the defendant has raised several grounds apart from the said grounds, none of them were discussed by the learned single judge while dismissing i.a.no.2 of 2022. 15. the hon'ble supreme court as well as the high court in various states have consistently held that proper reasons have to be given when the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 lower judiciary is disposing of any applications and no creptic order can be passed, especially one line order dismissing the application, which exhibits clear non application of mind by the said district judge. when the defendant has raised a maintainability and it is the duty of the district judge to answer the reasons for his dismissal and even though the lower court need not answer all the grounds in favour or against any party when a question is raised in the suit that too when application was filed under order 7 rule 11, it becomes the mandatory duty of the district court to discuss the application or non application of order 7 rule 11 cpc, when it has been raised by the parties concerned. for this reason alone, the order impugned in c.r.p. no.3672 of 2022 has to be set aside and when cryptic order is passed in i.a.no.2 of 2022 in cos no.9 of 2022 is unbecoming of the learned district judg, the district court has to rectify. accordingly, crp no.3672 of 2022 is allowed and order passed in i.a.no.2 of 2022 dated 28.07.2022 is set aside. 16. as far as crp no.3800 of 2022 is concerned, the plaintiff had filed i.a.no.4 of 2022 seeking amendment of plaint under order 6 rule 17 of cpc on 06.08.2022 after dismissal of i.a.no.2 of 2022. the amendment petition and the affidavit filed in support to the petition and the details of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 amendment clearly shows that those grounds which were raised for nonmaintainability of the suit in the written statement filed by the defendant, the plaintiff has come forward to rectify the mistakes by amending his plaint and the details sought for amendment are extracted hereunder:\" 1. add the following in between the words, 'years' and 'hindu' in the 2nd line in the plaintiff long cause title in the page no.1 of the plaint, \"consisting of the kartha madhan raj and its members b.niranjani aged 43 years the wife of the kartha and amitha aged 19 years the daughter of the kartha,\" 2. add the following in between the words, 'years' and 'the' in the 2nd line in para no.3 in the page no.1 of the plaint, \"the plaintiff is a licensed money lender\" 3. add the following in between the words 'plaintiff' and 'karur' in the 3rd line in para no.7 in the page no.2 of the plaint, \"at the plaintiff's residence at salem,\" 4. add the following at the end of para no.11 in the page no.3 of the plaint, \"as agreed by the defendant in the promissory notes, from 07.12.2019 to 16.12.2021 for the 1st promissory note and from 18.02.2021 to 16.12.2021 for the 2nd promissory note which comes totally rs.52,67,748/and further accrued interest at the rate of rs.0.033 per hundred per day after 16.12.2021.\" 5. add the following in between the words, 'plaintiff' and 'to' in the 7th line in para no.15 in the page no.4 of the plaint, \"at their residence at salem.\" the said petition seeking for the amendment was resisted by the defendant https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, limitation, non joinder of parties and no cause of action arisen for commercial dispute to invoke the jurisdiction of commercial courts act and for want of proper documents, being filed in support of the plaint averments, the said i.a.no.4 of 2022 was also heard and allowed by the learned district judge, commercial court, salem by an order dated 03.09.2022 and the relevant portion is extracted hereunder:\"12. when considering the transaction involved, this is an ordinary transaction of a money lender, who is a financier referred under section 2(1)(c)(i) of commercial courts act and prima facie this court is vested with jurisdiction to try this suit. a promissory note is a negotiable instrument and when filed in a commercial transaction, it becomes a mercantile document also, between the merchants and traders. therefore, the contentions raised by the respondent / defendant that these amendments introduce a new cause of action, that it alters the nature of the suit cannot sustain and question of estoppel cannot be gone into in this stage which has no relevance at all and the defendant does not lose any of his advantage, if any which accrued to him earlier because of this amendment. though the amendment is allowed, the defence if any which is available to the respondent / defendant is not washed away and he has all the opportunity to raise these aspects in his defence during trial. hence this petition is hereby allowed and there is no order as to cost.\" https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 17. on a careful perusal of the above said order, it is seen that the c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 defendant was given an opportunity to raise her defence during the trial. the learned judge while considering the amendment petition has confined only with regard to the amendment petition, which is the only way to decide the amendment petition as the predecessor has already decided and rejected the petition under order 7 rule 11 (a) and (b) of cpc. though the reasons are not acceptable and not in consonance with the commercial courts act, especially under section 2(1)c(i), this court is not inclined to interefere with the order for the reason that the defendant has always opportunity to raise his defense during trial. the incumbent learned judge has taken note of dismissal of i.a.no.2 of 2022 and passed orders in i.a.no.4 of 2022. 18. now, when we consider the facts under which c.r.p. no.338 of 2023 is filed, it is seen that the said revision is, as against order in i.a.no.6 of 2022, which was filed under order 6 rule 15-a and under section 151 of cpc, seeking to accept statements of truth and the learned district judge, commercial court, salem by an order and decreetal order dated 20.10.2022 has allowed the petition. it is well settled that the statute prescribed under order 6 rule 15-a for filing statement of truth, that ought to have been filed within 120 days from the date of service of summons, i.e., the time limit is 120 days, however, it is seen that the defendant has filed the application to receive the statement of truth on 20.10.2022 with the delay https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 of 249 days. the trial court has allowed the i.a.no.6 of 2022, as the delay is not very huge for the courts not to condone the same and this court finds no infirmity in the order and decreetal order of the district judge, especially, when the parties have brought before the court within the condonable time frame with appropriate reasons stated, the courts have always power to condone the same, hence this court is not inclined to interefere with the order passed in i.a.no. 6 of 2022 as there is no infirmity. accordingly, c.r.p. no.338 of 2023 is dismissed. 19. as far as c.r.p. no.2123 of 2023 is conconcerned, the same has been filed to strike off the plaint in c.o.s. no. 10 of 2023 filed by niranjani, who is none other than wife of madanraj, who is the plaintiff in d c.o.s. no.9 of 2022. though c.o.s.nos.9 of 2022 and 10 of 2023 are two different suits filed by husband and wife against the common defendant, the present revision is also taken along with the three crps by all the respective counsels. the c.o.s. no.10 of 2023 is filed by niranjani, plaintiff therein, invoking section 2(1)(c) of commercial courts act, 2015, seeking for a decree against the defendants therein to pay her a sum of rs.2,84,85,962/along with the accured interest on rs.2,16,00,000/at rs.1/per hundred per month from the date of suit till the date of realisation of the amount. the plaintiff, viz., niranjani has claimed that the defendants https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 were borrowing money on various dates from 24.03.2011 to 18.02.2021 and the defendants borrowed additional loan also and to repay the debts, the defendants issued cheques and on various dates, which on presentation on bank returned as insufficient funds. the plaintiff claims that she is a business woman, financier and an licensed money lender authorised to lend money for interest. when the money was not paid back, she initiated the proceedings under 138 of negotiable instruments act, before the learned judicial magistrate court, salem. when the suit summons were served, the defendants have approached this court by the present revision on the ground that section 12 (a) of the commercial courts act, 2015, which has pre-requisite and mandatory provision for mediation, without which the suit ought not to have been entertained. 20. in the recent judgment of the hon'ble supreme court reported in (2022) 10 supreme court cases 11, [patil automation pvt., ltd., & others vs. rakheja engineers pvt., ltd.,], the hon'ble apex court had an occasion to reset 12(a) of commercial courts act, 2015, and the relevant portions are extracted hereunder:24. he would submit that having regard to the purport of section 12a, the interest of justice would be subserved if the procedure which is adopted by the court in his case is accepted. in other words, if the court after the institution of the suit immediately refers the parties to the mediation, the appellants may not be justified in insisting on pre institution https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judismediation. in this regard, he would emphasisethat pre litigation mediation c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 contemplated in section 12a does not pertain to inherent jurisdiction of a court. while mediation is to be encouraged, the court may not lose sight of the fact that a half-way house between the two extremes has been attempted by the court in the case, which suffices, having regard to the fact also that no penal consequences are provided and no right of the defendant is imperilled. 25. he next draws our attention to the aspect of court fees. he would submit that the plaintiff is bound to pay the whole court fee under the law in question. when the plaint gets rejected under order vii rule 11, the plaintiff suffers a loss of the entire court fee. this is one of the consequences which this court should not lose sight of, it is contended. here again, the procedure which has been adopted in the case is commended for our acceptance as substantial compliance with section 12a which at the same time, will not reach such disastrous consequences for the litigants. he also touches upon the possible consequence of a plea of limitation overwhelming a fresh suit of the plaintiff after rejection of the first suit. 26. section 12a of the act reads as follows: 12a. pre-institution mediation and settlement— (1) a suit, which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief under this act, shall not be instituted unless the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of preinstitution mediation in accordance with such manner and procedure as may be prescribed by rules made by the central government. (2) the central government may, by notification, authorise the authorities constituted under the legal services authorities act, 1987 (39 of 1987), for the purposes of pre-institution mediation. (3) notwithstanding anything contained in the legal services authorities act, 1987 (39 of 1987), the authority authorised by the central government under sub-section (2) shall complete the process of mediation within a period of three months from the date of application made by the plaintiff under sub-section (1): provided that the period of mediation may be extended for a further period of two months with the consent of the parties: provided further that, the period during which the parties remained occupied with the pre-institution mediation, such period shall not be computed for the purpose of limitation under the limitation act, 1963 (36 of 1963). https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 (4) if the parties to the commercial dispute arrive at a settlement, the same shall be educed into writing and shall be signed by the parties to the dispute and the mediator. (5) the settlement arrived at under this section shall have the same status and effect as if it is an arbitral award on agreed terms under subsection (4) of section 30 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996).\" 27. the act was enacted in the year 2015. at the time, the monetary limit for a suit liable to be tried by the commercial court was fixed at rs.1 crore. 51. lastly, we may notice that in prem lala nahata v. chandi prasad sikaria16, justice p.k. balasubramanyan, speaking on behalf of justice s.b. sinha, also held as follows: \"16. order 7 rule 11(d) speaks of the suit being \"barred by any law\". according to black's law dictionary, bar means, a plea arresting a law suit or legal claim. it means as a verb, to prevent by legal objection. according to ramanatha aiyar's law lexicon, \"bar\" is that which obstructs entry or egress; to exclude from consideration. it is therefore necessary to see whether a suit bad for misjoinder of parties or of causes of action is excluded from consideration or is barred entry for adjudication. as pointed out already, on the scheme of the code, there is no such prohibition or a prevention at the entry of a suit defective for misjoinder of parties or of causes of action. the court is still competent to try and decide the suit, though the court may also be competent to tell the plaintiffs either to elect to proceed at the instance of one of the plaintiffs or to proceed with one of the causes of action. on the scheme of the code of civil procedure, it cannot therefore be held that a suit barred for misjoinder of parties or of causes of action is barred by a law, here the code. this may be contrasted with the failure to comply with section 80 of the 16 (2007) 2 scc 551 code. in a case not covered by sub-section (2) of section 80, it is provided in subsection (1) of section 80 that \"no suit shall be instituted\". this is therefore a bar to the institution of the suit and that is why courts have taken the view that in a case where notice under section 80 of the code is mandatory, if the averments in the plaint indicate the absence of a notice, the plaint is liable to be rejected. for, in that case, the entertaining of the suit would be barred by section 80 of the code. the same would be the position when a suit hit by section 86 of the code is filed without pleading the obtaining of consent of the central government if the suit is not for rent from a tenant.\" (emphasis supplied) views of high courts: https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisdiscordant notes? c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 52. in ganga taro vazirani v. deepak raheja17, the learned single judge of the high court of bombay, took the view that section 12a is a procedural provision. the learned single judge found further that when urgent relief is applied for, the procedure under section 12a need not be undergone. it was further observed that it was not, as if, the court lacks inherent jurisdiction to entertain a suit without complying with section 12a. still further, he refers to section 80 of the cpc. he refers to al. ar. 17 2021 scc online bombay 195 vellayan chettiar (decd.) & others v. government of the province of madras through the collector of ramnad at madura & another18, for the proposition that notice thereunder is given for the protection of the authority concerned and he can lawfully waive his right to the notice. reliance was also placed on the judgement in state of a.p. and others v. pioneer builders, a.p.19, wherein this court declined to interfere with the finding that having participated in the proceeding without raising objection about the maintainability of the suit, there would be waiver. learned single judge also took the view that even under section 12a of the act, in a given set of facts, the defendant could be held to have waived his right to set up section 12a. it is further found that, if there is substantial compliance, the plaintiff cannot be non-suited, i.e., if an attempt has been made for settling the dispute, which has failed and, therefore, the plaintiff is constrained to approach the court. it is this judgment, which has been relied upon in both the impugned judgments. 53. however, as pointed out by shri sharath chandran, a division bench of the high court of bombay, in an appeal, has found that the single judge, has erred in his view that section 12a is not mandatory. the division bench proclaimed that section 12a of the act is mandatory. it was further observed that considering the object and purpose of section 12a, being rooted in public interest, there is no question of it being waived. when it came to the order to be passed in the appeal, we notice that the plaintiff contended that the suit was allowed to be filed by the registry because of a confusion in the registry in the initial period, when the amending act came into force. there was oversight. the division bench stayed the suit and the impugned order for three months and referred the parties for mediation. 61.section 35 of the cpc in the schedule, inter alia, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judiscontemplates that in making an order for payment of costs, the c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 court shall have regard to the conduct of the parties and whether any reasonable offer to settle, is made by a party and unreasonably refused by the other party. sections 35(3) and 35(4) read as follows: \"35(3) in making an order for the payment of costs, the court shall have regard to the following circumstances, including— (a) the conduct of the parties; (b) whether a party has succeeded on part of its case, even if that party has not been wholly successful; (c) whether the party had made a frivolous counterclaim leading to delay in the disposal of the case; (d) whether any reasonable offer to settle is made by a party and unreasonably refused by the other party; and (e) whether the party had made a frivolous claim and instituted a vexatious proceeding wasting the time of the court.\" \"35(4) the orders which the court may make under this provision include an order that a party must pay(a) a proportion of another party's costs; (b) a stated amount in respect of another party's costs; (c) costs from or until a certain date; (d) costs incurred before proceedings have begun; (e) costs relating to particular steps taken in the proceedings; (f) costs relating to a distinct part of the proceedings; and (g) interest on costs from or until a certain date.\" [emphasis supplied] 66. we have noticed that a settlement arrived at in prelitigation mediation under section 12a, is to be treated as an award under section 30(4) of the arbitration and conciliation act. section 30(4) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, reads as follows: \"30(4) an arbitral award on agreed terms shall have the same status and effect as any other arbitral award on the substance of the dispute.\" 67. a mediation settlement arrived at under section 89 of the cpc must be scrutinised by the court and only on its imprimatur being given it is effective [see paragraph 40 of afcons infrastructure https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 limited and another v. cherian varkey construction company private limited and others25]. since a settlement under section 12a of the act is accorded the status of an award under the arbitration & conciliation act, it unerringly points to the object of the legislature to make pre-litigation mediation compulsory. we again underscore the vital role, the lawyers engaged can and must discharge in arriving at a just and valid settlement translating into an effective award and therefore, a decree. 68. rule 7 deals with the procedure to be adopted by the mediator. rule 9 enshrines the principle of confidentiality of mediation. the mediator, the parties, their authorised representatives or counsel are to maintain confidentiality about the mediation. rule 9 further declares that the mediator is not to allow stenographic or audio or video 25 (2010) 8 scc 24 recording of the mediation sittings. 84. one of the arguments of shri saket sikri is that, if a plaint is rejected under order vii rule 11, the plaintiff would be saddled with the deprivation of the court fee paid. he would contend that this aspect may be considered, when the court decides the question as to whether the provision is mandatory or not. whenever a plaint is rejected on the ground that the suit is barred under any law, this consequence is inevitable. [we may only, in this context, observe, that under section 4a of the kerala court fee and suit valuation act, 1959, the plaintiff needs to pay only one-tenth of the total court fee at the time of institution of the suit. the balance is to be paid not later than fifteen days from the date of framing of issues, inter alia. section 4a further provides that if the parties further settle the dispute within the period specified or extended by the court for payment of the balance court fee, the plaintiff shall not be called upon to pay the balance court fee.] if a plaint is rejected for failure to give a notice, as contemplated in section 80 of the cpc, the court fee paid, may be lost. equally, for violation of section 69 of the indian partnership act, if the plaint is rejected, the plaintiff loses the court fee. while it may appear to be hard on the plaintiff, the effect of the provision contained in order vii rule 11, cannot be diluted. therefore, we are not impressed by the argument, subject to what we will hold later on\" and the hon'ble supreme court while discussing in the said judgment has also considered various other judgments in the same line of arguments and finally in paragraph no.84, extracted supra, has decided and declared that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 section 12a of the act is mandatory and further any suit instituted violating the mandatory provision of section 12a must be revisited with the rejection of plaint under order 7 rule 11. in fact, the hon'ble apex court has also held that the power to reject can be exercised even suo motu by the courts, applying the said judgment to the present case on hand, this court finds that the defendant having invoked order 7 rule 11 (a) and (d) of cpc in i.a.no.2 of 2022 in c.o.s.no.9 of 2022 and having invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of this court 's intervention under article 227 of constitution of india and superintending power as against cos no.10 of 2023 in both the suits, there are no records to find that the parties have exhausted rule 12a of the commercial courts act, 2015, as mandated by the hon'ble supreme court in the above said judgments, which mandates that c.o.s. no.9 of 2022 and 10 of 2023 on the file of commercial courts, district judge, salem, have failed. in the nutshell, the crps are decided in the following manner: (i) c.r.p.no.3672 of 2022, which is filed against the one line docket order passed in i.a.no.2 of 2022 [filed to reject the plaint in cos no.9 of 2022 on various grounds including the ground of mainatainability] dated 28.07.2022 is set aside and the said crp is allowed. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 (ii) since the above said crp no.3672 of 2022 is allowed, i.a.no.4 of 2022, seeking amendment of plaint in cos no.9 of 2022, which was allowed by order dated 03.09.2022 is hereby setaside, thereby the crp no.3800 of 2022 is allowed. (iii) c.r.p.no.338 of 2023, which is filed against the docket order dated 20.10.2022 in i.a.no.6 of 2022 [filed to accept the statement of truth] cannot be interefered with and the said crp is dismissed. (iii) c.r.p.no.2123 of 2023, which is filed to strike off the plaint in cos no.10 of 2023 on the file of learned district judge, commercial court, salem is hereby allowed and the plaint in cos no.10 of 2023 is hereby rejected for want of compliance of section 12-a of the commercial courts act, 2015. (iv) it is left open to the parties to work out their remedies available under the act, as held and directed by the hon'ble apex court. consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed. no costs. 30.11.2023 index:yes/no; internet:yes/no speaking / nonspeaking order ssd https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 to the commercial district judge, salem v.bhavani subbaroyan j. ssd c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022 and 338 and 2123 of 2023 c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022 and 12931 of 2023 30.11.2023 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis"
