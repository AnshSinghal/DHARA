SHAH) [1.0] Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order dated  08.08.2017 passed by the learned Judge, Commercial Court, City Civil  Court,   Ahmedabad   below   Exhs.67   in   Commercial   Trade   Mark   Suit  No.8/2017 by which the learned Commercial Court has partly allowed  the said applications - notice of motion and has granted the temporary  injunction   against   the   appellants   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   in  terms of para 38A of the application for interim injunction, the original  defendant No.1 has preferred the present Appeal From Order. \n[2.0] The facts leading to the present Appeal From Order in nutshell  are as under: \n[2.1] That   the   respondent   herein   -   original   plaintiff   has   instituted  Commercial Trade Mark Suit No.8/2017 against the appellant herein -  original defendant in the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad for passing off,  seeking permanent injunction and relief of damages. That in the said suit  the   plaintiff   submitted  an  interim   injunction  application  -   took   out  a  Notice of Motion seeking interim injunction restraining the defendants,  their   agents,   partners,   proprietors,   servants   etc.   from   in   any   manner  using the impugned design including the shape, getup, layout, which is  identical   with   or   colourably   /   deceptively   similar   to   the   plaintiff's  product   and   from   passing   off   their   goods   viz.   Maharaja   Whiteline  Blizzard 50 and Blizzard 50 DLX as also Blizzard 20 and Blizzard 20 DLX  as those of the plaintiff.\n[2.2] It is the case on behalf of the plaintiff so pleaded in the plaint that  earlier the plaintiff Company was incorporated in the name of Sanskrut  Comfort Systems Pvt. Ltd. which subsequently came to be converted into  a Public Limited Company by passing a special resolution and thereafter  the name of the company was changed from Sanskrut Comfort Systems  Pvt. Ltd. to Symphony Comfort Systems Ltd. It is the case on behalf of  the   plaintiff   Company   that   plaintiff   Company   is   in   the   business   of  marketing, selling, trading and exporting of a range of air coolers under  the name of \"SYMPHONY\" nationally and internationally for high quality  products   with   excellent   performance,   aesthetic   outlook   and   unique  design  wherein  in  the  year ending 201516, the total turnover of the  plaintiff exceeded approximately Rs.523.98 crores. 7. It was also averred  in the plaint that considering the worldwide business of the plaintif with  warehouses servicing almost all states, dealers, retailers and distributors  in almost all towns, cities and villages are established and on the basis of  the   well   orchestered   effort   at   constant   innovation   and   consistent  performance, the plaintiff company has been honoured with the award  by   the   Ministry   of   Commerce   and   Industry,   Government   of   India   by  granting a Certificate of Recognition as an Export House in 2009 which  came to be upgraded to a Star Export House. It was also averred that the  plaintiff   is   also   having   a   wellestablished   Research   &   Development  Division (RDD) comprising of highly qualified and experienced engineers  so as to develop better and more efficient products as well as unique and  eye catching designs for their air coolers and other consumer products. \n[2.3] It   was   further   averred   and   submitted   that   apart   from   various  models of air coolers sold by the plaintiff, the plaintiff is also selling the  \"Diet\" model which has a unique design. It was further averred that the  plaintiff   Company   and   the   Founder   /   M.D.   Shri   Achal   Bakeri   is   the  holder of the design registration certificate for the said designs of \"Diet\"  model   under   the   Designs   Act,   2000   whereby   the   Registrar   has   duly  registered the unique designs of various models for sole and exclusive  use of the proprietor and the models in question are \"Diet 50T\" which  has   been   registered   on   04.02.2009   under   Classification   2304   (Air  Cooler) under Design Registration  No.221068;  that \"Diet 22T\" is also  registered on 05.02.2009 under Classification 2304 (Air Cooler) under  Design   Registration   No.221084   \"Diet   8T\"   has   been   registered   on  29.01.2009   under   Classification   2304   (Air   Cooler)   under   Design  Registration   No.220948.   It   is   further   averred   that   pursuant   to   the  Assignment Deed of Design, the same have been assigned in favour of  the plaintiff Company so as to enable the plaintiff Company to market  the said products under the registered designs. It was further averred  that the plaintiff Company has been selling and marketing the air coolers  in   different   shapes   and   models   and   in   order   to   make   the   air   coolers  attractive, eye catching, novel and impressionable to the customers, the  plaintiff developed a novel shape, configuration and pattern for the air  coolers   and   the   said   shape,   configuration,   ornament,   composition   of  lines and pattern have been registered as per the registration details. It  was further averred and the case on behalf of the plaintiff that as the  plaintiff came to know that the defendant No.1 is illegally and without  any   permission   or   authority   manufacturing,   selling   and   marketing   air  coolers   that   are   the   unauthorised   replicas   and   imitations   of   the   air  coolers of the plaintiff viz. \"Diet\" (variants 50T and 22T as also 50i and  22i),  through  its  respective  manufacturing  units  and  retail   outlet and  thereby  passing   off  its   goods   i.e.  air   coolers   viz.  \"Maharaja   Whiteline  Blizzard   50,   Maharaja   Whiteline   Blizzard   20\"   as   well   as   \"Maharaja  Whiteline Blizzard 50 DLX and Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard 20 DLX\",  stating and contending that the air coolers manufactured and marketed  by   defendant   No.1   are   so   strikingly   similar   to   the   air   coolers   of   the  plaintiff i.e. Diet 50T and Diet 22T as well as Diet 50i and Diet 22i which  may   entail   the   purchaser   /   consumer   to   believe   the   products   of  defendant No.1 to be the products of the plaintiff.\n[2.4] It was further averred in the plaint and it was submitted on behalf  of the plaintiff Company that defendant No.1 has recently launched the  aforesaid models as reflects from the model features in February 2017  catalogue and the defendant No.1 has been extensively advertising and  offering   for   sale   the   impugned   air   coolers   through   its   website  www.maharajawhiteline.com. Therefore, it was the case on behalf of the  plaintiff that since the plaintiff has established a unique and wellknown  design which has acquired a secondary meaning by virtue of its use and  goodwill generated in the course of trade or business and therefore, the  same  can  be  considered as   \"Trade   Marks\"  under  the  Shape  of  Goods  category and the same is required to be protected by an action in the  nature of passing off as the overall visual impression which creates in the  minds of customers as to the source and origin of the goods is from the  shape/aesthetic appearance of the goods and consequently an unwary or  a gullible customer may easily get confused between the product of the  plaintiff   and   defendant   No.1   due   to   striking   similarity   in   its   shape,  pattern and overall getup. Therefore, with above particular averments  and   contentions   the   plaintiff   has   instituted   the   suit   for   passing   off  damages, permanent injunction etc. As observed hereinabove in the said  suit   the   plaintiff   has   taken   out   the   Notice   of   Motion   vide   Exhs.67  restraining the defendants, their agents, servants etc. by way of interim  injunction   restraining   them   from   in   any   manner   using   the   impugned  design  including   the   shape,  getup,  layout,   which   is   identical   with   or  colourably   /   deceptively   similar   to   the   plaintiff's   product   and   from  passing off their goods viz. Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard 50 and Blizzard  50 DLX as also Blizzard 20 and Blizzard 20 DLX as those of the plaintiff. \n[2.5] That on being served with the process the defendants appeared  before the learned Commercial Court. The original defendant No.1 filed  its   written   statement   and   reply   to   interim   injunction   application   vide  Exh.19. It was submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1 that the entire  suit and application for interim injunction suffers from suppression of  material  fact  which   disentitles   the  plaintiff   to  claim  any  discretionary  relief. It was also submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1 that the  plaintiff   has   miserably   failed   to   establish   similarities   between   its  products and the products of the defendant No.1 so as to maintain an  action of passing off.\n[2.6] It was further submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1 that the  defendant No.1 was earlier known as Maharaja Whiteline Industries Pvt.  Ltd., which was subsequently taken over by a Group SEB, France in the  year 2014 and accordingly wholly owned subsidiary of Group SEB which  is   one   of   world's   leading   small   domestic   appliances   company   having  global turnover of 5000 Million Euro (approximately Rs.35,000 crores)  in the year 2016 which launches more than 300 products and sell over  200   million   products   every   year   across   the   globe   with   operations  spreading out to 150 countries. It was further submitted on behalf of the  defendant   No.1   that   the   defendant   No.1   has   created   a   distinct   and  unmistakable   image   on   the   basis   of   its   innovative   products   in   home  appliance industries and is also having goodwill and reputation in the  market. It was further averred on behalf of the defendant No.1 that for  having the aesthetic look, new, novel and creative design to the products  in   question,   the   work   of   conceptualizing   and   developing   the   design,  shape, etc. as entrusted to a specialized design firm viz. \"Story Design\" \nand the responsibility for the design front panel and deco control panel  for   the   air   coolers  and   the  adoption  thereof   have   been   raised  by   the  defendant No.1. It was further submitted that the defendant No.1 has  incurred   considerable   expenditure   in   developing,   designing,  manufacturing,   selling   and   marketing   the   product   in   question.  It   was  submitted   that   therefore   the   defendant   No.1   cannot   be   said   to   have  merely   copied   /   imitated   the   design   of   the   plaintiff's   products   (Diet  Model in the case on hand). \n[2.7] It was further submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1 that even  prior to the filing of the suit, the plaintiff was aware of the shape as well  as design of the products in question developed by defendant No.1 way  back   in   January   2016   and   no   grievances   whatsoever   have   been  ventilated by the plaintiff against the defendant No.1 with regard to the  products in question. It was further submitted that even the Controller  General  of  Patent,   Design   and  Trademark  (Authority)   was   pleased   to  register the design developed by defendant No.1 under the Designs Act,  2000 and the certificate to that effect has been issued in favour of the  defendant No.1 which is nothing but a prima facie proof of the defendant  No.1's originality, uniqueness and distinctiveness and the very fact as to  the registration of defendant No.1's design has been suppressed by the  plaintif. It was further submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1 that  even   the   cancelation   proceedings   initiated   by   the   plaintiff   for  cancellation of the registered design of defendant No.1 under Section 19  of   the   Designs   Act,   2000   (vice   versa)   have   not   been   disclosed.   It   is  submitted that therefore, nondisclosure of the aforesaid fact amounts to  suppression   and   concealment   of   the   material   fact   and   therefore,   the  plaintiff is not entitled to the discretionary relief of interim injunction /  injunction.   In   context   of   the   case   of   the   plaintiff   as   to   the  misrepresentation   was   created   in   the   minds   of   the   purchasers   /  customers, it was submitted on behalf of the  original defendant  No.1  that the products in question are materially distinct from each other. It  was   submitted   that   there   is   no   true   comparison   of   the   competing  products. Relying upon the chart prepared by the defendant No.1 and  produced   with   the   list   appended   with   the   written   statement,   it   was  submitted   that   there   is   no   question   of   any   misrepresentation   by   the  defendant   No.1.   It   was   submitted   that   even   a   look   at   the   competing  products through an ordinary purchaser's eye would make it abundantly  clear that there is no chance of any confusion or deceit in the minds of  general   public   regarding   the   origin   of   the   product.   Referring   to   the  products in question and showing the patterns and the distinctiveness of  the products in question, it was submitted on behalf of the defendant  No.1 that there is no possibility of misrepresentation on the part of the  defendant No.1 as the defendant No.1 is selling its products in the brand  name and trade name \"MAHARAJA WHITELINE\" which is distinctively  visible on each of its products. It was submitted that the brand name is  otherwise   wellknown   in   the   home   appliance   industry   and   having   a  distinct reputation and goodwill among the general public.\n[2.8] With   regard   to   the   issue   as   to   shape   and   configuration   of   the  products in question, it was submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1  that both the products in question are materially distinct and different  from each other as is evident from the height, width, length and overall  structure of the products and therefore the same rules out the possibility  of the defendant No.1 having indulged in passing off its goods as those  of   the   plaintiff.   Therefore,   it   was   requested   to   reject   the   interim  injunction application / Notice of Motion.\n[2.9] The   interim   injunction   application   was   also   opposed   by   the  original defendant No.2 by filing detailed reply at Exh.30. The defendant  No.2   supported   the   case   of   the   defendant   No.1   and   made   same  submissions which were made on behalf of the defendant No.1. \n[2.10] That thereafter by impugned order the learned Commercial  Court has partly allowed the Notice of Motion application Exhs.67 and  has   granted   the   temporary   injunction   in   terms   of   para   38A   of   the  application for interim injunction. Clause 38A of the Notice of Motion  Exhs.67   which   has   been   granted   by   the   learned   Judge   by  impugned  order as temporary injunction reads as under: \n\"38A. Pending the hearing and final disposal of the present  Civil Suit, THIS HON'BLE COURT be pleased to restrain each  of   the   Defendants   by   themselves,   its   Directors,   servants,  representatives,   agents,   stockists,   distributors,   retailers   etc.  from   in   any   manner   manufacturing,   marketing,   selling   or  advertising   for   sales   thereby   passing   of   the   goods   viz.  Maharaja   Whiteline   Blizzard   50   and   Maharaja   Whiteline  Blizzard   20   and   Maharaja   Whiteline   Blizzard   50   DLX   and  Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard 20 DLX;\"\nThat   while   allowing   the   Notice   of   Motion   and   granting   the  injunction in terms of Para 38(A) of the Notice of Motion, the learned  Judge has observed as under: \n\"1. That the plaintiff is not only a prior user, but the first who  introduced into the market a completely distinct shape which had  not been introduced earlier and it is this novelty that has been the  engine and cause for numerous sales and the popularity that the  plaintif has earned;\n2. That the plaintiff has created a good reputation nationally  and internationally;\n3. That the sales turnover of the plaintiff for the Diet Model for  the   year  2009   till  2016  is  Rs.73,197  lakh  in  total  and that  the  plaintiff has averred to have spent huge amount on promotion of  its   business   for   the   year   201415   by   spending   more   than  Rs.3134.23 lakh;\n4. That   the   Diet   model   in   question   appears   to   have   been  registered way back in the year 2009 and therefore, admittedly  the   plaintiff   seems   to   be   a   prior   user   with   the   goodwill   and  reputation with respect not only to the other products in question  but also with regard to the Diet Model in question;\n5. That   as   the   design   registration   of   the   plaintiff   and   the  novelty thereof rests and confined to the surface pattern of the  products  in question  and not to the shape and configuration as  submitted   by   the   defendant   No.1   cannot   be   a   sole   ground   to  deprive the plaintiff to subserve its legitimate right;\n6. That the defendant No.1 appears to have recently launched  the product in question in the market as per the invoices issued by  the   defendant   No.1   in   favour   of   the   defendant   No.2   dated  28.03.2017.  Even assumed to have launched its product in 2016,  then also the product so introduced by the plaintiff is of the year  2009;\n7. A comparison of both the products show a striking similarity  considering overall structure, phonetic similarity and idea thereto,  visual test of products in question.\"\nMaking   above   broad   findings   /   observations   the   learned  Commercial Court has granted the interim injunction in terms of para  38(A) of the Notice of Motion Exhs.67. \n[2.11] Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order  passed   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court,   below   Notice   of   Motion  Exhs.67, original defendant No.1 has preferred the present Appeal From  Order. \n[3.0] Shri   Shalin   Mehta,   learned   Senior   Advocate   has   appeared   on  behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1 and Shri Kamal  Trivedi,   learned   Senior   Advocate   has   appeared   on   behalf   of   the  respondent No.1 herein - original plaintiff. \n[4.0] Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant  herein - original defendant No.1 has vehemently submitted that in the  facts and circumstances of the case the learned Commercial Court has  materially erred in allowing the Notice of Motion Exh.67 and granting  the   temporary   injunction   against   the   appellant   herein   -   original  defendant No.1 in  terms  of  para 38(A)  of  the  application   for  interim  injunction. \n[4.1] It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Mehta,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1  that as such while granting interim injunction application, the learned  Commercial Court has not properly appreciated and considered the fact  that as such the plaintiff had not approached the Court with clean hands  and as such suppressed the material fact more particularly with respect  to the date of knowledge of the appellant herein - original defendant  No.1 in the market with its products in question viz. Maharaja Whiteline  Blizzard 50 and Blizzard 50 DLX as also Blizzard 20 and Blizzard 20  DLX.   It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Mehta,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1  that as such the plaintiff made a false statement in the plaint and interim  injunction application to the extent of its knowledge visavis shape and  configuration of the appellant's Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard series of air  coolers. It is submitted that the planitiff made a false statement that he  become   aware   of   the   shape   and   configuration   of   the   appellant's  Maharaja Blizzard series of air coolers in February 2017. It is submitted  that the learned Commercial Court has failed to appreciate that infact in  the cancelation petition filed by the original plaintiff against the original  defendant No.1's registered design No.269833, it was admitted by the  plaintiff about the knowledge of the appellant's products in question and  in the plaint misrepresented its date of knowledge with respect to the  said   products   as   February   2017.   It   is   submitted   that   therefore   the  learned Commercial Court ought to have rejected the interim injunction  application on the said ground alone as it is a settled proposition of law  that   a   party   who   conceals   and   suppress   facts   from   the   Court   is   not  entitled to any relief, much less any equitable relief. \n[4.2]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1 that even  otherwise the learned Commercial Court ought to have appreciated that  the delay in bringing an action of passing off also disentitles the plaintiff  from the equitable relief of injunction. \n[4.3]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1 that even  otherwise on merits also the learned Commercial Court has materially  erred in granting the interim injunction in terms of para 38(A) of the  interim injunction. \n[4.4]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1 that to be  successful in an action of passing off, the claimant has to establish classic  trinity i.e. (1) reputation and goodwill attached to the goods or services  that   the  claimant  supplies   -   goodwill   being   attached  to   the   badge   of  origin,   (ii)   misrepresentation   (whether   or   not   intentional)   by   the  defendant to the public leading or likely to lead public to believe that the  goods or services offered by the defendant are the goods or services of  the claimant and (iii) consquent damage to the goodwill of the claimant.  It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Mehta,   learned   Counsel   appearing   on  behalf   of   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that   it   is   a  settled principle of law that the absence of even one element of passing  off disentitles the claimant from any relief.   It is submitted that in the  present case the plaintiff has infact failed to establish any element of  passing off. It is submitted that therefore the plaintiff has no even prima  facie  case establishing any of the test of passing off and therefore, the  impugned   order   ought   not   to   have   been   passed   by   the   learned  Commercial Court. \n[4.5] It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that  the  learned Commercial Court has failed to appreciate that the plaintiff had  miserably failed to establish that the shape of its 'Diet 50T', 'Diet 22T',  'Diet 50i' and 'Diet 22i' air coolers has acquired distinctiveness  in the  minds of the relevant pubilc as being indicative of the source denoting  plaintiff's products and no one else. \n[4.6]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that   the  learned Commercial Court has failed to appreciate that the plaintiff has  miserably failed to even prima facie establish goodwill in the shape of its  'Diet 50T', 'Diet 22T', 'Diet 50i' and 'Diet 22i' air coolers much less that  the   said   that   the   said   shape   of   the   air   coolers   has   become   a   source  indicator of the plaintiff's products and no one else. \n[4.7]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that   the  learned Commercial Court has materially erred in observing and holding  that the plaintiff is a prior user of the shape of the air coolers - Diet  series air coolers. It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel  appearing on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1  that even the plaintiff has failed to establish and prove the goodwill in  their favour emanating from the shape of the 'Diet series' of air coolers in  India. It is submitted that whatever the documents of sale and goodwill  are   produced   are   that   of   foreign   countries   and   not   in   India.   It   is  submitted that therefore the finding recorded by the learned Commercial  Court   that   the   plaintiff   has  earned   the   goodwill  with   respect   to  'Diet  series' of air coolers and therefore, the learned Commercial Court has  materially erred in granting the injunction in favour of the plaintiff and  against the defendants. \n[4.8]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that   the  learned   Commercial   Court   has   erred   in   not   appreciating   that   the  registration   of   design   of   the   plaintiff   in   relation   to   its   air   coolers   is  admittedly in the \"surface pattern\", whereas, the registration of design of  the  defendant No.1  in  relation  to  its  air  coolers   is  in   the  \"shape   and  configuration\".   It   is   submitted   that   therefore   the   entire   action   of   the  plaintiff is completely misplaced and therefore, no injunction could have  been granted in favour of the plaintiff . \n[4.9]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that   the  learned  Commercial   Court   has   materially   erred   by   wrongly   placing  reliance   on   the   advertisements   placed   by   the   plaintiff   for   appointing  distributors and dealers in India. It is submitted that apart from the fact  that the said advertisement was not produced alongwith the plaint even  the   said   advertisements   are   with   respect   to   the   air   coolers   of   all   the  shapes,   dimensions   and   sizes.   It   is   submitted   that   therefore   these  advertisements would have no bearing on the mind of the purchasing  public qua the shape of the 'Diet series' of air coolers as being a source  indicated   by   the   plaintiff.   It   is   submitted   that   similarly   the   brochure  placed   on   record   by   the   plaintiff   contains   air   coolers   of   all   shapes,  dimensions and sizes and therefore, cannot be considered as indicative  of the goodwill of the shape of the 'Diet series' of air coolers.  It is further  submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the  appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that   as   such   the   learned  Commercial   Court   has   materially   erred   in   equating   the   goodwill   and  reputation knowledge by the plaintiff with the goodwill and reputation  associated with the shape of 'Diet series' air coolers. It is submitted that  the   same  cannot be  equated or considered  on  the  same footing.  It is  further submitted that  as such the  learned Commercial Court has not  properly appreciated the distinction and difference between the goodwill  and reputation.  It is  submitted  that goodwill  and reputation  are both  distinct and separate. It is submitted that in a given case the plaintiff  might   have   got   the   reputation   but   may   not   have   acquired   /   got   the  goodwill with respect to particular goods with respect to the passing off  action. \n[4.10]   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Mehta,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1  that even otherwise the learned Commercial Court has materially erred  in   not   properly   appreciating   the   fact   that   the   there   can   be   no  misrepresentation or confusion in the mind of purchaser when they go to  purchase the  air coolers, as the  appellant herein - original defendant  No.1 is selling its products which are subject matter of the many order  under its own distinct trade mark / name \"Maharaja Whiteline\" and the  distinct name of the product \"Blizzard\" is also prominently displayed on  the product. It is submitted that trade mark / name which has been in  use   by   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   since   the   year  1976 and the defendant No.1 has an annual turnover of approximately  231 Crores for the year 201516 itself and therefore, the defendant No.1  is a wellknown brand with a huge reputation and goodwill amongst the  public. It is submitted that thus when the appellant - original defendant  No.1's goodwill is itself immense, the likelihood of public confusing the  defendant No.1's good as those of the plaintiff or being associated with  the plaintiff is negligible. \n[ 4.11 ]   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Mehta,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1  that even otherwise there can be no misrepresentation or confusion in  the  minds  of  the  purchasing  public  as  the  competing  products  of  the  defendant No.1  \"Maharaja Whiteline\" the air coolers are visually and  aesthetically different. It is submitted that the impugned products of the  defendant   No.1   bear   no   resemblance   whatsoever   in   the   shape   and  configuration,   pattern,   ornamentation   or   overall   appearance   with   the  products of the plaintiff. It is submitted that in the present case despite  the   learned   Judge   observing   that   these   similarities   exist   between  competing products which are the subject matter of the present dispute ,  the learned Commercial Court has wrongly concluded that the shape,  configuration and overall appearance of the products in question of the  defendant No.1 - Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard series of air coolers are  strikingly similar. It is submitted that considering the aforesaid facts and  circumstances,   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   wrongly   concluded  that   the   plaintiff   has   a  prima   facie  case,   the   balance   of   convenience  favours the plaintiff and that irreparable harm or injury would be caused  to the plaintiff if the appellant herein - original defendant No.1 is not  restrained by an order of injunction. \nMaking above submissions and relying upon following decisions, it  is requested to allow the  present appeal and quash and set aside  the  impugned order of interim injunction passed by the learned Commercial  Court. \n1.

John & another (2008) 152 DLT 405 Delhi High Court  [5.0] Present   appeal   is   vehemently   opposed   by   Shri   Kamal   Trivedi,  learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff. \n[5.1] Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the original  plaintiff has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of  the case the learned Commercial Court has rightly granted the interim  injunction   against   the   defendant   No.1   and   the   same   is   granted  considering the material on record and having  prima facie  observed in  favour   of   the   plaintiff   that   plaintiff   has   made   out   a   case   against   the  defendant with respect to passing off its \"Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard  50,   Maharaja   Whiteline   Blizzard   20\"   as   well   as   \"Maharaja   Whiteline  Blizzard 50 DLX and Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard 20 DLX\" air coolers in  question.   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned  Counsel  appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such the plaintiff is  the pioneer in the business of coolers. It is submitted that the plaintiff  came out with a specially designed Tower Coolers in the year 2009 and  their products - Diet Series air coolers are in market since 2009 which  looking to its special design and shape has acquired a unique identity in  the market in the field of air coolers.   \n[5.2] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   original   plaintiff   that   as   such   the   plaintiff   has   been  successful in establishing and proving all the three conditions required  for the purpose of getting the injunction with respect to passing off its  goods, 1) prior user; 2) having acquired goodwill and reputation. It is  submitted   that   therefore   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   rightly  granted the injunction. \n[5.3] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such goodwill signifies the value  of business in terms of turnover. It is submitted that reputation follows  the goodwill. It is submitted that the plaintiff has both, goodwill and also  reputation   and   therefore,   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   rightly  granted the injunction against the defendant No.1 with respect to the  products in question. \n[5.4] Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the original  plaintiff has taken us to findings recorded by the learned Commercial  Court on prior user, on the plaintiff's acqiuring goodwill and reputation  and also the goodwill with respect to their Diet Series air coolers more  particularly with respect to the shape - unique shape and tower coolers  and   the   relevant   documents   /   material   on   record   which   should   have  been considered by the learned Commercial Court. \n[5.5] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such the suit is for passing off  action and the injunction is against the defendants for passing off their  goods  in  question.  It is  submitted  that  while  considering  the  case  for  passing off only, as per catena of decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court  as well as this Court only the particular similarities are to be looked at  and the microscopic dissimilarities are not required to be considered. It  is submitted that by and large overall similarities are to be considered. It  is   submitted   that   on   considering   both   the   products   in   question   the  learned Commercial Court has specifically given a finding that both the  products - products in question of the plaintiff as well as products in  question   of   the   defendant   No.1   are   by   and   large   having   overall  similarities. It is submitted that therefore when there are by and large  overall similarities there are all chances of confusion amongst the people  purchasing air coolers and therefore, the learned Commercial Court has  rightly granted the injunction. \n[5.6] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such there are no suppression of  material facts more particularly with respect to the date of knowledge of  goods   in   question   of   the   defendant   No.1   as   alleged   on   behalf   of   the  defendant   No.1.   For   the   aforesaid   he   has   taken   us   to   the   relevant  documents / material on record namely cancelation petition as well as  the averments in the plaint as well as the rejoinder before the learned  Commercial Court on the allegation of suppression. It is submitted that  therefore it can be said that defendant No.1 is not right in submitting  that   the   plaintiff   is   not   entitled   for   grant   of   relief   on   the   ground   of  suppression of material facts. It is submitted that as such the design of  the air coolers by the defendant No.1 was converted into Blizzard model  only in the month of February 2017. It is submitted that even otherwise  it makes no difference whether the defendant No.1 is in market since  2016 and/or in 2017 as such the plaintiff is in the market of selling the  Diet series air coolers since 2009. It is submitted that as such in the year  2009 the defendant No.1 was not even born. \n[5.7] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   original   plaintiff   that   as   such   the   plaintiff   has   been  successful   in  proving  prima   facie  at   this   stage   their   goodwill   and  repuation and even with respect to the Diet coolers. \n[5.8] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the original planitiff that while considering the action for  passing off and grant of injunction on the allegation of passing off, mere  representation is enough and the intention is not required to be proved. \n[5.9] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such the defendant No.1 has not  explained why the defendant No.1 has chosen the tower wall design of  the air cooler and why not other shape. It is submitted that they should  have   adopted   other   shape.   It   is   submitted   that   aforesaid   shows   the  intention on the part of the defendant No.1 in passing off of their goods  deceptively with that of the plaintiff's goods. \n[ 5.10 ] It is further submitted that in case of passing off and grant  of injunction likelihood of damages itself is sufficient. It is submitted that  mere likelihood is more than sufficient while granting the injunction. \n[5.11] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that the findings recorded by  the   learned   Commercial   Court   while   granting   injunction   more  particularly   the   findings   recorded   in   para   81   onwards   are   on  appreciation of evidence / material on record which are neither perverse  nor   contrary   to   the   evidence   on   record   and   therefore,   the   impugned  order of grant of injunction is not required to be interfered with by this  Court. \nMaking   above   submissions   and   relying   upon   the   following  decisions, it is requested to dismiss the present appeal. \n1.

Ltd. 2008 (3) GLR 2635 (Para 29) [6.0] Heard learned Counsel appearing for respective parties at length. \nAt the outset it is required to be noted that by the impugned order  the learned Commercial Court, City Civil Court, Ahmedabad has partly  allowed   the   Notice   of   Motion   Exhs.67   and   has   granted   the   interim  injunction  in  favour of the  original plaintiff  restraining  the  appellants  herein - original defendants by themselves, its Directors, servants etc.  from in any manner using the impugned design including the shape, get up, layout, which is identical with or colourably / deceptively similar to  the   plaintiff's  product and from  passing  off their  goods  viz. Maharaja  Whiteline   Blizzard   50,   Maharaja   Whiteline   Blizzard   20,   Maharaja  Blizzard 50DLX and Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard 20 DLX which being a  similar   design   -   tower   design   specially   created   and   designed   by   the  plaintiffs which is deceptively similar to that of plaintiff's product - air  coolers  \"Diet\" models. The plaintiffs have instituted the suit against the  defendants for passing off action alleging passing off their products -  produce designs, configurations, including \"Diet\" models, designs etc. of  the plaintiffs.  \n[6.1] Having   found  prima   facie  case   and   balance   of   convenience   etc.  and having found prima facie case that the aircoolers manufactured and  being   sold   by   the   defendants        Maharaja   Whiteline   Blizzard   50,  Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard 20, Maharaja Blizzard 50DLX and Maharaja  Whiteline Blizzard 20 DLX are deceptively similar to that of the design /  tower  models -  Diet  models  designed, manufactured and sold by the  plaintiffs, by impugned order the learned Commercial Court has granted  the injunction against the defendants. \n[6.2] That while considering the impugned order the findings recorded  by   the   learned   Commercial   Court   are   required   to   be   referred   to   and  considered, which are as under: \n(1) That the plaintiff company is in the business of marketing,  selling, trading and exporting a range of air coolers and pioneer in  establishing   or   marketing   or   producing   or   manufacturing   the  plastic body air coolers;\n(2) That   the   definition   of   \"mark\"   under   section   2(z)   of   the  Trade Marks Act include shape of goods;\n(3) That   the   plaintiff   is   operating   under   the   trade   name   of  \"Symphony\"   and   the   company's   total   turn   over  exceeded  approximately Rs.523.98 crores;\n(4) That the plaintiffs, its Directors got design of the questioned  product registered under the provisions of the Design Act, 2000; (5) That the plaintiff is pioneer in manufacturing of aircoolers  etc. and the plaintiff has been given ISO certification;\n       (6)      That design of each model has been registered;\n       (7)      That the defendant has got the design of the aircooler in  question registered in the year 2015, whereas the plaintiff have  got registration of the design in the year 2009 and since then the  plaintiff   has   been   selling   and   manufacturing   and   exporting   the  products in question;\n(8) That the plaintiff is prior user and the first who introduced  into the market a completely distinct shape which has not been  introduced earlier;\n(9) That   the  plaintiff  had  received   an   award   being  a  Quality  Marks Award - 2014 for his \"Diet\" model 22T and thereby has  created good reputation nationally and internationally.\n[6.3] It   is   also   further   observed   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court   in  paras 99 to 103 as under: \n\"99. It is pertinent to note here that since the issue on hand is  for   consideration   of   action   of   passing   of   and   therefore   the  said action can be said to be a recurring action and based on  Common Law rights. However, the entire issue rests on the  overall   shape,   configuration,   getup   and   appearance   of   the  products   in   question   and   the   possibility   of   deceit   and  confusion   in   the   minds   of   purchasers.   Thus,   admittedly  considering the  issue on hand which pertains to passing of  action, the plaintif is required to prove that the plaintif is a  prior user, adopter, prior registered proprietor of the design  in question who admittedly appears to have sold the products  in   question   in   the   market   and   its   sales   turnover   runs   into  crores of rupees and sales promotional expenses also in lacs  of   rupees   whereas   the   defendant   No.1   though   appears   to  have been 60 engaged in the manufacturing and selling the  products   of   home   appliances,   however   considering   the  products   in   question   -   disputed   products,   the   defendants  appear to have launched the products as acquainted by the  plaintif since September 2016 (or January 2016). Thus, the  defendants, so far as the products in question are concerned,  seems to be new comer who appears to harp over and to take  the   advantage   of   the   reputation   and   association   of   the  plaintif's products which amounts to an act of passing of. \nCOMPARISON OF BOTH THE PRODUCTS VISUALLY: \n100.   To   meet   with   the   issue   as   raised   by   the   defendants  pertains   to   the   products   in   question   manufactured   and  developed by the defendant No.1, a completely distinct, both  visually and aesthetically from that of the plaintif and no case  for any confusion, much less deceit and also on account of  the shape, configuration on the ground that the product of  the plaintif have attained a secondary meaning and pattern of  the   product   and   resemblance   thereof   with   the   shape,  configuration, pattern of the plaintif's products and the issue  as   to   the   product,   if   placed   side   by   side   as   well   as   on  independent comparison of both the products, it cannot be  said that the product of the defendant No.1 is leading and/or  likely to lead general public to believe that the goods ofered  by defendant No.1 are of the plaintif. 61 Thus, the aforesaid  issues  in  the  form  of  submissions,  are required to be dealt  with   in   compass   of   the   entire   material   placed   for  consideration on record. \n101. It is not in dispute that the whole case of the plaintif  rests   on   the   shape,   configuration,   pattern,   etc.   as   to   the  product in question as disputed by the defendant No.1. At the  outset,   it   is   to   state   that   at   the   joint   request   made   by   the  learned Senior Advocates appearing for the respective parties  seeking   permission   to   produce   their   respective   products  before the Court vide Exh.27 and therefore this Court while  conceding the request, has had an occasion to see both the  products  in question  which  were brought before this  Court  during   the   course   of   hearing   and   therefore   the   question  whether the two are deceptively similar or not, the test, as  held by several High Courts is, what appeals to the eye of the  Judge   on   the   first   impression   and   therefore,   the   first  impression  has  to be  of  a  person with   average  intelligence  and/or imperfect recollection. \n102. Even during the course of hearing, the learned Senior  Advocate   appearing   for   the   defendant   No.1   has   tried   to  distinguish and show the dissimilarities between the products  in question while referring the front view, rear view, upper  view and lower view. However, the said test is to be applied  and pertains to the infringement of the design under Section  22 of the Designs Act, 2000 which at the most may fall under  the category and issue of 62 fraudulent or obvious imitation  thereof   which   amounts   to   an   act   of   piracy   and/or  infringement. Therefore, this  Court in  the  preamble of  this  order has made it categorically clear that several contentions  raised   by   the   learned   Senior   Advocates   appearing   for   the  respective parties which pertains to the infringement of the  design would not be entertained as the entire gamut of the  case on hand is dispute as to passing of which only rests on  the   shape,   configuration   and   overall   appearance   of   the  products in question. In nutshell, a comparison of both the  products show a striking similarity, however eforts seems to  have been made by the learned Senior Advocate appearing  for   the   defendant   No.1   to   show   dissimilarities,   but  considering   the   test   requires   to   be   adopted   is   to   see   the  salient features, overall similarity, is the touchstone, mark or  product   must   be   viewed   by   observing   overall   structure,  phonetic similarity and idea thereto, visual test of products in  question. In short mark must be compared as a whole instead  of microscopic examination as the products are placed side by  side   only   to   find   out   diference   as   overall   similarity   as  appearing in case on hand, is sufficient. \n103. Apart from the goodwill and turnover of the products in  question   and   in   furtherance   thereof   as   to   the   substantial  goodwill and reputation inheres in the plaintif's products in  question which seems to have been launched way back in the  year 2009 and the 63 very fact has not been disputed by the  defendants .   Not   only   that,   at   the   relevant   time,   no   other  product   as   launched   by   the   plaintif   and   with   the   similar  comparable shape/appearance existed in the market prior to  the introduction thereof by the plaintif. Thus, the product in  question   so   launched   by   the   plaintif   at   the   relevant   time  acquired   a   distinctive   shape   and/or   getup   and/or   colour  scheme and/or overall appearance (surface pattern) cannot  be disputed.\" \nIt is further observed in paras 105 to 107 as under: \n\"105. In furtherance of the aforesaid aspect, even the product  in   question   introduced   by   the   plaintif   at   the   relevant   time  wherein prior thereto, no such product or similar thereof or  comparable   shape   and   overall   appeals   existed   and   the  gestures   of   the   plaintif   while   launching   such   product  completely amounts to a revolutionary and of distinct shape  which   had   not   been   introduced   earlier   and   therefore,   the  same   can   be   termed   as   a   novelty   itself   of   the   product   in  question which generated a huge sale and popularity. \n106.   Though   the   eforts   seems   to   have   been   made   by   the  defendant   No.1   by   placing   forward   the   ground   as   to   the  product in question being commonly known / design having  overall similar appearance as that of the impugned design of  the   plaintif   having   been   so   granted   in   favour   of   Lesko  Holdings by the USPTO in 2006. However, while perusing the  material in support of its contention, it prima facie appears  that   the   said   image,   the   xerox   copy   of   which   has   been  produced by the defendant No.1, is a body for a vertical fan  whereas the impugned product in question is an air cooler. \n107.   Not   only   that,   the   overall   appearance   of   the   said  product, comparing with the impugned product, stands on a  diferent footing. Thus, the protest so lodged by the defendant  No.1 while placing forward the aforesaid product to disentitle  the claim of the plaintif with regard to the impugned product,  would   not   come   to   the   rescue   of   the   contention   of   the  defendant   No.1   as   the   defendant   No.1   seems   to   have  launched its product admittedly in January 2016 whereas the  product of the plaintif in question, as discussed hereinabove,  was launched in 2009 and at that time, no other product with  the similar or comparable shape and/or overall appearance  existed in the market prior to the introduction thereof by the  plaintif and the very existence amounts to goodwill and/or  reputation   in   the   shape   and/or   overall   appearance   of   the  product in question.\"\n[6.4] Considering   the   findings   recorded   which   are  prima   facie  on  appreciation   of   evidence   /   material   on   record   and   thereafter   having  opined   /   observed   that   the   case   for   passing   off   is   made   out   and  thereafter   the   learned   Commercial   Judge   has   granted   the   interim  injunction as prayed for in terms of para 38A, we are of the opinion that  it can not be said that the learned Judge has committed any error . The  findings recorded by the learned Commercial Court are on appreciation  of evidence and having found  prima facie  case, balance of convenience  etc. Once having found the deceptive similarity between the products in  question of the plaintiffs and the products in question of the defendants  and having found that the plaintiffs introduced the design first time of a  tower model - Diet model which had earned a reputation, goodwill etc.  and the plaintiff is in prior use of the said design / models and having  given   the   aforesaid   findings,   we   are   of   the   opinion   that   the   case   of  passing off has been made out and therefore, the learned Commercial  Court has rightly granted the injunction referred to hereinabove. \n[6.5] Number   of   decisions   have   been   cited   by   the   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the respective parties referred to hereinabove.  However, all the decisions are required to be considered in the facts and  circumstances   of   the   case   and   a  prima   facie  case   being   made   out,  considering the principles to be considered while granting the case of  passing off. Therefore, we are of the opinion that though we agree with  the proposition of law laid down in the cited decisions relied upon by  the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, same shall not  be applicable to the facts of the case on hand more particularly with  respect   to   the   findings   arrived   at   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court  referred to hereinabove. \n[ 6.6 ] We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned  Commercial Court. No interference of this Court is called for against the  impugned interim injunction granted by the learned Commercial Court. \n[7.0] In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, we see no  reason   to   interfere   with   the   impugned   order   passed   by   the   learned  Commercial Court. Under the circumstances, present Appeal From Order  deserves to be dismissed and is, accordingly, dismissed. \nBeing a commercial dispute arising out of the Commercial Courts  Act ,   the   learned   Judge,   Commercial   Court   is   directed   to   decide   and  dispose   of   the   suit   at   the   earliest.   All   concerned   are   directed   to  cooperate  the   learned   Commercial   Court  in   early  disposal   of  the   suit  being a commercial dispute. It is observed that findings recorded by the  learned Commercial Court and confirmed by this Court are to be treated  and considered as  prima facie  while deciding applications Exh.67 and  the   learned   Commercial   Court   to   decide   and   dispose   of   the   suit   in  accordance with law and on its own merits. \nWith this, present Appeal from Order stands dismissed. \nCIVIL APPLICATION NO.1 OF 2017 In   view   of   dismissal   of   main   Appeal   from   Order,   present   Civil  Application also stands dismissed. \nSd/          (M.R.

notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than

jasola new delhi v. m/s action construction equipments ltd. dudhohla and 3 others. 5, m/s. escorts construction equipment ltd. v. m/s gautam engineering company and another 6, salutri remedies v. unim pharma lab pvt. ltd 7 and standard glass beads factory and another v. shri dhar and ors 8 to contend that the high court erred in law in transferring the suit to the commercial court (district level) while setting aside the order passed by the commercial court to transfer the said suit to the ilr 2008 kar 2533 2016 scc online all 975 air 2010 j&k 13 2009 scc online guj 9488 air 1961 all 101 high court. it was also argued that the high court erred in holding that since an appeal against the order of cancellation by the controller lies to the high court, the transfer would not be sustainable for the reason that the appellate jurisdiction is distinct from the original jurisdiction in a plea for cancellation of the design in a suit in terms of the provisions of 2000 act. 7. on the other hand, mr. assudani, learned counsel for the respondent relied upon the order of this court in godrej sara lee as well as whirlpool of india v. videocon industries ltd. 9 to support the order passed by the high court. 8. we have heard learned counsel for the parties. the 2015 act deals with two situations i.e. the high courts which have ordinary original civil jurisdiction and the high courts which do not have such jurisdiction. the high court of madhya pradesh does not have the ordinary original civil jurisdiction. in areas where the high courts do not have ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the commercial courts at the district level are to be constituted under section 3 of the 2015 act. the state government is also empowered to fix the pecuniary limit of the commercial courts at the district level in consultation with the concerned high court. in terms of section 3(2) of the 2015 2014 scc online bom 565 act, the court of district judge at indore is notified to be a commercial court. \"commercial dispute\" within the meaning of section 2(c)(xvii) of the act, 2015 includes the dispute pertaining to \"intellectual property rights relating to registered and unregistered trademarks, copyright, patent, design, domain names, geographical indications and semiconductor integrated circuits.\" therefore, disputes related to design are required to be instituted before a commercial court constituted under section 3 of the said act. 9. on the other hand, section 4 of the 2015 act provides that where the high courts have ordinary original civil jurisdiction, a commercial division is required to be constituted. further, in terms of section 5 of the act, a commercial appellate division is required to be constituted. section 7 of the act deals with the suits and applications relating to the commercial disputes of a specified value filed in the high court having ordinary original jurisdiction, whereas, the second proviso contemplates that all suits and the applications transferred to the high court by virtue of sub-section (4) of section 22 of 2000 act shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the high court in all the areas over which the high court exercises ordinary original civil jurisdiction. 10. it is thus contended that in the high courts having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the suits which have been transferred to the high court by virtue of sub-section (4) of section 22 of the act are required to be dealt with by the commercial division of the high court instead of a bench of the high court, in terms of the rules appliable to each high court. thus, the suit pertaining to design under the 2000 act would be transferred to the commercial division from the ordinary original civil jurisdiction, i.e., from one bench to the other exclusive court dealing with commercial disputes. 11. it is pertinent to mention that section 7 of the 2015 act only deals with the situation where the high courts have ordinary original civil jurisdiction. there is no provision in the 2015 act either prohibiting or permitting the transfer of the proceedings under the 2000 act to the high courts which do not have ordinary original civil jurisdiction. further, section 21 of the 2015 act gives an overriding effect, only if the provisions of the act have anything inconsistent with any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of law other than this act. since the 2015 act has no provision either prohibiting or permitting the transfer of proceedings under the 2000 act, section 21 of the 2015 act cannot be said to be inconsistent with the provisions of the 2000 act. it is only the inconsistent provisions of any other law which will give way to the provisions of the 2015 act. in terms of section 22(4) of the 2000 act, the defendant has a right to seek cancellation of the design which necessarily mandates the courts to transfer the suit. the transfer of suit is a ministerial act if there is a prayer for cancellation of the registration. in fact, transfer of proceedings from one bench to the commercial division supports the argument raised by learned counsel for the appellant that if a suit is to be transferred to commercial division of the high court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, then the civil suit in which there is plea to revoke the registered design has to be transferred to the high court where there is no ordinary original civil jurisdiction. 12. the judgment in godrej sara lee arises out of an order passed by the controller of patent & designs, kolkata under section 19(1) of the 2000 act, cancelling the registered designs belonging to the respondent therein. the question examined was as to whether the delhi high court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeals against the order of the controller. the respondent had also filed a civil suit before the delhi high court alleging infringement of registered designs and thus seeking cancellation of the designs. later, the controller of design cancelled three designs belonging to the respondent. this order of cancellation was challenged by the respondent before the high court. in these circumstances, the question examined was regarding interpretation of the expression high court used in section 19(2) and 22(4) of the 2000 act and section 51a of the indian patents and designs act, 1911 10. 13. it was held that any application for cancellation of registration under section 19 could be filed only before the controller and not to the high court. therefore, in these circumstances, it was held that the high court would be entitled to assume jurisdiction only in appeal. it was not a case of suit for infringement in which the defendant has raised a plea of revocation of registration which is required to be transferred to the high court in terms of section 22(4) of the 2000 act. therefore, such judgment has been wrongly relied upon by the high court assuming that the proceedings are before the controller and that the plaintiff/respondent had filed a suit for infringement wherein a plea of revocation of registration was raised which was required to be transferred to the high court in terms of section 22(4) of the 2000 act. 14. furthermore, in the 2000 act, there are two options available to seek revocation of registration. one of them is before the controller, appeal against which would lie before the high court. second, in a suit for infringement in a proceeding before the civil court on the for short the ‘1911 act' basis of registration certificate, the defendant has been given the right to seek revocation of registration. in that eventuality, the suit is to be transferred to the high court in terms of sub-section (4) of section 22 of the 2000 act. both are independent provisions giving rise to different and distinct causes of action. 15. in standard glass beads, the 1911 act was under examination before the division bench of the allahabad high court. section 29 thereof permits a suit to be filed by a patentee wherein the defendant could raise a plea of revocation of patent in a counter-claim. considering section 29 of the act, it was held as under: \"10. the expression \"shall be transferred\" in our judgment means \"shall stand transferred\"; and the district judge is left with no jurisdiction save to make such order as is necessary to secure the physical transfer of the records of the case to the high court. if this meaning be not given to these words there will be an element of uncertainty both with regard to the time when the record of the case is to be sent to the high court and to the powers of the district court during the period which is allowed to elapse before the record is in fact transferred.\" 16. the said view was reiterated by another single bench of allahabad high court in a judgment reported as r. n. gupta after the enactment of the 2000 act. the court held as under: \"35. apart from that, looking from another angle, in case it is left open to district court to proceed further to record any satisfaction on the material filed on record in support of the ground taken by the defendant as available under section 19, it would mean that the district court would be entering into the jurisdiction of the controller of the designs as provided to him under section 19 or of the high court, in case any such proceedings for cancellation of registration are proceeded further by the controller of designs or are sent to the high court. to my mind, the district court can go only to the extent of satisfying itself as to whether ground, on which the registration of design may be cancelled under section 19, has been availed as a ground of defence or not. it cannot go into the merits of the defence so taken by the defendant as it would amount to exceeding his jurisdiction, which can only be gone into by the high court on transfer of the case to the high court as to whether there is any force or not in such defence taken by the defendant under section 19 of the act. 36. in such view of the matter, once, on bare reading of the reply filed to the interim injunction application, it is found that that a defence or ground under section 19 is availed of, nothing further is to be seen by the district court and he has no option but to transfer the case to the high court for decision including the interim injunction application.\" 17. similar view was taken by single bench of karnataka high court in a judgment reported as m/s astral polytechnic, wherein the court held as under: \"15. in that view of the matter, the order passed by the trial judge refusing to transfer the pending suit to this court when admittedly the second defendant has taken a defence under sec. 19 of the act contending that the design which is registered in favour of the plaintiff was not registerable at all, is erroneous and liable to be quashed.\" 18. to the same effect is a judgment of jammu and kashmir high court reported as m/s. escorts construction equipment, wherein it is held that once a defence is taken for revocation of registration, then in terms of sub-section (4) of section 22 of the 2000 act, the civil court has no power to decide the revocation of the design and it is only the high court which has to adjudicate upon the matter and decide as to whether the design is to be cancelled or not. it was held that the learned trial court committed a legal error in not transferring the case to the high court. 19. the bombay high court in whirlpool of india was dealing with a suit against the defendant for infringement of the registered designs; passing off; and the damages. the defendant never sought the cancellation of the registration granted to the plaintiff but relied upon the registration granted to it. in these circumstances, the high court held as under: \"19. in support of its contention that the defendant's registered design can only be challenged by proceedings under section 19 of the act before the controller, the defendant would argue that the availability of a remedy under section 19 of the act for cancellation of a registered design amounts to a negation and exclusion of remedy under section 22 of the act. this is plainly incorrect. section 19 and section 22 of the act operate independently in different circumstances. section 19 of the act is invoked to seek cancellation of a registration of a design. section 22 of the act is invoked where a registered design of a proprietor is infringed by any person and the registered proprietor seeks reliefs in the form of damages, injunction, etc. against the infringer. such relief can be sought even against a registered proprietor of a design by questioning his registration. the defendant too can submit that the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief in terms of damages, injunction etc. by questioning the registration of the plaintiff's on grounds available under section 19 of the act for cancellation of a registration. again, section 19 entitles a party to move the controller for cancellation of a design even where the registered proprietor is not using the design. section 19 therefore affords a cause of action where a mere registration is considered objectionable and a mere factum of registration affords a cause of action. in marked contrast, section 22 of the act affords a cause of action only where a registered design is being applied or caused to be applied to any article for the purposes of sale or in relation to or in connection with such sale. consequently, if a registered proprietor does not apply his design to an article for sale or in connection with such sale, another registered proprietor cannot have recourse to section 22 of the act. the remedy under section 22 of the act is only available where the impugned design is being used. a further distinction between section 19 and 22 of the act, as correctly pointed out on behalf of the plaintiff is that while section 19 is applicable to ‘any person interested', section 22 is available only to a small segment of such person viz. registered proprietors. the remedy under section 19 and the remedy under section 22 are therefore very different. they apply to different persons in different circumstances and for different reliefs.\" 20. in view of the above, the order of the commercial court at the district level is in accordance with law. however, we are unable to agree with the commercial court to transfer such suit to calcutta high court. the high court, where the cause of action arises has the jurisdiction to entertain the suit in terms of godrej sara lee. since no part of cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of kolkata, the suit is liable to be transferred to madhya pradesh high court, indore bench. in fact, the plaintiff has filed suit at indore, madhya pradesh only. 21. thus, we find that the order of the high court is not sustainable. the same is set aside and the matter is remitted to the high court of madhya pradesh, indore bench, who shall decide the suit in accordance with law. the appeal is disposed of in the above terms. .j.
