Mishra, J.      The Writ Petition has been preferred challenging\n\n       the order dated 18.07.2024 in Arbp No.02 of 2024 passed by\n\n       the District Judge, Cuttack, vide which it was ordered that\n\n       the said Court lacks jurisdiction over the subject to entertain\n\n       the application filed under Section 9 of the Arbitration and\n Conciliation Act, 1996, shortly hereinafter, 'the Act, 1996' and\n\nordered to transfer the matter to the Commercial Court, \n\nCuttack. \n\n2.           The factual matrix, which led to filing of the\n\npresent Writ Petition, is that on 17.05.2022, the Petitioner\n\nand the Opposite Party Nos.1 & 2 entered into a Partnership\n\nAgreement for smooth running of the movie business\n\ninherited from their father in the name and style as M/s.\n\nBrajaraj Movies. The said partnership agreement was reduced\n\nto writing in shape of Deed of Agreement and subsequently\n\nregistered with the I.G.R., Odisha, Cuttack on 31.05.2022,\n\nvide registration No.720202200555. The Opposite Party No.1,\n\ninstead of extending his cooperation for smooth running of\n\nthe business of the firm, allegedly violated the terms of the\n\nsaid Deed of Agreement and committed breach of trust, as\n\nhas been detailed in the Writ Petition. When the Petitioner\n\ntried to contact the Opposite Party No.1 to ascertain the fact\n\nand resolve the issue amicably, the Opposite Party No.1 did\n\nnot come forward to resolve the said dispute. Hence, the\n\nPetitioner and the Opposite Party No.2 were constrained to\n\nlodge an F.I.R. against the Opposite Party No.1 in Purighat\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                              Page 2 of 36\n P.S. on 05.02.2024. They also issued a legal notice on\n\n07.02.2024 for appointment of an Arbitrator in terms of\n\nClause-15 of the Deed of Agreement dated 17.05.2022, which\n\nwas received by the Opposite Party No.1 on 08.01.2024. The\n\nPetitioner and the Opposite Party No.2 thereby requested to\n\nextend consent within seven days from the date of receipt of\n\nthe said notice for appointment of an Arbitrator to arbitrate\n\nand resolve the said dispute. However, the Opposite Party\n\nNo.1, after receipt of the said legal notice dated 07.02.2024\n\nfor appointment of an Arbitrator, gave a reply vide letter dated\n\n22.02.2024 expressing his unwillingness for giving his\n\nconsent for appointment of the Arbitrator to resolve the said\n\ndispute. Finding no other way out, the Petitioner preferred an\n\napplication under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 before this\n\nCourt praying for appointment of an Arbitrator in terms of\n\nClause 15 of the Deed of Agreement dated 17.05.2022, which\n\nhas been registered as Arbp No.09 of 2024 and the same is\n\nstill pending for consideration before this Court. As the\n\nOpposite Party No.1 has failed to perform his duties in\n\ncontravention of terms and conditions of Deed of Agreement,\n\nthe Petitioner, pending consideration of his application for\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                              Page 3 of 36\n appointment of an Arbitrator by this Court, was being\n\nconstraint to approach the District Judge, Cuttack by filing\n\nan application under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 for grant of an\n\norder of interim injunction against the Opposite Party No.1,\n\nthereby restraining the Opposite Party No.1 or his agents from\n\ntelecasting the movies and songs of M/s.  Brajaraj Movies in any form through television media, satellite broadcasting,\n\nF.M. channels, mobile operator, cinema halls, DVD & You Tube Channels and to restrain him from proceeding with the production of the Movie \"I Love You-2\" and also using the title and logo of M/s. Brajaraj Movies in any manner till the dispute is resolved through arbitration. \n\n3.           The said petition, registered as ARBP No.02 of 2024, was admitted and notice was issued to the Opposite Parties. Being noticed, the Opposite Party No.1 duly appeared and filed objection/show cause on 27.06.2024. On the very day, the District Judge, Cuttack was pleased to pass an interim order restraining the Opposite Party No.1 from proceeding with the release of the film \"I Love You-2\" and using the logo and banner of M/s. Brajaraj Movies till the next date and the matter stood adjourned to 11.07.2024. On W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                             Page 4 of 36  the said date, the Petitioner filed another application for grant of interim order as well as an application for continuance of the interim order dated 27.06.2024 whereas, the Opposite Party No.1 filed applications under Order 7, Rule11 of C.P.C.\n\nfor rejection of the ARBP No.02 of 2024 and for vacating the stay order dated 27.06.2024. However, the District Judge,\n\nCuttack was pleased to extend the interim order and posted the matter to 18.07.2024. On the said date, the Petitioner filed his Reply in response to the application filed by the Opposite Party No.1 under Order 7 Rule, 11 of C.P.C. so also to the application for vacation of stay. However, the District Judge, Cuttack, though extended the interim order till the next date, but on a wrong noting and misconstruing the provisions enshrined under the Act, 1996 as well as the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, shortly hereinafter, 'CC Act,\n\n2015' and relying on the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Jaycee     Housing         Pvt.   Ltd.   &   others   Vrs.   Registrar (General), Orissa High Court, Cuttack & others, reported in 2022 Live Law (SC) 860, transferred the case to the Court of the Senior Civil Judge (Commercial Court), Cuttack on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. While passing the said order,\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                     Page 5 of 36  the District Judge, Cuttack also directed to dispose of the said matter on or before 23.07.2024 on merit in accordance with law, with an observation not to extend the interim order in a causal manner. Hence this Writ Petition. \n\n4.           The said order passed by the District Judge,\n\nCuttack dated 18.07.2024 passed in ARBP No.02 of 2024 has been challenged on the following grounds: \n\n             (i)     The same is contrary to the provisions of law                      enshrined under the Act, 1996 as well as the                      CC Act, 2015.\n\n             (ii )    The Court below completely misconstrued                      the decision rendered by the Supreme Court                      in Jaycee Housing Pvt. Ltd. (supra).\n\n             (iii)   The Court below misconstrued the facts and                      circumstances of the Petitioner's case and                      wrongly rendered a finding that the case                      involved   is   pertaining   to   violation   of                      intellectual property right and loss and the                      valuation of the same appears to be more                      than five lakhs, forgetting the fact that the                      Petitioner has filed   the application under W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                  Page 6 of 36                      Section 9 of the Act, 1996 for grant of interim                     relief till disposal of the dispute through                     arbitration in which there is no specified                     value, as envisaged under section 3 of the                     Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n\n             (iv)   The order passed by the District Judge,\n\n                    Cuttack is also contrary to Section 6 of the                     CC Act, 2015 which mandates that the CC                     Act shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and                     applications relating to a commercial dispute                     of a specified value, though, in the instant                     case, there is no specified value as on the                     date. \n\n             (v)    The impugned order is also in contravention                     to the provisions enshrined under Sections                     10, 12 & 15 of the CC Act, 2015 and section                     2(1)(e) of the Act, 1996. \n\n             (vi )   Since the dispute has no specified value, as                     required under the provisions of the CC Act,\n\n                    2015, the application under Section 9 of the                     Act, 1996 cannot come under the definition W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                  Page 7 of 36                     of Section 2(b),(c), vii, xv and xvii of the CC                    Act, 2015, as referred to in the impugned                    order, and the said order suffers from                    illegalities and infirmities and is liable to be                    quashed. \n\n5.           Reiterating the grounds agitated in the Writ Petition, Mr. Panda, learned Counsel for the Petitioner,\n\ndrawing attention of this Court to the provisions enshrined under section 2 (1)(e) of the Act, 1996 so also under Section 6,\n\n10 and 15 of the C.C Act, 2015 submitted that the District Judge, Cuttack, being the Principal Civil Court, is only competent to hear the application filed under section 9 of the Act, 1996. The section 9 application being in the nature of interlocutory application, having no valuation, the District Judge should not have transferred the said application to the Commercial Court, Cuttack, which lacks jurisdiction to try the said petition. In view of the provisions enshrined under section 6 read with section 15 of the CC Act, 2015, only suits and applications, including applications under the Act, 1996 relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value can only be tried by the Commercial Court. The specified value, as per W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                Page 8 of 36  the amended provisions under the CC Act, 2015, being Rs.3,00,000/- and admittedly the section 9 application filed by the Petitioner having no valuation and with a prayer for interim injunction, cannot be heard by the           Commercial Court. Only the District Judge, Cuttack, being the Principal Civil Court, is competent to hear and decide the said application. Hence, the Impugned order dated 18.07.2024 passed in ARBP No.02 of 2024, being contrary to the legal provisions enshrined under the Act, 1996 so also the CC Act,\n\n2015, deserves interference and be quashed and direction be given to the District Judge, Cuttack to hear the said application filed under section 9 of the Act, 1996 and dispose of the same on merit in the interest of justice.\n\n6.           To   substantiate   his   submission,   Mr.   Panda,\n\nlearned Counsel for the Petitioner, relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Jaycee Housing Pvt. Ltd. (supra),\n\nsubmitted that though the District Judge, Cuttack relied on the said judgment in the impugned order, but misconstrued the said decision of the Supreme Court. Mr. Panda submitted that, vide the said decision, it was never held by the Supreme Court that all the cases under sections 9, 14, and 24 of the W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                               Page 9 of 36  Act, 1996 have to be filed and adjudicated by the Commercial Court irrespective of the valuation. Mr. Panda, relying on para-10 of the said judgment of the Supreme Court,\n\nsubmitted that it was also held vide the said judgment that as per section 15 of the CC Act, 2015, all suits and applications,\n\nincluding applications under the Act, 1996, relating to a commercial dispute of \"specified value\" shall have to be transferred to the Commercial Court.\n\n7.           Mr. Panda, learned Counsel, referring to para-15 of the order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court at Jabalpur,\n\nreported in 2021 SCC OnLine MP 457 (Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi Vs. District & Sessions Judge and Another)\n\nsubmitted that the Court of District Judge, being the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction, would be competent to decide the matters/disputes filed under the provisions of section 9 , 14, 34 and 36 of the Act, 1996 so also under the provisions of the CC Act, 2015, regardless of the value of claim and it can only distribute such work amongst any of the Additional District Judges under his supervision, but not to any Court of Civil Judge Class-I or Senior Civil Judge, or any Court of Small Causes.\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                             Page 10 of 36  8 .           In response to the argument advanced by Mr.\n\nPanda, learned Counsel for the Petitioner, Mr. Dash, learned Counsel for Opposite Party No.1, drawing attention of this Court to the definition of \"Commercial Court\", \"commercial dispute\" and \"Specified Value\", as defined         under sections 2(1)(b), 2(1)(c) & 2(1)(i) respectively, so also section 3(3), 6 and 10(3) of the C.C. Act, 2015, submitted that in view of the definition of commercial dispute under the CC Act, 2015 read with section 6 and 10(3) of the CC Act, 2015, all applications and appeals, arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Act, 1996, that would ordinarily lie before any principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district (not being High Court), has to be filed in and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration, where such Commercial Court has been constituted. Since ARBP No.02 of 2024 has been preferred under section 9 of the Act, 1996, instead of filing such an application before the Commercial Court,\n\nCuttack, the Petitioner wrongly filed such an application before the District Judge, Cuttack. Hence, the Opposite Party No.1, in addition to filing an application for vacation of stay,\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                Page 11 of 36  also filed an application under Order-7, Rule 11 of C.P.C. for rejection of the said petition on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the District Judge, Cuttack so also on some other grounds. However, the District Judge, Cuttack, instead of hearing such application first, ordered for disposing of all the applications together with section 9 application. However,\n\nthe District Judge ultimately thought it prudent to transfer the said proceeding to the Commercial Court, in terms of the legal provisions under the CC Act, 2015, referring to the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Jaycee Housing Pvt. Ltd.\n\n(supra).\n\n9.           Mr. Dash, learned Counsel for the Opposite Party No.1, drawing attention of this Court to the legal provisions under Section 10(3) of the CC Act, 2015, submitted that any application under the Act, 1996, pertaining to a commercial dispute, has to be moved before the Commercial Court after formation of the Commercial Court and not before the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district and the District Judge, Cuttack should have returned the application filed under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 to the Petitioner. However, on being so pointed out by his client, the W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                             Page 12 of 36  District Judge, Cuttack ordered for transfer of the said proceeding to the Commercial Court, Cuttack. There being no infirmity in the impugned order and the same having been passed in terms of the legal provisions under the CC Act,\n\n2015, the Writ Petition deserves to be dismissed. \n\n10.          From the pleadings made in the Writ Petition,\n\ngrounds urged therein to challenge the impugned order so also submissions made at the Bar, the following points emerge to be answered in the present Writ Petition.\n\n             (i )    In absence of any valuation, in an application                     filed under section 9 of the Act, 1996,\n\n                    whether the Commercial Court, constituted                     under sub-section (1) of section 3 of the CC                     Act,   2015,     is   competent   to   hear     such                     application?\n\n             (ii)   Whether the District Judge was justified to                     transfer the section 9 application, registered                     as ARBP No.02 of 2024, to the Court of                     Senior   Civil    Judge    (Commercial        Court),\n\n                    Cuttack?\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                   Page 13 of 36  11.          Since both points are interrelated, the same are dealt with together for the sake of brevity and clarity.

Though \"Court\" is defined under Section 2(1)(e) of the Act, 1996 to be the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in the district, but in the provisions enshrined under Section 10(3) of the CC Act, 2015, it has been clearly enumerated that, where the subject matter of an arbitration is a \"commercial dispute\" of \"Specified Value\" and such arbitration is other than the         international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Act, 1996, that would ordinarily lie before any principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district (not being a High Court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial Court has been constituted.\n\n13.          The word \"commercial dispute\" has been defined under section 2(1)(c) of the C.C. Act, 2015, which clearly includes a dispute arising out of partnership agreements in terms of sub-clause (xv) under clause (c) of section 2(1) of the C.C Act, 2015. Similarly, the word \"Specified Value\" used in various provisions of the C.C Act, 2015 has been defined under section 2(1)(i). Specified Value, in relation to a W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                              Page 21 of 36  commercial dispute, shall mean the value of the subject matter in respect of a \"suit\", which is to be determined in accordance with section 12 and the same shall not be less than three lakh rupees or such higher value, as may be notified by the Central Government.\n\n14.          So far as the Order of Madhya Pradesh High Court in Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi (supra) cited by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, it was held as follows:\n\n               \"15. In view of the above discussions, the           present petition deserves to succeed. The Entry No.45           of the impugned order dated 20.10.2020 is set aside. \n          It is hereby declared that the Court of District Judge as           the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction would           be competent to decide the matters/disputes filed           under the provisions of Sections 9, 14, 34 & 36 of the           Arbitration Act and also under the provisions of the           Commercial Courts Act regardless of the value of           claim. However, the District Judge by virtue of Section           7 read with Section 15 of the Civil Courts Act would be           entitled to distribute such work amongst any of the           Additional District Judges under his supervision , but           not to any Court of Civil Judge Class-I or Senior Civil           Judge, or any Court of Small Causes.\"\n\n\n\n15.          However, the High Court of Bombay in Gaurang Manguesh       Suctancar       Vs.    Sonia     Gaurang       Suctancar,\n\nreported in MANU/MH/2578/2020, dealing with an issue as to whether the Commercial Court under the CC Act, 2015 was justified to refuse to entertain an application under Section 9 W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                       Page 22 of 36  of the Act, 1996 and return it to the Petitioner/Applicant to be presented before the appropriate Court, held as follows:\n\n             \"Issue:\n\n             2. For adjudicating an application under           Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, which is the           forum: Is it the court as defined under Section 2           (1) (e) of the Arbitration Act, read with Section 5           of the Goa Civil Courts Act 1965 or is it the           Commercial Court under Section 3 (1) of the           Amended Commercial Courts Act 2015? \n\n             92 . Evidently, the Commercial Courts Act is a later           enactment, but it does not work at cross purpose with           the Arbitration Act. In fact, both aim at speedy           adjudication. The Commercial Courts Act covers all the           commercial disputes, whereas the Arbitration Act           covers only those disputes that involve arbitration. As           Kandla Export Corporation has held, both the           enactments call for a harmonious interpretation. If at           all there is any conflict, as to the substantive           provisions, the Arbitration Act prevails; but it has left           the procedural niceties to the Commercial Courts Act.\n          Section 10 (3) of the Commercial Courts act and the           Remote Conditional:\n             93. Let us revisit Section 10 (3) of the Commercial           Courts Act. \"If it is a domestic arbitration, all           applications or appeals arising out of arbitration \"that           would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of           original jurisdiction\" in a district (not being a High           Court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by           the Commercial Court\".\n             94. Sub -section (3) begins with a conditional \"if.\n          Then, it delineates on how \"all applications or appeals\"\n          arising out of arbitration should be adjudicated. They           \"would ordinarily\" lie before the \"principal civil court of           original jurisdiction.\" In that sentence, \"ordinarily\" is           an adverbial emphasiser; let us keep it aside. Now the           sentence is \"they would lie before the principal civil           court of original jurisdiction.\" It is, grammatically           speaking, the 'second conditional' employing the           subjunctive \"would\". If refers to an unlikely or           improbable future event or arrangement. What could           have been an ordinary course of remedial event now           stands altered. This uncertainty or altered course           under sub-section (3) is because of a statutory           development-the advent of the Commercial Courts Act. \n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                         Page 23 of 36            So, to repeat, what could have been the subject of           adjudication before the principal civil court of original           jurisdiction, now \"shall be filed in, and heard and           disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising           territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such           Commercial Court has been constituted.\"\n             95. Because, now, the Commercial Courts have           been established, \"all applications\" under the           Arbitration Act should lock, stock, and barrel go before           the Commercial Courts. So the concept of\" the principal           civil court of original jurisdiction\" no longer applies. \n          Instead, what matters is the \"Commercial Court\". That           accepted, which is the Commercial Court-the Senior           Civil Judge's Court or the District Court? In Goa, the           District Court is no longer the primary Commercial           Court; it is, in fact, a Commercial Appellate Court. \n             96 . In this context, I may once again quote G.P.\n          Singh, G.P. Singh (n 13) 91, who says that \"the words           of a statute are first understood in their natural,\n          ordinary or popular sense and phrases and sentences           are construed according to their grammatical meaning,\n          unless that leads to some absurdity or unless there is           something in the context, or in the object of the statute           to suggest the contrary.\" Here, if sub-section (3) is not           read in its ordinary grammatical sense, it will lead to           absurdity.\n\n          The Decisions:\n\n             97. The respondent wants me to treat co-equal           Bench decisions in D.M. Corporation and Jaiswal           Ashoka Infrastructure as per incuriam. They have           been rendered, as she points out, in ignorance of           Kandla Export Corporation. As the Supreme Court has           held in B. Satyanarayana Rao, the rule of per incuriam           can be applied \"where a Court omits to consider a           binding precedent of the same court or the superior           court rendered on the same issue or where a court           omits to consider any statute while deciding that           issue . \" \n             98. In D.M. Corporation, a learned Single Judge           (Dr. Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi, J.) has, on facts, noted           that the dispute concerns an arbitration agreement,\n          the subject-matter of which is above Rs. 1 crore; it is a           dispute of commercial nature. So even if the relief           claimed is mere injunction, because of Section           10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act, the Principal           District Judge has correctly transferred the           arbitration application to the Commercial Court. \n          The impugned order passed by the District Court W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                       Page 24 of 36            being just, legal, and correct; it warranted no           interference. \n              99. In Jaiswal Ashoka Infrastructure, another           learned Single Judge (A.S. Chandurkar, J) has           observed that because of Section 15(2) of the           Commercial Courts Act, suits and applications in           relation to a commercial dispute pending in any civil           court must be transferred to the Commercial Court.\n          That is, the civil court \"ceases to have jurisdiction to           entertain an application under the provisions of the           [Commercial Courts] Act in relation to a commercial           dispute of a specified value.\" Once the court lacks           inherent jurisdiction, express or implied consent,\n          failure to raise jurisdictional object, or even           acquiescence cannot clothe the court with jurisdiction. \n              100. I have already elaborately discussed           Kandla Export Corporation, and I see no           precedential transgression in D.M. Corporation or           Jaiswal Ashoka Infrastructure. \n\n                    Conclusion: \n\n                    (1) Contrary to the respondent's contentions,\n                   the Notification, dt. 05.05.2020, issued by                    the Government of Goa, is in tune with the                    legislative mandate under Sections 3 and 3A                    of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n\n                   ( 2) In the State of Goa, the designated                    District Courts are the Appellate Commercial                    Courts, and the Senior Civil Judges' Courts                    are the Commercial Courts. \n\n                   (3) Even adjudication of an application                    under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act                    must be before the Commercial Court,\n                   and that Commercial Court need not be                    the principal civil court of original                    jurisdiction. \n\n                   (4) There is no conflict between the                    Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996                    and the Commercial Courts Act 2015. If                    at all we maintain the distinction, the                    former Act deals with the substantive                    rights of the parties to the arbitration,\n                   and the latter Act with the procedural                    essentials, the choice of the forum being                    a part of it.\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                      Page 25 of 36                      (5) As Kandla Export Corporation has held,\n                    regarding any commercial arbitral dispute,\n                    the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996                     determines, among other things, the                     appellate remedies and the Commercial                     Courts Act 2015 provides for the forum and                     adjudicatory procedure. \n          Result: \n\n             As a result, I hold that the Ad-hoc Senior Civil           Judge, \"A\" Court, Panaji, has failed to exercise           the jurisdiction vested in it as the Commercial           Court. Its returning the petitioner's application to be           presented \"before proper court\" is erroneous and           unsustainable, for it is, by itself, the proper court. The           impugned Order, dt. 08.07.2020, is set aside. \n             So the Commercial Court at North Goa, Panaji, will           have the CMA Stamp No. 243/2020 restored to file           and adjudicated on merits, after giving the regular           number.\"\n\n                                            (Emphasis supplied)\n\n16.           The Division Bench of this Court in M.G. Mohanty and others Vs. State of Odisha and others, reported in 2022(III)ILR-CUT-992, while deciding the issue regarding constitutional validity of section 10(3) of the CC Act, 2015 in a batch of cases, took note of both the said Orders of Madhya Pradesh High Court so also Bombay High Court. The Division Bench disagreed with the reasoning of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi (supra),\n\nwhereas, respectfully agreed with the views of Bombay High Court in Gaurang Manguesh Suctancar (supra) and observed as follows:\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                        Page 26 of 36                  \"39. In Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi v.\n          District & Sessions Judge (supra), the Madhya           Pradesh High Court relied on the decision of the           Supreme Court of India in State of Maharashtra,\n          through Executive Engineer v. Atlanta Limited (2014)\n          11 SCC 619 to hold that the Court of superior most           jurisdiction in a district is the Court of the District           Judge. It concluded that: \n                    \" 14...... Segregation of an arbitration                     matters on the basis of a pecuniary                     limit is not what the law provides for. \n                    All      the    arbitration      matters,\n                    irrespective of the value of claim, are                     required to be adjudicated by                     Principal Civil Court of original                     jurisdiction . Therefore, it is clear that                     in respect of commercial disputes                     involving an arbitration dispute only                     the Commercial Court of the status of                     District Judge or Additional District                     Judge would be the competent court                     to entertain the matters under                     Sections 9, 14, 34 & 36 of the                     Arbitration Act.\"\n                42. In any event, this Court is unable to           agree with the reasoning of the High Court of           Madhya Pradesh in Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi           (supra). In particular, the Court would like to refer to           the Parliamentary intent in enacting the CC Act in           2015 much after the A&C Act of 2016 and the SOR not           only of the Bill introduced in 2015 but also the SOR of           the Bill introduced in 2018, amending the said statute.\n          The debates in the Parliament in this regard are           instructive. In defending its decision to expand the           scope of commercial disputes beyond those which           were of high value, three aspects that were mentioned           on behalf of the Government defending the Bill in the           Parliament, which read as under:\n\n                 \"Now, what really has transpired in                  December 2017? As has already been                  mentioned by the hon. Minister , in                  December, 2017, the Government had                  established a total of 247 commercial                  courts across the country. But, the non-                  exhausted list of 22 disputes, termed as                  commercial disputes, has also been                  brought in. To increase the efficiency of the                  system, there are still many enactments                  and many things which we need to correct W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                         Page 27 of 36                   and this is just one part of the correction to                  improve the ease of doing business. By                  bringing the jurisdiction to three lakhs, we                  will    actually   be    bringing     judicial                  accessibility to a wider audience and to a                  larger number of people. By making it                  available to a larger number of people, we                  will be resolving a larger number of                  disputes. It is in this context that the                  jurisdiction has been reduced after                  studying the data in detail. \n\n                This particular amendment has been brought in           with the specific value which was determined under           Section 2 (1) (i), where the minimum pecuniary           jurisdiction is mentioned, which was one crore earlier           before the Ordinance, now it has been brought to three           lakhs. This jurisdiction will initiate more such disputes           to have a faster disposal. \n                As I have mentioned earlier, under the Charter,\n          there are Chartered High Courts and non-Chartered           High Courts. So, certain original jurisdictions are           vested with certain High Courts and not with every           High Court. This was one impediment in establishing           commercial divisions. So, there was a bar of some sort. \n          To do away with the bar, this particular enactment           has been brought in and this is another major change           which has been brought in through this           particular Bill. \n                The third aspect of the commercial           appellate court is that normally at the District           Level, either a District Judge or a Judge below           the level of District Judge, will be notified as the           Commercial Court Judge. Then the appeal need           not go to the High Court. The appeal can go to           the District Judge. That is also a part of this           particular enactment.\"\n                43. The legislature appears to have left it open to           the High Court and the State government either to           appoint a Civil Judge (Senior Division) or an Additional           District Judge as the Commercial Court of first           instance to expedite the adjudication of commercial           disputes. It is interesting to note that there are           several States that have constituted Commercial           Courts both at the District Judge level as well as           below the District Judge level. In Gujarat, the           Courts of the Additional District Judges in Bhuj, Anjar,\n          Gandhidham and Bhachau have been constituted for           hearing arbitration matters whereas the Courts of the           Principal Senior Civil Judge in these places are for W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                          Page 28 of 36            hearing other commercial disputes. In Karnataka, in           some districts, it is the Principal D&SJ and in others           the AD&SJ. In Bihar, depending on the pecuniary           value, it could be the District Judge or the Sub-Judge. \n          In Uttarakhand, it is the Additional District Judge           Commercial Court, Dehradun. The intent clearly           was to expand the power and to bring in more           Courts under the rubric of 'Commercial Courts'. \n          Considering that the specified value was being           lowered, it was but natural to allow Courts below           the rank of the District Judge to be designated           as such.\n                44. Section 10(3) of the CC Act specifically           deals with arbitrations, 'other than international           commercial arbitrations'. The jurisdiction in           respect of such disputes would now be based           with the Commercial Courts, although earlier it           was with a principal Civil Court, which would           ordinarily exercise jurisdiction under Section           2(1)(e) of the A&C Act. The orders passed by the           D&SJ on 7th July 2021, transferring the           arbitration petitions to the Court of the Senior           Civil Judge Commercial Court, was only by way           of implementation of these provisions.\n                46. There might be an anomaly inasmuch as           arbitral disputes of a commercial value of less than           Rs.3 Lacs may have to be dealt with directly by the           D&SJ in terms of the definition under Section 2(1)(e) of           the A&C Act and appeal against which would lie to the           commercial appellate division in the High Court. But           none of the petitions before this Court has that fact           situation. The questions is, therefore, purely academic. \n          Nevertheless, it will be open to the State Government           to revise its notification in view of the above anomaly.\n                48. At this stage, it must be pointed out that this           Court's attention has been drawn to the Judgment of           the Bombay High Court in Gaurang Mangesh           Suctancar v. Sonia Gaurang Suctancar (Supra).\n          The Bombay High Court, on analyzing these very           provisions, came to the conclusion that it is the CC Act           provisions that would prevail. The Court is in           respectful concurrence with the said view. As           rightly noted by the Bombay High Court both Sections           42 of the A&C Act and Section 21 of the CC Act           appeared to be similar provisions inasmuch as they           begin with a non-obstante clause, precluding the           applicability of any other law for the time being in           force. The following observations of the Bombay High           Court in this regards are relevant, which reads as           under:\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                       Page 29 of 36                 \" 60. G.P. Singh, in his cerebral                commentary, Principles of           Statutory                Interpretation (G.P. Singh, Interpretation of                Statutes, (reprint, 14 edn., Lexis Nexis,\n               2018) 403), has explained that \"the                expression 'notwithstanding anything in                any other law' occurring in a section of an                Act cannot be construed to take away the                effect of any provision of the Act in which                that section appears. In other words, 'any                other law' will refer to any law other than                the Act in which that section occurs.\" In                contrast, the expression 'notwithstanding                anything contained in this Act' may be                construed to take away the effect of any                provision of the Act in which the section                occurs but it cannot take away the effect                of any other law. \n               61 . Indeed, a special enactment or Rule                cannot be held     to be overridden by a                later general enactment or simply because                the latter opens up with a non obstante                clause. There should be a clear                inconsistency between the two before                giving an overriding effect to the non                obstante clause. \n               62. The learned author G.P. Singh has                also remarked that sometimes one finds                two or more enactments operating in the                same field and each containing a non                obstante clause. Each clause, in fact,\n               declares that its provisions will have effect                'notwithstanding anything inconsistent                therewith contained in any other law for                the time being in force'. The conflict in such                cases is resolved on consideration of                purpose and policy underlying the                enactments and the language used in                them. Another test applied is that the later                enactment normally prevails over the                earlier one. It is also relevant to consider                as to whether either of the two enactments                can be described a special one; in that                case the special one may prevail over the                more general one notwithstanding that the                general one is later in time. \n               63. In fact, the Arbitration Act and the                Commercial Courts Act, both central                enactments, have employed this 'non-                obstante clause' at more than one place. \n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                        Page 30 of 36                  Precisely for this reason, Kandla Export                 Corporation has harmoniously resolved                 this imbroglio: that the Arbitration Act                 prevails when it concerns the parties'\n                substantive rights, and the Commercial                 Courts Act does when it concerns the                 parties' procedural rights.\"\n                49. The Bombay High Court then undertook an           analysis of the un-amended provisions of the CC Act           and noted that there is a two-tier Court at the district           level. One is the Commercial Court of original           jurisdiction and another at the District Judge level of           the Commercial Appellate Court. The approach in           Kandla Exports (supra) about the CC Act being           procedural     in   nature    and    therefore   having           retrospective effect, found support in the decision in           New India Assurance Company Limited v. Shanti           Misra (1975) 2 SCC 840, where a three-Judge Bench           held that once there was a change not in the           substantive law but in the procedural law, it would           operate retrospectively and 'the person has to go to the           new forum even if his cause of action or right of action           accrued prior to the change of forum'. The relevant           passage of the decision of the Bombay High Court in           Gaurang Mangesh Suctancar v. Sonia Gaurang           Suctancar , reads as under:\n\n                \"92. Evidently, the Commercial Courts Act                 is a later enactment, but it does not work                 at cross purpose with the Arbitration Act. \n                In fact, both aim at speedy adjudication. \n                The Commercial Courts Act covers all the                 commercial      disputes,   whereas     the                 Arbitration Act covers only those disputes                 that involve arbitration. As Kandla Export                 Corporation has held, both the enactments                 call for a harmonious interpretation. If at                 all there is any conflict, as to the                 substantive provisions, the Arbitration Act                 prevails; but it has left the procedural                 niceties to the Commercial Courts Act.\"\n                50. The Court finds merit in the contention on           behalf of the Opposite Parties that the A&C Act must           yield to the CC Act and not vice versa given that the           objective of both enactments is the speedy disposal of           the cases and the CC Act was a later enactment. There           is no apparent conflict between the A&C Act and the           CC Act for being resolved. The objective of both is the           speedy resolution of the disputes . As far as challenge           to the vires of Section 10 of the CC Act is concerned,\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                      Page 31 of 36            indeed no ground has been made out before this Court           to show how Section 10 of the CC Act is ultra vires the           legislative powers of the Parliament or how it is           'manifestly arbitrary'. The         identification   of           commercial disputes as distinct from ordinary           civil disputes is based on an intelligible           differentia and subjecting them to a special           expedited procedure can neither be considered to           be arbitrary nor ultra vires the A&C Act. That           prayer, therefore, has to be rejected.\n                51. Incidentally, there is no challenge to either           Section 15 or 21 of the CC Act. If indeed commercial           cases      involving     arbitral     disputes     have           necessarily to be transferred under Section 10(3)\n          read with Section 15(2) of the CC Act , then as a           natural corollary the Commercial Court alone           will have to decide those disputes and not of the           Court in terms of the A&C Act. In passing the           impugned orders transferring the cases, the D&SJ has           not committed any illegality nor has the Senior Civil           Judge, Commercial Court, Bhubaneswar committed           any illegality in accepting the cases on transfer and           proceeding with them in accordance with law.\" \n\n                                          (Emphasis supplied) \n\n17.          The Judgment of this court in M.G. Mohanty (supra) being challenged before the Supreme Court, the same was upheld in Jaycee Housing Pvt. Ltd. (supra). Paragraphs 6, 10 & 11 of the said judgment, being relevant, are reproduced below: \n\n          \"6. The question of law arising for consideration           in the present appeal is, whether in exercise of           powers under Section 3 of the Commercial Courts           Act, 2015, the State Government can confer           jurisdiction to hear applications under Sections           9, 14 and 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation           Act, 1996, upon Commercial Courts which are           subordinate to the rank of the Principal Civil           Judge in the District, contrary to the provisions           of Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act?\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                     Page 32 of 36            10. Thus, the Objects and Reasons of Commercial           Courts Act, 2015 is to provide for speedy disposal of           the commercial disputes which includes the arbitration           proceedings. To achieve the said Objects, the           legislature in its wisdom has specifically conferred the           jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters as per           Section 10 of the Act, 2015. At this stage, it is           required to be noted that the Act, 2015 is the Act           later in time and therefore when the Act, 2015           has been enacted, more particularly Sections 3 &\n          10, there was already a provision contained in           Section 2(1)(e) of the Act, 1996. As per settled           position of law, it is to be presumed that while           enacting the subsequent law, the legislature is           conscious of the provisions of the Act prior in           time and therefore the later Act shall prevail. It is           also required to be noted that even as per Section 15 of           the Act, 2015, all suits and applications including           applications under the Act, 1996, relating to a           commercial dispute of specified value shall have to be           transferred to the Commercial Court. Even as per           Section 21 of the Act, 2015, Act, 2015 shall have           overriding effect. It provides that save as           otherwise provided, the provisions of this Act           shall have effect, notwithstanding anything           inconsistent therewith contained in any other           law for the time being in force.\n\n          11. Therefore, considering the afore stated provisions           of the Act, 2015 and the Objects and Reasons for           which the Act, 2015 has been enacted and the           Commercial     Courts,    Commercial       Division   and           Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts are           established for speedy disposal of the commercial           disputes including the arbitration disputes, Sections 3           & 10 of the Act, 2015 shall prevail and all           applications or appeals arising out of arbitration           under the provisions of Act, 1996, other than           international commercial arbitration, shall be           filed in and heard and disposed of by the           Commercial Courts, exercising the territorial           jurisdiction over such arbitration where such           commercial courts have been constituted. If the           submission on behalf of the appellants that all           applications/appeals arising out of arbitration under           the provisions of Act, 1996, other than the           international commercial arbitration, shall lie before           the principal civil Court of a district, in that case, not           only the Objects and Reasons of enactment of Act,\n          2015 and establishment of commercial courts shall be W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                        Page 33 of 36            frustrated, even Sections 3, 10 & 15 shall become           otiose and nugatory. If the submission on behalf of           the appellants is accepted, in that case, though           with respect to other commercial disputes, the           applications or appeals shall lie before the           commercial courts established and constituted           under Section 3 of Act, 2015, with respect to           arbitration proceedings, the applications or           appeals shall lie before the principal civil Court           of a district. There cannot be two fora with           respect to different commercial disputes. \n                Under the circumstances, notification issued by           the State of Odisha issued in consultation with the           High Court of Orissa to confer jurisdiction upon the           court of learned Civil Judge (Senior Division)\n          designated as Commercial Court to decide the           applications or appeals arising out of arbitration under           the provisions of Act, 1996 cannot be said to be illegal           and bad in law. On the contrary, the same can be said           to be absolutely in consonance with Sections 3 & 10 of           Act, 2015. We are in complete agreement with the view           taken by the High Court holding so.\"\n\n                                           (Emphasis supplied)\n\n18.          Law is well settled that the Court under section 9 of the Act, 1996 is only to formulate interim measure so as to protect the right under adjudication before the Arbitral Tribunal from being frustrated. In view of the provisions enshrined under section 10(3) read with the definition of \"Commercial Dispute\" and \"Specified Value\", as defined under section 2(1)(c) & (i) of the CC Act, 2015 respectively, in addition to the settled position of law, as detailed above, this Court is of the view that only Suits and Applications, which require to give a declaration regarding the valuation of Suit/Application, which will be further subjected to valuation,\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                      Page 34 of 36  if so required, to be determined in terms of section 12 of the CC Act, 2015, will be the decisive factor to approach the fora under the CC Act, 2015. This Court is of further view that, in view of definition of \"Specified Value\" under section 2(1)(i) of the CC Act, 2015, the same is not applicable to a section 9 application     for   determination   of   the   jurisdiction   of   a Commercial Court to consider such application and the Commercial Courts, where such Courts have been established in the state, are only competent to hear and decide the section 9 application filed under the Act, 1996.\n\n19.           This Court is of further view that section 15 of the CC Act, 2015 regarding transfer of suits and applications being only applicable to pending cases, the District Judge,\n\nCuttack ought to have returned the section 9 application to the Petitioner for its presentation before the Court of the Senior Civil Judge (Commercial Court), Cuttack. However,\n\nduring hearing of the said application, realizing the fact that the said Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the said application,\n\nafter assessing the cost of such application to be more than rupees five lakhs, as is permissible under section 12 of the CC Act, 2015 (though it was not so required in a section 9 W.P.(C) No.18217 of 2024                                 Page 35 of 36  application), it was rightly ordered to transfer the matter to the Commercial Court. \n\n20.          In view of the detailed discussions made in the forgoing paragraphs, this Court is also of the view that the plea of the Petitioner regarding lack of jurisdiction of the Commercial Court to adjudicate an application under section 9 of the Act, 1996, in absence of any valuation, is misconceived. Both the points emerged, detailed above, are answered accordingly. \n\n21.          There being no infirmity in the impugned order passed in ARBP No.02 of 2024, the Writ Petition stands dismissed. No order as to cost. \n\n\n\n\n                                          ................................... \n                                            S.K.

to the root of the matter in view of the confusion prevailing in the office/registry after the transfer of such pending summary suits because of the provisions of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015 (for short, \"the commercial courts act\"). background of proceedings3 the following are the background dates of the proceedings as per the respondent-plaintiff (idbi) to decide the maintainability of the commercial appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act, apart from decision on merits. on 11/09/14, summary suit no.776 of 2014 was filed by the respondent (plaintiff) (idbi) on 11 september 2014, seeking a decree in the sum of over rs.33 crores. during the pendency of the summary suit, the commercial courts, commercial division, commercial appellate division of high courts ordinance, 2015 (the ordinance) was promulgated on 23 october 2015 with immediate effect. the ordinance inter alia provided for the constitution of commercial ssm/dgm 4 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw divisions in high courts having ordinary original civil jurisdiction. an order/notice dated 17 november, 2015 was issued by the then hon'ble the acting chief justice constituting the commercial division and commercial appellate division under sections 4 and 5 of the ordinance. the then hon'ble acting chief justice also issued an assignment order dated 22 december, 2015 of the original side of this court to take effect from 4 january 2016, constituting the commercial division and the commercial appellate division of this high court and nominating judges for the same. mr. justice s.c. gupte was nominated as the \"commercial division\" of this court and assigned all summary suits, i.e. including the present summary suit. assignment order dated 22 december 2015, was the order constituting the commercial division and commercial appellate division. the commercial courts act does not prescribe any particular form of the order to constitute such divisions. the chief justice is required to pass only an administrative order, not a judicial order. on 1 january, 2016, the commercial courts act came to be notified in the official gazette with effect from 23 october 2015. ssm/dgm 5 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw on 4 january 2016, the commercial divisions and the commercial appellate divisions as constituted, have commenced functioning accordingly. on 7 january 2016, and from time to time thereafter, the assignment orders were varied as under : a) notice dated 7 january 2016 in partial modification of the assignment order dated 22 december 2015. b) assignment order dated 3 march 2016 with effect from 7 march 2016. c) assignment order dated 15 march 2016 with effect from 21 march 2016. d) assignment order dated 19 august 2016 with effect from 22 august 2016. at all relevant times, the learned judge continued to be nominated as the \"commercial division\" of this court assigned to hear all summary suits, including the present summary suit. 4 the summons for judgment in the summary suit was argued finally on merits by the counsel for the parties before the commercial division on 12 and 14 january 2016 and was reserved for orders on 14 january 2016. on 13 may 2016, pending the final order in the summons for judgment, the captioned summary suit was formally transferred by a

(3) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, an application for summary judgment under this order shall not be made in a suit in respect of any commercial dispute that is originally filed as a summary suit under order xxxvii.\" (emphasis added) summary suit and unamended cpc13 the commercial suits/applications on the original side of the bombay high court are governed by the cpc read with bombay high court (original side) rules, 1980 as amended from time to time and so also the summary suits as contemplated under order xxxvii of cpc so filed within the jurisdiction of bombay high court (original side). it is always subject to the territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction. the pecuniary jurisdiction had undergone a change and accordingly suits/petitions/applications were transferred and/or re-transferred to the concerned city civil court/small causes courts based upon the valuation of the suits/applications. if order=judgment-under cpc14 an ordinary appeal from judgment/order passed by the learned single judge of the bombay high court on the original side, apart from the provisions of the cpc is governed by the letters patent ssm/dgm 16 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw act, subject to clauses 12 to 15. in the decisions in shah babulal khimji v. jayaben d. kania & anr.1 and midnapore peoples' co-op. bank ltd v. chunilal nanda,2 the supreme court observed as under : \"82. we now proceed to deal with the main controversy as to what is the true scope, meaning and purport of the word 'judgment' used in clause 15 of the letters patent. numerous authorities on both sides were cited before us in the course of the very able arguments advanced by counsels for the parties and it appears that there are three leading judgments which have spelt out certain tests to determine as to when an order passed by a trial judge can be said to be a 'judgment' within the meaning of. clause 15 of the letters patent. a very narrow view on this point was taken by a division bench of the calcutta high court in the case of the justice of the peace for calcutta (supra) where sir couch, c.j. on an interpretation of clause 15 of the letters patent observed thus:we think that \"judgment\" in clause 15 means a decision which affects the merits of the question between the parties by determining some right or liability. it may be either final, or preliminary, or interlocutory, the difference between them being that a final judgment determines the whole cause or suit, and a preliminary or interlocutory judgment determines only a part of it, leaving other matters to be determined. \"113 .(3) intermediary or interlocutory judgment-most of the interlocutory orders which contain the quality of finality are clearly specified in clauses (a) to (w) of order 43 rule 1 and have already been held by us to be judgments within the meaning of the letters patent and, therefore, appealable. there may also be interlocutory orders which are not covered by order 43 rule 1 but which also possess the characteristics and trappings of finality in that, the orders may adversely affect a valuable right of the party or decide an important aspect of the trial in an ancillary proceeding. 1 (1981) 4 scc 8 2 air 2006 sc 2190 ssm/dgm 17 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw before such an order can be a judgment the adverse effect on the party concerned must be direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote. for instance, where the trial judge in a suit under order 37 of the code of civil procedure refuses the defendant leave to defend the suit, the order directly affects the defendant because he loses a valuable right to defend the suit and his remedy is confined only to contest the plaintiff's case on his own evidence without being given a chance to rebut that evidence. as such an order vitally affects a valuable right of the defendant it will undoubtedly be treated as a judgment within the meaning of the letters patent so as to be appealable to a larger bench.\". the supreme court in midnapore peoples' co.op bank ltd. (supra) has observed in para 16 as under:\"16. interim orders/interlocutory orders passed during the pendency of a case, fall under one or the other of the following categories: (i) orders which finally decide a question or issue in controversy in the main case. (ii) orders which finally decide an issue which materially and directly affects the final decision in the main case. (iii) orders which finally decide a collateral issue or question which is not the subject matter of the main case. (iv) routine orders which are passed to facilitate the progress of the case till its culmination in the final judgment. (v) orders which may cause some inconvenience or some prejudice to a party, but which do not finally determine the rights and obligations of the parties. the term 'judgment' occurring in clause 15 of the letters patent will take into its fold not only the judgments as defined in section 2(9) cpc and orders enumerated in order 43 rule 1 of cpc, but also other orders which, though may not finally ssm/dgm 18 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw and conclusively determine the rights of parties with regard to all or any matters in controversy, may have finality in regard to some collateral matter, which will affect the vital and valuable rights and obligations of the parties. interlocutory orders which fall under categories (i) to (iii) above, are, therefore, 'judgments' for the purpose of filing appeals under the letters patent. on the other hand, orders falling under categories (iv) and (v) are not 'judgments' for purpose of filing appeals provided under the letters patent.\" (emphasis added) the scheme of commercial courts act15 the terms \"commercial court\", \"commercial division\" and \"commercial appellate division\" have been defined under sections 3, 4 and 5 of the commercial courts act. the constitution of the commercial courts is by the state government which are at district level in territories other than the territories where the high court has ordinary original civil jurisdiction. the constitution by the state government is subject to the condition of consultation with the concerned high court by publishing a notification in the official gazette specifying the local limits of jurisdiction of the commercial courts. it is also subject to nomination of one or more persons having experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be a judge or judges of commercial courts. ssm/dgm 19 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 16 the constitution of commercial division of high court is also subject to the order of chief justice of high court consisting of commercial division, having one or more branches consisting of a hon'ble judge/judges. the chief justice of high court, by the nomination, has appointed the judges of high court who have experience in dealing with the commercial disputes. the constitution of commercial appellate division by the nomination, is also by the order of chief justice of the high court, keeping in mind to nominate such judges of high court, who have experience in dealing with the commercial disputes. 17 chapter ii of the commercial courts act deals with the constitution of commercial courts and commercial divisions and commercial appellate divisions at various levels/courts. there is no issue that commercial courts and commercial divisions and commercial appellate divisions are required to be constituted as per the prescribed provisions so referred above. the order/nomination by the chief justice in case of commercial division and the commercial ssm/dgm 20 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw appellate division is thus sufficient so far as the constitution of such divisions under the commercial courts act. the requirement of notification/ order by the state government in consultation with the chief justice is also the requirement of the act for the constitution of commercial courts in the district area/territories. so far as the government of maharashtra is concerned, a notification dated 13 june 2016 was issued under section 3(1) constituting a commercial court in each district and in some places, judges have been appointed to preside over the commercial court by appointment order dated 21 july 2016. as noted, the commercial divisions of the bombay high court have been constituted from time to time by nomination and so also the commercial appellate divisions of high court as contemplated under sections 4 and 5 of the commercial courts act. 18 in view of section 2(1)(c) of commercial courts act, in view of definition of \"commercial dispute\" and \"specified value\" and as the summary suits fall within the definition of \"commercial dispute\" and the valuation of the ssm/dgm 21 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw subject matter exceeds one crore, the provisions of commercial courts act would apply to such suits, petitions and applications and the appeal in question. there is no issue on this. 19 section 6 empowers the commercial court to try and hear all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute based upon the valuation so recorded above which is subject to territorial jurisdiction. all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute where the subject matter exceeds rupees one crore and which are pending in any civil court in any district shall be transferred to the commercial courts so constituted is the mandate of section 15(2) of the commercial courts act. section 7 empowers \"commercial division\" of high court to hear \"all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of the stated value of the subject matter which are filed in high court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction\". this includes all suits/applications filed before the commencement of the commercial courts act/ordinance and ssm/dgm 22 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw even the constitution of commercial division. this also includes all fresh suits, applications filed after the commencement of the act and/or constitution of the commercial division provided it should be 'commercial disputes', having the valuation of the subject matter exceeding one crore. the mandate of section 15(1) of the commercial courts act is applicable even for all suits and applications pending in the high court where commercial division has been constituted it shall be transferred to the commercial division of the high court. it is, therefore, clear that commercial courts act, in view of above provisions so reproduced is made applicable retrospectively and would take into its ambit all pending suits, petitions and applications relating to commercial dispute of the specified value and specified disputes. therefore, all such suits, petitions and applications pending or fresh, will be governed by the commercial courts act with effect from 23.10.2015. this is also clear, therefore, that all the rights in regard to pending suits, petitions and applications shall be governed by the commercial courts act, once transferred. the commercial court appeal against decision/judgment/order/decreessm/dgm 23 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 20 the jurisdiction of the commercial appellate division as provided in chapter ii and specifically section 13 provides that the commercial appellate division of a high court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from decisions, judgments, orders or decrees passed by the commercial division of that high court or by commercial courts within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the high court. 21 after giving due consideration to the provisions of section 13(1) read with section 13(2) it is apparent that it provides that appeals will lie to the commercial appellate division against the decision of the commercial court or commercial division. the words \"decision\", \"judgment\", \"order\" \"decree\" as such are not defined. it is defined and elaborated under the cpc. from section 13(1) it follows that it includes \"judgment\" or \"order\" and read with sections 8, 13(2) it includes \"decree\" of the commercial court or commercial division. however, it is specifically mentioned in proviso to section 13(1) that such orders as enumerated in order xliii of cpc should be the order against which an appeal against order is maintainable under section 13. further the proviso contemplates that an appeal would lie against appealable order under section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation ssm/dgm 24 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw act, 1996. section 13(2) has restricted the appeals even for section 13 of the commercial courts act by rider that \"no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court other than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\". this is also with \"notwithstanding\" clause under section 13(2) whereby, it is mandated that \"notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of high court\". therefore, taking into consideration the overall provisions and intent of section 13(1)and (2) which provides the specific orders against which an appeal can be filed in such commercial matters. the appeal under section 13 is maintainable, once the suits, petitions applications and appeals are transferred and treated as commercial disputes having specified value, where the learned commercial division judge has taken the decision and/or passed the \"judgment\" and/or \"order\" or \"decree\". it is relevant to note that under section 21 of the commercial courts act, it is mandated and reinforced that the provisions of the commercial courts act will prevail over the provisions of other act. therefore, an appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act is maintainable against the decision/ judgment/ order or decree, if it falls within the ambit of the provisions ssm/dgm 25 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw of the commercial courts act. this includes that the subject matter must be commercial dispute having valuation of more than one crore and falls within the territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction of the respective court and/or division and/or subject to the specific provisions like the arbitration and conciliation act, read with the special statutes and the provisions so required, referred under umbrella of \"commercial dispute\" so defined. appeal against any final decision include the judgment so passed by the commercial court and/or commercial division, the proviso to section 13(1) will not be applicable to such decision/judgment, as the proviso refers to \"orders\". the reference to \"orders\" in the opening portion of section 13(1) would relate to the application of the proviso to sub-section (1). however, the opening portion of sub-section (1) (words prior to the proviso) clearly use the words \"decision\", \"judgment\" and \"order\". therefore, the ambit of this part of sub-section (1) is quite broader when it comes to appeals arising out of orders other than the category of orders falling under order xliii of the cpc. therefore, an appeal under section 13(1), even if there is an order, but which has a tinge or colour of judgment ssm/dgm 26 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw as laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in shah babulal khimji v. jayaben d. kania & anr3 and midnapore peoples' co-op. bank ltd. (supra), the appeal under section 13 against such order being a \"judgment\" within the meaning of cpc, is maintainable. the provisions of cpc (amended and unamended) are applicable to the commercial courts act's proceedings. the term \"judgment\" was not even defined under the letters patent act. in the summary suit, though it is an interlocutory order of granting defendants conditional leave to defend such summary suit, as it directly affects and loses the valuable rights of the defendant without giving full opportunity and as transferred and as heard by the learned commercial division bench/judge, the commercial appeal against such \"judgment\" is maintainable. therefore, we are of the view that there is no reason to hold that the commercial appeal as filed is not maintainable. \"summary suit\" and \"summary judgment\"24 the conceptual position of \"summary suit\" as contemplated under order xxxvii of cpc and its specific 3 (1981) 4 scc 8 ssm/dgm 27 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw provisions are governed as per the original provisions of cpc. the amended cpc, in view of section 16 of the commercial courts act inserted the provision for a \"summary judgment\", through order xiii-a which is made applicable to the classes of suits (commercial suits) which required to be decided by the commercial division/court. it prescribes the procedure and stages for application for summary judgment. this also includes and provides the powers of a commercial judge to pass conditional order including for evidence for hearing of summary judgment. we are concerned with order xiii-a, rule 1(3) of cpc, whereby it is specifically provided \"notwithstanding anything to the contrary, \"an application\" for summary judgment under this order shall not be made in a suit in respect of any commercial disputes that is originally filed as a summary suit under order xxxvii.\". therefore, once the summary suit as originally filed, prior to the commencement of the and as now transferred, being commercial dispute matter, the original procedure as provided under order xxxvii shall be applicable to such summary suits. the parties are not entitled to prayer for summary judgment under xiii-a in view of the specific ssm/dgm 28 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw provision so referred above. this also means that the judgments and the issues so decided in summary suit shall for all purposes be governed by the cpc, even after such suits are transferred as commercial suits. the commercial division judge is required to follow the original c.p.c. and is required to keep in mind the position in law revolving around all the facets of summary suits. the provisions of section 13, therefore, is required to be interpreted and/or considered accordingly, when any decision is given by the commercial division/court in such summary suit. the proviso to section 13(1), will not affect the maintainability of such appeal so filed against such order/judgment passed by the commercial division/court in such summary suit. 25 the submission that section 13 proviso has extinguished, expressly and/or by necessary intentment the appeal against the order passed by the commercial judge in summary suit granting the defendant conditional leave to defend a summary suit is unacceptable. section 13 itself contemplates that an appeal is maintainable against the ssm/dgm 29 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw decision/judgment or order which has effect of \"judgment\", though it falls outside the purview of order xliii as observed above. the right of appeal is creation of statute26 it is settled that a right of appeal is not a matter of procedure, but it is a matter of a substantive right which accrues to the litigant and as exists on the date of suit being instituted (see the constitutional bench decision in garikapati veeraya vs. n. subbiah choudhry & ors 4., para 23) such right of appeal is governed by the law prevailing at the date of the institution of the suit or proceedings and not by the law that prevails at the date of its decision or at the date of filing of the appeal. it is equally settled that a vested right of appeal is not absolute; and that it can in fact be abrogated either explicitly or by implicit intendment. [kamal kumar dutta vs. ruby general hospital5]. the commercial courts act provides for an appeal against the decision, judgment and order so referred above. an appeal is available if the commercial 4 air 1957 sc 540 5 (2006) 7 scc 613 ssm/dgm 30 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw suit/dispute is dealt with by the commercial division/commercial court and passes order/judgment and/or take decision. this statutory appeal as provided, therefore, cannot be taken away notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court [section 13(2)]. the commercial courts act or special statute, if empowers, the appellate division court to deal with the appeal against the judgment/order passed by the commercial division or the commercial court, the bar so submitted of proviso to section 13(1) is not applicable in each and every matter specifically when the subject matters are commercial disputes as defined under the commercial courts act and are also governed by the special act/statute other than the cpc. the specific provisions/ statute/ act will prevail as substantial rights, if are created over the provisions of order xliii

comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 27 section 13 scheme itself provides appeal against decision which includes judgment/order passed by the commercial division/court. there is no provision of revision against the interlocutory order in view of bar of section 8. section 8 further clarifies that only appeal against such order is available subject to section 13 proviso. even the issue of jurisdiction or such challenge will be subject to section 13 of the commercial courts act. therefore, the aggrieved parties have no option but to file appeal against the decision/order. the appellate court, however, may or may not entertain appeal against the order or interlocutory order, in view of proviso to section 13(1). but filing of appeal under section 13, in our view, cannot be occluded. the appeal against any decision of any commercial division/court is maintainable. to entertain or not is the appellate court's power and the jurisdiction depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case. the effect of not permitting to file the commercial appeal, in such matters28 another factor is, if such appeals are not permitted, the aggrieved parties shall have no option but to invoke ordinary jurisdiction of the high court or court to challenge the interlocutory ssm/dgm 32 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw order or order though the decision is by the commercial division/court, as commercial disputes are transferred and governed by the commercial courts act for all the purposes. such dichotomy, in our view, is surely not the intention of the legislature as followed from a cumulative reading of the various provisions as noted by us. the filing of such commercial appeal by the party in the ordinary court, except where suit/application, valuation is less than one crore, therefore, is not what is contemplated. it will frustrate the ambit and object of the commercial courts act. the commercial disputes of specified valued shall be governed by the commercial act only29 there is no scope to any authority, not to transfer the commercial suits, having one crore and above valuation, for the purpose of pecuniary jurisdiction under the commercial courts act, in case of a commercial dispute. the state government needs to take steps as contemplated under sections 19 and 20 of the commercial courts act. all and every concerned authority are bound to aid and assist to give effect to these provisions to all the pending suits/applications, to achieve the object of the commercial courts act. all are bound by the provisions, including amended cpc to ssm/dgm 33 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw expedite the pending suits filed prior or post the commercial courts act. the appeals are also expedited by the provisions so also pending arbitration petitions/appeals as specified, though filed prior to the enforcement of the commercial courts act. sections 10, 13 and 15 deal with the pending arbitration matters, including appeal under section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act. the supreme court in a recent decision in arun dev upadhyaya vs. integrated sales service ltd. & anr.6, now has expanded and included even the appeal under section 50 of the arbitral act in the facts of the case. it needs to be subject to valuation of the suit/appeal. 30 we are also inclined to observe that the vested right of appeal is not taken away by the commercial courts act. however, it is subject to section 13 so recorded above and/or section 13 in no manner takes away and/or extinguishes right of appeal in pending summary suits which are transferred and dealt with by the commercial division/court. 31 having once observed that the appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act is maintainable, we are dealing with the 6 2016(9) scale 427 ssm/dgm 34 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw merits of the matters on the facts and in the background already reflected/mentioned in the initial paras. 32 the background of the litigations between the parties is relevant for consideration of this appeal on merits. the respondent (plaintiff) is a company incorporated under the companies act, 1956 and is a debenture trustee of the debentures issued to vinca developer private limited (\"vinca\") by amazia developers private limited (\"amazia\") and rubix trading private limited (\"rubix\"). amazia and rubix are wholly owned subsidiaries of vinca. the appellant (defendant) and its individual promoters collectively own 90 per cent shareholding in vinca. nederlandse financierings maatschappiji voor ontwikkelingslanden n.v. (\"fmo\") is a corporation constituted under the laws of netherlands. fmo holds 10 per cent shareholding in vinca. fmo also holds 3 compulsorily convertible debentures (ccds) issued by vinca. the said three ccds were convertible within a period of 60 months from december 2009. upon such conversion, fmo would hold 90% shareholding in vinca. the investment made by fmo in vinca in the form of three ccds was used by vinca to purchase optionally ssm/dgm 35 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw convertible debentures (\"opcds\") issued by amazia and rubix. in respect of the opcds, a debenture subscription and debenture trust cum mortgage deed was executed on 1 december 2009 between amazia, the defendant and the plaintiff. similarly in respect of the opcds issued by rubix, a debenture subscription and debenture trust cum mortgage deed dated 1 december 2009 was executed between rubix, the defendant and the plaintiff as amended by opcd amendment agreement dated 8 september 2010. the aforesaid deeds shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as \"the debenture trust deeds\" (dtds). in respect of the liability arising under opcds, the defendant executed a deed of corporate guarantee dated 9 december 2009 in favour of the plaintiff, (the guarantee). 33 for the purpose of the present appeal, the case of the respondent-plaintiff is as under:on 1 december 2009, facility agreement was executed between inter alia rubix trading private limited (as borrower), deutsche investments india private limited (as lender), the respondent (plaintiff) (as security trustee) and the appellant-hubton (defendant) (as confirming party), diipl has provided rubix with a ssm/dgm 36 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw loan facility of rs.23,50,00,000/(rupees twenty three crores and fifty lakhs only). on 9 december 2009, the defendant (as guarantor/surety) has executed a deed of guarantee cum mortgage and under which the defendant has inter alia agreed to stand surety/guarantor and provide guarantee on behalf of rubix in favour of the plaintiff for the benefit of diipl on the terms and conditions more particularly set out therein. on 22 january 2010, the said facility was disbursed to rubix by diipl. on 22 april 2012, rubix was liable to pay interest on the facility each quarter. however, rubix defaulted in payment of interest on the facility since 22 april 2012. on 5 march 2013, rubix made part payment of rs.42,54,745/-. 34 the respondent-idbi (plaintiff) filed summary suit no. 520/2013 on 16 may 2013 against the defendant for recovery of dues under the said guarantee. prior to the filing of the suit, the respondent (plaintiff) (idbi) on 10 may 2013, filed company petition no. 644 of 2013 seeking winding up of the defendant on the ground that the defendant has failed to comply with the statutory notice to pay the amount under the guarantee. on 12 february 2014, the respondent-idbi (plaintiff) filed summary suit no. 480 of 2014 for ssm/dgm 37 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw recovery of the back end coupon dues payable under the said guarantee which amount was not included in the above summary suit. the defendant (hubton) has filed its affidavit in the summons for judgment raising several contentions. the plaintiff too has filed affidavits dealing with the contentions raised by the defendant. an additional affidavit is filed on behalf of the plaintiff dated 4 july 2014 in company petition no. 644 of 2013 bringing on record the various facts. 35 in view of the aforesaid defaults on the part of rubix and the defendant, diipl vide its letter dated 5 june 2013, cancelled the facility with immediate effect and declared that all of the facility, along with accrued interest thereon were immediately due and payable. on 8 june 2013, the advocates for rubix sent diipl a holding reply. on 9 june 2013, in the meantime, considering that rubix had not fulfilled its obligations under the facility agreement and considering that rubix failed and/or neglected to repay the amounts demanded under the recall notice, the plaintiff was constrained to issue a demand certificate to the defendant for the enforcement of the guarantee, in terms of the deed of guarantee. ssm/dgm 38 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 36 rubix's aforesaid holding reply was followed by a further reply dated 18 july 2013, as stated, false, baseless and wholly untenable allegations in its defence. on 8 august 2013, diipl vide their letter replied to rubix's letter dated 18 july 2013. despite repeated requests and reminders and post several meetings and discussions, the defendant and/or rubix have failed and/or neglected to repay the facility along with all amounts due and/or accrued thereunder including interest and default interest since 23 april 2012. in view thereof, on 14 august 2014, diipl was constrained to issue a supplementary recall notice to rubix. on 19 august 2014, the plaintiff (idbi) issued supplementary demand certificate to the defendant (hubton) for the enforcement of the guarantee, in terms of the deed of guarantee. no reply has been received to the aforementioned supplementary recall notice and supplementary demand certificate. hence the summary suit and summons for judgment no.39/2013. 37 the single judge (coram:s.j. kathawalla, j.) on 8 may 2015 in summons for judgment no. 39 of 2013 in summary suit no. ssm/dgm 39 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 520 of 2013 has passed the following order:\"42. in the circumstances i am of the view that the defendant has raised triable issues which require adjudication on further evidence at the time of final disposal of the suit. hence the following order: (i) unconditional leave is granted to the defendant to defend the above suit; (ii) the suit is transferred to the list of commercial causes and the defendant is directed to file its written statement on or before 15th june, 2015; (iii) the hearing of the suit is expedited and the court will endeavour to dispose of the suit within a period of one year from the date of this order. it is clarified that the suit shall be decided without being influenced by any of the observations made in the present order; (iv) place the suit for framing of issues on 29th june, 2015. the summons for judgment is accordingly disposed of.\" 38 the respondent-idbi's (plaintiff's) case in summons for judgment no.111 of 2014 in summary suit no.776 of 2014, is as under:the respondent's (plaintiff's) case is that the deed of guarantee executed by the appellant (defendant) relates to the following three separate and distinct transactions:ssm/dgm 40 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw (a) repayment of the amount of rs.23.50 crores loaned by diipl to rubix under the facility agreement; (b) due performance and repayment by amazia, of its opcds of rs.150 crores issued to vinca on terms and conditions mentioned in amazia opcd subscription and debenture trust deed of 1 december 2009; and (c) due performance and repayment by rubix of opcds totaling rs.268 crores issued and allotted to vinca on terms and conditions mentioned in rubix opcd subscription and debenture trust deed of 1 december 2009. amazia and rubix transactions referred to in (b) and (c) above involved vinca which was a 100% holding company of both amazia and rubix. there was a separate summary suit filed by the plaintiff herein for enforcement of the guarantee given by the defendant herein for those two transactions. it was the case of the defendant in that suit that the opcds reflected investments made by fmo (referred to above), though ostensibly in vinca, actually meant for amazia and rubix operating in the housing sector and what the transaction really contemplated was fdi with assured/fixed returns in housing sector, ssm/dgm 41 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw i.e. in amazia and rubix, through a nominal recipient, vinca. on a summons for judgment taken out in that suit, a learned single judge came to the conclusion that the factual matrix and transaction documents prima facie established that the transaction of routing fdi through the newly interposed vinca was a colourable device and was structured to enable fmo to secure repayment of fdi at a fixed rate of return, thus contrary to the fdi policy and statutory fema regulations and thus, opposed to public policy and illegal. the learned judge held that the deed of guarantee issued by vinca being a part of this structure was also prima facie unenforceable. (the learned judge (s.j. kathawalla,j), accordingly, granted unconditional leave to defend on 8 may 2015). 39 it is, however, the respondent-idbi (plaintiff's) case in the present summary suit that the deed of guarantee insofar as it relates to the dippl loan (forming part of (a) above), which is the subject matter of the present suit, is on the basis of the facility agreement which is in fact a plain vanilla indian rupee loan provided by the plaintiff, an indian registered non-banking finance company to rubix, an indian entity, to which no fdi law or policy applies. it is ssm/dgm 42 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw submitted that though this guarantee is contained in the same document as the guarantee provided for amazia and rubix opcds, it has nothing to do with either of these two transactions. it is submitted that it is an altogether separate transaction and in any event, severable from the other transactions. 40 the defence of the appellant-original defendant (hubtown) was noted in para 6 and 12 of the said summons for judgment, which reads thus:\"the defendant disputes this case. mr. chinoy, learned senior counsel appearing for the defendant, relies on paras 8(iv), (x), (xiii), (xxi) and (xxiv), and paras 15 and 16 of the affidavit in reply and paras 4, 9, 14, 18, 20, 22, 24 and 25 of the affidavit in rejoinder and argues that the circumstances reflected therein show that these three transactions were related and formed part of one whole transaction. the gist of his contentions is this : deutsche bank a.g. agreed to act as an arranger of funds to be invested in a group company/companies of the defendant to the tune of usd 60 million (with an option to increase it to usd 90 to 100 million) at an irr of upto 20% per annum. (the opcds of rubix and amazia were part of this ssm/dgm 43 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw investment.) the consideration payable to deutsche bank was a stipulated arranger fee. the foreign investor identified by deutsche bank (i.e. fmo) was willing to invest around usd 90 to 100 million at a lower irr (i.e. 14.75 % p.a.). as a result, deutsche bank asked for an increased arranger fee. the defendant and its group companies being in a desperate need of funds, had to give in to this demand and were constrained to pay revised arranger fee. deutsche bank, in turn, agreed to reroute a part of the revised arranger fee as a loan to the defendant or any of its group companies. the loan of rs.23.50 extended by diipl, at a far higher rate of interest, was a part of that commitment and thus, a part and parcel of the illegal structuring undertaken by deutsche bank. the defendant submits that it was at the instance of the foreign investor that the loan of rs.23.50 crores was extended as an \"indian leg of the structured transaction of the foreign investor along with deutsche bank a.g. inspite of the fact that rubix was in no need of the additional secured loan of rs.23,50,00,000/from diipl\". relying on these facts, namely, of increased arranger fees, proximity of the dates of the individual transactions and common security documents, mr. chinoy submits that the transaction is one whole and the diipl loan and the deed of ssm/dgm 44 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw guarantee insofar as it relates to that loan cannot be separated from fdi brought into india in an illegal and impermissible manner.\" \"learned counsel for the defendant relies on the analysis of the facts of the case in the plaintiff's suit for enforcement of guarantees in respect of amazia and rubix opcd transactions in idbi trusteeship services ltd. vs. hubtown ltd . 7 by the learned judge (s.j. kathawalla, j.), whilst dealing with the case of videocon industries limited vs. intesa sanpaolo s.p.a . 8 in support of his defence. in that case, the learned judge was considering the severability of the routing of fdi investment in amazia and rubix through the newly interposed vinca (as the nominal recipient of fdi) and the guarantee given by the defendant to ensure repayment of the fdi. the learned judge held them to be prima facie inseverable. here, we are considering the severability of the guarantee towards repayment of fdi and towards repayment of the indian loan, which is separate from the fdi transaction. the observations dated 8 may 2015 of kathawalla, j. in that case have no bearing on this severability.\" 41 the operative part of the impugned order dated 6 june 7 summons for judgment no.39-13 in summary suit no.520-13 decided on 8 may 15. 8 2014 scc online bom 1276 ssm/dgm 45 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 2006 passed in summons for judgment no.111 of 2014 in summary suit, is as under:\"14 accordingly, the summons for judgment is disposed of in terms of the following order:(i) the defendant is granted leave to defend on and subject to the condition of depositing a sum of rs.33,55,16,946.85 in this court within a period of twelve weeks from today; (ii) upon such deposit being made, the suit shall be transferred to the list of commercial causes; (iii) the defendant to file its written statement in the suit within twelve weeks of making of the deposit; (iv) the amount of deposit, if any, shall be invested by the prothonotary & senior master of this court in a fixed deposit of a nationalized bank initially for a period of two years and thereafter, to be renewed from time to time and to abide by further orders that may be passed in the suit; (v) the suit to come up on board for directions after twenty four weeks from today.\" 42 hence, this commercial appeal filed on 12 july 2016. the reasons for the reversal of the impugned ordertwo views on construction of documents-question of law-triable issue43 admittedly, the findings given by the learned single judge on documents being severable or unseverable, goes to the root of the ssm/dgm 46 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw interpretation and the construction of the same documents and the related transactions. the contrary view so expressed by the learned judge in the impugned order (para 40 and 41), in view of the earlier findings (para 39) itself require a consideration in the suit and more particularly when another learned single judge in summary suit no. 520 of 2013 (supra) has prima facie held the document/guarantee is inseverable. in this position we are not persuaded to accept that the ratio of the decision of the supreme court in b.o.i. finance ltd. vs. custodian & ors. 9, and in canbank financial services ltd. vs. the custodian & ors. 10 would be applicable to the facts in hand. reasoning of the learned single judge, (s.j. kathawalla, j.) in order dated 8 may 2015, in para 37.2, 37.3 read thus\"37.2 in the case in hand, i am prima facie of the view that the structure/device of routing fmo's fdi amount of rs. 418 crores to amazia and rubix through the newly interposed vinca (as the nominal recipient of the fdi) was a colourable device structured only to enable fmo to secure repayment (through vinca) of its fdi amount and interest thereon at 14.75%, contrary to the statutory fema regulations and the fdi policy embodied therein, which only permit fdi investment in townships/real estate development sector to be made in the form of equity (including compulsorily convertible debentures) and preclude any assured return. i am also prima facie of the view that the defendant's guarantee (which is the basis of the 9 (1997) 10 scc 488 10 (2004) 8 scc 355 ssm/dgm 47 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw company petition no. 644 of 2013) though ostensibly in favour of vinca, an indian company, was part of the aforesaid illegal structure/scheme and was given to ensure that fmo received back its fdi amount with interest as aforesaid through vinca. the guarantee was therefore part of the aforesaid illegal structures/scheme and therefore prima facie illegal and unenforceable. 37.3 further the question of the defendant not being allowed to plead its own wrong also does not arise in the facts of the present case. through the present petition, the plaintiff (who is admittedly acting at the instance of fmo/fmo's nominees) is in effect seeking the assistance of this court to enable/enforce recovery by fmo of its fdi amount and interest thereon (through vinca), contrary to the provisions of the fema regulations and fdi policy embodied therein. as has been held by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of immami appa rao vs. g. ramalingamurthi (supra), the plaintiff who wants orders in his favour, is actually seeking the active assistance of the court to achieve what the law prohibits/declares illegal and that is clearly and patently inconsistent with public interest. moreover, as has been held by the supreme court in the above case, in such a case there can be no question of estoppel and the paramount consideration of public interest requires that the plea be allowed to be raised and tried.\" the defence so raised itself being the question of law, as the interpretation of documents itself goes to the root of the transactions/contract and the claim based upon it. in the present case, b.o.i. finance ltd. (supra), as relied is not applicable on facts and the laws. that was a case of ssm/dgm 48 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw ready forward contract. in the case in hand, three documents and the transactions, of which two views of the learned judges unless decided finally in due trial, it is difficult to accept the case that the view taken by the one learned judge that transactions are sham and bogus and unseverable and other judge hold it to be severable, without trial and by overlooking the earlier opinion, this itself is a triable issue. the appellate bench also may not decide such issue on such question of law, considering the scope and purpose of law on order xxxvii of the cpc, at this stage of the summary suit. it should be after final judgment. in the present case, the same documents are interlinked and interconnected as observed by the earlier learned judge, therefore, unless these findings are set aside, the findings in the impugned order that those are severable just cannot be accepted, without the trial. the case of misconstruction or interpretation of all connected documents itself made out a case of good defence. it cannot be treated as sham or bogus defence. the misinterpretation itself affects the rights and the transaction/claim. therefore, the construction of documents is always question of law so is the position in case in hand. the distinction, therefore, at this stage, in summary proceedings like this, itself will not sufficient to deny the order of unconditional leave as ssm/dgm 49 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw granted by one judge on the basis of same documents. (sir chunilal v. mehta and sons ltd. vs. century spinning and manufacturing co. ltd. 11 and hero vinoth (minor) vs. seshammal12) interpretation of documents and the nature of transactions-triable issue44 we have to consider the legal position in view of the contentions so raised by the learned counsel appearing for the parties. the apex court in smt. krishnabai bhritar ganpatrao deshmukh vs. appasaheb tuljaramarao nimbalkar13, while dealing with the aspects of interpretation of any deed or documents, has held as under:\"27. secondly, there is ample authority for the proposition that when there is a dispute in regard to the true character of a writing, evidence de hors the document can be led to show that the writing was not the real nature of the transaction, but was only an illusory, fictitious and colourable device which cloaked something else, and that the apparent state of affairs was not the real state of affairs.

(b) if the defendant raises a triable issue indicating that he has a fair or bona fide or reasonable defence although not a positively good defence the plaintiff is not entitled to sign judgment and the defendant is entitled to unconditional leave to defend. (c) if the defendant discloses such facts as may be deemed sufficient to entitle him to defend, that is to say, although the affidavit does not positively and immediately make it clear that he has a defence, yet, shows such a state of facts as leads to the inference that at the trial of the action he may be able to establish a defence to the plaintiff's claim the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment and the defendant is entitled to leave to defend but in such a case the court may in its discretion impose conditions as to the time or mode of trial but not as to payment into court or furnishing security. (d) if the defendant has no defence or the defence set up is illusory or sham or practically moonshine then ordinarily the plaintiff is entitled to leave to sign judgment and the defendant is not entitled to leave to defend. (e) if the defendant has no defence or the defence is illusory or sham or practically moonshine then although ordinarily the plaintiff is entitled to leave to sign judgment, the court may protect the plaintiff by only allowing the defence to proceed if the amount ssm/dgm 52 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw claimed is paid into court or otherwise secured and give leave to the defendant on such condition, and thereby show mercy to the defendant by enabling him to try to prove a defence.\" \"9. the case before us certainly does not fall within the class (e) set out above. it is only in that class of case that an imposition of the condition to deposit an amount in court before proceeding further is justifiable.\" 47 the apex court in this regard has further reiterated above principle and on facts as case was made out granted an unconditional leave. this makes the position of law clear, which need to be kept in mind while granting and/or refusing leave to defend. the case in hand, in our opinion, falls within the ambit of clauses (a) and (b) as expressed in mechelec engineers & manufacturers (supra).
