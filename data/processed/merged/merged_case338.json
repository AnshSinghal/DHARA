Shyam Prasad, J., Delivered The Following:\n\n                        Judgment\nThis appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 [for short, 'the Arbitration Act'] is filed calling in question the order dated 03.12.2021 in Commercial Arbitration Suit No. 6/2019 on the file of the Principal District Judge, Kalaburagi, [for short, 'the commercial Court']. The commercial Court, by the impugned order dated 03.12.2021, has rejected the NC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB appellant's application [I.A.No.I] filed under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 [for short, 'the Limitation Act'] for condonation of the delay of more than 200 days refusing to entertain the application filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.\n2. At the threshold, this Court must record that the first respondent's claim petition before an Arbitral Tribunal has culminated in the award dated 13.05.2016 granting certain relief to the respondents including the refund of Rs.89,49,492/- retained by the appellant. The first respondent has filed its application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act in AS No.3/2017, and this application being belated, has sought for condonation of delay in filing such application. The commercial Court by a separate order has rejected the respondent's application for condonation of delay in filing its application. The first respondent has not challenged this order. \n3. The appellant, upon service of notice of the respondent's application in AS No.3/2017, has filed its NC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB detailed counter claim, and after more than two years from the date of filing such counter claim, the appellant has filed the present suit in A S No.6/2019 under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act along with an application for condonation of delay. The appellant has filed this application for condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act without mentioning the actual period of delay, but in support of the application for condonation of delay, the appellant has contended that the delay is because of the constant transfers of the concerned officers and the delay in constitution of its elected body and in securing a legal opinion. \n4. The commercial Court has rejected the appellant's application for condonation of delay and the suit on merits on separate grounds. The commercial Court has reasoned as follows:\n\" Even, the reasons assigned for condonation of delay is not sufficient. Further, the scope of maintainability of arbitral award is limited to the proposition of law as enunciated under Section 34 of the Arbitration and NC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB Conciliation Act. The grounds urged in the present case does not speak about those aspects while challenging the award. The award was passed on 09.03.2017 and the suit is filed on 07.08.2019. Hence, there is inordinate delay in filing the suit and it is not explained properly. The mandatory provisions of Section 34 (3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act clearly bars the suit. The appellant in his affidavit has not stated the date on which he has made an application for obtaining certified copy of the award and the date on which he received the award or when the award was served to him by the Arbitrator himself. In the absence of such averments, it cannot be said that suit was filed in time. Therefore, in view of the discussion made above, this Court comes to the conclusion that I.A.No.I filed under Section 5 of the Limitation Act is liable to be dismissed and consequently, the suit filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is also liable to be dismissed as not maintainable.\" \nAs regards the other ground, the commercial Court has opined that because a pre-deposit of 75% of the award amount is not deposited, the suit under Section 34 must also be rejected. \nNC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB 5. Sri Ameet Kumar Deshpande, the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant, and Sri Manvendra Reddy, the learned counsel for the first respondent, are heard on the application filed for condonation of delay of 190 days in filing the present application under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act in the light of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Government of Maharashtra (Water Resources Department) vs. Borse Brothers Engineers and Contractors Private Limited reported in (2021) 6 SCC 460. They do not dispute that with this decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court it is settled that an application for condonation of delay in filing an application under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act will have to be considered in the light of the provisions of Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and Section 5 of the Limitation Act, that the delay could be condoned provided it is shown that the applicant has acted bona fide without negligence, and in the discretion of the Court if no right has accrued to the other party during the delay period. \nNC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB 6. However, Sri Ameet Kumar Deshpande submits that this Court must condone the delay of 190 days on the following grounds, which includes his submissions on merits of the application under Section 37 of the Act:\n6.1 The commercial Court has dismissed the application on the ground of maintainability holding that the appellant has failed to deposit 75% of the amount payable in terms of the award. There is nothing in law which contemplates this requirement as a pre-deposit. \nThe commercial Court has failed to consider that the appellant, upon service of notice of the respondent's suit under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, has filed a detailed objections as against the award. The present suit in AS 6/2019, along with an application for condonation of delay, is filed only to ensure that there is no formal defect. \n6.2 If the date for the purposes of condonation of delay is reckoned in the aforesaid circumstances, it would relate back to the date of filing statement of objections, and in the circumstances explained, sufficient cause is NC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB shown for condonation of delay. The commercial Court has failed to consider these circumstances. Earlier, a party to the arbitral proceedings, because of certain judicial pronouncements, could not have filed a counter claim, but with the recent amendment to the Arbitration Act, it is open to the party to the proceedings to file a counter claim. In any event, if a counter claim could be filed in the arbitral proceedings, it would also be permissible to file cross objections in an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. \n6.3 The appellant's position that the limitation for the purpose of computation of delay must be reckoned from the date on which the statement of objections are filed in AS No.3/2017 would be within time should have been examined in the afore circumstances, and hence it was permissible for the commercial Court to consider the question of delay as canvassed by the appellant. The failure has resulted in injustice. \nNC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB 6.4 The limitation for filing an application under Section 34 will have to be reckoned from the date a copy of the signed award is made over by the Arbitrator and received by the party. This would follow from the conjoint reading of the provisions of Section 31(5) and Sections 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. If an enquiry is held on the merits of the application filed for condonation of delay before the commercial Court, the appellant would have an opportunity to show that the appellant was not delivered with a copy of the award duly signed as contemplated under Section 31(5) of the Arbitration Act. The circumstances established in such enquiry could be considered to assess sufficient cause necessary for condonation of delay beyond 90 days. \n6.5 The appellant is a statutory committee and hence the question of condonation of delay not just in the present proceedings but also in the proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act must necessarily be considered in the light of all the circumstances including the fact that the appellant is a statutory committee. \n- 10 - NC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB 7. Sri Manvendra Reddy refutes these submissions contending that the appellant has not set forth any of these circumstances in the affidavit accompanying the application filed before the commercial Court. The appellant has only stated that the delay is because of the delay in constitution of the elected body, repeated transfers of the officials and the time taken to secure a legal opinion. The appellant has filed detailed statement of objections upon receipt of service of the respondent's application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, and after a period of over 200 days thereafter the application is filed along with an application for condonation of delay. The Courts can condone delay of only 30 days or after the 90 days, and when it is undisputed that the delay is over 200 days, it would not be open even for the commercial Courts to condone the delay and the commercial Court has rightly rejected. \n8. Sri Manvendra Reddy emphasizes that the jurisdiction to condone the delay must be exercised only in - 11 - NC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB exceptional circumstances where bona fides are demonstrated. Here, the appellant did not file an application for a period of over 200 days despite service of notice in the application filed by the appellant, and even the present application is belated by 190 days. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Government of Maharashtra (Water Resources Department) vs. Borse Brothers Engineers and Contractors Private Limited supra, has refused to condone the delay of 131 days because reasons were not sufficiently explained. As such, this Court must reject the application and consequentially the appeal. \n9. These rival submissions are considered to decide on the following question:\nWhether the appellant has shown sufficient cause and bona fides for exercising the discretion to condone the delay of 190 days and if in this Court's opinion the appellant has failed to establish bona fides or shown sufficient cause, what order should follow. \n10. The exposition of law by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Government of Maharashtra (Water Resources - 12 - NC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB Department) vs. Borse Brothers Engineers and Contractors Private Limited supra on the condonation of delay even when the appeal is filed by the Government under Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Act [in para 63 of the decision] is as follows:\n\"Given the aforesaid and the object of speedy disposal sought to be achieved both under the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act, for appeals filed under section 37 of the Arbitration Act that are governed by Articles 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act or section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, a delay beyond 90 days, 30 days or 60 days, respectively, is to be condoned by way of exception and not by way of rule. In a fit case in which a party has otherwise acted bona fide and not in a negligent manner, a short delay beyond such period can, in the discretion of the court, be condoned, always bearing in mind that the other side of the picture is that the opposite party may have acquired both in equity and justice, what may now be lost by the first party's inaction, negligence or laches. \n- 13 - NC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB The merits of the appellant's application for condonation in presenting this appeal, as also the application before the commercial Court, must be examined in the bona fides, or the lack of bona fides, that comes through the circumstances of the case because, with the exposition as aforesaid, it cannot be disputed that the delay, either before this Court or the commercial Court, could be condoned only in exceptional circumstances and where bona fides are established. \n11. The appellant's application before the commercial Court is silent on the number of delayed days, but it is admitted before this Court that the delay in filing such application is more than two years from the date of filing of statement of objections in the application by the respondent in AS No.3/2017 as against the same award. This puts the delay in filing the application before the commercial Court beyond the period that could be ordinarily condoned. As is obvious from the submissions before this Court, an effort is made to contend that the delay must be reckoned not from the date on which the - 14 - NC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB application is presented but the day on which the detailed objections are filed, and in any event, there must be an enquiry on the request for condonation of delay because the Arbitrator did not deliver a signed award to the respondent as contemplated under Section 31(5) of the Arbitration Act. The application for condonation of delay before the commercial Court does not advert to these circumstances and therefore, rather than comment on whether such exercise must be undertaken in the circumstances of this case, this Court must opine that this argument appears to be a complete afterthought. \n12. The onus, as reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, is to establish bona fides for exercise of discretion, and this exercise must be only in exceptional circumstance. If the appellant were to be bona fide in setting up these circumstances, it should have in the least referred to the relevant circumstances and sought for indulgence. The absence thereof, constrains this Court to opine that these circumstances are put forth for the first time before this Court as an afterthought and belies the - 15 - NC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB bona fides in filing the present appeal as well belatedly. The suit before the commercial Court is delayed by over 200 days and this appeal by over 190 days, the delay cannot be condoned just because the appellant is a public body, as emphasized by the decision in Government of Maharashtra (Water Resources Department) vs. Borse Brothers Engineers and Contractors Private Limited supra in para No.59.\n13. In the aforesaid circumstances, this Court is of the view that the commercial Court's conclusion that the appellant's application for condonation of delay in the absence of the material particulars, a finding which cannot be factually found fault with, is just and proper and does not call for any interference. Consequentially, i.e., because bona fides are not established, the questions framed for consideration are answered in favour of the respondent, rejecting not just the application for condonation of delay but also the appeal. \n- 16 - NC: 2023:KHC-K:1293-DB 14. At this stage, Sri Ameet Kumar Deshpande submits that an undertaking is given on behalf of the respondent in the present proceedings that though execution proceedings are initiated for enforcement of the award, no precipitative action would be sought for in such execution proceeding, and with the present disposal of the appeal, this Court may grant certain sufficient reasonable time for the appellant to pursue its further remedy. This submission must be recorded only to answer that this request could be made in the execution proceedings to be considered strictly in accordance with law. \nIn view of disposal of the appeal, pending interlocutory applications, if any, stand disposed of. \nSd/-\nJUDGE Sd/-\nJUDGE SWK",

ms. justice shalinder kaur judgment 1. the petitioner has preferred to invoke the power of superintendence vested in this court under article 227 of the constitution impugning the order dated 10.04.2023 passed by learned district judge (commercial court) -01, west, tis hazari court, delhi (in short \"commercial court\") in cs (comm) no. 320/2021 titled as \"sh. naveen sabharwal proprietor m/s nav prints vs shr. rajesh wadhawan proprietor m/s global trendz\" whereby petitioner's written statement was not allowed to form part of the record in view of non-conformity to order vi rule 15a of code of civil procedure, 1908 (in short \"cpc\") thereby striking of his defence in the suit. 2. it would be apposite to elucidate the relevant facts starting with the respondent filing a suit for recovery of rs. 33,50,081/against the petitioner before the learned commercial court wherein the summons were issued to the petitioner on 13.08.2021. the petitioner was served with summon of the suit through whatsapp and email on 26.08.2021. on 23.10.2021, the petitioner did not appear before the learned commercial court and hence was proceeded ex-parte. later that day, the petitioner appeared before the court and was apprised of the order passed and an application for setting aside ex-parte order was moved on the same day. the application of the petitioner was allowed on 25.11.2021 and the ex-parte order was set aside by the learned commercial court and the matter was posted for filing of written statement subject to issue of limitation on 05.01.2022. 3. thereafter, the petitioner on 04.01.2022 filed the written statement along with the affidavit through the email and also filed the physical copy of the same on 06.01.2022 before the learned commercial court. 4. upon filing of the written statement, the respondent filed replication along with an application under order vi rule 15a cpc for striking the petitioner's written statement off the record on the ground that the written statement as filed by the petitioner does not comply with the mandate of order vi rule 15a cpc as the same is not duly supported by the statement of truth and signatures are not appended on each and every page of the written statement. 5. due to non-appearance of the petitioner, the learned commercial court on 09.05.2022 again proceeded ex-parte against the petitioner and posted the matter for ex-parte plaintiff's evidence. upon learning of this, petitioner filed an application under order ix rule 7 cpc seeking to set aside the said ex-parte order dated 09.05.2022 which was allowed vide order dated 26.11.2022 subject to cost of rs. 4,000. matter was then fixed for reply and consideration of the application of the respondent under order vi rule 15a cpc on 24.01.2023. 6. subsequently, the petitioner filed reply to the said application of the respondent and also moved an application under order v rule 1 read with section 151 cpc seeking condonation of delay in filing the written statement after curing the defective written statement supported by statement of truth and with signatures appended on each and every page. respondent filed reply to the application of the petitioner and the arguments were heard on 18.03.2023. vide the impugned order, the learned commercial court dismissed the petitioner's application under order v rule 1 cpc and allowed the application of the respondent under order vi rule 15a cpc thereby striking off the written statement from the record by not allowing the petitioner to rely on it. hence, the present petition before this court. contentions of the parties 7. mr. tarun satija, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that petitioner had filed the written statement on 04.01.2022 and its physical copy was placed on record on 06.01.2022 which is within the extended time of limitation as provided by hon'ble supreme court in re: cognizance for extension of limitation, (2021) 17 scc 231, however, the learned commercial court erred in dismissing application holding that no explanation was given by the petitioner for not curing the defects in the written statement within reasonable period once the defects came into petitioner's knowledge. 8. learned counsel vehemently submitted that provisions under order vi rule 15a cpc are directory in nature and non-compliance will not render the filing of the written statement non-est as the said defects are curable in nature. thus, limitation would also stop running the moment the written statement is filed. 9. learned counsel further submitted that delay in re-filing of the written statement has to be treated on a different footing than delay in filing the original written statement, specifically when the defects are not material and only procedural not affecting the substance of the written statement, the delay in re-filing could be condoned. 10. learned counsel also submitted that the written statement after removing defects could not be immediately filed as the petitioner's son was undergoing continuous treatment for a serious medical ailment and was admitted to the hospital for 15 days. the learned commercial court has ignored the said fact while considering his application. 11. in this regard, the learned counsel in support of his contentions placed reliance on various judgements set hereinbelow: 1. udai shankar triyar v. ram kalevar prasad singh, 2005 scc online sc 2. delhi development authority v. durga construction co., (2013) scc online del 4451 3. m/s unilec engineer ltd. v. hpl electric and power ltd, 2023 scc online

ltd., 2021 scc online cal 2457 12. per contra, mr. rajesh mahindra, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the petitioner has been delaying the present suit since its inception and therefore, the conduct of the petitioner is required to be seriously looked at. moreso, due to non-appearance of the petitioner on various dates, the learned commercial court had proceeded ex-parte twice, which orders were set aside subsequently on the applications moved by the petitioner before the learned commercial court. however, petitioner had been deliberately delaying the proceedings of respondent's suit on flimsy grounds. 13. learned counsel submitted that petitioner has failed to furnish any explanation for not filing the written statement after alleged removal of defects within a reasonable time period from filing of the first written statement i.e. 04.01.2022. 14. it was contended that the petitioner has no right to file the subsequent written statement as under no provision of law without seeking amendment, a second written statement is permissible to be placed on record, more so, the said written statement is to be tested from date of filing and limitation is to be calculated from date of service. since, subsequent written statement was filed on 13.01.2023, almost after one year which is beyond 120 days, thus, the said written statement which is highly belated, it cannot be taken on record and is liable to be rejected. 15. it was further submitted although no limitation period is prescribed for curing the defects, however, it cannot be more than the total period of limitation provided for filing a written statement. reliance, was placed on prayag polytech p. ltd. vs raj kumar tulsian, 2023 scc online del 6058. 16. concluding his submissions, the learned counsel submitted that the case before the learned commercial court is at the final stage and even the written submissions in support of the arguments has been filed by the respondent and thus the petitioner cannot be permitted to restart the entire trial after more than three years having been passed since the filing of the suit. reasons and conclusion 17. before coming to the factual matrix of the case, it will be apposite to produce the provision under order vi rule 15a of cpc as amended by the commercial courts act, 2015, which is hereunder: \"[15a verification of pleadings in a commercial dispute -(1) notwithstanding anything contained in rule 15, every pleading in a commercial dispute shall be verified by an affidavit in the manner and form prescribed in the appendix to this schedule. (2) an affidavit under sub-rule (1) above shall be signed by the party or by one of the parties to the proceedings, or by any other person on behalf of such party or parties who is proved to the satisfaction of the court to be acquainted with the facts of the case and who is duly authorised by such party or parties. (3) where a pleading is amended, the amendments must be verified in the form and manner referred to in sub-rule (1) unless the court orders otherwise. (4) where a pleading is not verified in the manner provided under sub-rule (1), the party shall not be permitted to rely on such pleading as evidence or any of the matters set out therein. (5) the court may strike out a pleading which is not verified by a statement of truth, namely, the affidavit set out in the appendix to this schedule.] 18. the aforesaid provision mandates the verification of pleadings by way of an affidavit, which ensures that the statements made in the pleadings are duly authenticated and verified under oath and in absence of such verification, the pleadings cannot be relied as evidence. even if the pleading is to be amended, the same has to be abided by the rigors of order vi rule 15a cpc and non-compliance of which may result in the court rejecting the pleading or would require the party to have such defects rectified. 19. the statement of truth accompanying a pleading is sworn by the deponent who on oath undertakes that the contents of the accompanying pleading have been drafted as under his directions and instructions and moreso are true and correct to his knowledge. the said affidavit has to be attested, signed and to be filed along with the pleading. therefore, this reflects the importance of strict compliance with the mandate of verification of pleadings. 20. the learned single judge of this court in raj kumar gupta vs m/s narang constructions & financiers pvt. ltd., 2023 iv ad (delhi) 535 held that non-attesting of a an accompanying affidavit was a mere irregularity which was a curable defect and would not render the filing as non-est. 21. in oil and natural gas corporation ltd. vs joint venture of sai rama engineering enterprises (sree) and ors., manu/de/0049/2023, this court while dealing with an application under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, held that filing of an affidavit in support of an application is a procedural requirement. the statement of truth by way of an affidavit is also a procedural matter and it would not render the aforesaid application as non-est but only defective. 22. further, the learned division bench of this court in prayag polytech pvt. ltd and another vs raj kumar tulsian, 2023 scc online del 6058 had categorically held that mere non-signing of each and every page of the pleadings is per se a defect, but the same could very well be cured. likewise, any defect in verification of an affidavit in the nature of statement of truth is also curable. 23. needless to say, after occurrence of such defects, whether the same can be condoned or allowed to be cured will depend on facts and circumstances of each case based on factor such as stage of proceedings in the suit as well as law of limitation. 24. in the present case, the written statement was filed by the petitioner on 04.01.2022 through email and also on 06.01.2022 physically in court. it is also true that period of limitation with respect to all kinds of limitations was extended by hon'ble supreme court vide re: cognizance for extension of limitation (supra), from 15.03.2020 till 28.02.2022 by granting further time up to may, 2022 for the purposes of limitation. therefore, the filing of the written statement was not challenged on the ground of limitation. 25. it is not disputed that petitioner has taken considerable time in curing the defects. the learned commercial court while considering the application filed by the petitioner under order v rule 1 cpc and the application filed by the respondent under order vi rule 15a cpc came to the conclusion that petitioner was negligent in filing the application for curing the defects by a period of more than four months specifically when the petitioner had already became aware of the defects in the written statement. 26. it is noticed that on 09.05.2022 the petitioner was proceeded ex-parte and the same was set aside on 26.11.2022, thereafter, time was granted to the petitioner to file reply to respondent's application under order vi rule 15a cpc and matter was directed to be listed on 24.01.2023. it is further noticed that on 24.01.2023, at the request of the petitioner matter was adjourned to 31.01.2023. on the said date, the petitioner took steps for curing the defects in the written statement. 27. indisputably, the written statement initially filed suffered from defects inasmuch as each and every single page of the same were not duly appended by the signatures and moreso, the written statement was not supported by the statement of truth. therefore, the written statement indeed suffered from defects. however, it is now well settled that defects such as noted above, are not fatal defects and are very much curable. the said defects will also not render the written statement being non-est. from the aforesaid cited authorities, it is clear that the filing of statement of truth is a procedural matter and as well as no signatures appended on each and every page is also a curable defect. 28. the rectified written statement filed after curing the aforesaid defects was filed by the petitioner on 24.01.2023 by moving an application under order v rule 1 cpc seeking condonation of delay in filing the written statement duly supported by statement of truth and as well as signatures appended on each and every page of the written statement. moreso, it is also undisputed that the subsequent written statement has not been changed in any manner in substance other than the defects being cured, thus written statement filed on 24.01.2023 relates back to having being filed on 04.01.2022. the respondent had already filed its replication to the written statement dated 04.01.2022/06.01.2022. 29. it is settled law, the rigors of procedure are handmaid of justice and it has to be ensured that substantive justice is done to both the parties. the technicalities should be applied in a manner that promotes fairness and upholds the rights of all the parties. 30. having considered the aforesaid and taking into account the peculiar facts of the present case, the impugned order dated 10.04.2023 is set aside and the written statement, as cured after removing of the defects by the petitioner on 24.01.2023, is allowed to be taken on record, subject to the petitioner paying the cost of rs. 35,000/to the respondent, due to the delay caused by the petitioner in not pursuing the case diligently. the aforesaid cost to be paid before the learned commercial court on the next date of hearing. 31. accordingly, the petition is allowed and the pending application stands disposed of. shalinder kaur, j. august 01, 2024 su"
