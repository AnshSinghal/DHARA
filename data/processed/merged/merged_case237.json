Several applications in suits pending before the Commercial Division as well as in suits pending before the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court along with petitions under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 pending in the Commercial Division of this Hon'ble Court as well as in the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court have been heard analogously as they involved issues relating Section 12A and Section 15 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. \n2. The Advocates appearing for the respective parties have advanced elaborate submissions in support of their respective contentions. For the sake of convenience, the respective submissions have been summarised in the paragraphs hereinafter. \n3. The following issues have arisen for consideration :-\n(1) Is Sect ion 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 mandatory or directory? \n(2) What is the interplay of Section 12A and Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 in a suit involving a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act of 2015 filed in the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of a High Court subsequent to the date of notification of the Specified Value ? \n(3) In view of the provisions of Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 can a suit of the Specified Value involving a commercial dispute within the meaning of the Act of 2015 be transferred to the Commercial Division of the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court? \n(4) If the answer to the preceding issue is in the affirmative then what are the procedure and the modalities for the transfer? \n(5) Can a suit filed in the Commercial Division of the High Court be transferred to the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of the High Court on finding that the suit does not involve a commercial dispute within the meaning of the Act of 2015 ? \n(6) If the answer to the preceding issue is in the affirmative then what would be the procedure and modality for the same. \n(7) How should proceedings under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 be dealt with in respect of the previous issues? \n4. Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the first defendant in CS No. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, provisions of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 are mandatory. He has relied upon Section 12A of the Act of 2015 and submitted that, the plaintiff approaching the Commercial Division of a Court in respect of a commercial dispute is mandatorily required to undertake pre-institution mediation. Only in the event, the plaintiff has claimed that, the plaintiff requires urgent reliefs, the plaintiff need not undertake a pre-institution mediation. In such circumstances, the plaintiff has to obtain leave of the Court under Section 12A of the Act of 2015, so as not to undertake a pre-institution mediation and then the suit can be instituted. In the present case, there is no pleading in the plaint that there is any urgency. The plaintiff has not claimed in the plaint that, pre-institution mediation is not required. The plaintiff has not pleaded anything with regard to Section 12A of the Act of 2015 in the plaint. \n5. Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the first defendant in CS No. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, the word 'shall' used in Sub-Section (1) of Section 12(A) is mandatory in nature. According to him, the scheme by the Act of 2015 has a requirement for expeditious disposal of a commercial dispute. In order to attain expeditious disposal of a commercial dispute the legislature has thought it appropriate that, the plaintiff approaching a Commercial Division of a Court undertakes a pre- institution mediation in order to have expeditious resolution of the commercial dispute acceptable to all parties concerned. Therefore, the word 'shall' as used in Sub-Section (1) of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 should not be read to mean that it is directory. \n6. Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the first defendant in CS No. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, the authority for the purpose of pre- institution mediation was notified on July 3, 2018. The said authority and the District Authority constituted under the Legal Services Act, 1987 has been designated as the authority concerned to undertake a pre- institution mediation. \n7. Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the first defendant in CS No. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, since the plaintiff did not obtain leave under Section 12A of the Act of 2015 and since, the plaintiff never applied for any urgent relief, the plaint of the instant suit should be rejected. \n8. Learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff in CS No. 213 of 2018 has submitted that there are two previous applications pending between the parties in the suit. One of such application is at the behest of the first defendant being GA No. 1106 of 2019 seeking extension of time to file written statement. The other application is that of the plaintiff being GA No. 1179 of 2019, under Chapter XIIIA of the Original Side Rules. According to him, the first defendant having accepted the jurisdiction of the Hon'ble Court and having participated in the suit, cannot be permitted to rake up the issue of lack of jurisdiction. Moreover, the plaintiff has obtained leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patents Act, 1865 to institute the instant suit. \n9. Learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff in CS No. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, on a meaningful reading of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 along with the objects and purpose of such Act, the provisions of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 can be said to be directory in nature. According to him, provisions of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 are not a part of the substantive law. Such provisions cannot be read so as to non- suit a plaintiff who otherwise has a legal and valid claim. A person should not ordinarily be denied the opportunity of participating in the process of justice dispensation unless compelled by express and specific language of the statute. According to him, Section 12A has not prescribed a consequence of failure to comply, therefore, such provision should always be read to be directory. Moreover, no equity or right is created in favour of any defendant in a suit filed in the Commercial Division under the provisions of Section 12A of the Act of 2015. Therefore, Section 12A of the Act of 2015 should be held to be directory. According to him, the Act of 2015 is more in the nature of procedural law and hence should not be read in such a manner so as to create a complete embargo on a person approaching a Court of law. \n10. In support of the contention that, the word 'shall' used in Section 12A of the Act of 2015 can be read as directory, learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff in CS No. 213 of 2018 has relied upon 2007 Volume 6 Supreme Court Cases page 420 (R.N. Jadi & Brothers & Ors. v. Subhash Chandra), 2008 Volume 11 Supreme Court Cases page 769 (Zolba v. Keshao & Ors.), All India Reporter 1957 Supreme Court 912 (State of U.P. v. Manbodhan Lal Srivastava), All India Reporter 1955 Supreme Court 233 (Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Syed Ahmad Ishaque & Ors.), All India Reporter 2010 Supreme Court 2261 (Shivjee Singh v. Nagendra Tiwary & Ors.), All India Reporter 1954 Calcutta page 49 (Ajit Kumar Sen & Anr. v. State of West Bengal & Ors.), All India Reporter 1991 Kerala page 240 (The Food Inspector, Cannanore Municipality, Cannanore v. M. Gopalan), All India Reporter 2005 Patna page 136 (Smt.

Ltd.), 2018 Volume 9 Supreme Court Cases page 472 (State of Bihar & Ors. v. Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti).\n11. Referring to Section 12A of the Act of 2015, learned Advocate for the plaintiff in CS No. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, unlike the provisions of Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, Section 12A of the Act of 2015 does not provide that leave has to be obtained from the Court. He has contrasted the provisions of Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 with that of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 and submitted that, Section 12A of the Act of 2015 not expressly providing for leave to be obtained and significantly not providing for the consequence of the failure to obtain leave under Section 12A of the Act of 2015 , assuming that such leave is required to be obtained, then the only possible inference is that the provisions of Section 12A is not mandatory. No leave under Section 12A of the Act of 2015 is required when a plaintiff did not undertake a pre-institution mediation and that non-obtaining of such leave is not fatal to the suit instituted. \n12. In reply, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the first defendant in CS No. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, the provisions of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 are mandatory. He has submitted that, the Central Government has designated the authority for the purpose of pre- institution mediation by the notification dated July 3, 2018. The intention of the Act of 2015 is to expedite resolution of disputes. Such resolution need not be through courts. The Act of 2015 has created an opportunity to the parties to settle their disputes by way of mediation prior to approaching the Court. \n13. Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the first defendant in CS No. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, the provisions of Commercial Courts (Pre-institution Mediation and Settlement) Rules, 2018 and particularly Rule 3(1) thereof do not dilute the mandatory nature of Section 12A of the Act of 2015. The word 'may' used in the Rules of 2018 governs the manner in which an application to the designated authority can be made. An application can be made either online or by post or by hand. The word 'may' used in Rule 3 of the Rules of 2018 cannot be construed to mean that a party may apply for pre-institution mediation. In any event, rules framed under a statute cannot override the statute. In support of such contentions, he has relied upon 1984 Volume 2 Supreme Court Cases page 50 (Babaji Kondaji Garad v. Nasik Merchants Co-operative Bank Ltd. Nasik). \n14. In support of the contention that, the provisions of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 is mandatory and that compliance thereof are required for a valid institution of a suit learned Senior Advocate appearing for the first defendant in CS No. 213 of 2018 has relied upon 2011 SCC Online 4325 (Cal.) (Port Blair v. Airport Authority of India), 2012 Volume 13 Supreme Court Cases page 538 (Chaluvegowda v. State) and 1970 Volume 3 Supreme Court Cases page 716 (Gangappa Gurupadappa Guwad v. Rachawwa). \n15. In CS No.136 of 2020, the defendant No. 1 has applied for rejection of the plaint and stay of proceedings of the suit. \n16. Learned advocate appearing for the defendant No. 1 has submitted that, the disputes involved in CS No. 136 of 2020 cannot be said to be commercial disputes within the meaning of section 2 (1) (c) of the Act of 2015. He has referred to the pleadings of the plaint. He has drawn the attention of the Court to the prayers of the plaint. He has submitted that, the Specified Value under the Act of 2015 is now at Rupees 3 lakhs. The suit has been filed in the year 2021, when the Specified Value for commercial suits stood at Rupees 3 lakhs. He has referred to the agreement between the parties as relied upon by the plaintiff in the suit. According to him, the suit property has been used exclusively for commercial purposes and therefore the suit is in respect of a dispute which is a commercial dispute within the meaning of the Act of 2015. He has relied upon 2019 SCC Online SC 1311 (Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd versus K S Infraspace LLP and another) in support of the contention that, the present suit is a suit involving a commercial dispute within the meaning of the Act of 2015. \n17. Learned advocate appearing for the defendant No. 1 in CS No.136 of 2020 has submitted that, on return of a plaint under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 and on the returned plaint being presented before the competent court, such date of presentation is the date of commencement of the fresh suit. The latter suit cannot be considered as a continuation of the earlier suit. In support of such contentions, he has relied upon 2014 Volume 1 Supreme Court Cases 648 (Oil and Natural Gas Corporation versus Modern Construction and Company). \n18. Relying upon All India Reporter 1963 Supreme Court 424 (Amar Nath Dogra versus Union of India) and All India Reporter 1984 Supreme Court 1043 (Behari Chowdhary and another versus State of Bihar and others) learned advocate appearing for the defendant No. 1 in CS No.136 of 2020 has submitted that, the provisions of section 12A of the Act of 2015 are mandatory. Section 12A is akin to section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908. According to him, a suit which does not satisfy the terms of section 12A of the Act of 2015 is liable to be dismissed. \n19. Learned senior advocate appearing for the plaintiff in CS No.136 of 2020 has submitted that, the application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 made by the defendant No. 1 is not maintainable. He has relied upon Ambalal Sarabhai (supra) and All India Reporter 2016 Delhi 186 (Soni Dave versus Translation Industries Expositions Private Limited) in support of the contentions that, unless it is pleaded in the plaint, that the property with respect to which the suit has been filed is used exclusively in trade and commerce, it cannot be kept in the commercial division by labelling it as a commercial dispute. He has contended that, the question as to whether the dispute arises out of an agreement relating to an immovable property used exclusively in trade and commerce is a mixed question of fact and law and cannot be decided on a demurrer. \n20. Referring to section 15 of the Act of 2015, learned senior advocate appearing for the plaintiff in CS No.136 of 2020 has submitted that, the court should exercise its jurisdiction thereunder in order to transfer the suit to the Commercial Division. According to him, unlike section 31 of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 section 15 of the Act of 2015 has not used the word 'pending prior'. According to him, section 15 of the Act of 2015 has application on all suits pending and is not restricted to suits pending prior to the act coming into force. Suits that have been filed both before and after the Act of 2015 coming into force should be transferred by using section 15 of the Act of 2015. He has relied upon 2016 SCC Online Bom 9019 (Hubtown Ltd. versus IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd.) in support of such contentions. He has submitted that, although section 12 A of the Act of 2015 has been introduced after the judgement of Hubtown (supra) then also, the interpretation given thereunder should be applied. \n21. Learned advocate appearing for the parties have drawn the attention of the court to the judgement and order dated February 22, 2021 passed in C.O. No. 1678 of 2020 (M/s Dhanbad Fuels Ltd versus Union of India and others) and submitted that, on a transfer of a suit from the regular court to the commercial division, such a suit can be registered but not admitted till such time, the rigours of Section 12 A of the Act of 2015 have been complied with.\n22. Learned Senior Advocate for the petitioner appearing in IA GA No. 1 of 2020 in AP No. 25 of 2016 has submitted that, there is interportability of suits and proceedings between the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of the High Court and the Commercial Division. According to him, irrespective of whether a suit is a regular suit or a commercial suit, a suit is filed before the Hon'ble High Court at Calcutta and is under the High Court's Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction. According to him a filing in a Commercial Division of a High Court is done in the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of the Court. In terms of Section 2(1)(d) read with Section 4 of the Act of 2015, such a suit is then heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the Hon'ble Court. Therefore, if a suit is incorrectly filed as a civil suit before the regular bench, the recourse is to transfer such suit to the Commercial Division. According to him, such a transfer is akin to a transfer from a bench not having a determination to the bench conferred with such determination by the Chief Justice. Since it is a transfer intra Court, the principles relating to Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 does not apply. Once a Court exercises powers, under Section 15 of the Act of 2015 and transfers the suit to the Commercial Division the provisions under Section 15(3) of the Act of 2015 become applicable and the Commercial Division will ensure that all procedures that were not completed at the time of transfer are completed in relation to the suit. In addition to other procedural compliances such as those relates to the statement of truth, the compliance will also relate to Section 12A of the Act of 2015. Until such procedural requirements are completed with, the suit will be deemed to have been filed but not instituted and no further steps can be taken in the suit until such procedures are completed. \n23. Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner in IA GA No. 1 of 2020 in AP No 25 of 2016 has submitted that, the Court should take into account that the dismissal of a suit on the ground that it has been filed in a Civil Court and not as a commercial suit will be harsh and imply loss of Court fees. Innocent clients may be unfairly penalized solely due to errors on the part of the lawyers. According to him, Section 12A of the Act of 2015 is applicable only to institutions of suits and is not applicable to arbitration application. \n24. As the statement of objects and reasons of the Act of 2015 has stated, the Act of 2015 came into being to provide a mechanism for speedy disposal of high-value commercial disputes. According to the government high-value commercial disputes involve complex facts and questions of law. Therefore, the government has felt the need to provide for an independent mechanism for their early resolution. Early resolution of commercial dispute has been conceived to create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive legal system of the country. The Act of 2015 has been brought about to accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the Indian Justice delivery system and repose the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation.\n25. The Act of 2015 has been divided into eight chapters. Chapter IIIA has been inserted to the Act of 2015 with retrospective effect from May 3, 2018. This chapter contains Section 12A. In the facts of the present case, the Court has not been called upon to deal with the retrospective effect of Section 12A of the Act of 2015. Section 12A of the Act of 2015 is as follows:-\n\"12A. Pre-Institution Mediation and Settlement--(1) A suit, which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief under this Act, shall not be instituted unless the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of preinstitution mediation in accordance with such manner and procedure as may be prescribed by rules made by the Central Government.\n( 2) The Central Government may, by notification, authorise the Authorities constituted under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 (39 of 1987), for the purposes of pre-institution mediation. \n(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 (39 of 1987), the Authority authorised by the Central Government under sub-section (2) shall complete the process of mediation within a period of three months from the date of application made by the plaintiff under sub-section (1).\"\n26. In addition to the provisions of Section 12A of the Act of 2015, the provisions of Section 15 and Section 21 of the Act of 2015 have to be taken note of while deciding the crimes involved. Sections 15 and 21 of the Act of 2015 are as follows:-\n\"15. Transfer of Pending cases.-(1) All suits and applications, including applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of Specified Value pending in a High Court where a Commercial Division has been constituted, shall be transferred to the Commercial Division.\n(2) All suits and applications, including applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of specified Value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a Commercial Court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such Commercial Court:\nProvided that no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the Court prior to the constitution of the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court shall be transferred either under sub-section (1) or sub- section (2). \n(3) Where any suit or application, including an application under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of Specified Value shall stand transferred to the Commercial Division or Commercial Court under sub- section (1) or sub-section(2), the provisions of this Act shall apply to those procedures that were not complete at the time of transfer. \n(4) The Commercial Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be, may hold case management hearings in respect of such transferred suit or application in order to prescribe new timelines or issue such further directions as may be necessary for a speedy and efficacious disposal of such suit or application in accordance [with Order XV-A] of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908):\nProvided that the proviso to sub-rule (1) of rule 1 of Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908(5 of 1908) shall not apply to such transferred suit or application and the court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which the written statement shall be filed. \n(5) In the event that such suit or application is not transferred in the manner specified in sub-section (1),sub- section (2) or sub-section (3), the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court may, on the application of any of the parties to the suit, withdraw such suit or application from the court before which it is pending and transfer the same for trial or disposal to the Commercial Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be, having territorial jurisdiction over such suit, and such order of transfer shall be final and binding.\" \n\"21. Act to have overriding effect.-- Save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than this Act.\"\n27. The Act of 2015 has incorporated various amendments to the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. It has incorporated amendments both in the substantive portion of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as also in the procedural portions. On the substantive portion, provisions of Section 26 and 35 have been amended. Provisions of Section 35A(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 have been omitted. Section 35 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as amended by the Act of 2015 has allowed the Court to impose costs on a party to a proceeding which involves a commercial dispute. Sub-Section (3) of Section 35 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as amended has allowed the Court, in making an order of payment of cost, to have regard to the circumstances, inter alia, whether any reasonable offer to settle was made by a party and unreasonably refused by the other party. \n28. Section 21 of the Act of 2015 has mandated that the provisions of the Act of 2015 shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than the Act of 2015. User of the non obstantinate clause in Section 21 has bestowed overriding effect on the provisions of the Act of 2015 unless otherwise provided in the Act of 2015. User of such non obstantinate clause has permitted the inference that, the intention of the legislature is that, the provisions of the Act of 2015 will have primacy in the field of resolution of commercial disputes. \n29. In Ajit Kumar Sen & Ors. (supra), while considering the provisions of Section 45(3) of the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1923, the Calcutta High Court has expressed the view that the question whether a particular provision is imperative or directory is complex. There cannot be a hard and fast rule of general application. However, there are three fundamental tests which are often applied. \n30. The Supreme Court in Hari Vishnu Kamath (supra) has considered provisions of Article 329(b) of the Constitution. It has observed that, an enactment in form mandatory might in substance be directory. The use of the word 'shall' does not conclude the matter. However, the true intention of the legislature is the determining factor and that, whether a provision is mandatory or directory will depend upon the context. It has explained that, the distinction between a provision which is mandatory and one which is directory. It has observed that, while a provision which is mandatory must be strictly observed, in the case of a provision which is directory, it is sufficient that it is substantially complied with. \n31. The Supreme Court in Sharif-ud-Din (supra) has considered the provisions of Jammu & Kashmir Representation of People Act, 1957. It has held that, in order to find out the true character of the legislation, that is, whether the legislation is mandatory or directory in nature, the Court has to ascertain the object which the provision of law in question is to subserve and the design and the context for which it is enacted. If the object of a law is to be defeated by non-compliance with it, then, such provision is to be regarded as mandatory, but when a provision of law relates to any performance of any public duty and the invalidation of any act done in disregard of that provision causes serious prejudice to those for whose benefit it is enacted and at the same time who have no control over the performance of the duty, such provision should be treated as a directory one. It has held that, where, a provision of law prescribes that a certain act has to be done in a particular manner by a person in order to acquire a right and which is coupled with another provision which confers an immunity on another when such act is not done in that manner, the former has to be regarded as a mandatory one. A procedural rule ordinarily should not be construed as mandatory if the defect in the act done in pursuance of it can be cured by permitting appropriate rectification to be carried out at a subsequent stage unless by according such permission to rectify the error later on, another rule would be contravened. Whenever a statute prescribes that a particular act is to be done in a particular manner and also lays down that failure to comply with the said requirement leads to a specific consequence, such a requirement should be held to be mandatory. \n32. In Owners and Parties interested in M.V. \"Vali Pero\" (supra) the Supreme Court has considered the Calcutta High Court Rules. It has held that, the defect of not taking the signature of the witness on the deposition was not fatal to the reception of the deposition in the evidence. It has observed that, Rules of procedure are not by themselves an end but the means to achieve the ends of justice. Construction of the Rule of procedure which permits justice and prevents miscarriage by enabling the Court to do justice in myriad situation, all of which cannot be envisaged, acting within the limits of the permissible construction, must be preferred to that which is rigid and negatives the cause of justice. \n33. The Supreme Court in Chandrika Prasad Yadav (supra) has observed that, the question as to whether a statute is directory or mandatory would not depend upon the phraseology used. The principle as regards the nature of the statute must be determined having regard to the purpose and object to the statute seeks to achieve. \n34. The Patna High Court in Smt. Sunita Devi & Ors. (supra) has held that, the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 are not mandatory and that in exceptional cases, written statement can be accepted beyond the time limit prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The Supreme Court in R.N. Jadi & Brothers & Ors. (supra), Salem Advocate Bar Association, Tamil Nadu (supra) and Zolba (supra) has considered the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 which limits the time period for filing a written statement by a defendant in a suit. In Salem Advocate Bar Association, Tamil Nadu (supra) the Supreme Court has held that, Order VIII Rule 1 and the proviso thereto are directory in character and not mandatory. Such view has been reiterated in R.N. Jadi & Brothers & Ors. (supra) and Zolba (supra). \n35. The Supreme Court in Manbodhan Lal Srivastava (supra) has observed that the use of the word 'shall' in a statute, though generally taken in a mandatory sense, does not necessarily mean that in every case it shall have effect that is to say that, unless the words of the statute punctiliously valid, the proceeding or the outcome of the proceeding would be invalid. It has observed that, Article 320(3)(c) is not mandatory. Irregularity in consultation with public service commission does not afford a public servant with cause of action in a Court of Law. \n36. The Supreme Court in Shivjee Singh (supra) has considered Section 1 and Section 202(2) proviso of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. It has held that, despite the use of the word 'shall', in Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, it has to be treated as directory. It has held that, the proviso to Section 202(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 is also not mandatory. The Supreme Court in Smt. Lila Gupta (supra) has considered the proviso to Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and held the same not to be mandatory. \n37. The Supreme Court in Macquarie Bank Limited (supra) has considered Section 9(3)(c) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and held that, the same to be a procedural provision and directory in nature. \n38. The Supreme Court in Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti (supra) has considered the provisions of Section 34 of the Act of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and held that, the views of the High Courts of Bombay and Calcutta represent the correct view. Candor Gurgaon two Developers and Projects Pvt. Ltd. (supra) of the Calcutta High Court has been noted therein. It has held that the vested right of a party to challenge the award under Section 34 cannot be taken away of a non-compliance of issuance of prior notice before filing of the arbitration petition. \n39. The Full Bench of Kerala High Court in M. Gopalan (supra) while considering the provisions of Section 23 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 and Rule 7(3) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules, 1955 has held that Rule 7(3) of the Rules are directory in nature. \n40. In Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Limited (supra) the Supreme Court has considered the issue whether the transaction between the parties in the suit under consideration before the Supreme Court can be considered as a commercial dispute so as to enable the Commercial Court to entertain the suit. It has held, the literal and strict interpretation has to be applied while interpreting a particular statute or a provision. Adverting to the various provisions of the Act of 2015 it has held the Act of 2015 allows the Court to adopt a proactive approach in resolving a Commercial dispute. It has observed that. The intent of the legislature is to have a procedure which expedites the disposal of commercial disputes and thus create a positive environment for investment and development and make India an attractive place to do business. It has also held a purposive interpretation of the objects and reasons and the various amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 made by the Act of 2015 leaves no room for doubt that the provisions of the Act of 2015 are to be strictly construed. The object shall be fulfilled only if the provisions of the Act of 2015 are and interpreted in a narrow sense and not hampered by the usual procedural delays plaguing the traditional legal system. \n41. In Dhanbad Fuels Limited (supra), the Court has considered an order passed by the Commercial Court rejecting an application under Order VII Rule 11 (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 seeking dismissal of the suit in view of non compliance of Section 12A of the Act of 2015. In the facts of that case, the defendant in the suit filed an application under Order VII Rule 11(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 which was rejected. The defendant did not raise the issue of non compliance of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 therein. The subsequent application under Order VII Rule 11 (d) for rejection of the plaint on the ground of non compliance of section 12A of the Act of 2015 filed more than a year since institution of the suit was rejected by the Trial Court. In revision, the Court had directed reference to mediation and stay of the suit for limited period so as to allow the process of mediation to run its course. The Revisional Court had taken note of the fact that the suit was filed in August 2019, Standard Operating Procedure for Pre-institution Mediation and Settlement was prescribed on December 11, 2020 and the panel for trained mediators was availed on January 27, 2020. \n42. The Bombay High Court in 2021 SCC Online Bom 195 (Ganga Taro Vazirani v. Deepak Raheja) has held that, Section 12A of the Act of 2015 is a procedural provision and if there is a substantial complaining the plaintiff cannot be non-suited. \n43. Section 12A of the Act of 2015 has been introduced to the Act of 2015 by an amendment. It has been introduced to the Act of 2015 with retrospective effect from May 3, 2018. Sub-Section (1) of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 has required the plaintiff to exhaust the remedy of pre- institution mediation to institute a suit which may fall within the purview of the Act of 2015. Sub-Section (2) of Section 12A has required the Central Government to authorise authorities constituted under the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 for the purposes of pre-institution mediation. In exercise of powers conferred under Sub-Section (2) of Section 12A of the Act of 2015, the Central Government has by a notification dated July 3, 2018 published in the Gazette of India on July 3, 2018, authorised the State Authority and the District Authority constituted under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 for the purposes of pre-institution mediation and settlement under Chapter IIIA of the Act of 2015, that is, Section 12A of the Act of 2015. \n44. Sub-Section (3) of Section 12A has prescribed a time limit of three months for the completion of the process of mediation. The first proviso to such Sub-Section has allowed the time limit to complete the process of mediation to be extended for a further period of two months, with the consent of parties. The second proviso to Sub-Section (3) has mandated that, the period during which the parties remained occupied with the pre-institution mediation, shall not be computed for the purpose of limitation under the Limitation Act, 1963. Sub-Section (4) of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 has required the parties to reduce the settlement, if any, arrived at with regard to the commercial dispute, into writing, and such settlement to be signed by the parties and the mediator. Sub- Section (5) of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 has provided that, the settlement arrived at under the provisions of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 shall have the same status and effect as if it is an arbitral award on agreed terms under Sub-Section (4) of Section 30 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The settlement therefore can be enforced as an award. The award partakes the character of a decree by virtue of the legal fiction imbibed under the Act of 1996 in respect of an award. \n45. The scheme of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 as has been amended is that, a commercial dispute must receive a pre-institution mediation. Such pre-institution mediation has to be completed within the time frame stipulated. In the event such pre-institution mediation results in a settlement, then such settlement will partake the character of an award necessarily inviting the application of the provisions of the Act of 1996 along with all attendant rigors and benefits with regard to an award passed under the Act of 1996. Therefore, a pre-institution mediation, may result in an award which is enforceable as a decree of a Court within a maximum period of 5 months from the date of application for mediation made under Section 12A (1) of the Act of 2015. A regular suit, even under the rigours of the Act of 2015 may not attend finality within the maximum period of five months prescribed for completion of a pre- institution mediation. The provisions for pre-institution mediation are therefore a mechanism which allows expeditious disposal of a commercial dispute between the parties. \n46. Section 12A (1) of the Act of 2015 has debarred a plaintiff from instituting a suit relating to a commercial dispute, without exhausting the remedy of pre-institution mediation, unless the plaintiff seeks urgent reliefs. The word 'shall' used in Section 12A (1) of the Act of 2015 has to be considered in light of the Act of 2015 and the authorities cited at the bar. \n47. Whether a provision of any statute is mandatory or not depends upon various factors. Existence or user of the word 'shall' is not the sole determinative factor. User of such word usually denotes a mandatory nature to the provision. However there are instances where, the word 'shall' has been read to be directory. In order to arrive at a conclusion as to whether or not, the provision of the statute is mandatory, the Court has to find out the object and purpose of the Act in question. The Court has to ascertain the object, design, purport and the context in which the provision of law was enacted. If the object of the Act would be defeated by non-compliance, then such statute has to be regarded as mandatory. If a provision of law prescribes that, for a person to acquire a right a certain act has to be done in a particular manner and it is coupled with another provision which confers a right on another when such act is not done in that manner, then it has to be regarded as a mandatory provision. \n48. Procedural law can be mandatory also. Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 is one of such instance which has been held to be mandatory by the Supreme Court in 1977 Volume 1 Supreme Court Cases 379 (Seth Loonkaran Sethiya & Ors. v. Mr. Ivan E. John & Ors). The time to file written statement as prescribed by the Act of 2015 by introducing amendments to the procedural part of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 has been held to be mandatory by the Supreme Court in 2019 Volume 12 Supreme Court Cases 210 (SCG Contracts (India) Private Ltd. v. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Private Ltd. & Ors). Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 which is a procedural provision has been held to be mandatory by Supreme Court in 1977 Volume 1 Supreme Court Cases 257 (State of Maharashtra v. Chanderkant). In 2013 Volume 10 Supreme Court Cases 178 (State of Kerala v. Sudhir Kumar) the Supreme Court has held that, a suit filed without complying with Section 80(1) of the Code of Civil procedure, 1908 cannot be regularised by filing an application under Section 80(2). \n49. Section 69 of the Partnership Act 1932 and Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 prohibits institution of a suit without satisfaction of the parameters laid down therein. Both have been held to be procedural law but mandatory. Similarly, Section 12A of the Act of 2015 has a prohibition on institution of a suit in the sate parameters. The prohibition or institution of a suit under Section 12A of the Act of 2015 is of similar nature as that of the prohibition under Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 and Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908. In all three cases, the prohibition is absolute when the plaintiff fails to observe the modalities stipulated therein. Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 and Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 does not contemplate substantial compliance. On the same analogy Section 12A of the Act of 2015 should not do so also. Both Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 and Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 non-suits a plaintiff if the stipulate parameters are complied with by the plaintiff. Section 12A of the Act of 2019 stipulates the same result for the plaintiff on non-compliance. The consequence of non-adherence to Section 12A of the Act of 2015 renders the institution of the suit void in the same nature as that ofa breach of Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 and Section of 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 affects a plaint. The pain of non compliance with Section 12A of the Act of 2015 for the plaintiff is getting non-suited. Being non-suited for non-compliance of statutory provisions is a concept not unknown to law. \n50. Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises (supra) has laid down that, the provisions of the Act of 2015 has to be strictly construed. The construction and interpretation of the Act of 2015 has to be such that it fulfills the object of expeditious disposal of a commercial dispute. The provisions of the Act of 2015 have to be interpreted in a narrow sense so that the procedural delays plaguing the traditional legal system are obviated. \n51. Section 12A of the Act of 2015 although being procedural in nature has a public purpose. The public purpose is to have commercial disputes within the meaning of the Act of 2015 disposed of expeditiously through mediation at the pre-institution stage. A mandatory pre-institution mediation will not only expedite the resolution of a commercial dispute within the meaning of the Act of 2015 on an amicable platform but will also facilitate and face up the time of a congested Commercial Division or a Commercial Court to devote time and energy to the disposal of the pending suits. Section 12A of the Act of 2015 if construed as mandatory achieves twin objects of expeditious disposal and freeing up time and space for the Court. \n52. The object of the Act of 2015 is to ensure expeditious and speedy disposal of a commercial dispute. Expedition and speed in disposing of a commercial dispute is attained, in the wisdom of the legislature, by a pre-institution mediation. Section 12A(1) of the Act of 2015 distinguishes suits filed under the Act of 2015 into two categories. It treats the two categories of suits differently. Suits are categorized into two on the basis of need of the plaintiff to obtain urgent interim relief. One category is a suit where the plaintiff does not seek urgent interim relief. In such category Section 12A of the Act of 2015 debars the plaintiff from instituting a suit unless the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of pre- institution mediation. The provisions of Sub-Section (1) of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 are such that, a plaintiff is obligated to approach the appropriate authority for a pre-institution mediation, unless he seeks urgent interim relief, in respect of a commercial dispute, to approach the Court for resolution of the commercial dispute. Section 12A of the Act of 2015 prescribes an obligation on the plaintiff to undertake the pre- institution mediation and vests a corresponding right on the defendant. The defendant enjoys the right of a pre-institution mediation and in the default of the plaintiff not going for pre-institution mediation, then having a suit against the defendant by such defaulting plaintiff, being barred by law. Failure of the plaintiff to exhaust pre-institution mediation, unless, he seeks urgent relief, in a commercial dispute, gives a corresponding right to the defendants to claim that, such suit could not have been instituted by the plaintiff. Such failure of the plaintiff will result in the dismissal of the suit if allowed to be instituted. The other category of suits under Section 12A of the Act of 2015 is a suit where the plaintiff seeks urgent interim reliefs. \n53. The two categories of suits under Section 12A of the Act of 2015 are treated differently. In the category of suits where the plaintiff does not seek urgent interim relief, the plaintiff is statutorily required to exhaust pre-institution mediation, whereas a plaintiff seeking urgent interim relief is not required to do so. In a suit where the plaintiff does not seek urgent interim reliefs, limitation is extended or kept in abeyance, as one may perceive it, till the conclusion of the statutorily mandated period of mediation while in the other category no such benefit is extended. \n54. Given the nature of the language used in Section 12A of the Act of 2015, and the two categories of suits being dealt with thereunder, and taking into consideration the distinction between 'filing' of a suit and its 'institution' in my view, it requires the Court to apply its mind at the time of the suit being presented before it, as to whether the plaintiff in a suit which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief under the Act of 2015 exhausted the remedy of pre-institution mediation in accordance with the manner and procedure prescribed or not. Sub-Section (1) of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 casts a duty upon the Court to ensure that a suit is instituted by a plaintiff in accordance with procedure laid down therein. The duty is akin to a duty under Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963. A plaintiff may not undertake pre-institution mediation if the plaintiff is in a position to demonstrate that, the plaintiff requires urgent interim relief. In order to do so, the plaintiff has to approach the Court before which the suit is to be instituted and satisfy the Court that it needs to institute such suit without undertaking a pre- institution mediation in view of the urgency claimed by the plaintiff. \n55. A civil Court has jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature, excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. Various statutes have either expressly or impliedly barred the jurisdiction of a Civil Court to try a suit of civil nature under section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. For instance such bar can be had at Section 18 of Recovery of debts due to Banks and Bankruptcy Act, 1993. The right of a litigant to approach a Civil Court to have suits of Civil nature adjudicated and decided is not unconditional. Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 itself recognizes that such right is not unconditional. Such right can be abridged, regulated or taken away as the case may be. Section 12A of the Act of 2015 is a provision which regulates and affects the right of the plaintiff to approach a Court to try suits of a civil nature. Of Course, Section 12A of the Act of 2015 is in the context of a commercial dispute to be tried by a Commercial Court or a Commercial Division of a High Court, as the case may be. \n56. It cannot be contended that, a plaintiff has an unconditional right to approach the Commercial Court or a Commercial Division of a High Court to have an issue involving a 'commercial dispute' within the meaning of the Act of 2015 decided by such Court without adhering to the provision of Section 12A of the Act of 2015. The right to approach such Court is regulated by Section 12A of the Act of 2015. The regulation in place is such that it expedites resolution of the commercial dispute. \n57. Section 12 A of the Act of 2015 has entered the statute book with retrospective effect from May 3, 2018. It has been introduced to the Act of 2015 by the Amendment Act of 2018. The Amendment Act of 2018 has been published in the Gazette of India on August 21, 2018. The Act of 2015 has come into force on October 23, 2015. The Act of 2015 has been published in the Gazette of India on January 1, 2016. \n58. Between the periods October 23, 2015 when the Act of 2015 had come into retrospective effect till January 1, 2016, when the Amendment Act of 2018 was published, the public was not aware that a plaintiff was required to undertake a pre-institution mediation in respect of a commercial dispute of the Specified Value. In my view, suits involving a commercial dispute of the Specified Value instituted before the Commercial Division without pre-institution mediation till January 1, 2016 cannot be faulted on the touchstone of failure to undertake a pre- institution mediation in terms of section 12 A of the Act of 2015 simply on the ground that the public was not aware of the requirement to do so till January 1, 2016.\n59. For the period therefore from October 23, 2015 till January 1, 2016, a plaintiff was not aware of the provisions of Section 12 A of the Act of 2015 for such plaintiff to comply therewith. There is one more period to which, the plaintiff cannot be faulted for not undertaking a pre- institution mediation. It is the period from January 1, 2016 till December 11, 2020 being the date when the manner and procedure for the pre- institution mediation had been prescribed by the rules made by the central government. The same would include the availability of requisite infrastructure for pre-institution mediation as also availability of trained mediators. Once the procedure has been prescribed by the rules of the central government and the requisite infrastructure to undertake a pre- institution mediation is in place, a plaintiff cannot claim that, Section 12 A of the Act of 2015 is directory and not mandatory, when such plaintiff is not seeking any urgent interim relief. Therefore, for the period from October 23, 2015 till December 11, 2020 a plaintiff cannot be faulted for not undertaking pre-institution mediation under Section 12A of the Act of 2015 where the plaintiff is not seeking any urgent interim relief as the requisite infrastructure to do so was not in place. \n60. In view of the discussions above, the first issue is answered by holding that section 12A of the Act of 2015 is mandatory. In respect of suits filed upto December 11, 2020 the plaintiff cannot be non-suited for non-compliance as the requisite infrastructure under Section 12A was not notified. \n61. Section 12A has been introduced to the statute with retrospective effect from May 3, 2018. Therefore, a plaintiff not seeking urgent interim relief has to exhaust the remedy of pre-institution mediation in terms of the procedure as prescribed by the rules made by the Central Government. Section 15 has provided for transfer of pending cases. Section 15 has dealt with both suits as well as arbitration applications. Under Sub-section (1) of Section 15 of the Act of 2015, all suits and applications, including application under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 relating to a commercial dispute of the Specified Value pending in a High Court where a Commercial Division has been constituted, shall be transferred to the Commercial Division of such High Court. Sub-section (2) of Section 15 has provided for transfer of pending suit and application, including applications under the Act of 1996 relating to a commercial dispute to a Commercial Court that has been constituted for such purpose. The proviso to Sub-section (2) of Section 15 has stipulated that no suit or application of which the final judgement has been reserved by the Court prior to the constitution of the Commercial Division for the Commercial Court shall be transferred under Sub-section (1) or Sub-section (2). Sub-section (5) of Section 15 has provided that in the event, a suit or an application has not been transferred in terms of Sub-section (1) or Sub-section (2) or Sub-section (3), the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court may, on the application of any of the parties to the suit, withdraw such suit or application from the Court before which it is pending and transfer the same for trial or disposal to the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court as the case may be.\n62. The transfer provisions of pending suits and applications as has been incorporated in Section 15 of the Act of 2015, allows two methods of transfer of the pending suits and applications. One method of transfer is a transfer contemplated under Sub-section (1), (2) and (3) of Section 15 by which, the Court in seisin of the suit or application transfers such suit or application on a finding that, the dispute involved is a commercial dispute within the meaning of the Act of 2015 and is of Specified Value. The other mode of transfer is on an application of a party to the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court. \n63. Section 15 of the Act of 2015 has to be read along with Sections 6 and 7 of the Act of 2015. \n64. Sections 6 and 7 of the Act of 2015 are as follows:-\n\"6. Jurisdiction of Commercial Court.--The Commercial Court shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value arising out of the entire territory of the State over which it has been vested territorial jurisdiction. Explanation.--For the purposes of this section, a commercial dispute shall be considered to arise out of the entire territory of the State over which a Commercial Court has been vested jurisdiction, if the suit or application relating to such commercial dispute has been instituted as per the provisions of sections 16 to 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908). 7. Jurisdiction of Commercial Divisions of High Courts.--All suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a Specified Value filed in a High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of that High Court: Provided that all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes, stipulated by an Act to lie in a court not inferior to a District Court, and filed or pending on the original side of the High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court: \nProvided further that all suits and applications transferred to the High Court by virtue of sub-section (4) of section 22 of the Designs Act, 2000 (16 of 2000) or section 104 of the Patents Act, 1970 (39 of 1970) shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court in all the areas over which the High Court exercises ordinary original civil jurisdiction.\"\n65. Sections 6 and 7 of the Act of 2015 have vested the Commercial Court and the Commercial Division of a High Court with jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of Specified Value. Under Section 7 of the Act of 2015, all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a Specified Value filed in a High Court having Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court. The two provisos to Section 7 of the Act of 2015 are not material in the instant matters. \n66. It has been contended that, by virtue of the language used in Section 6 and 7 of the Act of 2015 suits and applications before a High Court having an Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction, are required to be filed in such jurisdiction and be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of such High Court. In other words, it has been contended that, a suit, although may involve a commercial dispute, will be filed in the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court but the same has to be heard and decided by the Commercial Division. It has been contended that, the suits so filed are interportable between the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction and the Commercial Division. A Court in the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction on finding that the suit involves a commercial dispute within the meaning of the Act of 2015 must transfer it to the Commercial Division without anything else and on the transfer the Commercial Division will proceed to hear and dispose of it as if the suit was instituted in the Commercial Division. Such contentions, however, cannot be accepted. \n67. All High Courts in India do not have Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction. Section 7 of the Act of 2015 governs such of the High Courts who have Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction. It is in such context that the word 'filed' used in Section 7 of the Act of 2015 has to be understood. In any event, a suit after 'filing' has to be 'presented' before an appropriate person for it to be duly 'instituted'. The distinction between filing and institution has been recognised in Bihari Chowdhurry and Anr. (supra).\n68. Section 15 is attracted to only such suits and applications which involve a commercial dispute as defined under the Act of 2015 and is of the Specified Value, again as notified under the Act of 2015. These twin parameters have to be satisfied for Section 15 to apply. Section 15 of the Act of 2015 is not an open ended provision for transfer of all suits and applications satisfying the twin tests, for eternity. \n69. Section 15 has a terminus by reason of the user of the word \"pending\". The terminus is the date when the Specified Value is notified. The terminus shifts with the reworking of the Specified Value. In other words, in a given case, if the authorities issue a notification stipulating that the Specified Value under the Act of 2015 would be Rs. 3 lakhs then, all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of such Specified Value pending in a High Court where there is a Commercial Division and in any Civil Court in respect of which a Commercial Court has been constituted, shall be transferred to the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court as the case may be. \n70. All High Courts in India do not have Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction. Sub-section (1) of Section 15 of the Act of 2015 relates to and governs such of the High Courts that have Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction. In the High Courts in India having Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction, the Act of 2015 culls out a Commercial Division for them. The Act of 2015 has stipulated the matters which such Commercial Division is required to deal with. The Act of 2015 has not vested any Original Jurisdiction to a High Court which does not have it prior to the Act of 2015 coming into effect. The Act of 2015 has only specified the suits and applications which are to be dealt with in the Commercial Division of a High Court which has Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction. Section 7 of the Act of 2015 has to be construed and understood in such context. \n71. Section 15 has required the transfer of pending suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of the Specified Value to the Commercial Division of a High Court. Section 12A of the Act of 2015 has stipulated a pre-institution mediation. Reading the three sections namely Sections 7, 12A and 15 together and interpreting the three sections in the strict and narrow sense as Ambalal Sarabhai (supra) has required a Court to give a narrow and strict interpretation to the provisions of the Act of 2015, then, it cannot be said that, there is interportability between the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of a High Court and the Commercial Division of such High Court. A suit which has been filed subsequent to the notification of the Specified Value in the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be transferred to the Commercial Division of the High Court by virtue of Section 15(1) of the Act of 2015. A suit filed subsequent to the notification of the Specified Value in the Ordinary Civil Jurisdiction of a High Court having a Commercial Division cannot be said to be a \"pending\" suit within the meaning of Section 15(1) of the Act of 2015. The moment a suit is not \"pending\" in terms of Section 15(1) of the Act of 2015 , the same cannot be transferred to the Commercial Division by virtue of Section 15(1) of the Act of 2015. Whether or not such a suit can be transferred under Section 15(5) of the Act of 2015 has not fallen for consideration and therefore, such issue is not answered. \n72. Section 15 cannot be considered open ended as done in Hubtown (supra) in view of the provisions of Section 12A requiring a pre- institution mediation for a suit involving a commercial dispute. Hubtown (supra) has been rendered prior to the coming into effect of Section 12A of the Act of 2015. Subsequent to the introduction of Section 12A reading Section 15 as open ended would render Section 12A otiose. If section 15 is considered open ended then, in a given situation a plaintiff can file a suit involving a commercial dispute not in the Commercial Division to have it transferred subsequently thereto and thereby not comply with Section 12 A.\n73. Despite the absence of power under Section 15(1) of the Act of 2015 to transfer a suit relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value filed in the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of the High Court, having a Commercial Division, to the Commercial Division of such High Court, after such suit being filed subsequently to the specification of the Specified Value, the Court has powers under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 to deal with the same. Power under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 stands regulated by Section 15(1) of the Act of 2015 so far as pending suits relating to a commercial dispute of the Specified Value in the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of the High Court. Once the suit has been filed beyond date of the notification of the Specified Value, Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, governs the field. \n74. In exercise of powers under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the Court has to return the plaint to be filed before the Court having jurisdiction. In the case of a suit relating to a commercial dispute of the Specified Value filed in the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of the High Court having a Commercial Division, filed beyond the date of notification of the Specified Value, the plaint of such a suit must be returned to the plaintiffs for presentation before the appropriate Court, in exercise of powers under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Once the same is done, the plaintiff in such a suit has to file the plaint of such suit in the same High Court but in the Commercial Division of such High Court. Once the same is done, the question of operation of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 will arise. \n75. There is a distinction between filing and institution of a suit. This distinction has been noticed in Bihari Chowdhurry and Anr. (supra) where the Supreme Court has considered the provisions of Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. In the context of Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 the Supreme Court has held that, a suit against the Government/Government officer, to which the requirement of a prior notice under Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is attracted cannot be validly instituted until the expiration of the period of two months next after the notice in writing has been delivered to the authorities concerned in the manner prescribed in Section 80 and if filed before the expiry of such period, the suit has to be dismissed as not maintainable.\n76. A suit transferred under the provisions of Section 15 of the Act of 2015 has to be considered as the continuation of the old suit now to be tried either in the Commercial Division or in the Commercial Court as the case may be. However, a suit involving a commercial dispute and of the Specified Value filed subsequent to the notification of the Specified Value has to be transferred to the Commercial Court or the Commercial Division as the case may be under the provisions of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Such suit when presented before the Commercial Court or the Commercial Division has to be treated as a fresh suit in view of the ratio laid down in Modern Construction and company (supra).\n77. The second to the fourth issues that have fallen for consideration can be answered in the manner following: -\n(A) Suits involving a commercial dispute filed in the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction subsequent to the date of the notification of the Specified Value are not maintainable in such jurisdiction in view of provisions of section 7 of the Act of 2015.\n(B) In the event, in a suit governed by scenario (A) above, the plaintiff applies for transfer, the same can be granted under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (C) On an order under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 being passed, the plaint has to be returned to the plaintiff to be filed before the appropriate forum. \n(D) The rigors of Section 12 A of the Act of 2015 will apply to the suit returned under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for it to be instituted before the Commercial Division on its presentation. \n78. The Act of 2015 has not provided for any transfer of a suit filed in the Commercial Division to any other Court in the event a suit is found to be incorrectly filed in the Commercial Division. Thus in my view such suit has to be dealt with under Order VII Rule 11 or Order VII of Rule 10 as the case may be. The fifth and the sixth issues that have been raised herein are answered accordingly. \n79. So far as proceedings governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 involving a 'commercial dispute' within the meaning of the Act of 2015 are concerned they would be guided by Section 15 of the Act of 2015 for filing upto the notification of the Specified Value. Filings in the Courts other than Commercial Division would mean that such filings have to be transferred under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is such Court is invited by any of the parties to the proceeding to do so or dismiss it under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. In the case of a proceeding under the Act of 1996 the rigors of Section 12 A of the Act of 2015 are not attracted. The seventh issue that has been raised is answered accordingly. \n80. In the CS No. 213 of 2018, the plaintiff has a money claim as against the defendants. According to the plaintiff, the defendants along with other owners of an immovable property had entered into a development agreement with a developer. The defendants had offered the plaintiff sale of an apartment measuring about 2,870 square feet on the 32nd floor of the proposed building including a servant quarter and two car parking spaces for the total sum of Rs. 2,47,88,700/-. The plaintiffs had from time to time advanced a sum of Rs. 1,73,52,092/- to the defendants towards part consideration and part payment for the flat. The plaintiff and the defendants had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding dated July 3, 2013 with regard to the apartment proposed to be constructed at the property. The defendants had promised to commence construction within one year from the date of the Memorandum of Understanding and complete the construction within four years from the date of sanction of the building plan by the appropriate authority. The defendants had failed to keep their commitments. Thereafter, the defendant No. 1 had informed the plaintiff that, the plaintiff will be entitled to an allotment of an apartment measuring 3,575 square feet on the 18th floor instead of an apartment measuring 2,870 square feet on the 32nd floor. The defendant No. 1 had also demanded increase in the total consideration to Rs. 3,24,05,090/-. The plaintiff had through its advocate's letter dated February 5, 2018 called upon the defendants to confirm the allotment of an apartment measuring 2,870 square feet on the 32nd floor. The defendant No. 1 had by its letter dated February 22, 2018 refuted such claim of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had by its letter dated February 23, 2018 called upon the defendants to return the consideration amount received by the defendants along with interest at the rate of 18% per annum. According to the plaintiff, it had advanced the sum of Rs. 1,73,52,092/- to the defendants which the defendants are liable to refund along with interest at the rate of 18% per annum. The defendants not having returned such sum, the plaintiff has filed the instant suit after obtaining leave under clause 12 of the Letters Patent, 1865.\n81. In the CS No. 213 of 2018, the plaintiff has applied for decree and final judgment under Chapter XIII A of the Original Side Rules. The defendant No. 1 has applied for extension of time to file written statement. The defendant No. 1 has also applied by way of the present application for rejection of the plaint. \n82. It has been admitted at the bar in CS No. 213 of 2018 that, the subject matter of the suit involves a commercial dispute arising out of an agreement relating to an immovable property that the parties have used and are using exclusively in trade or commerce, within the meaning of Section 2 (1)(c)(vii) of the Act of 2015. \n83. CS No. 213 of 2018 had been instituted in October 2018 much prior to the requisite infrastructure under section 12 A of the Act of 2015 being in place on December 11, 2020. The plaintiff in CS No. 213 of 2018 therefore cannot be non-suited on such ground. IA No. G.A 4 of 2019 in CS No. 213 of 2018 is dismissed. The other pending application will appear in the list as adjourned motion 4 weeks hence. \n84. In CS No. 116 of 2019 the plaintiffs have sought to recover money lent and advanced, from the defendant. The plaintiffs have not established themselves to fall in any of the categories under Section 2 (1)\n(c) of the Act of 2015. The disputes involved in the suit cannot be said to be a \"commercial dispute\" within the meaning of the Act of 2015. By IA No. GA 4 of 2021 the plaintiffs have applied for transfer of the suit to the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. \n85. The Act of 2015 has no provision for transfer of a suit from the Commercial Division of the High Court to its Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction. However, the Commercial Division of the High Court can invoke Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 to deal with such a prayer. \n86. In such circumstances, IA No. GA 4 of 2021 in CS No. 116 of 2019 is disposed of by directing the Department to return the plaint to the learned Advocate on Record for the plaintiff for presentation before the appropriate court. On return of the plaint, the Department will record CS No. 116 of 2019 as disposed of in the Commercial Division. The plaintiffs are at liberty to renew their prayer under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 before the appropriate Court. \n87. In IA No. G A 2 of 2020 in AP No. 25 of 2016 the petitioner has sought permission to assign five units covered in a Development Agreement dated December 28, 2007 registered through an agreement dated March 30, 2009. The disputes involved between the parties will fall under Section 2 (1) (c) (vi) of the Act of 2015. The proceedings are pending since 2016. Therefore, it would be appropriate to invoke Section 15 of the Act of 2015 and transfer IA No. G A 2 of 2020 in AP No. 25 of 2016 to the Commercial division. Learned Advocate on Record for the petitioner is granted leave to incorporate the words \"Commercial Division\" in the cause title of the petition and affidavits on record. List the application in the Commercial Division 4 weeks hence. All other points raised by the parties are kept open. \n88. By the application being IA No. G A 2 of 2020 in E C 243 of 2017 the petitioners have applied under Section 36 of the Act of 1996. It has been contended that, the prescription of Specified Value in the Act of 2015 is of no consequence in dealing with an Arbitration proceeding under the Act of 1996. With respect, in an arbitration proceeding, the Court needs to decide as to whether a \"commercial dispute\" within the meaning of the Act of 2015 is involved or not and then whether the value of the dispute is of the Specified Value or not. In the facts of E C 243 of 2017 a Shareholders Agreement is involved attracting Section 2 (1) (c)\n(xii) of the Act of 2015. IA No. G A 2 of 2020 in E C 243 of 2017 is therefore returned to the learned Advocate on Record for the petitioner for filing before the appropriate forum. On return of the petition, the Department will treat IA No. GA 2 of 2020as disposed of. The petitioner also has the liberty not to press I A No. G A 2 of 2020 and file an application under Section 36 of the Act of 2015 on the self same cause of action in the Commercial Division. \n89. By way of IA No. GA 2 of 2021 in CS No. 136 of 2020, the defendant No. one has applied for rejection of the plaint. The defendant No. 1 has contended that, the dispute in the suit is a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section 2 (1) (c) (vii) of the Act of 2015. The plaintiff has filed CS No. 136 of 2024 seeking eviction of the defendant No. 1. The defendant No. 1 has contended that the agreement between the parties was a lease agreement relating to an immovable property in respect of which the defendant No. 1 was inducted as a tenant for commercial purpose. Since the defendant No. 1 has admitted the suit property to be in use for commercial purpose it would be appropriate to hold that the suit involves a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section 2 (1) (c)\n(vii) of the Act of 2015. The plaint of CS No. 136 of 2020 is therefore returned to the learned Advocate on Record of the plaintiff for presentation in the Commercial Division. On return of the plaint, the Department will treat CS No. 136 of 2020 as disposed of. The plaintiff will be at liberty to avail of the benefits of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963. \n90. CS No. 136 of 2020 having been instituted in November 2020, that is, prior to December 11, 2020 the question of non-suiting the plaintiff for non-compliance of Section 12A of the Act of 2015 on transfer of the suit to the Commercial Division does not arise. \n91. The petitioners in A P No. 223 of 2020 have applied under Section 14 of the Act of 1996 for termination of the mandate of the Arbitrator in respect of a loan agreement. The respondent is a financer. The disputes come within Section 2 (1) (c) (i) of the Act of 2015. A P No. 223 of 2020 be returned to the learned Advocate on Record for the petitioner for filing before the appropriate forum. On return of the petition, the Department will treat A P No. 223 of 2020 as disposed of. The petitioner also has the liberty to not press A. P. No. 223 of 2020 and file a fresh on the self same cause of action before the Commercial Division. IA No. GA 1 of 2020 in A P No.223 of 2020 is disposed of accordingly. \n[DEBANGSU BASAK,J.]",

16.3.2023 passed by the learned commercial court (\"appellate court\" for short) allowing the commercial appeal no.1 of 2023 filed by the dbs bank limited respondent no.3, whereby the learned appellate court by vacating injunction has quashed and set aside order below exh.5 dated 7.5.2022 passed by the learned commercial court in commercial civil suit no.10 of 2021. 2.1 the petitioners are the original plaintiffs, whereas the respondents are the original defendants in the commercial civil suit no.10 of 2021. for the sake of bravity and convenience, they are referred to as their status before the learned commercial court. facts: 3. tersely stated facts leading to filing of this petition are that the plaintiffs have filed commercial civil suit no.1 of 2020 before the learned commercial court against the defendants for declaration, permanent injunction and other reliefs. the case of the plaintiffs was that m/s hussain sheth ispat is the partnership firm registered under the partnership act and the plaintiffs nos.2 and 3 are its partners. it is further the case of c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 the plaintiffs that they are engaged in the business of ship breaking, trading and manufacturing of iron and steel products having its principal place of business is at alang, dist: bhavnagar. further, as per the case of the plaintiffs, the defendant no.1 capital corp asia private limited, who claimed to be the owner of the ship namely mv seniha-s (\"vessel\" for short). the plaintiffs entered into memorandum of agreement (\"moa\" for short) with the defendant no.1 on 21.4.2021 for purchase of the said vessel for the consideration of us $ 31,58,540/-. as per the terms and conditions of the moa dated 21.4.2021, the sale was required to be placed and the mode of payment was provided in clause 2 of the said moa. the payment was to be made through letter of credit to be opened from the punjab national bank. 4. it is further the case of the plaintiffs that the moa executed between the plaintiffs and the defendant no.1 underwent many changes from time to time. the first amongst was made on 23.4.2021 and in view of said amendment, opening of the letter of credit has been changed from the punjab national bank to canara bank defendant no.2. it was further agreed that out of total consideration, us $ 24,58,540/shall be paid by the letter of credit and us $ 7 lakh by way of telegraphic transfer. subsequent thereto, the letter of credit was opened on 26.4.2021 by the defendant no.2 in favour of the defendant no.3. as such, the defendant no.3 acted as a banker of the defendant no.1 which was required to negotiate the letter of credit. one of the conditions of the letter of credit regarding c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 the payment was that it was to be made after 150 days from the date of physical delivery of the vessel. 5. the moa again underwent change and as per the first amendment made on 4.5.2021, certain conditions of the letter of credit were changed which were duly reflected in the delivery report issued by the defendant no.2. the change was provided in this delivery report that except for the change made in the delivery report, all other terms and conditions to remain the same. the moa again underwent change on 13.5.2021 . as per the change in the moa, the entire consideration of us $ 31,58,540/was to be paid by the letter of credit. no payment was to be made through telegraphic transfer as it was provided earlier. because of the change in the moa, the value of the letter of credit was increased to us $ 31,58,540/-. the said change was reflected in the delivery report issued by the defendant no.2. 6. the moa initially was provided that the said vessel shall be delivered and taken over at alang on 21.5.2021, but since the defendant no.1 was not in a position to deliver the said vessel on the said date, the moa changed on 21.5.2021 and as per the change, the date of delivery of the vessel was deferred to 15.6.2021 and the cancellation date was fixed on 26.6.2021. again, letter of credit was amended on 24.5.2021 and again, further changes were made in the terms of the said letter of credit, which were reflected in the delivery report issued by the defendant no.2, which provides that all other terms and c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 conditions remained the same. subsequent thereto, the defendant no.2 forwarded an email to mr. ashit parikh broker of the defendant no.1 as well as to the plaintiffs on 28.5.2021 stating that the defendant no.3 has sent the documents for the presentation to negotiate the letter of credit. thereafter, mr. ashit parikh approached the defendant no.2 and it was conveyed that the said vessel was about to sail and reach at alang on or before 22.6.2021 as promised by the defendant no.1 and further, it was conveyed that the defendant no.1 is required a letter from the plaintiffs to unable them to secure the early release of the said vessel and thus, the plaintiffs are required to pay as per the terms and conditions of the letter of credit and according to these instructions, the plaintiffs wrote a letter to the defendant no.2 on 1.6.2021 (however, it is the case of the plaintiffs that draft of the letter was dictated by mr. ashit parikh broker in his own language). 7. according to the plaintiffs, they will declare their intention that they are accepting the documents when the ship will arrive at alang and when the notice of readiness be presented. further, the case of the plaintiffs is that however, the defendant no.2 acted with gross negligence and issued swift message contained in the said delivery report dated 3.6.2021 in favour of the defendant no.3 to negotiate the letter of credit. 8. appropos, the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant no.1 has not delivered the said vessel on or before 25.6.2021, as promised, hence, 3rd and 4th amendment to the moa comes on c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 22.6.2021 and the accepted delivery time was shifted to 15.8.2021. on 18.8.2021, another amendment was underwent in the moa. by way of 5 th amendment, the expected delivery time is deferred to 30.9.2021 with the date of cancellation fixed on 6.10.2021. thereafter, the plaintiffs had an extensive communications with the defendant no.1 and with their agents through email, whats app messages etc. the defendant no.1 was giving false excuses for non-delivery of the said vessel, but subsequently, the plaintiffs came to know that the said vessel was arrested by the indonesian court and in spite of that, the defendant no.1 was constantly giving false promises. therefore, the plaintiffs wrote a letter dated 5.9.2021 to the defendant no.1 regarding cancellation of the letter of credit bearing no.00302fouu2111601 for us $ 31,58,540/and to refund the said amount. 9. according to the plaintiffs, lastly, the plaintiffs and the defendant no.1 entered into 6th and final amendment of the moa on 17.9.2021 and both of them agreed to cancel the moa dated 21.4.2021 and shown date of cancellation as 6.10.2021, which was mutually agreed between the plaintiffs and the defendant no.1 that neither of them will have any claim against each other and the defendant no.1 would be free to sell the said vessel to any other party. pursuant to the final amendment in the moa by and between the plaintiffs and the defendant no.1, a delivery report was sent by the defendant no.2 on 18.9.2021 to the defendant no.3 that moa between the plaintiffs and the defendant no.1 has been cancelled and requested the defendant c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 no.3 to confirm that said letter of credit stands cancelled. 10. it is alleged in the suit that in spite of the above communication, the defendant no.3 has not confirmed the cancellation of the letter of credit and did not agree to cancel the said letter of credit and disclosed that the defendant no.3 has discounted the letter of credit on the basis of the swift message and delivery report dated 3.6.2021 sent by the defendant no.2. 11. upon such averments and contentions, the plaintiffs contained that the defendants have clearly played fraud upon the plaintiffs and discounted the letter of credit even in absence of delivery of the vessel and therefore, the plaintiffs filed commercial civil suit no.10 of 2021 seeking the relief stated herein above. 12. pending hearing of the suit, the plaintiffs have filed an application under order 39 rule 1 and 2 read with section 151 of the civil procedure code, 1908 at exh.5 seeking following reliefs:\"(a) during the pendency and final disposal of the suit, the hon'ble court be pleased to grant a temporary injunction restraining defendant no.2 from making any payment under the letter of credit no. no.00302fouu2111601. (b) pending hearing of this applciation, the hon'ble court be pleased to grant ex-parte ad-interim injunction in terms of para (a) above.\" c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 13. initially, the learned commercial court has issued ex parte injunction and after that, on completion of pleadings and having heard learned advocates for both the sides, the learned commercial court allowed the injunction application and confirmed the ad interim relief and made it absolute till final disposal of the suit by order dated 7.5.2022. 14. being aggrieved by the order passed below exh.5, the defendant no.3 preferred ao no.124 of 2022 under order 43 rule 1(r) of the civil procedure code, 1908 before this court. the division bench of this court vide order dated 10.1.2023 transferred the appeal to the concerned learned appellate court and as such, commercial appeal no.1 of 2023 came to be registered before the learned appellate court at bhavnagar. 15. having heard learned advocates for both the sides, the learned appellate court allowed the appeal and set aside the order passed below exh.5 by the learned commercial court and vacated the interim relief granted in commercial civil suit no.10 of 2021. 16. being aggrieved, the plaintiffs have preferred present petition claiming following relief:\"(a) this hon'ble court be pleased to issue a writ of or in the nature of a certiorari or any other appropriate writ, order or direction quashing and setting aside the impugned order dated 16.3.2023 passed by the commercial appellate court at bhavnagar in appeal from order no.1 of 2023 at annexure e hereto. c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 (b) pending the admission hearing and final disposal of the present petition, this hon'ble court be pleased to stay and suspend the operation and implementation of the impugned order dated 16.3.2023 passed by the commercial appellate court at bhavnagar in appeal from order no.1 of 2023 at annexure e hereto.\" 17. this court vide order dated 5.4.2021 issued notice. vide order dated 13.4.2023, this court has extended the stay order passed below exh.16 in commercial appeal no.1 of 2023 by the learned appellate court till next date of hearing, which has been continued thereafter during the hearing of this petition. 18. learned senior counsel mr. mihir joshi appears with learned advocate ms. amrita thakore for the petitioners original plaintiffs. the respondent no.1 is served, but he has chosen not to remain present. learned advocate mr. vishwas k. shah appears for the respondent no.2 original defendant no.2 canara bank and learned senior counsel mr. rs sanjanwala appears with mr. siddharth sinha for j. sagar associates for respondent no.3 original defendant no.3 dbs bank. submissions on behalf of the petitioners/plaintiffs 19. learned senior counsel mr. joshi would submit that the order passed by the learned appellate court is perverse, erroneous and passed without application of mind and as such, suffers from illegality, material irregularity and in excess of jurisdiction. he would further submit that the learned appellate court was hearing the ao filed under order 43 rule 1(r) of the civil procedure code, 1908. the scope and ambit of the ao is well defined and settled. the learned appellate court cannot c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 reassess the evidence on record and come to the conclusion other than conclusion arrived at by the learned commercial court at the first instance under the discretionary jurisdiction. he would further submit that by catena of decisions, it is settled that even if two view are possible, the view taken by the learned court at the first instance under the discretionary jurisdiction has to be adhered to until it is proved that such view is perverse and against settled principles of law. he would further submit that the learned appellate court has ignored these principles by allowing the ao substituting its view upon the possible view arrived by the learned trial court under discretionary jurisdiction and as such, has committed serious, but patent error. to support his submission, learned senior counsel mr. joshi has relied upon decision of the hon'ble apex court in case of mohd. mehtab khan vs. khushnuma ibrahim khan reported in 2013(9) scc 221. 20. learned senior counsel mr. joshi would further submit that the terms of the letter of credit are required to be strictly complied with by the banks in its invocation /encashment, the terms of moa has to be scrupulously adhered by the issuing bank and negotiating bank i.e. defendant nos.2 and 3 while negotiating the letter of credit. he would further submit that since the letter of credit is governed by the terms and conditions of the moa, the negotiation of the letter of credit is subject to fulfillment of the conditions stated in the moa. he would further submit that the bank inter se cannot agree to ignore or modify or waive its terms. he would further submit c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 that though the letter of credit has witnessed various amendments and changes, field 42c stipulates that payment was to be made 150 days from the date of physical delivery of the vessel. he would further submit that field 48 stipulates that presentation was to be made 21 days from the date of shipment. point 9 of field 47a (additional conditions) stipulates that document to be presented after receipt of an authenticated swift message as under: \"a tested telex or swift advice from the opening bank confirming that buyers have received the notice of readiness from the seller or seller's agent at alang that the vessel is ready to be delivered physically to buyers.\" 21. learned senior counsel mr. joshi would further submit that point 8 of field 47a stipulates that notice of readiness would be issued only after the vessel has been arrived at a safe anchorage at alang, india and is ready for effecting physical delivery. he would further submit that field 78 of the letter of credit made it clear that payment under the letter of credit was subject to compliance with the credit terms that \"upon receipt of documents at our counter on due presentation on or before 5.6.2021 drawn in compliance with the credit terms we shall remit the fund on due date as per negotiating bank's instructions\" 22. learned senior counsel mr. joshi would therefore, submits that both the banks i.e. defendant nos.2 and 3 i.e. issuing bank and the negotiating bank were independently duty bound to determine whether the conditions stated in the letter c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 of credit are fulfilled and only upon fulfillment of the conditions, the letter of credit can be negotiated. however, in the present case, the defendant no.1, who is a proposed seller of the vessel, had never given delivery of the vessel to the plaintiffs and as such, committed fraud on the plaintiffs. the dbs bank i.e. negotiating bank without following conditions of the letter of credit, presented the documents, which were not in compliance of the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. the defendant no.2 played fraud in collusion and passed swift message even in absence of clear acceptance of the documents by the plaintiffs and permitted the defendant no.3 to negotiate the letter of credit. in that event, on negotiation of the letter of credit, the sale consideration has been received by the defendant no.1 without physical delivery of the vessel and thereby, the plaintiffs became the victim of fraud played by the defendants. 23. learned senior counsel mr. joshi would further submit that the letter of credit is a separate contract between two bankers and is governed by the ucp 600. however, such practice developed by the international chamber of commerce by incorporating ucp, does not absolute. but the issuing bank and the negotiating bank are under the duty to comply with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. he would further submit that though the ucp is a practice developed by the international chamber of commerce and operating to the field, in absence of inequitable or unconditional letter of credit, the terms and conditions of the letter of credit would always govern the negotiation of the letter of credit. he would further submit c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 that the banks under the guise of operating ucp 600 cannot modify, or waive the terms of the moa, which governs the letter of credit. for such submission, learned senior counsel mr. joshi has relied upon judgment in case of united commercial bank vs. bank of india reported in 1981(2) scc 766 as well as hindustan construction co. vs. state of bihar reported in 1999(8) scc 436. relying upon these judgments, he would submit that the learned appellate court has totally ignored the this aspect and terms and conditions of the moa, which were governing the letter of credit. 24. learned senior counsel mr. joshi would further submit that the learned appellate court has misconstrued the word \"presentation\" regarding documents in background of the ucp 600. he would further submit that the presentation does not mean that the only presentation of documents themselves but also the delivery of vessel thereof. he would further submit that presentation must be complying presentation and it should be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. but, in the present case, the learned appellate court has erroneously believed that the negotiating bank has presented the documents to the issuing bank and it was accepted by the plaintiffs and therefore, under the waiver clause of the ucp, the negotiating bank was not required to see that all the conditions of the letter of credit are fulfilled. he would further submit that such an approach on the part of the learned appellate court is erroneous and completely against the settled principles of law. he would further submit that the plaintiffs have never accorded c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 the presentation of the document by waiving certain terms and conditions of the letter of credit, but the learned appellate court has totally missed to read this aspect, which had been rightly believed by the learned commercial court at the first instance. 25. learned senior counsel mr. joshi would further submit that the learned commercial court at the first instance has rightly believed that the defendant no.3 was duty bound to determine whether the terms of the letter of credit were complied with when the defendant no.1 presented the document and that both the banks i.e. negotiating bank and the issuing bank has not taken required care before negotiating the letter of credit. the learned appellate court has committed patent jurisdictional error by taking different view against the possible view of the court at the first instance. he would further submit that finding of the learned appellate court to the effect that the plaintiffs have not raised any dispute as to the presentation of the documents and waived the terms and conditions is clearly and factually incorrect finding. he would further submit that in any circumstances, adherence of the terms and conditions of the letter of credit are separate matter along with acceptance of the documents and compliance and thus, the communication of the plaintiffs cannot amend or waive the other conditions of the letter of credit. he would submit that in fact, no communication to the effect of waiver of the condition of the letter of credit has ever been made and yet, the defendant nos.2 and 3, hand in glow with the defendant no.1, negotiated the c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 letter of credit, which is totally against the terms and conditions. moreover, since no vessel was ever delivered to the plaintiffs by the defendant no.1, no occasion arises for the defendants to negotiate and discount the letter of credit, but ignoring all these aspects, the defendant no.3 has discounted the letter of credit. the learned commercial court at first instance has rightly observed and held that such act of the defendant no.3 is illegal. however, the learned appellate court has set aside such factual finding, which clearly indicates that the learned appellate court has transgressed its jurisdiction and thereby, has committed error. 26. learned senior counsel mr. joshi would further submit that fact of the case apparently disclosed or demonstrated that the plaintiffs became the victim of the fraud played by the defendant no.1, who without delivering the vessel to the plaintiffs, presented documents for discounting the letter of credit and such presentation has been considered by the defendant no.3 without considering that whether such presentation of the document is complied with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit and as such, the plaintiffs became the victim of the fraud and is one of the important ground seeking special equity in favour of the plaintiffs, which was rightly considered by the learned commercial court. he would further submit that since the plaintiffs did not get the vessel and yet the defendant no.3 was permitted to negotiate the letter of credit, it was put massive financial burden upon the plaintiffs. he would further submit that in this position, the c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 plaintiffs, who have not received the vessel, would have to pay the sale consideration and that will cause irretrievable prejudice to the plaintiffs and therefore, action on the part of the defendant no.2 and 3 would be extremely unjust and inequitable. he would further submit that the defendant no.1 has its address in singapore, so there is unlikely chance that even if any decree is passed against the defendant no.1 for recovering the amount which he has already pocketed on encashing the letter of credit, therefore, equity runs in favour of the plaintiffs. learned commercial court has discussed all these factual aspects in its order. however, the learned appellate court has ignored these aspects and as such, committed patent error, which requires to be corrected by allowing this petition. 27. learned senior counsel mr. joshi would further submit that since the terms and conditions were part of the letter of credit, it cannot be waived inter se by the banks i.e. defendant nos.2 and 3. he would further submit that plea of waiver is a question of fact and can be established by proper pleadings of proof. the defendant nos.2 and 3, who have argued regarding the plea of waiver, are not permitted to take such waiver until it is properly pleaded. for such submission, learned senior counsel mr. joshi has relied upon judgment of the hon'ble apex court in case of vm salgaocar vs. board of trustees of port of mormugao reported in 2005(4) scc 613. 28. upon such submission, learned senior counsel mr. joshi would submit that the learned appellate court has committed c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 grave and serious error in upsetting the order passed below exh.5 by the learned commercial court at the first instance under the discretionary jurisdiction and as such, he would submit to allow this petition, and urged to restore order passed below exh.5 by upturning the judgment and order delivered by the learned appellate court. submissions on behalf of respondent no.2/defendant no.2 29. on the other hand, learned advocate mr. vishwas k. shah appearing on behalf of the defendant no.2 canara bank in his crisp argument opposed the submission canvassed by the learned senior counsel mr. mihir joshi. he would submit that the letter of credit is a contract between two banks, namely issuing bank and the negotiating bank. this letter of credit has nothing to do with the contract/ moa executed between the buyer and the seller and therefore, the terms and conditions of the moa/contract between the buyer and seller would not ipse dixit applicable to the letter of credit. he would further submit that the letter of credit has been opened by the plaintiffs with the defendant no.2 on 26.4.2021 and it came to be amended from time to time. on 24.5.2021, the third amendment was made in the letter of credit and in that third change, the letter of credit dated 24.5.2021 does not spell out that notice for readiness or physical delivery of the vessel would be condition precedent before issuing confirmation of the defendant no.3 for discounting the letter of credit. 30. learned advocate mr. vishwas k. shah would further c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 submit that in view of ucp 600, the negotiating bank had to present the document and if that document is approved by the plaintiffs, it would be incumbent upon the defendant no.2 to issue swift message. he would further submit that on 1.6.2021, the plaintiffs have given two letters to the defendant no.2 giving green signal to communicate swift message and consequent thereto, the swift message was passed by the defendant nos.2 to defendant no.3 and which has resulted in discounting of the letter of credit. 31. learned advocate mr. vishwas k. shah would further submit that the plaintiffs are guilty of the suppression of material facts. the plaintiffs, who wrote two letters dated 1.6.2021, have produced only one of them and did not produce another one, which has given green signal to the defendant no.2 for passing swift message. said letter was first time produced by the defendant no.2 before the learned commercial court along with its written statement. thus, the crucial document has been withheld and produced by the plaintiffs while seeking equitable relief. hence, the plaintiffs were not entitled for any discretionary and equitable relief from the court. he would further submit that the payment due dated 19.11.2021 is reflected in the swift message dated 3.6.2021 from the defendant no.2 to the defendant no.3 on the admission of the plaintiffs that the vessel shall arrive on 22.6.2021, which was reflected in the letter dated 1.6.2021 issued by the original plaintiffs to the defendant no.2. therefore, the condition of paying the amount 150 days after the vessel is arrived, which c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 was between the defendant nos.2 and 3 i.e. issuing bank and the negotiating bank and upon completion of 150 days, the defendant no.3 who is negotiating bank, which has confirmed negotiating the letter of credit, is entitled to encash the amount from the defendant no.2. he would further submit that in view of article 5 of ucp 600, the issuing bank and the negotiating bank i.e. defendant nos.2 and 3 has to deal with the document and not with the goods. thus, before issuing confirmation to the defendant no.3, on 3.6.2021, the defendant no.2 had obtained two letters in view of article 5 of the ucp 600 from the original plaintiffs, which entitled the defendant no.2 to pass swift message containing that the plaintiffs have honoured the presentation of the document. 32. learned advocate mr. vishwas k. shah would further submit that the grant or refusal of injunction as far as matter under the bank guarantee or letter of credit is concerned, the law is well settled that the court must be circumspect and while granting injunction in the case of invocation of the bank guarantee or letter of credit, until the fraud is specifically pleaded and proved with cogent evidence in the case of lc.a. fortiori. he would submit that the learned appellate court has not committed any error by reversing the order of the learned commercial court at the first instance, which has not considered the settled law on granting injunction on the issue of invocation of the bank guarantee/letter of credit. in that facts and circumstances, he would submit that the present petition is bereft of merit and thus, it is required to be dismissed. in c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 support of his submission, he has relied upon recent judgment of the hon'ble apex court in case of bawa paulins vs. ups freight services reported in 2022 scc online sc 1551. submissions on behalf of respondent no.3/defendant no.3 33. learned senior counsel mr. rs sanjanwala assisted by learned advocate mr.siddharth sinha for j. sagar associates for the defendant no.3 dbs bank limited would submit that the plaintiffs have not asked any injunctive relief against the defendant no.3. taking this court through the relief prayed in injunction application as well as in the plaint, he would submit that the plaintiffs have asked relief only against the defendant no.2 and not against the defendant no.3. he would further submit that in spite of said fact, the learned commercial court had erroneously granted injunction against the defendant no.3, which has rightly been corrected by the learned appellate court. he would further submit that the letter of credit was accepted by the defendant no.2 on 3.6.2021, whereby the defendant no.2 has categorically promised to pay the amount under the letter of credit on 19.11.2021. based on such assurance and promise, the defendant no.3 has acted to its prejudice by discounting the letter of credit and released the discounted amount in favour of the defendant no.1 i.e. the beneficiary. he would further submit that since negotiating or discounting of the amount has already taken place in favour of the defendant no.1, grant of injunction was not permissible. however, the learned commercial court has committed patent illegality in granting injunction against settled provisions of law, which has rightly been corrected by the c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 learned appellate court. 34. in support of his submission, learned senior counsel mr. sanjanwala has referred and relied upon the judgment of the hon'ble apex court in case of federal bank limited vs. v.m. jog engineering and others reported in 2001(1) scc 663; in case of millenium wires (p) ltd. vs. state trading corporation of india ltd. reported in 2015(14) scc 375 and in case of bawa pollins (supra). 35. it was further argued that the defendant no.2 opened the letter of credit in favour of the defendant no.3 on 26.4.2021. the letter of credit thereafter, underwent three amendments, first on 4.5.2020, second on 18.5.2021 and third on 24.5.2021. he would further submit that as finally agreed upon, certain documents were presented as per field 46a only. apart from those documents, no other documents inviting notice of readiness was required to be presented in view of field 46a comes in by way of 3rd amendment in letter of credit. he would further submit that the documents as required under field 46a were duly presented to the defendant no.2 by scrutiny undercover of letter dated 20.5.2021. he would further argue that in the said letter, it was clearly stated that \"we have enclosed the documents for your acceptance and payment at maturity. upon your acceptance, we will negotiate the presented documents under the dc. advise due date and acceptance by autenticated swift/tested telex we have endorsed the documents amount on the reverse of the dc.\" c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 36. learned senior counsel mr. sanjanwala would further submit that these documents presented to the defendant no.2 was not only scrutinized by the defendant no.2, but was also verified and authenticated by the plaintiffs and pursuant to such, letter of acceptance was issued on 1.6.2021 in favour of the defendant no.2 inter alia accepting the documents and permitting discounting of letter of credit. he would further submit that in view of acceptance by the plaintiffs itself, the letter of credit was negotiated. the defendant no.3 was not required to obtain separate concurrence of the plaintiffs for permission to discount the letter of credit. it is only the defendant no.2 who was required to do so and it has obtained permission and get the documents verified from the plaintiffs, which is clearly reflected from the letter of 1.6.2021. this has rightly been appreciated by the learned appellate court to deny the injunction application. he would further submit that in fact, this letter was crucial and pivotal and yet the plaintiffs, in order to obtain equitable relief, has suppressed this letter, but it was filed by the defendant no.2 along with its written statement. thus, it clearly indicates that the plaintiffs were indulged in submitting false statement since the beginning. 37. it is further submitted that since the plaintiffs have wrote a letter dated 1.6.2021 to the defendant no.2 informing the defendant no.2 that they have accepted the documents presented by the defendant no.1 through the defendant no.3 and therefore, there is no reason not to discount the letter of credit by the defendant no.3. the plaintiffs were failed to bring to notice that under which pretext or facts or reasons, the c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 defendant no.3 has committed fraud upon the plaintiffs or with the defendant no.2. it was further submitted that considering letter dated 1.6.2021 written by the plaintiffs to the defendant no.2, they cannot plead ignorance that the defendant no.3 has discounted the letter of credit without the permission of the plaintiffs since the clear acceptance has been indicated by the plaintiffs in letter dated 1.6.2021. 38. learned senior counsel mr. sanjanwala would further submit that the letter of credit is a separate contract between the two bankers i.e. issuing bank and negotiating bank and it is confined by the condition if any operates between the two bankers i.e. issuing bank and negotiating bank, the letter of credit cannot be governed by the separate moa between the seller and the buyer of the product. he would further submit that whether product is reached to the plaintiffs or not is not a material for the negotiating bank. he would further submit that once the documents, which were presented by the seller, which in the present case is the defendant no.1 has been admitted by the defendant no.2, which is issuing bank in the present case and further verified by the plaintiffs, which are purchasers in the present case, the task of the defendant no.3 is complete and the defendant no.3 was under contractual obligation to discount the letter of credit, which in the present case, the defendant no.3 has done so. the plaintiffs cannot set the case against its letter dated 1.6.2021 and bring something different which was never part of the condition in the letter of credit. 39. upon such arguments, learned senior counsel mr. c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 sanjanwala has submitted that the learned appellate court has rightly appreciated all these aspects and found that the learned commercial court has acted in ignorance of the settled principles of law. such finding of the learned appellate court is having full of reason and backed by the provisions of law and therefore, does not call for interference in the limited jurisdiction under article 227 of the constitution of india. 40. learned senior counsel mr. sanjanwala would further submit that considering the entire plaint as well as injunction application, at no place, the plaintiffs have levelled allegation of fraud against the defendant no.3 bank. considering the pleadings of the plaint, the allegation of fraud is levelled against the defendant no.1 as well as defendant no.2, but not against the defendant no.3 and in that circumstances, one of the main elements being allegation of fraud is missing in the pleadings and since the allegation of fraud is not a part of the pleadings, no such fraud can be alleged against the defendant no.3. he would further submit that the learned appellate court has rightly appreciated this aspect. 41. learned senior counsel mr. sanjanwala would further submit that ucp 600 is the governing principle and process to be followed in case of presentation of the documents and letter of credit etc. the learned appellate court has rightly interpreted the articles of ucp 600 and rightly interpreted these provisions to upturn impugned injunction order. he would further submit that in view of article 16 of the ucp 600, once the document even if it is discrepant is accepted by the issuing bank and c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 further verified by the plaintiffs, which is purchaser of the vessel under ucp 600, the defendant no.3 was at compulsion to negotiate/discount the letter of credit, whether the product for which the letter of credit has been reached to the purchaser or not is immaterial for discounting the letter of credit. in support of such argument, learned senior counsel mr. sanjanwala has relied upon judgment of hon'ble calcutta high court in case of navyug enterprises (p) ltd, vs. bangladesh krishi bank reported in (2016) scc online cal 12227 as well as division bench judgment which has upheld the learned single judge judgment in case of bangladesh krishi bank vs. navyug enterprises (p) ltd reported in manu/wb/1021/2019. 42. learned senior counsel mr. sanjanwala would further submit that ordinarily the learned appellate court should not disturb the finding of the court at the first instance arrived upon the discretion, however, when the learned commercial court has acted in ignorance of the settled principles of law and arbitrarily, the learned appellate court is duty bound to interfere with such order to prevent the miscarriage of justice, which in the present case, the learned first appellate court has done and rightly, which is not required to be interfered with in the limited jurisdiction under article 227 of the constitution of india. 43. learned senior counsel mr. sanjanwala would further submit that the plaintiffs have failed to bring out any extraordinary case. the defendant no.3 has acted bona fide and in due compliance with the provisions of law as well as under ucp 600 and therefore no exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 under article 227 of the constitution of india to interfere with the impugned order is required. in support of such submission, he has relied upon judgment of the hon'ble supreme court in case of waryam singh and another vs. amarnath and another reported in air 1954 sc 215, puri investments vs. young friends and co. and others reported in 2022(4) scale 654 as well as in case of shalini shyam shetty and another vs. rajendra shankar patil reported in (2010) 8 scc 329. 44. mainly upon above submissions, learned senior advocate mr. sanjanwala prays to dismiss this petition with cost. submissions on behalf of the petitioners/plaintiffs in rejoinder 45. in reply, insofar as the argument that the plaintiffs have not asked for the relief against the defendant no.3, it is sought to be submitted by the learned senior counsel mr. mihir joshi that the court has always jurisdiction to mould relief appropriate to the pleadings. he would further submit that the court cannot be hyper-technical so as to deny the relief, which is otherwise equitable in favour of the plaintiffs. learned senior counsel mr. joshi having referred to order vii, rule 7 of the code of civil procedure and the judgment of the hon'ble supreme court in case of sopanrao v. syed mehmood reported in (2019) 7 scc 76 as well as in case of manohar ramkrishna shirodkar v. trimbak rama kelkar reported in ilr 1992 kar 213 to submit that if the equitable jurisdiction is just and proper to grant relief which is not sought in a plaint, in view of order 7 rule 7, it can be granted. therefore, it was submitted by learned senior counsel c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 mr. joshi that the submission that no relief is asked against the defendant no.3 would not prevent the court from granting equitable relief if it is just and proper. 46. further, learned senior counsel mr. joshi would submit that there is no suppression of material facts on the part of the plaintiffs. the plaintiffs have pleaded about the letter dated 01.06.2021, since it was a format letter and having no much importance, it was not produced along with the plaint. but, the plaintiffs have made pleading of this document and therefore, allegation that the plaintiffs have suppressed material fact has no ground to stand. he would further submit that the judgment of federal bank (supra) is not applicable to the facts of the present case. insofar as federal bank (supra) judgment is concerned, it is submitted that it is based upon ucp of 1983 which revised with tasking the bank to determine whether a presentation is applied with terms and conditions of letter of credit or not and therefore this judgment would not be applicable to the facts of the present case. it is further submitted that in case of federal bank (supra), the confirming bank had no knowledge of any fraud when it discounted the letter of credit and there was no issue of non-compliance with the terms and conditions of letter of credit. whereas in the present case there was a requirement of compliance of terms and conditions of letter of credit, mainly the notice of readiness and payment is to be made 150 days after the vessel is arrived. 47. learned senior counsel mr. joshi would submit that the judgment of bawa paulins (supra) is also on different facts and c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 therefore it is not applicable. lastly, it is argued that the learned commercial court has rightly appreciated the facts of the case to the effect that the fraud was committed upon the plaintiffs and the special equity and irretrievable prejudice was caused to the plaintiffs as the plaintiffs did not receive product i.e. vessel and yet the plaintiffs were required to pay the amount of the said vessel. so, it was a clear case of fraud and which was rightly appreciated by the learned court at the first instance under the discretionary jurisdiction. the learned appellate court ignoring the scope and ambit of the ao, unsettled the impugned order by substituting its own view upon the discretionary view exercised by the learned commercial court and therefore, the order is bad, capricious and against the settled principles of law and thus, learned senior counsel mr. mihir joshi prays to interfere with the impugned order passed by the learned appellate court by allowing this petition and to restore injunction order passed by the learned commercial court. 48. no other and further arguments have been canvassed by the learned advocates appearing for the either party. 49. heard learned advocates for the respective parties in extenso. analysis & conclusion 50. it is trite law that the bank guarantee/ letter of credit is an independent contract between the bank and the beneficiary and is not qualified by the underlying transaction and the validity of the primary contract between the beneficiary and the person at whose instance, the bank has given the bank c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 guarantee or issued the letter of credit is immaterial and of no consequences. there are exception to this rule. when there is a clear case of fraud or irretrievable injustice or special equity, the court can interfere with by issuing proper injunction. however, the court ordinarily should not interfere with the invocation or encashment of letter of credit or bank guarantee so long as it is in terms of letter of credit or bank guarantee. 51. in united commercial bank (supra), the hon'ble apex court observed that letter of credit is not concerned with the contract between the buyer and seller, it is an independent contract between the bankers i.e. issuing bank and negotiating bank. we deem it fit to quote para 40, which reads as under:\"it the light of these principles, the rule is well established that a bank issuing or confirming a letter of credit is not concerned with the underlying contract between the buyer and seller. duties of a bank under a letter of credit are created by the document itself, but in any case it has the power and is subject to the limitations which are given or imposed by it, in the absence of the appropriate provisions in the letter of credit.\" 52. yet in another case between the standard chartered bank vs. heavy engineering corporation reported in 2020(13) scc 574, the hon'ble supreme court in para 23 observed following:\"23. the settled position in law that emerges from the precedents of this court is that the bank guarantee is an independent contract between bank and the beneficiary and the bank is always obliged to honour its guarantee as long as it is an unconditional and irrevocable one. the dispute between the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the bank has given the guarantee is immaterial and is of no consequence. there are, however, exceptions to this rule when there is a clear case of fraud, irretrievable injustice or special equities. the court ordinarily should not interfere with c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 the invocation or encashment of the bank guarantee so long as the invocation is in terms of the bank guarantee.\" 53. in federal bank (supra), the hon'ble supreme court in para 55 to 57 and 60 has observed following:\"55 in several judgment of this court, it has been held that courts ought not to grant injunction to restrain encashment of bank guarantees or letters of credit, two exceptions have been mentioned-(i) fraud and (ii) irretrievable damage. if the plaintiffs is prima facie able to establish that the case conies within these two exceptions, temporary injunction under order 39, rule 1, cpc can be issued. it has also been held that the contract of the bank guarantee or the letter of credit is independent of the main contract between the seller arid the buyer. this is; also clear from arts. 3 and 4 of the ucp (1983 revision). in case of an irrevocable bank guarantee or letter of credit the buyer cannot obtain injunction against the banker 0n the ground that there was a breach of the contract by the seller. the bank is to honour the demand for encashment if the seller pima facie complies with the terms of the bank guarantee or letter of credit, namely, if the seller produces the documents enumerated in the bank guarantee or letter of credit if the bank is satisfied on the face of the documents that they are in conformity with the list of documents mentioned in the bank guarantee or letter of credit and there is no discrepancy, it is bound to honour the demand of the seller for encashment. while doing so it must take reasonable care. it is not permissible for the bank to refuse payment on the ground that the buyer is claiming that there is a breach of contract. nor can the bank try to decide this question of breach at that stage and refuse payment to the seller. its obligation under the document having nothing to do with any dispute as to breach of contract between the seller and the buyer. as to its knowledge of fraud or forgery, we shall presently deal with it, knowledge of fraud : 56. decided cases hold that in order to obtain an injunction against the issuing bank, it is necessary to prove that the bank had knowledge of the fraud. 57.kerr, j. said in r.d, harbottle (mercantile) lid v. national westminister bank ltd., (1978) q.b, 146 at 155 at irrevocable letters of credit are 'the life blood of international commerce''. c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 he said : \"except possibly in clear cases of fraud of which the banks have notice, the courts will leave the merchants to settle their disputes under the contracts by litigation or arbitration.otherwise, trust in international commerce could be irreparably damaged.\" denning m,r, .stated in edward and owen engineering ltd. v. barclays sank international lid. (1978) q.b. 159 that 'the only exception is where there is a clear fraud of which the bank had notice\": browne, lj. said in the same case : \"but it is certainly not enough to alleged fraud, it mast be established\" and in such circumstances, i should say, very clearly established\", in bolvinter oil s.a.v. chase manhattan bank, (1984) 1 all e.r, 351 at p. 352, it was said 'where it is proved that the bank knows that any demand for payment already made or which may thereafter be made, will clearly be fraudulent. but the evidence must be.clear both as to the fact of fraud and as to the bank's knowledge. it would certainly not be sufficient that this rests upon the uncorroborated statement of the customer,, for irreparable damage can be done to a bank's credit in the relatively brief time \"before the injunction is vacated\". thus, not only must 'fraud' be clearly proved but so far as the bank is concerned, it must prove that it had knowledge of the fraud. in united trading corp. s.a. v. allied ards bank, (1985) 2 lloyds rep, 554, it was stated that there must be proof of knowledge of fraud on the part of the bank at any time before payment. it was also observed that it \"would be sufficient if the corroborated evidence of the plaintiffs usually in the form of contemporary documents and the unexplained failure of a beneficiary to respond to the attack, lead to the conclusion that the .only realistic inference to draw was 'fraud'\". in guarantee trust co, of new york v, hanney, (1918) 2 k.b. 623 (kb), the banker accepted the documents without any knowledge of fraud or falsify and it was held that me defendants could not counter-claim from the bank. however, it would be the 'banker's duty to refuse the documents which oh their face bear signs of having been altered (see re salomon and nandszus, [l899].92' l.t. 325. that was a c.i.f. contract. this court in itc ltd. v. debts record appellate tribunal, [1998] .2 :scc 70 (at 79) also held that knowledge of the bank as to the fraud or forgery had to be prima facie established. c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 60. the contract between the issuing banker and the paying or negotiating (intermediary) banker may partake of a dual nature. the relationship is mainly that of principal and agent, mandator and mandatory. in order that he may claim reimbursement for any payment he makes under the credit or the indemnify of an agent, the intermediary banker must obey strictly, the instructions he receives, for by acting on them, he accepts then and thus enters into contractual relations with the issuing bank. the instructions may take the form of an authority either to pay against documents or drafts accompanied by document; or to negotiate drafts drawn either on the issuing banker or on the buyer. the authority may be accompanied by instructions to the intermediary banker to confirm the credit, that is, to place himself in binding contractual relationship with the beneficiary. there is ordinarily no privity between the intermediary banker and the buyer. but the intermediary banker, though initially the agent of the issuing bank, may also act as principal in relation to him.\" 54. in recent judgment of hon'ble supreme court in case of bawa paullins (supra), after considering various previous judgments, observed that letter of credit is used as a mode of ensuring payment and performance of the contractual terms and international transaction once the bank issued, the letter of credit confirmed the document, the confirming bank is obliged to pay to the beneficiary on demand, the credit amount and in turn recover the same from the issuing bank. it is further observed that a letter of credit is independent of and unqualified by the contract of sale or underlying transactions. the irrevocable letter of credit is autonomous documents. it is further observed that if courts interfere in such transactions, it would be prone to misuse by the party to gain undue advantage leaving the issuing bank at peril in the international financial market. we deem it fit to quote para 34 and 35 as under:\"34. it is common knowledge that in international c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 transactions, letter of credit is used as a mode of ensuring payment and performance of the contractual terms. a letter of credit is a document issued by a bank (issuing bank) on behalf of a party (applicant) in favour of another party (beneficiary) under which, the issuing bank undertakes to pay to the beneficiary, certain sums of money subject to compliance of the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. in an international transaction, the beneficiary is the seller who requests the applicant (buyer) to furnish a letter of credit from any bank which is recognized worldwide (issuing bank). the letter of credit is issued in favour of a beneficiary on the request of an applicant after furnishing securities as may be demanded by the issuing bank. a seller can ask the issuing bank to honour the letter of credit to his own bank (confirming bank) within a certain maturity date. the seller is required to produce certain documents regarding proof of delivery of goods, commercial invoice, bill of lading, insurance documents etc. before the confirming bank. on scrutiny the confirming bank would ask for advice of the issuing bank to confirm whether the documents produced by the beneficiary is compliant to the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. once the issuing bank confirms the document, the confirming bank is obligated to pay to the beneficiary on demand, the credit amount and in turn recover the same from the issuing bank. 35. in hindustan steel workers construction ltd. v g.s. atwal & co. (engineers) (p) ltd. [ (1995) 6 scc 76] this court held that a letter of credit is independent of and unqualified by the contract of sale or underlying transactions. the autonomy of an irrevocable loc is entitled to protection and as a rule, courts refrain from interfering with that autonomy. if courts interfere in such transactions, it would be prone to misuse by the applicant party to gain undue advantage leaving the issuing bank at peril in the international financial market.\" 55. thus, it is clear that letter of credit is independent contract between bankers governed by condition stated therein. contract/agreement between the parties is also autonomous contract regulating purchase and sale of goods being stated therein. both are operating in different arena. one may not have any bearing over other. invocation of letter of credit can c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 be interfered in explicitly only in case where fraud is pleaded and proved or terms and conditions of letter of credit is breached. 56. before we examine second aspect whether the condition of the letter of credit is breached, let us go through the plaint so as to find out whether allegation of fraud is levelled and prima facie proved against the defendant no.3 and as such, first aspect is attracted. on going through the averments made in the plaint as it is, it transpires that in the entire plaint, the allegations of fraud are levelled against the original defendant no.1, more particularly, reading para 10, 11 and 13 of the plaint and some of the allegations are levelled against the defendant no.2. however, there is no whisper of fraud alleged against the defendant no.3. the plaintiffs have not pleaded that the defendant no.3 has committed fraud with the plaintiffs with hand in glow with the defendant nos.1 and 2. it is settled law that it is not enough to allege fraud, but there must be clear evidence as to the facts of the fraud. at the cost of the repetition, it can be said that on surfacing through the plaint, at nowhere, the plaintiffs have alleged that the defendant no.3 has committed fraud hand in glow with other two defendants. in fact, no relief is asked against the defendant no.3 in the plaint or in the injunction application. learned senior counsel mr. mihir joshi is failed to point out averment of fraud levelled against the defendant no.3 in plaint. 57. on perusal of the records, it shows that the moa has been entered into by and between the plaintiffs and the defendant c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 no.1 on 21.4.2021 with various conditions. it was initially decided to pay 31,58,540 us $ as part of the purchase price through irrevocable letter of credit to be opened from the punjab national bank. one of the important conditions of the moa was that the opening bank to provide necessary instructions to confirming bank to permit discounting of the letter of credit upon receipt of appropriate documents from the seller. meaning thereby, it was the opening bank, which was authorized to pass instructions to the confirming bank to permit discounting of the letter of credit and not the plaintiffs. the another important condition was that the swift message from the opening bank confirming that buyer shall receive the notice of readiness from the seller or seller's agent at alang that the vessel has been physically delivered to the buyer. another condition between buyer and seller was that the seller shall issue notice of readiness for delivery only after vessel is arrived at safe anchorage at alang and is ready to affect physical delivery. all these conditions as part of the moa were operating between the plaintiffs and the defendant no.1. the moa has witnessed first change on 23.4.2021 and it was considered first amendment, whereby the opening bank has been changed from the punjab national bank to the canara bank, bhavnagar defendant no.2 herein with the further condition that the total amount of sale consideration of the vessel shall be paid through letter of credit and that too after 150 days of discounting of the letter of credit. another change was made on 13.5.2021 in the moa by way of addendum 2. on 20.5.2021, the moa witnessed third change called as addendum 3, where expected time of delivery of the vessel was stated 15.6.2021 and date of c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 cancellation was stated and considered as 22.6.2021. thereafter, the moa has witnessed several subsequent changes. 58. as per the moa, the letter of credit was obtained with the canara bank i.e. defendant no.2 and the receiving bank or negotiating bank was considered as dbs bank i.e. defendant no.3. it was an irrevocable letter of credit and the applicable rules were ucp latest version. in the first opening of the letter of credit, there were certain conditions mentioned, which was a contract between the defendant nos.2 and 3, and as it is stated earlier, it was irrevocable contract. the prime condition between the defendant nos.2 and 3 was that the amount of the letter of credit shall be recovered by the defendant no.3 from the defendant no.2 150 days after discounting it and from the date of physical delivery of the vessel. in field 46a, there are certain conditions incorporated when the letter of credit was opened. 59. learned senior counsel mr. mihir joshi has pressed his argument on the condition that the issuance of the notice of readiness for delivery of the vessel and the physically delivery to the buyer are the most important condition operating between the defendant nos.2 and 3 and it continued to operate between the parties throughout in spite of the letter of credit has witnessed several changes. in order to examine said submission, it is incumbent to refer the addendum impugned in the letter of credit. the first addendum was made in the letter of credit, which is on page 84 of the paper book, whereupon, field 46b has been brought on record, which reads as under:c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 46b documents repall / field 46a required point no.4 now to be read as a letter of undertaking from sellers that they will submit to the buyers copy of certificate from present port of registry stating that the time of delivery vessel is free of encumbrances point no.7 now to be read as a tested telex or swift advice from the opening bank confirming that the buyers have received the notice of readness from the sellser or sellers agent at alang that the vessel is ready to be delivered physically to buyers 57aadvise through bic / ifsc code dbsssgsgxxx bank bic / ifsc description dbs bank ltd. dbas asia central mdfc tower 3, 12 marina boulevard 73z sender to receiver all other terms and conditions information to remain same 60. so, substantial change has been witnessed. instead of condition of the vessel has been arrived at/anchoring at alang, it has been changed that tested telex or swift advised from the opening bank confirming that the buyers have received the notice of readiness from the seller or seller's agent at alang that their vessel is ready to be delivered physically to buyer. thus, the condition has been substantially and radically changed. initially, the condition was that the vessel has been arrived at alang, but has been replaced with the word that \"ready to be delivered physically to the buyer.\" the condition of the letter of credit was changed upon letter from the plaintiffs dated c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 4.5.2021 (page 86 of the paper book). likewise, the amount of letter of credit was also enhanced by 70,00,000 us $. 61. on 21.5.2021, the defendant no.1 also wrote letter to the plaintiffs for deleting point no.7 of field 46b and and be added condition in field 47a that the document to be presented after receipt of swift message as under:\"a tested telex or swift advice from the opening bank confirming that the buyers have received the notice of readiness from the seller or sellers agent at alang that the vessel is ready to be delivered physically to buyers.\" 62. consequent thereto, third amendment was taken place in the letter of credit incorporating said condition. on 25.5.2021, the defendant no.1 had presented necessary documents for encashing/discounting of the letter of credit, which includes bill of sale, notarial certificate, commercial invoices etc. (page 94 to 102 of the paper book). upon receipt of documents for encashment or discounting of the letter of credit, the defendant no.3 forwarded it to the defendant no.1 for confirmation with the following:\"we enclose documents relating to this drawing as required under the terms of the above documentary credit. please handle this document in accordance with the instructions. we have enclosed the documents for your acceptance and payment at maturity. upon your acceptance, we will negotiate the presented document under the dc. advise due date and acceptance by authenticated swift /tested c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 telex. we have endorsed the documents amount on the reverse of dc.\" 63. mr. ashit parikh, who was broker of the plaintiff, also sent the documents for approval to the plaintiffs vide email. consequent thereto, the plaintiffs have approved the documents by format/letter of acceptance on 1.6.2021, which reads as under:\"format of letter of acceptance of usance documents to be obtained from the importer clients in respect of documents received under lc date 1st june, 2021 from hussain sheth ispat (ship breaking) apt no.5d, alang ship yard, alang, bhavnagar to, the branch in-charge, canara bank, bhavnagar branch dear sir, sub :acceptance of documents drawn under import letter of credit

agreement cum application executed while establishing the letter of credit. thanking you yours faithfully authorized signatory\" (above letter has not been produced by the plaintiffs along with the plaint, but has been produced by the defendant no.2). 64. another letter was also written by the plaintiffs to the defendant no.2 on 1.6.2021, which reads as under:\"date 1st june, 2021 to, the branch manager, canara bank, bhavnagar sub regarding accepting the documents of vessel senihas dear sir, we are accepting the documents, the same will accept by us on arrival of ship along with present of notice of readiness. kindly, inform the dbs bank, singapore accordingly. we enclose here with addendum no.3 as per which the delivery will be on or before 22nd june, 2021. c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 this is for your kind information and please do the needful. regards, hussain sheth ispat (ship breaking) parnter encl addendum no.3.\" 65. thus, both the above format of letters indicates that the plaintiffs have accepted the documents which were presented by the defendant no.1 for the purpose of discounting/negotiating/encashing the letter of credit. the plaintiffs have instructed the defendant no.2 to inform the defendant no.3 accordingly. the plaintiffs have also mentioned that the delivery of the vessel will be arrived on or before 22.6.2021. thus, having stated so, the plaintiffs have accepted the documents produced by the seller through the defendant no.3 and reached to the plaintiffs through the defendant no.2 as well as from his broker mr. ashit parikh. 66. article 16 of the ucp 600 which was governing and applicable rules upon the letter of credit provides the clause for discrepant document waiver notice. article 16 reads as \" if the issuing bank or the confirming bank fails to act in accordance with the provisions of this article, it shall be precluded from claiming that the documents do not constitute a complying presentation.\" means, until the issuing bank or the confirming bank, in present case defendant no.2, raises any dispute in regards to the document tendered by the defendant no.3 for the c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 purpose of discounting the letter of credit, it would be considered as complying presentation. in article 16a to 16d, various provisions are given as to raise the dispute regarding non-presentation of the documents. it is nobody's case that the dispute has been raised as per article 16a to 16d or under any of them. however, this dispute for non-complying presentation has to be raised by the defendant no.2 only. in the present case, even the plaintiffs have not raised any such dispute about noncomplying of the presentation of the documents. in fact, by above stated two format of letters, the plaintiffs have accepted the presentation of the documents which was tendered by the defendant no.3 for discounting/encashing/negotiating of letter of credit. 67. consequent upon two letters, by which the plaintiffs have accepted the presentation of the documents, the defendant no.2 has issued the swift message to defendant no.3, which reads as under:77 narrative documents for usd 3158540.00 under lc ref no. 00302fouu211601 have been accepted to be paid on 19.11.2021 we will remit the negotiated amount as per your instructions on due date if this payment due date falls on a saturday or on a non banking day in india then the payment will be c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 made on the following banking day please avoid duplication 68. at this juncture, we may deem it fit to quote para 11(c) of the reply given by the defendant no.2, which reads as under:\"the plaintiffs vide letter dated 1.6.2021 informed to the defendant no.2 that they are accepting the documents, the same will be accepted by them on arrival of ship along with the notice of readiness. it submitted that as per the letter dated 1.6.2021 along with the addendum#3, it is transpired that the ship is about to arrive on 15.6.2021, accordingly, the defendant no.2 informed to the defendant no.3 vide swift message dated 3.6.2021 that the documents have been accepted and the amount of the letter of credit will be paid on 19.11.2021 assuming that the delivery of the vessel and notice of readiness etc. will be provided on or before 22.6.2021 as per the terms and conditions of the letter of credit and the copy of said swift message was also forwarded to the plaintiffs as per procedure and not disputed by the plaintiffs. the copy of the aforesaid documents are attach with separate list.\" 69. the defendant no.1 has tendered documents to the defendant no.3, which has been forwarded to the defendant no.2 for confirming it as a complying presentation, which was a part of the condition between the defendant nos.2 and 3 as per the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. the defendant no.2 being issuing bank has sent all these documents to the plaintiffs. the broker of the plaintiffs have also sent all these documents to the plaintiffs for confirming it as a complete compliance. the plaintiffs had unequivocally and explicitly accepted the presentation of the documents and considered it as a perfect compliance requirement. thus, in turn, the defendant c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 no.2 by swift message informed the defendant no.3 to discount the letter of credit. the plaintiffs himself have accepted that since the vessel was about to arrive on 15.6.2021, it directed the defendant no.2 to inform the defendant no.3 and consequent thereto, on 3.6.2021, a swift message was issued by the defendant no.2 to the defendant no.3 for discounting the letter of credit with the condition that the defendant no.2 shall pay the amount on 19.11.2021 150 days after the letter of credit is discounted. so, there is no breach of the terms and conditions of the contract on the part of the defendant no.2 or defendant no.3. in fact, the plaintiffs by varying the condition itself have allowed to relax the condition from vessel physically arrived to vessel to be arrived and informed that as per the seller's letter, the vessel is likely to arrive on 15.6.2021 and therefore, the letter of credit may be discounted and having confirmed/approved the complying presentation of the document, as per article 16 of the ucp 600, the defendant nos.2 and 3 to act upon the letter of credit and to pay the amount to the defendant no.1. learned senior counsel mr. mihir joshi failed to point out that how and in what circumstances, the defendant nos.2 and 3 have done wrong. they have acted as per the instructions of the plaintiffs and discounted the amount of the letter of credit. whether product (vessel) was reached to the plaintiffs or not, was not the issue governed by the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. it is a separate contract between the plaintiffs and the defendant no.1 and even that has been relaxed by the plaintiffs as well as the defendant from the \"vessel has to be arrived to \"vessel to be arrived\". c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 70. at the cost of the repetition, it can be observed that at no point of time, the plaintiffs had denied or objected the documents tendered by the defendant no.1 and received to the plaintiffs through the defendant no.2 forwarded by the defendant no.3 as well as forwarded through his broker or did not point out any discrepancy therein or issue any notice revising to honour the documents or the presentation as per article 16 of the ucp 600 within the stipulated time period or even thereafter. since the plaintiffs did not protest or quarrel about the insufficiency of the document at any point of time, its failure to do so has the effect to admitting those documents and which permits the defendant no.2 as well as defendant no.3 to play on the letter of credit and to negotiate it. the banks have to only deal with the documents and documents alone. the bank is not concerned over the issue whether the goods are delivered or not. support can be derived from the case between bangladesh krishi bank vs. navyug enterprises (p) ltd (supra), the division bench of the calcutta high court has observed following:\".the bank has to only deal with the documents and the documents alone and it is not the bank's concern even as to whether the goods covered by the documents exists or not.\" 71. in view of above reasons, there is shred of merit in any of the grounds canvassed by learned senior counsel mr. mihir joshi appearing for the petitioner. invocation of letter of credit, which can be questioned on two aspects; firstly on fraud and secondly, on non-compliance of the condition of the letter of c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 credit, both of which are missing in the present case. 72. two mere arguments were canvassed by learned senior counsel mr. mihir joshi for the petitioner that in view of order 7 rule 7 of the civil procedure code, 1908, the court can mould the relief, if the equity demands. reliance was placed upon the judgment of manohar ramkrishna (supra). para 14 & 15 of the said judgment observed following:\"14. having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned judge k.s. hegde, j, as he then was, held \"that the lesser right in plaintiffs's favour was sufficient to grant the relief prayed for. 15. under order 7 rule 7 the plaint shall state specifically the relief which the plaintiff claims either simply or in the alternative. if any general or other relief is not asked in the plaint, if the court thinks just and proper, such relief can be granted as if the plaintiff has asked for such relief. this rule applies to any relief claimed by the defendant in his written statement.\" 73. so, conclusions herein above indicates general or the relief which is ancillary to the main relief if has not been asked in the plaint, it can be granted if the court thinks fit under the jurisdiction of granting equitable relief, but under order 7 rule 7 of the civil procedure code, 1908, the court cannot grant relief if not asked. in case of sopanrao (supra), the hon'ble apex court in para 11 has observed as under:\"11. in our view, the aforesaid judgment does not help the appellants and, in fact, helps the respondents. the judgment clearly lays down that the lesser relief or smaller version of the relief claimed or prayed for can be granted. the plaintiffs claimed the status of inamdars which is a higher position than that of (2008) 17 scc 491 mutawalis. the high court has c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 granted a lesser or lower relief and not a higher relief or totally new relief and, therefore, we reject this contention also.\" 74. in the present case, it is undisputed that the plaintiffs have not asked any relief against the defendant no.3, therefore, under the guise of using power under order 7 rule 7 of the civil procedure code, 1908, court cannot grant relief against the defendant no.3. the plaintiffs are required to ask specific relief against the defendant no.3. until the plaintiffs asked relief against the defendant no.3, the court under the caption of general or other relief, cannot grant relief against the defendant no.3. thus, that contention has no substance to stand. in fact, order 7 rule 7 of the civil procedure code, 1908 clearly mandates that relief to be specifically asked, the provisions of law contain word \"shall\" which indicates that asking of relief specifically is the mandatory and the plaintiffs cannot turn away from the provisions of order 7 rule 7 of the civil procedure code, 1908 basing himself that the court under the equitable jurisdiction can mould the relief. 75. the second submission canvassed by learned senior counsel mr. mihir joshi was to the effect that under order 43 rule 1(r) of the civil procedure code, 1908, the learned appellate court enjoys very limited and circumscribe jurisdiction. the learned appellate court has committed error by upturning the order passed by the learned commercial court under the exercise of discretion. he would further submit that interference at the hand of the learned appellate court was not warranted c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 even if the learned appellate court held different view. reference was made to the judgment of hon'ble apex court in case of mohd. mehtab khan (supra). there is no cavil on the proposition of law canvassed or are propounded in the aforesaid judgment. under order 43 rule 1(r) of the civil procedure code, 1908, the learned first appellate court enjoys the circumscribe jurisdiction and ordinarily, it cannot interfere with the order impugned arrived at in exercise of discretion. however, if the order passed under discretionary jurisdiction is palpably wrong and passed in ignorance of settled principles of law or patently illegal, to prevent miscarriage of justice, the appellate court can interfere with such order. in the present case, the learned commercial court has totally missed to read and follow the settle principles of law. in a case where injunction is sought against invocation of letter of credit, the learned commercial court has granted ex parte injunction, which even otherwise, has to be granted in a very rare and exceptional circumstances. what more shocking appears that ex parte injunction was granted with recording satisfactory reason and proper application of mind. the court is under an obligation to record the reason that why an ex parte order of injunction is required to be passed in the best facts and circumstances of the particular case. recording of the reason is not mere formality for granting ex parte injunction, but it is a pre-condition. this requirement is consistent with the principle that a party to suit which is being restrained from exercising a right which such party claims to exercise either under statute or under common law. the factor which is waived with the court to grant ex parte injunction, which is well-defined by the hon'ble apex court in c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 case of morgan stanley mutual fund vs. kartik das reported in 1994(4) scc 225. it is undisputed that ex parte injunction has been granted in ignorance of these principles and the factors which is enumerated by the hon'ble apex court in case of morgan stanley mutual fund (supra). not only that, thereafter, while hearing the injunction application by parte, the learned commercial court without reading ucp 600 in its proper perspective and without bifurcating difference between the moa and the contract of letter of credit, intermixed it and granted stay against the defendant no.3 against whom no relief was ever prayed by the plaintiffs and therefore, exercise of power under the discretionary jurisdiction by the learned commercial court was totally against settled principles of law and it was palpably wrong for as much appalling to the judicial conscience. 76. the learned appellate court in para 33 to 36 of the impugned order, has addressed issue that how the learned commercial court has passed the order against settled principles of law and how it is arbitrary, wrong and capricious and eventually displayed its disapproval. according to this court, the learned appellate court has not committed any error in upturning the order passed by the learned commercial court. the learned appellate court has considered articles of ucp 600 in background of the contract of letter of credit between the parties as well as presentation of the documents and issuance of the swift message rightly. we do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned judgment delivered in commercial appeal no.1 of 2023. c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 77. even otherwise, under article 227 of the constitution of india, under the supervisory jurisdiction, we cannot lens the impugned order as a appellate body. this court has to confine to its jurisdiction of being supervisory, and refrain from entering into the factual arena of the issue, which is legally impermissible. it is settled proposition that supervisory power conferred by article 227 of the constitution of india has to be exercised rarely. in this regard, we deem it fit to quote para 12 of the judgment of the hon'ble apex court in case of waryam singh (supra), which, later on, is reiterated by the hon'ble apex court in its decision of shalini shyam shetty (supra). para 12 reads as under:\"this power of superintendence conferred by article 227 is, as pointed out by harries c. j., in dalmia jain airways ltd. v. sukumar mukherjee(2), to be exercised most sparingly and only in appropriate cases in order to keep the subordinate courts within the bounds of their authority and not for correcting mere errors. as rightly pointed out by the judicial commissioner in the case before us the lower courts in refusing to make an order for ejectment acted arbitrarily. the lower courts realised the legal position but in effect declined to do what was by section 13 (2) (i) incumbent on them to do and thereby refused to exercise jurisdiction vested in them by law. it. was, therefore, a case which called for an interference by the court of the judicial commissioner and it acted quite properly in doing so. in our opinion there is no ground on which in an appeal by special leave under article 136 we should interfere. the appeal, therefore, must stand dismissed with costs.\" 78. with profit, we may refer recent decision of garment craft v/s prakash chand goel reported in (2022) 4 scc 181, wherein c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 the hon'ble apex court with regards to the jurisdiction under article 227 of the constitution of india has observed following:\"15. having heard the counsel for the parties, we are clearly of the view that the impugned order is contrary to law and cannot be sustained for several reasons, but primarily for deviation from the limited jurisdiction exercised by the high court under article 227 of the constitution of india. the high court exercising supervisory jurisdiction does not act as a court of first appeal to reappreciate, reweigh the evidence or facts upon which the determination under challenge is based. supervisory jurisdiction is not to correct every error of fact or even a legal flaw when the final finding is justified or can be supported. the high court is not to substitute its own decision on facts and conclusion, for that of the inferior court or tribunal [celina coelho pereira (ms) and others v. ulhas mahabaleshwar kholkar and others, (2010) 1 scc 217]. the jurisdiction exercised is in the nature of correctional1 jurisdiction to set right grave dereliction of duty or flagrant abuse, violation of fundamental principles of law or justice. the power under article 227 is exercised sparingly in appropriate cases, like when there is no evidence at all to justify, or the finding is so perverse that no reasonable person can possibly come to such a conclusion that the court or tribunal has come to. it is axiomatic that such discretionary relief must be exercised to ensure there is no miscarriage of justice. 16. explaining the scope of jurisdiction under article 227, this court in estralla rubber v. dass estate (p) ltd., (2001) 8 scc 97 has observed:\"6. the scope and ambit of exercise of power and jurisdiction by a high court under article 227 of the constitution of india is examined and explained in a number of decisions of this court. the exercise of power under this article involves a duty on the high court to keep inferior courts and tribunals within the bounds of their authority and to see that they do the duty expected or required of them in a legal manner. the high court is not vested with any unlimited prerogative to correct all kinds of hardship or wrong decisions made within the limits of the jurisdiction of the subordinate courts or tribunals. exercise of this power and interfering with the orders of the courts or tribunals is restricted to cases of c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 serious dereliction of duty and flagrant violation of fundamental principles of law or justice, where if the high court does not interfere, a grave injustice remains uncorrected. it is also well settled that the high court while acting under this article cannot exercise its power as an appellate court or substitute its own judgment in place of that of the subordinate court to correct an error, which is not apparent on the face of the record. the high court can set aside or ignore the findings of facts of an inferior court or tribunal, if there is no evidence at all to justify or the finding is so perverse, that no reasonable person can possibly come to such a conclusion, which the court or tribunal has come to.\" 79. in view of above, the petitioner failed to make out a case, which may persuade this court to exercise the supervisory power conferred by article 227 of the constitution of india. 80. for the foregoing reasons, this petition sans merit and is accordingly rejected. interim relief, if any, stands vacated forthwith. connected civil application, if any, stands disposed of. rule discharged. (ashutosh shastri, j) (j. c. doshi,j) shekhar p. barve further order after pronouncement of judgment, learned senior advocate mr. mihir joshi appearing with learned advocate ms. c/sca/5483/2023 cav judgment dated: 16/06/2023 amrita thakore for the petitioners prays to continue the interim relief for a further period of six weeks, which was operating during the pendency of the petition so as to enable the petitioners to approach the apex court. learned advocate appearing for the other side objected to grant of said request. since the interim relief was operating pending hearing of this petition, it is continued for a further period of three weeks from today.
