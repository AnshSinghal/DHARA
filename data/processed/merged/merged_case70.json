Respondent\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       O R D E R \nSurinder Singh Nijjar, J.\n1. The petitioner has filed the present application under Sections 11(4) and (6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read with paragraph 2 of the Appointment of the  Arbitrators by the Chief Justice of India Scheme, 1996 . It is stated that the parties had entered into a legally valid and enforceable Memorandum of Understanding (`MOU')\n- 1 - dated 25th September, 2007, providing, inter alia, for the respective obligation of both the parties in connection with the marketing of the cars of the petitioner. Though the term of the MOU was till December, 2007, it was extended by the acts of the parties in terms of Clause 2 of the MOU.\n2. The petitioner makes a reference to various requests made by the respondent for supply of cars in terms of MOU on 22nd April, 2008; 24th August, 2008; and 1st April, 2009. The petitioner further claims that some time in September 2009, disputes arose between the parties. \nNumerous e-mails were exchanged between the parties, apart from the personal discussions between their representatives, touching and covering the disputes. It is the petitioner's claim that during the term of MOU, merely 15 cars of the petitioner had been sold in the Belgium Region. The petitioner, therefore, claimed that the respondent did not have in place the necessary resources to build the brand of the petitioner. Consequently, through e-mail dated 25th September, 2009 the petitioner requested the respondent to immediately cease sales and - 2 - marketing activities on its behalf and take necessary steps of providing after sales and service to existing car owners, till such time the petitioner appointed its new distributor. The petitioner claims that the aforesaid e-mail duly constituted the termination of the contractual relationship between the parties as covered under the MOU. \n3. As a consequence of the aforesaid termination, the parties have exchanged various e-mails raising claims and counter claims on 6th /7th /8th October, 2009. \n4. The petitioner further claims to have received a Writ of Summons dated 14th January, 2010 of legal proceedings initiated by the respondent in Belgium before the First Divisional Court, Room A of the Commercial Court in Brussels. According to the petitioner, the claims made by the respondent before the Commercial Court, Brussels disclose that the respondent instituted the legal proceedings inter alia claiming damages from the petitioner on account of termination of the MOU dated 25th September, 2007. On 15th March, 2010, the counsel for the - 3 - respondent sent an e-mail communication that the respondent was willing to negotiate a global settlement with the petitioner and that the respondent through its counsel would be available to discuss any such proposal. According to the petitioner, the aforesaid communication also acknowledges the fact that the rights and obligation of both the parties were covered by the distributorship agreement, i.e. the MOU, which stood duly terminated. \n5. The petitioner thereafter issued a notice dated 24th March, 2010 through its counsel in terms of Clause 11 of the MOU invoking arbitration under the MOU and referring all disputes between the parties to arbitration. The petitioner in fact nominated Mr. Justice Jayasimha Babu (Retired) as the Sole Arbitrator, and failing confirmation by the respondent, as the arbitrator of the petitioner on the three member Arbitral Tribunal to be constituted in terms of Clause 11.\n- 4 - 6. The respondent through its counsel sent a reply to the notice dated 7th April, 2010 denying existence of any contractual relationship between the parties on the date of termination of MOU on 25th September, 2009. \n7. The petitioner, therefore, filed Arbitration Application No.576 of 2010 under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before the Court of the Principal City Civil & Sessions Judge at Bangalore praying for an order of injunction restraining the respondent from proceeding with the legal proceedings initiated before the First Divisional Court, Room A of Commercial Court of Brussels, Belgium. \n8. The petitioner had also moved I.A.No.1 in the aforesaid suit dated 19th April, 2010 seeking an order of temporary injunction which was granted by the Principal City Civil & Sessions Judge at Bangalore on 21st April, 2010. Thereafter the petitioner has moved the present application for appointment of the Arbitrator in terms of Clause 11 of the MOU which reads as under:-\n\"11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction - 5 - i. This MOU shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of India.\nii. In the event of any dispute or difference arising at any time between the parties hereto as to the construction, meaning or effect of this Agreement or thing contained herein or the rights, duties, liabilities and obligations of the parties hereto in relation to this Agreement, the same shall be referred to a single arbitrator, in case the parties can agree upon one (1) within a period of thirty days upon being called by a party to do so and failing such agreement to three (3) arbitrators one (1) each to be appointed by GREENMOBIL and RECC and the third to be appointed by the two arbitrators so appointed. The award passed by such arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on both the parties. \nAll such arbitration proceedings shall be held in Bangalore as per the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 as amended from time to time.\"\n9. In reply to the aforesaid petition, the respondent claimed that the MOU dated 25th September, 2007 expired on 31st December, 2007. The petition does not clearly set out the claim or the period of the claim but the documents and implication of the contents of the present petition seem to indicate that the claim of the petitioner is in respect of the commercial distribution of the cars which commenced from 1st January, 2008 i.e. after the expiry of Memorandum of understanding. It is also the plea of the respondent that the MOU relate to a test and trial period - 6 - which came to an end on 31st December, 2007, after which the parties decided to enter into a distribution agreement which was sent by the petitioner to the respondent on 15th November, 2007, i.e., 15 days prior to the expiry of the MOU. Therefore, the arbitration clause relied upon by the petitioner does not cover any disputes/claims that relate to any period beyond 31st December, 2007. It is further claimed that the petition is only a counterblast to the proceedings filed by the respondent before the Commercial Court at Brussels. This, according to the respondent, is evident from the fact that the respondent had instituted the proceedings in the Commercial Court at Brussels on 14th January, 2010; the petitioner was intimated about the said proceedings vide e- mail dated 15th March, 2010; and the notice invoking the arbitration clause in the MOU is dated 24th March, 2010. It is, therefore, clear that the arbitration clause is invoked only to avoid proceedings before the Commercial Court at Brussels. It is emphasised that the proceedings before the Commercial Court at Brussels related to the period beyond the MOU when the parties had commenced work of distributorship or dealership after the test trial period under the MOU had come to an end. \n- 7 - 10. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties. \n11. Mr. Narasimha, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the averments made by the respondent in reply to the petition make it abundantly clear that the disputes pertained to the MOU dated 25th September, 2007. According to the learned counsel, there was no fresh agreement entered into between the parties. Cars were being supplied to the respondent in terms of Clause 2 of the MOU. \nMaking a reference to Clause 2, learned counsel submits that the aforesaid clause makes it clear that the MOU was effective for a period of three to six months, from the date of arrival of the cars in Belgium. This term was to be considered as the trial period. On completion of the trial period but not later than 3rd December, 2007, the parties were to mutually decide to continue the marketing, sales, and service of the work hours by the respondent. They were also to enter into a fresh long term agreement on mutually agreed terms and conditions. He submits that till the date of the termination of the MOU, no fresh agreement had - 8 - been entered into between the parties. Relying on the last sentence of the Clause 2, Mr. Narasimha submits that it was the sole discretion of the petitioner to extend the MOU in case the petitioner believed that the additional time is required to complete the trial period. The aforesaid portion of Clause 2 is as under :-\n\"RECC, at its sole discretion, may decide to extend the MOU if RECC believes that additional time is required to complete the trial period.\"\n12. He further submits that although the cars were being supplied to the respondent but the petitioner was not satisfied with the progress made in the number of cars sold by the respondent. Therefore, the respondent was constrained to terminate the MOU, after a period of two years from the commencement. \n13. According to Mr. Narasimha, respondent has initiated the proceedings in the Brussels Court only to pre-empt the initiation of legal proceedings by the petitioner. He points out that the pleadings in the Writ of Summons, clearly show: that the respondent was only concerned with the effect of the termination and not the period of the MOU. \n- 9 - Respondent has admitted that the contractual relationship started in 2007. The respondent has admitted that there is no other subsequent agreement. In Paragraph 18 of the Writ of Summons, the respondent admits that the contractual relationship was subsisting till September, 2009. In Paragraph 30, it is admitted by the respondent that \"the party summoned below terminated the contract in an untimely and brutal manner on 25th September, 2009\". \n14. He points out that the disputes have arisen in relation to the termination of the MOU and the consequences thereof. Such disputes are clearly covered by the arbitration clause which clearly provides for resolution of disputes through arbitration. The clause provides that in the event of any dispute or difference arising at any time between the parties in relation to the agreement shall be referred to a Sole Arbitrator. \nThe clause, according to the learned senior counsel, is not limited to the disputes relating only to the initial period of the MOU till 31st December 2007. \n- 10 - 15. He submits irrespective of whether the MOU is now in existence or not, the Arbitration clause would survive. He relies on the decisions of this Court in the cases of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. Vs. Great Eastern Shipping Company Ltd.1 and Everest Holding Limited Vs. Shyam Kumar Shrivastava & Ors.2 He further submits that this Court is required to refer the disputes between the parties to the Sole Arbitrator, without any in-depth examination of the disputes. The Court is merely to be satisfied that the disputes fall within the ambit of the Arbitration Clause. In support of this submission, he relies on the judgment of this Court in Brigadier Man Mohan Sharma, FRGS (Retd.) Vs. Lieutenan t General Depinder Singh3 . He also relies on the judgment in the case of National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Boghara Polyfab Private Limited4 , in support of the submission all disputes are such which need to be decided by the Sole Arbitrator on merits, and can not be decided by this Court in a petition under Section 11(4) and 6 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Learned 1 2008 (1) SCC 503 2 2008 (16) SCC 774 3 2009 (2) SCC 600 4 2009(1) SCC 267 - 11 - counsel further submits that in accordance with the aforesaid clause the petitioner had already nominated the Sole Arbitrator. The respondent has, however, not accepted the aforesaid arbitrator. At the same time, it had expressed its willingness to negotiate the global settlement with the petitioner. \n16. On the other hand, Ms. Tasneem Ahamadi, has submitted that the MOU having come to an end by efflux of time, there was no question of any termination as claimed by the petitioner. She further submits that the notice invoking arbitration was sent only as a counterblast to the summons received by the petitioner from the Brussels Commercial Court. Learned counsel further submitted that the disputes which form the basis of the claim in the Brussels Commercial Court pertained to a period subsequent to the period covered by the MOU. The arbitration clause in the MOU relates only to disputes which relate to the test and trial period. Hence, an arbitrator can not be appointed for settlement of disputes which occurs / relate to a period after 31st December, 2007. \nThe disputes raised before the Commercial Court at Brussels are not - 12 - covered by the arbitration clause in the MOU. She had made a detailed reference to numerous e-mails exchanged between the parties to submit that the parties had in fact entered into a long term contract. This was only to be reduced to a formal document. Since the disputes are not covered by the arbitration clause, there can be no reference. In support of the aforesaid submission, learned counsel relies on a judgment of this Court in the case of SBP & Co. Vs. Patel Engineering Ltd. & Anr.5 . \nIn view of the law laid down in the aforesaid judgment, according to the learned counsel, the arbitration petition deserves to be dismissed. \n17 I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties. It appears that the submissions made by Ms. Ahamadi that the question with regard to the existence of a valid arbitration agreement would have to be decided by this Court, is not without merit. This Court has on a number of occasions examined the scope and ambit of the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice or his designate under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. A reference in this connection 5 2005 (8) SCC 618 - 13 - can be made to the judgment of this Court in SBP & Co. (supra) wherein a Constitution Bench of this Court has clearly held as under:\n\"39. It is necessary to define what exactly the Chief Justice, approached with an application under Section 11 of the Act, is to decide at that stage. Obviously, he has to decide his own jurisdiction in the sense whether the party making the motion has approached the right High Court. He has to decide whether there is an arbitration agreement, as defined in the Act and whether the person who has made the request before him, is a party to such an agreement. It is necessary to indicate that he can also decide the question whether the claim was a dead one; or a long-barred claim that was sought to be resurrected and whether the parties have concluded the transaction by recording satisfaction of their mutual rights and obligations or by receiving the final payment without objection. It may not be possible at that stage, to decide whether a live claim made, is one which comes within the purview of the arbitration clause. It will be appropriate to leave that question to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal on taking evidence, along with the merits of the claims involved in the arbitration. The Chief Justice has to decide whether the petitioner has satisfied the conditions for appointing an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act. For the purpose of taking a decision on these aspects, the Chief Justice can either proceed on the basis of affidavits and the documents produced or take such evidence or get such evidence recorded, as may be necessary. We think that adoption of this procedure in the context of the Act would best serve the purpose sought to be achieved by the Act of expediting the process of arbitration, without too many approaches to the court at various stages of the proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal.\" \n- 14 - In the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd. (supra), this Court again examined the question with regard to the scope of the jurisdiction under Section 11(6). In doing so, this Court explained the ratio of the Constitution Bench in SBP & Co. (supra). In Para 21 of the Judgment, the power of the Arbitral Tribunal in cases where the disputes are referred to arbitration without the intervention of the court has been distinguished from the power in matters where the intervention of the court is sought for appointment of an Arbitral Tribunal. In case where the matters are sought to be referred to arbitration without the intervention of the court it has been held that the Arbitral Tribunal can decide the following questions affecting its jurisdiction: (a) whether there is an arbitration agreement; (b) whether the arbitration agreement is valid; (c) whether the contract in which the arbitration clause is found is null and void, and if so, whether the invalidity extends to the arbitration clause also. \n18. In matters, where the intervention of the Chief Justice of India has been sought for appointment of a sole arbitrator under Section 11(4), (5)\n- 15 - and (6) of the Arbitration Act, 1996, the Chief Justice or his designate will have to decide certain preliminary issues. It would be apposite to notice here the relevant observations made in Para 22, which are as follows :-\n\"22. This Court identified and segregated the preliminary issues that may arise for consideration in an application under Section 11 of the Act into three categories, that is, (i) issues which the Chief Justice or his designate is bound to decide; (ii) issues which he can also decide, that is, issues which he may choose to decide; and (iii) issues which should be left to the Arbitral Tribunal to decide. 22.1. The issues (first category) which the Chief Justice/his designate will have to decide are:\n(a) Whether the party making the application has approached the appropriate High Court. \n(b) Whether there is an arbitration agreement and whether the party who has applied under Section 11 of the Act, is a party to such an agreement. \n22.2. The issues (second category) which the Chief Justice/his designate may choose to decide (or leave them to the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal) are:\n(a) Whether the claim is a dead (long-barred) claim or a live claim.\n(b) Whether the parties have concluded the contract/transaction by recording satisfaction of their mutual rights and obligation or by receiving the final payment without objection.\n- 16 - 22.3. The issues (third category) which the Chief Justice/his designate should leave exclusively to the Arbitral Tribunal are:\n(i) Whether a claim made falls within the arbitration clause (as for example, a matter which is reserved for final decision of a departmental authority and excepted or excluded from arbitration).\n(ii) Merits or any claim involved in the arbitration. \" \nThese observations were further reiterated by this Court in the case of A.P. Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. Vs. Pampa Hotels Ltd.6. The aforesaid ratio of law has been reiterated by this Court in Alva Aluminium Limited, Bangkok Vs. Gabriel India Limited7. Upon consideration of the entire case law, it has been observed as follows :-\n\"18. It is in the light of above pronouncements, unnecessary to delve any further on this issue. It is clear that once the existence of the arbitration agreement itself is questioned by any party to the proceeding initiated under Section 11 of the Act, the same will have to be decided by the Chief Justice/designate as the case may be. That is because existence of an arbitration agreement is a jurisdictional fact which will have to be addressed while making an order on a petition under Section 11 of the Act.\"\n6 [2010 (5) SCC 425].\n7 [2011 (1) SCC 167].\n- 17 - 19. In view of the aforesaid authoritative dicta, the submission of Ms. Ahamadi has to be accepted that in a petition under Sections 11(4)(5)(6) and (9) of the Arbitration Act, 1996, it is for the Chief Justice of India/his designate to decide about the existence of a valid arbitration agreement. Now let me examine the facts in the present case keeping in view the aforesaid well settled principles. \n20. There is no dispute that the parties had entered into a legally valid and enforceable MOU dated 25th September, 2007. There is also no dispute that Clause 11 provides that disputes arising between the parties, at any time, in relation to the MOU, shall be referred to arbitration. Clause (2) of the MOU, undoubtedly, fixes the trial period upto 31st December, 2007. However, the clause also provides that the petitioner may unilaterally decide to extend the MOU, if it considers necessary. The correspondence between the parties would show that the petitioner had proposed a draft distribution agreement to the respondent for discussion. Thereafter, a series of e-mails were exchanged between the parties, but making it apparent that no final consensus was reached. \n- 18 - It would, therefore, appear that the MOU was duly extended till it was terminated as averred by the petitioner. \n21. The petitioner has categorically pleaded that the MOU was terminated on 25th September, 2009. The petitioner has placed on record the e-mail dated 25th September, 2009 in which it is clearly stated that MOU was entered into on 25th September, 2007 for a test period of six months from the date of arrival of the trial cars. It is further stated that this period was extended on an informal and voluntary basis by the petitioner for a period extending to two years from the date of signing of the MOU. During this two years period, a total of 15 REVA cars have been sold. It is pointed out that inspite of the best efforts of the respondent and the efforts of the petitioner to support the respondent, following a review of the European operations it is believed that the respondents do not have in place the resources to build the REVA brand, invest in the appropriate infrastructure, obtain necessary fiscal and/or subsidy and infrastructure support and are not adequately prepared to launch the M1 vehicles introduced by REVA at the Frankfurt IAA.\n- 19 - Thereafter it requests the respondents to immediately cease all sales and marking activities on behalf of REVA brand. This termination of the agreement has been acknowledged by the respondents in its e-mail dated 7th October, 2009. A perusal of this e-mail would also demonstrate that the disputes had clearly arisen between the parties at that time. The e-mail makes a grievance that the respondents had not been notified of the termination of its dealership activities a few weeks ago when it had informed the petitioner of its negotiations with potential Dutch partners. The respondents also repeated its disappointment that the win-win soft-landing solution it proposed on 25th September, 2009 was rejected by the petitioner. Rest of the correspondence between the parties continues in the same tenor. Clearly, therefore, the MOU has been extended till its termination on 25th September, 2009. It is also evident that the parties had failed to reach any fresh agreement with regard to sale of REVA cars in Europe by the respondents. In my opinion, the pleadings and the material on record has clearly established that there was a valid arbitration agreement incorporated in Clause 11 of the MOU.\n- 20 - 22. This takes me to the second submission of Ms.Ahamadi that, in any event, the disputes cannot be referred to arbitration as it pertained to a period subsequent to the term of the MOU. Mr.Narasimha has, however, pointed out that according to the case pleaded by the respondents in the Brussels Court which is evident from the writ of summons, all the disputes pertained to the period prior to the termination of the agreement by the petitioner. The writ of summons clearly mentions as follows :\n\"Whereas the first cars of the make REVA were marketed in India from June 2001 onwards, then in the UK in 2003 and worldwide from 2007. \nThat the party summoned below had however promised the arrival of more performing Lithium batteries that would be installed in their vehicles from the middle of 2008, as well as a new or more competitive and more attractive car model by the end of 2008, the REVA `NXR'. \nWhereas the contractual relationships between the petitioner and the party summoned below started in 2007. Whereas the distribution of the REVA cars by the petitioner took place in two stage. \n- 21 - That during an initial period the petitioner ran a pilot project for the party summoned below to assess the marketing possibilities of the REVA on the Belgian market. That after a certain period of time the petitioner became an exclusive distributor of REVA cars for the BENULEX.\" \n23. The writ of summons further mentions that the petitioner had to run a pilot project of three to six months to test the marketing possibilities of the REVA cars on the Belgium market. It is further pleaded that at the end of the test period and at the latest on 31st December, 2007, the parties had to decide jointly whether the petitioner would continue to provide the promotion, sales and service of REVA Cars in Belgium within the framework of a long-term distribution contract. \nThe respondents further pleaded that :-\n\"Whereas, in spite of the absence of the signing of a written contract between the parties, the petitioner de facto became the exclusive distributor of REVA vehicles in the BENELUX starting the month of January, 2008.\"\n24. Thereafter the respondents gave details of the efforts made by it for marketing of the REVA Cars from January, 2008 onwards. In paragraph 19 of the writ of summons, it is clearly admitted as follows :-\n- 22 - \"Whereas on the 25th of September, 2009, as soon as the first REVA cars fitted with Lithium batteries and of the new REVA NXR model arrive in Belgium the petitioner is going to be ejected all of a sudden by the party summoned below. That during a telephone conversation on 25th September, 2009, confirmed in an email of the same date the party summoned below suddenly announced its decision to terminate the concession granted to the petitioner for the Belelux, with immediate effect;\nThat the party summoned below asked the petitioner to immediately stop the sale and promotion of the REVA cars as well as the use of the REVA mark.\" \n25. The claims made by the respondents clearly pertained to the contract which was terminated on 25th September, 2009. In paragraph 30 of the writ of summons, it is pleaded as under :-\n\"That the parties summoned below terminated the contract in any untimely and brutal manner on 25th September, 2009.\"\n26. On the aforesaid basis, the respondents claim compensation and damages amounting to Euro 454,000.\n27. The aforesaid averments and the material on record would clearly demonstrate that the disputes that have arisen between the parties - 23 - clearly relate to the MOU dated 25th September, 2007. It would be for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide as to whether claims made are within the arbitration clause. The Arbitral Tribunal would also have to decide the merits of the claim put forward by the respective parties. In view of the material placed on record, it would not be possible to accept the submissions of Ms. Ahamadi that the disputes were beyond the purview of the arbitration clause. \n28. A similar matter was examined by this Court in the case of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. Vs. Great Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd.8 In the aforesaid case, an agreement called time charter party was entered into between the appellant and the respondent on 6th May, 1997 for letting on hire vessels for a period of two years from 22nd September, 1996 to 30th June, 1997 and from 1st July, 1997 to 30th June, 1998. It appears that certain disputes arose between the parties. Thereafter, on the basis of the correspondence exchanged between the parties with regard to the disputes, claims and counter claims were filed before the 8 (2008 (1) SCC 503).\n- 24 - Arbitral Tribunal. Issues were duly framed of which the following three issues may be of some relevance in the present context viz. \n\"Issue 1.--Whether the Hon'ble Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute between the claimant and the respondent for the period September 1998 to August 1999 in respect of the vessel Jag Praja for the reasons stated in Para 1 of the written statement? \nIssue 2.--Whether there is any common practice that if the vessel is not redelivered at the end of the period mentioned in the time charter the vessel would be governed by the charter party under which originally it was chartered? \n* * * Issue 5.--Whether the time charter party dated 6-5-1997 came to an end by efflux of time on 30-8-1998? \" \n29. The Arbitral Tribunal by its order dated 12th May, 2003 came to the conclusion that the appellant having invoked the arbitration clause contained in the charter party agreement dated 6th May, 1997, which was valid upto 31st December, 1998 and as the dispute between the parties related to the period subsequent to 31st August, 1998, they had no jurisdiction to decide the reference. The tribunal held that the charter party agreement dated 6th May, 1997 was superseded by a fresh agreement. Therefore, original charter party dated 6th May, 1997 got - 25 - extinguished. The respondents challenged the said award before the High Court. Learned Single Judge set aside the award and held that the Arbitral Tribunal has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the disputes between the parties as the vessel continued to be hired by the appellant for the period subsequent to 31st August, 1998 on the same terms and conditions, as were contained in charter party agreement dated 6th May, 1997. It was held that the charter party dated 6th May, 1997 did not come to an end by efflux of time and it was extended by the party on the same terms and conditions. Correctness of this order was challenged in this Court. On examination of the entire fact situation, it was held as follows :-\n\"19. It is, no doubt, true that the general rule is that an offer is not accepted by mere silence on the part of the offeree, yet it does not mean that an acceptance always has to be given in so many words. Under certain circumstances, offeree's silence, coupled with his conduct, which takes the form of a positive act, may constitute an acceptance--an agreement sub silentio. Therefore, the terms of a contract between the parties can be proved not only by their words but also by their conduct.\"\n- 26 - 30. Examining the fact situation in the present case, I am of the opinion that the conclusion is inescapable that notwithstanding the initial period under the MOU expiring by 31st December, 2007, the same was extended by the petitioner in exercise of its discretion under Clause (2) of the MOU. The extended MOU was terminated only on 25th September, 2009. Therefore, it is not possible to accept the submission of Ms. Ahamadi that the disputes arising between the parties cannot be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal. In my opinion, Mr. Narasimha has rightly submitted that the disputes have arisen in relation to the termination of the MOU and the consequences thereof. Such disputes would be clearly covered under the Arbitration clause which provides that in the event of any dispute or difference arising at any time between the parties in relation to the agreement shall be referred to a Sole Arbitrator. The clause is clearly not limited to the disputes relating only to the initial period of the MOU till 31st December, 2007. \n31. I also find merit in the submission of Mr. Narasimha that irrespective of whether the MOU is now in existence or not, the - 27 - arbitration clause would survive. The observations made by this Court in the case of Everest Holding Ltd. (supra) would clearly support the submission made by the learned senior counsel. In the aforesaid case, the parties had entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (for short `JVA') dated 25th September, 2003 for the purpose of mining, processing and export of Iron Ore. On 26th March, 2004, another JVA was executed between the parties, particularly to iron out certain controversy in respect of JVA dated 25th September, 2003. Article 14.3 of the said JVA contained an arbitration clause providing that if the parties failed to resolve the matter through mutual agreement, the dispute shall be referred to an Arbitrator appointed by mutual agreement of the two parties. The stand of the petitioner in the aforesaid case was that on 20th September, 2004, it was shocked and surprised to receive unwarranted notices for cancellation of JVA. The aforesaid notice was replied on 6th October, 2004. Since the disputes between the parties were not resolved, the petitioner invoked the arbitration clause. \nRespondent No. 1 in reply to the notice refuted the claim of the petitioner and also refused to refer the matter to arbitration on the ground that the - 28 - JVA between the petitioner and the respondent No.1 is not in existence as the same had been terminated by respondent No.2. It was stated that in view of the aforesaid position, there could be no invocation of Clause 14.3 of JVA.\n32. Considering the aforesaid fact situation, this Court observed that under Clause 14.2, the parties had agreed that they would use all reasonable efforts to resolve the disputes, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these agreements. Since the parties have failed to resolve their differences, the same had to be referred to Arbitration under Clause 14.3. It was held that there is a valid Arbitration Agreement between the parties as contained in the JVA, which the parties are required to adhere to and are bound by the same. In other words, if there is any dispute between the parties to the agreement arising out of or in relation to the subject matter of the said JVA, all such disputes and differences have to be adjudicated upon and decided through the process of Arbitration by appointing a mutually agreed Arbitrator. This Court observed as follows:-\n- 29 - \"Though the JVA may have been terminated and cancelled as stated but it was a valid JVA containing a valid arbitration agreement for settlement of disputes arising out of or in relation to the subject-matter of the JVA. The argument of the respondent that the disputes cannot be referred to the arbitration as the agreement is not in existence as of today is therefore devoid of merit.\" \nIn my opinion, the aforesaid observations are squarely applicable to the facts in the present case. The disputes that have arisen between the parties clearly pertain to the subject matter of the MOU. \n33. Even if, I accept the submission of Ms.Ahamadi that MOU was not extended beyond 31st of December, 2007, it would make little difference. \nSection 16(1)(a) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 provides that an arbitration clause which forms part of the contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. \nThe plain meaning of the aforesaid clause would tend to show that even on the termination of the agreement/contract, the arbitration agreement would still survive. It also seems to be the view taken by this Court in Everest Holdings Ltd. (supra). Accepting the submission of - 30 - Ms.Ahamadi that the arbitration clause came to an end as the MOU came to an end by efflux of time on 31st December, 2007 would lead to a very uncertain state of affairs, destroying the very efficacy of Section 16(1). The aforesaid section provides as under :\n\"16. Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction - (1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement, and for that purpose - (a) an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract; and (b) a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.\"\n34. The aforesaid provision has been enacted by the legislature keeping in mind the provisions contained in Article 16 of the UNCITRAL Model Law. The aforesaid Article reads as under :-\n\"Article 16 - Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction - (1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be - 31 - treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. \n(2)..............................................................\n(3)...............................................................\" \nUnder Section 16(1), the legislature makes it clear that while considering any objection with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement, the arbitration clause which formed part of the contract, has to be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. To ensure that there is no misunderstanding, Section 16(1)(b) further provides that even if the arbitral tribunal concludes that the contract is null and void, it should not result, as a matter of law, in an automatic invalidation of the arbitration clause. \nSection 16(1)(a) presumes the existence of a valid arbitration clause and mandates the same to be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. By virtue of Section 16(1)(b), it continues to be enforceable notwithstanding a declaration of the contract being null and void. In view of the provisions contained in Section 16(1) of the - 32 - Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, it would not be possible to accept the submission of Ms.Ahmadi that with the termination of the MOU on 31st December, 2007, the arbitration clause would also cease to exist. As noticed earlier, the disputes that have arisen between the parties clearly relate to the subject matter of the relationship between the parties which came into existence through the MOU. Clearly, therefore, the disputes raised by the petitioner needs to be referred to arbitration. Under the arbitration clause, a reference was to be made that the disputes were to be referred to a single arbitrator. Since the parties have failed to appoint an arbitrator under the agreed procedure, it is necessary for this Court to appoint the Arbitrator. \n35. In exercise of my powers under Section 11(4) and (6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read with Paragraph 2 of the Appointment of Arbitrator by the Chief Justice of India Scheme, 1996, I hereby appoint Hon.Mr.Justice R.V. Raveendran, R/o 8/2, Krishna Road, Basavangudi, Bangalore, Former Judge of the Supreme Court of India, as the Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes that have arisen - 33 - between the parties, on such terms and conditions as the learned Sole Arbitrator deems fit and proper. Undoubtedly, the learned Sole Arbitrator shall decide all the disputes arising between the parties without being influenced by any prima facie opinion expressed in this order, with regard to the respective claims of the parties. \n36. The registry is directed to communicate this order to the Sole Arbitrator to enable him to enter upon the reference and decide the matter as expeditiously as possible. \n37. The Arbitration Petition is accordingly disposed of. \n...............................J. [Surinder Singh Nijjar] New Delhi;\nNovember 25, 2011. \n- 34 - - 35 -",

instant letters patent appeal1 questions the correctness of lpa the judgement rendered by a learned single judge of the court dismissing a petition for rectification moved by the appellant and referable to section 57 of the trade marks act, 19992. 2. when we heard the matter on 10 july 2023, we took note of the preliminary objection which was raised at the behest of respondent no. 1 relating to the maintainability of the present lpa itself. admittedly, the question of maintainability of an lpa against a judgement rendered by a learned judge of the court on a petition under section 57 of the tma had directly fallen for consideration before a coordinate bench of the court in resilient innovations pvt. ltd. v. phonepe private limited & anr.3 and came to be answered in the affirmative. 3. as was noticed by us in our order of 10 july 2023, mr. nayar, mr. sethi and mr. krishnan, learned senior counsels appearing for respondent no. 1 had in unison submitted that the exposition of the legal position in resilient innovations was incorrect and merited reconsideration. the doubts so expressed essentially rested upon the provisions of the commercial courts act, 20154 and more particularly section 13 thereof, which restricts an intra-court appeal only to such orders as may be traceable to order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 19085 and section 37 of the arbitration and tma 2023:dhc:3426-db 2015 act code conciliation act, 19966. learned senior counsels had contended that although the issue of whether an intra-court appeal would be maintainable in light of section 13 of the 2015 act was directly raised before the court in resilient innovations, no findings or conclusions came to be returned in that respect. 4. on hearing learned senior counsels for parties on that date, we had desisted from expressing any prima facie opinion subject to submissions in this respect being heard in greater detail. pursuant to the liberty so reserved, learned senior counsels representing respondent no. 1 were thereafter heard at length on the question whether resilient innovations merited reconsideration or in case of doubt the matter liable to be referred for the consideration of a larger bench. in order to delineate the principal issue which arises, the submissions that were addressed on this score are noted hereinafter. 5. the respondent no. 1 would contend that section 2(1)(c) of the 2015 act, while defining the expression \"commercial dispute\" in terms of clause (xvii) includes a dispute arising out of intellectual property rights relating to registered and unregistered trade marks, copyright, patent, design, domain names, geographical indications and semiconductor integrated circuits. it was contended that the 2015 act must thus be understood as bringing within its ambit all commercial disputes as defined and which would include those arising out of intellectual property disputes. 1996 act 6. it was further submitted that in terms of section 7 of the 2015 act, all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes are ordained to be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of a high court. learned senior counsels also relied upon sections 4 and 5 of the aforesaid enactment to submit that the provisions aforenoted clearly mandate all commercial disputes, and which would necessarily include those falling within the scope of section 2(1)(c)(xvii), to be tried by the commercial division of the high court or a commercial court. 7. it was then submitted that in terms of section 13, an appeal is provisioned for against any judgement or order of a commercial court or by a judge sitting on the commercial division of a high court. however, and was pointed by learned senior counsels, such appeals would stand restricted to orders traceable either to order xliii of the code or section 37 of the 1996 act. it was the submission of learned senior counsels that an order rejecting a cancellation petition under section 57 of the tma clearly does not fall within the ambit of order xliii. it was thus submitted that in light of the plain language of section 13 coupled with the indubitable fact that the rejection of a cancellation petition would not fall within the ambit of order xliii of the code, would clearly lead to the inevitable conclusion that no further appeal would lie. 8. learned senior counsels also laid stress upon the provisions contained in section 13(2) of the 2015 act and which clearly proscribes an appeal being entertained against an order or decree of the commercial division or a commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions made in the said statute. according to learned senior counsels, section 13(2) in unambiguous terms overrides any provision contained in any other law including a provision for an lpa and thus embodying the legislative intent of the remedy of appeal being governed solely and exclusively by section 9. according to learned senior counsels, on a holistic examination of the aforesaid provisions it would thus be manifest that it is only when a learned judge presiding over the commercial division or the commercial court passes an order traceable to order xliii of the cpc or section 37 of the 1996 act that an appeal under section 13(2) would lie. according to learned senior counsels, section 13(2) reinforces the intent of the legislature to accord overriding effect to the provisions of the 2015 act over any provision to the contrary contained in any other law for the time being in force and extending to an lpa before the high court. 10. it was further submitted that the fact that the tma does not provision for an appeal against an order passed either by the registrar or the high court when petitioned under section 57 is liable to be viewed as evidence of no further appeal being envisaged. for this reason also, it was contended that the instant appeal would not be maintainable. 11. according to learned senior counsels, resilient innovations clearly fails to consider the aforesaid aspects and has thus incorrectly come to conclude that an lpa would be maintainable. according to the first respondent, the said conclusion is rendered wholly unsustainable when tested on the anvil of section 13 of the 2015 act. it was their submission that although section 13 was cited for the consideration of the division bench, it has clearly failed to examine the issue from that perspective and the judgment thus deserves to be revisited by a larger bench of the court. 12. we note that while resilient innovations may not have rendered any categorical findings on the maintainability of an appeal tested against the provisions of the 2015 act, the court while dealing with the principal question of maintainability of an lpa has rendered the following pertinent observations:\"25. at this stage we may note that an intra-court appeal in this court would, broadly, fall into four slots. [see c.s. aggarwal v state & ors. and jaswinder singh]. (i) first, appeals, which are available under the cpc. (ii) second, where the provision of appeal is made in a given statute. (iii) third, appeals available under section 10 of the dhc act, in respect of judgements which are rendered by a single judge in the exercise of ordinary original civil jurisdiction, as construed under section 5(2) of the very same act. thus, an appeal under this provision i.e., section 10(1) of the dhc act would be available where a single judge passes an order while exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction, which is otherwise not available under section 104 read with order 43 rule 1 of the cpc, as long as it meets the test of \"judgement\" as enunciated in babulal khimji. (iv) lastly, appeals available under clause 10 of the letters patent. 25.1 in the instant case, ripl has slotted its appeal in the last category i.e., clause 10 of the letters patent. the reason is quite clear; the first three slots would not apply as the learned single judge was not exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction; there is no provision in the cpc for maintaining this appeal and the 1999 (amended) tm act does not provide for an appeal. 25.2 ppl, on the other hand, has, inter alia, emphasized that because of the history of trademark legislation, the exclusion of an intra-court appeal provision is implied. 25.3 we tend to disagree. to our minds, there is nothing in the framework of the 1999 tm act which suggests that the legislature, by implication, sought to exclude one level of scrutiny that would be available by way of an intra-court appeal preferred under clause 10 of the letters patent. concededly, there is no provision in the 1999 (amended) tm act, which expressly excludes the applicability of the provision for appeal provided under clause 10 of the letters patent. 26. the question that then arises is: whether the fact that there is no provision with regard to the applicability of the provisions of cpc would make any difference to the conclusion that we have reached in the matter? 26.1 in this context, it is to be noticed that in the national sewing thread case, when the supreme court was called upon to rule on whether an intra-court appeal would lie under clause 15 of the letters patent, as applicable to the gujrat high court, the decision on the maintainability of the intra-court appeal did not turn on the provisions of sub-section (3) of section 76 of the1940 tm act, which provided that the provisions of the cpc would apply to the appeals preferred to the high court under the act. 26.2 clearly, in sub-section (3) of section 76 of the said act and in subsection (8) of section 109 of the 1958 tm act, provide for the application of the provisions of cpc. a plain reading of the said provisions would show that the cpc applies to appeals preferred with the high court under the respective statute. 26.3 an appeal under the letters patent (in this case, clause 10), however, is an appeal under a special law, and not an appeal under the act. therefore, the absence of a similar provision under the 1999 (amended) tm act would have, in our opinion, no impact on the sustainability of the instant appeals. 27. therefore, in our view, the first issue has to be answered in favour of ripl and against ppl. intra-court appeals would lie against the decision of the single judge rendered under section 57 of the 1999 (amended) tm act.\" 13. we respectfully concur with the exposition of the legal position as enunciated in the passages of that decision extracted hereinabove. however, and this we do acknowledge that learned senior counsels representing the respondent appear to be correct in their submission that resilient innovations fails to deal with the impact of section 13 and the consequential question of whether notwithstanding the limited avenue of an appeal created in terms thereof, an lpa remedy would still be available to be invoked. 14. however, the issue of the matter being referred to a larger bench would arise only if we, on a consideration of the submissions noticed above, come to the conclusion that the legal position as enunciated in resilient innovations is rendered unsustainable in light of the provisions of the 2015 act and in the context of the submissions advanced before us. we thus proceed to examine whether the remedy of an lpa as recognised to exist in resilient innovations is the correct position in law or whether a note of dissent is merited when viewed in the context of the provisions of the 2015 act. 15. having conferred our thoughtful consideration on the submissions addressed on this score, we find no justification to differ from the ultimate conclusions that came to be rendered by the court in resilient innovations for reasons which are set out hereinafter. this we do hold since the discussion which follows would establish that the lpa remedy with respect to a judgment or order rendered in section 57 proceedings by a judge constituting the commercial division or a commercial court survives and can be legally invoked notwithstanding section 13 and the other provisions of the 2015 act which were cited for our consideration. 16. undisputedly, disputes arising out of intellectual property rights fall within the meaning of a \"commercial dispute\" as defined in section 2(1)(c)(xvii) of the 2015 act. the constitution of commercial courts flows from section 3 of the 2015 act which reads as under:\"3. constitution of commercial courts.--(1) the state government may after consultation with the concerned high court, by notification, constitute such number of commercial courts at district level, as it may deem necessary for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on those courts under this act: provided that with respect to the high courts having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the state government may, after consultation with the concerned high court, by notification, constitute commercial courts at the district judge level: provided further that with respect to a territory over which the high courts have ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the state government may, by notification, specify such pecuniary value which shall not be less than three lakh rupees and not more than the pecuniary jurisdiction exercisable by the district courts, as it may consider necessary. (1-a) notwithstanding anything contained in this act, the state government may, after consultation with the concerned high court, by notification, specify such pecuniary value which shall not be less than three lakh rupees or such higher value, for whole or part of the state, as it may consider necessary. (2) the state government shall, after consultation, with the concerned high court specify, by notification, the local limits of the area to which the jurisdiction of a commercial court shall extend and may, from time to time, increase, reduce or alter such limits. (3) the state government may, with the concurrence of the chief justice of the high court appoint one or more persons having experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be the judge or judges, of a commercial court either at the level of district judge or a court below the level of a district judge.\" 17. sections 4 and 5 deal with the constitution of commercial divisions and commercial appellate divisions at the level of high courts. those provisions are extracted hereinbelow:\"4. constitution of commercial division of high court.--(1) in all high courts, having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the chief justice of the high court may, by order, constitute commercial division having one or more benches consisting of a single judge for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under this act. (2) the chief justice of the high court shall nominate such judges of the high court who have experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be judges of the commercial division. 5. constitution of commercial appellate division.--(1) after issuing notification under sub-section (1) of section 3 or order under subsection (1) of section 4, the chief justice of the concerned high court shall, by order, constitute commercial appellate division having one or more division benches for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it by the act. (2) the chief justice of the high court shall nominate such judges of the high court who have experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be judges of the commercial appellate division.\" 18. the jurisdiction of a commercial division of a high court is defined by section 7 in the following terms:\"7. jurisdiction of commercial divisions of high courts.-all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value filed in a high court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of that high court: provided that all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes, stipulated by an act to lie in a court not inferior to a district court, and filed or pending on the original side of the high court, shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the high court: provided further that all suits and applications transferred to the high court by virtue of sub-section (4) of section 22 of the designs act, 2000 (16 of 2000) or section 104 of the patents act, 1970 (39 of 1970) shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the high court in all the areas over which the high court exercises ordinary original civil jurisdiction.\" 19. section 8 bars a civil revision or a petition against any interlocutory order of a commercial court. it further prescribes that the only remedy available in this respect would be by way of an appeal subject to the provisions of section 13. section 8 reads thus:\"8. bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order.--notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the commercial court.\" 20. section 13 constructs the remedy of an appeal and reads as under:\"13. appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions.-(1) any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court below the level of a district judge may appeal to the commercial appellate court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order. (1-a) any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court at the level of district judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order: provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996).] (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\" 21. the remedy of rectification or cancellation stands enshrined in section 57 of the tma and is extracted hereinbelow:\"57. power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register.--(1) on application made in the prescribed manner to the high court or to the registrar by any person aggrieved, the registrar or the high court, as the case may be, may make such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registration of a trade mark on the ground of any contravention, or failure to observe a condition entered on the register in relation thereto. (2) any person aggrieved by the absence or omission from the register of any entry, or by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause, or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register, or by any error or defect in any entry in the register, may apply in the prescribed manner to the high court or to the registrar, and the registrar or the high court, as the case may be, may make such order for making, expunging or varying the entry as it may think fit. (3) the registrar or the high court, as the case may be, may in any proceeding under this section decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection with the rectification of the register. (4) the registrar or the high court, as the case may be, of its own motion, may, after giving notice in the prescribed manner to the parties concerned and after giving them an opportunity of being heard, make any order referred to in sub-section (1) or subsection (2). (5) any order of the high court rectifying the register shall direct that notice of the rectification shall be served upon the registrar in the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the register accordingly.\" 22. section 91 of the tma as it stands post its amendment and the passing of the tribunal reforms act, 20217 is couched in the following words:\"91. appeals to high court. --(1) any person aggrieved by an order or decision of the registrar under this act, or the rules made thereunder may prefer an appeal to the high court within three months from the date on which the order or decision sought to be appealed against is communicated to such person preferring the appeal. (2) no appeal shall be admitted if it is preferred after the expiry of the period specified under sub-section (1): provided that an appeal may be admitted after the expiry of the period specified therefor, if the appellant satisfies the high court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within the specified period.\" (3) an appeal to the high court shall be in the prescribed form and shall be verified in the prescribed manner and shall be tra accompanied by a copy of the order or decision appealed against and by such fees as may be prescribed.\" 23. of equal significance are the provisions enshrined in sections 134 and 135 of the tma and since those would have a bearing on the issues which stand raised, the same are extracted hereunder:\"134. suit for infringement, etc., to be instituted before district court.-(1) no suit-(a) for the infringement of a registered trade mark; or (b) relating to any right in a registered trade mark; or (c) for passing off arising out of the use by the defendant of any trade mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff‟s trade mark, whether registered or unregistered, shall be instituted in any court inferior to a district court having jurisdiction to try the suit. (2) for the purpose of clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (1), a \"district court having jurisdiction\" shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) or any other law for the time being in force, include a district court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, at the time of the institution of the suit or other proceeding, the person instituting the suit or proceeding, or, where there are more than one such persons any of them, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain. explanation.--for the purposes of sub-section (2), \"person\" includes the registered proprietor and the registered user. 135. relief in suits for infringement or for passing off.-(1) the relief which a court may grant in any suit for infringement or for passing off referred to in section 134 includes injunction (subject to such terms, if any, as the court thinks fit) and at the option of the plaintiff, either damages or an account of profits, together with or without any order for the delivery-up of the infringing labels and marks for destruction or erasure. (2) the order of injunction under sub-section (1) may include an ex parte injunction or any interlocutory order for any of the following matters, namely:-(a) for discovery of documents; (b) preserving of infringing goods, documents or other evidence which are related to the subject-matter of the suit; (c) restraining the defendant from disposing of or dealing with his assets in a manner which may adversely affect plaintiff‟s ability to recover damages, costs or other pecuniary remedies which may be finally awarded to the plaintiff. (3) notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the court shall not grant relief by way of damages (other than nominal damages) or on account of profits in any case-(a) where in a suit for infringement of a trade mark, the infringement complained of is in relation to a certification trade mark or collective mark; or (b) where in a suit for infringement the defendant satisfies the court-(i) that at the time he commenced to use the trade mark complained of in the suit, he was unaware and had no reasonable ground for believing that the trade mark of the plaintiff was on the register or that the plaintiff was a registered user using by way of permitted use; and (ii) that when he became aware of the existence and nature of the plaintiff‟s right in the trade mark, he forthwith ceased to use the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which it was registered; or (c) where in a suit for passing off, the defendant satisfies the court-(i) that at the time he commenced to use the trade mark complained of in the suit, he was unaware and had no reasonable ground for believing that the trade mark for the plaintiff was in use; and (ii) that when he became aware of the existence and nature of the plaintiff‟s trade mark he forthwith ceased to use the trade mark complained of.\" 24. section 3 of the 2015 act provides that the state government may, with the consultation of the concerned high court, constitute such number of commercial courts at the district level as may be deemed necessary. the first proviso to section 3 deals with those courts which exercise ordinary original civil jurisdiction and provides for the constitution of commercial courts at the district level. the second proviso then proceeds to deal with high courts which exercise ordinary original civil jurisdiction with respect to a particular territory and provides that the state government may specify the pecuniary limits which may govern the jurisdiction exercisable by district courts functioning under the superintendence of such a high court. section 4 stipulates that the chief justice of a high court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction may by order constitute a commercial division comprising of one or more benches. section 5 envisages the creation of a commercial appellate division. in terms of section 6 thereof, a commercial court so constituted may exercise jurisdiction over all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes. section 7 provides for the transfer of all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes pending in a high court exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction to be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of that court. 25. the 2015 act thus on a foundational plane, creates a hierarchy of commercial courts at the district level as well as the creation of a commercial division at the level of those high courts which exercise ordinary original civil jurisdiction. such high courts are also obliged to create a commercial appellate division. both the commercial division at the level of a high court and commercial courts at the district level thus stand bestowed with the jurisdiction to decide suits and applications pertaining to commercial disputes which in turn are enumerated in section 2(1)(c) of the 2015 act. 26. as would be evident from a reading of the aforenoted provisions, the commercial division of a high court is created in those high courts which were, on the appointed date, exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction. the commercial division of a high court comes into being only in situations where that high court stood vested with and was exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction prior to the enforcement of the 2015 act. this position clearly emerges upon a conjoint reading of section 3, its first proviso and section 4 of the 2015 act. the commercial court or the commercial division thus stands created at the district level and in certain high courts to try commercial disputes. however, what becomes important to note is that the aforenoted categories of courts are those which were, prior to the promulgation of the 2015 act, exercising \"ordinary original civil jurisdiction\". the 2015 act essentially creates a distinct hierarchy for courts charged with dealing with commercial disputes. by virtue of the provisions of the 2015 act, commercial disputes which earlier could have been tried by any court at the district level or a high court vested with ordinary original civil jurisdiction must now be placed either before commercial courts or the commercial division depending upon the pecuniary limits that prevail. the legislation also envisages the creation of a special wing in the shape of a commercial division in high courts which were otherwise exercising an ordinary original civil jurisdiction prior to the promulgation of the 2015 act. 27. what however needs to be borne in mind is the nature of jurisdiction which a judge on the commercial division exercises while entertaining a petition under section 57 of the tma. section 57 enables any aggrieved person to move either the high court or the registrar for cancellation or variation of a trade mark which has come to be registered. the contemporaneous power which is conferred on a high court under section 57 is one which stands specifically invested in that court by virtue of the aforesaid provision of the tma. the power so conferred on the high court is thus traceable not to its existing ordinary original civil jurisdiction but section 57 of the tma. the power of rectification or cancellation is not traceable to an inherent jurisdiction vesting in a judge as part of the commercial division but one which stands created by section 57 of the tma. the authority to entertain a petition for cancellation or rectification is thus not one which is traceable to the jurisdiction otherwise recognised to inhere in the commercial division of a high court but one which owes its basis to section 57 of the tma. 28. consequently, when the high court entertains a petition with reference to section 57 of the tma, it does so solely by virtue of the avenue created by the tma as opposed to the powers otherwise exercisable by that high court under its ordinary original civil jurisdiction. what thus needs to be appreciated and understood is the nature of the power which the commercial division exercises when dealing with such a petition. we are of the firm opinion that the high court while acting through its commercial division is thus not wielding a power which is traceable to its ordinary original civil jurisdiction but one which owes its genesis to a statutory enactment. it is the tma which designates and clothes the commercial division of a high court with the authority to decide a petition traceable to section 57. 29. the 2015 act, on the other hand, aims at creating a special adjudicatory structure to deal with suits or applications relating to a commercial dispute. however, while proceeding to do so it identifies courts which were otherwise exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction. while proceeding to designate such courts and assigning that jurisdiction it does not seek to deprive or denude the powers that are otherwise conferred on such judicial institutions independently. the various sections of the 2015 act are thus liable to be interpreted as regulating the ordinary original civil jurisdiction exercisable by those courts and not extending to, controlling or eclipsing the special jurisdiction or authority that may otherwise be statutorily conferred on such judicial institutions. that jurisdiction or authority is neither possessed nor exercised by those courts by virtue of the powers otherwise inhering in them. the above conclusions are further fortified when one views section 13(1a) which too speaks of a judgment or order rendered by a commercial court exercising \"original civil jurisdiction\". 30. the distinction that is liable to be acknowledged as existing when a court exercises its original civil jurisdiction and when it assumes jurisdiction to decide by virtue of an independent statutory conferral of power is further evident when one contrasts section 57 with section 134 of the tma. as would be evident from a reading of section 57, a person aggrieved is entitled to institute proceedings for cancellation or variation of a registered trade mark either before the registrar or the high court. the high court here is not so designated by virtue of it being one which is otherwise vested with original civil jurisdiction. the section 57 remedy would thus be available to be exercised by all high courts generally. section 134 on the other hand speaks of suits for infringement or passing off being instituted before a court which is not inferior to a \"district court\". the meaning of the phrase \"district court\" would have to be gathered from the code which defines it in section 2(4) to mean either the principal civil court of original jurisdiction or the high court. thus, while an appeal against a judgment or order passed by a commercial court or a judge sitting on the commercial division on a suit for infringement or passing off would be regulated by section 13 of the 2015 act, any order or judgment rendered which is not traceable to the exercise of original jurisdiction would not. the power and authority exercised by the commercial division of a high court in terms of section 57 thus cannot possibly be recognised as being one traceable to its original jurisdiction. 31. we thus come to the firm conclusion that section 13 while speaking of appeals is restricted to orders passed by such courts in exercise of their ordinary original civil jurisdiction. it does not regulate or control orders passed by such courts by virtue of jurisdiction conferred by a special legislation. a legislation may choose to confer an adjudicatory function on any judicial institution. the conferral of such adjudicatory functions is not in recognition of the plenary power of such a court but the express will of the legislature to designate a judicial authority with the power to adjudicate upon a special genre of a lis. section 57 clearly represents one such legislative measure. the said provision is not one which could be recognised to be otherwise existing or ordinarily exercisable by a commercial court or a commercial division but for the conferral of jurisdiction by that provision. at the cost of repetition, it must thus be observed that the authority to rule on a petition for cancellation owes its genesis not to a power ordinarily inhering or exercisable by such a court but by virtue of a statutory conferment. it is this facet which is critical and determinative of the question that stands raised. 32. the respondent no. 1 would contend that the appellate power as recognised in section 13 must regulate all powers that a commercial court or the commercial division may exercise. however, that submission fails to consider that a commercial court or the commercial division may perform a multifunctional role. that multifaceted role may include not just an exercise of its ordinary and plenary powers but also those which may be bestowed upon those courts independently by statute. the special powers which such a commercial court or commercial division may discharge cannot, therefore, be equated to its \"ordinary original civil jurisdiction\". 33. what section 13 purports and seeks to control are those judgments or orders that may be rendered by the commercial court or the commercial division in exercise of their \"ordinary original civil jurisdiction\". the bar of the lpa remedy in terms of section 13(2) would consequently apply only in respect of judgments or orders rendered by a commercial court or the commercial division in exercise of their ordinary original civil jurisdiction. 34. we also find merit in the submission of mr. sibal who contended that if the interpretation advocated by the first respondent were to be accepted, it would result in various high courts which otherwise may not be exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction from being excluded from the ambit of section 57 of the tma. this too lends credence to the view that we have expressed hereinabove, namely, of the section 57 power being separate and distinct from the ordinary original civil jurisdiction exercised by high courts. 35. for the purposes of elucidating the nature of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction which stands bestowed upon this high court, we deem it apposite to refer to the following passages from the decision of the supreme court in grieshim gmbh vs. goyal mg gases private limited8. the supreme court in grieshim was considering the meaning to be ascribed to the phrase \"district court\" as appearing in section 44a of the 1996 act and whether it would include this high court in light of the pecuniary limits prescribed. answering the aforesaid question the supreme court observed thus:\"22. the question that emerges for our consideration is whether the high court of delhi in exercise of its original jurisdiction is a competent court to entertain a petition for executing a money decree (in excess of rs 20 lakhs) of a foreign court which is notified as a superior court of reciprocating territory under section 44-a of the code. **** **** **** 24.5. section 5, delhi high court act, 1966 -\"jurisdiction of high court of delhi\" 5. jurisdiction of high court of delhi.--(1) the high court of delhi shall have, in respect of the territories for the time being included in the union territory of delhi, all such original, appellate and other jurisdiction as, under the law in force immediately before the appointed day, is exercisable in respect of the said territories by the high court of punjab. (2022) 11 scc 549 (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, the high court of delhi shall also have in respect of the said territories ordinary original civil jurisdiction in every suit the value of which exceeds rupees twenty lakhs.\" 25. the expression \"district\" is defined under section 2(4) of the code and the term \"district court\" referred under section 44-a of the code although not defined, but on conjoint reading of the provision makes it clear that it refers to the local limits of the jurisdiction of a principal civil court of original jurisdiction (provisions of the code called a \"district court\") and it includes the local limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of a high court and it is not disputed that principal civil court of original jurisdiction is normally a district court (with whatever change in the nomenclature) and the high courts in india exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction are not too many, but where there is a split jurisdiction based on its pecuniary value, notified from time-to-time, the district court or the high court in its ordinary original civil jurisdiction is competent to exercise power for execution of decree, including money decree of the foreign court of reciprocating jurisdiction, provided other conditions are complied with as contemplated under section 44-a of the code. 26. section 44-a of the code provides for execution of decrees passed by the foreign courts in reciprocating territories. it, inter alia, stipulates that where a certified copy of a decree of any of the superior court of any reciprocating territory has been filed in a district court, the decree may be executed in india as if it had been passed by a district court. together with the certified copy of the decree, a certificate from such superior court is to be filed stating the extent, if any, to which the decree has been satisfied or adjusted. such a certificate is the conclusive proof of the extent of such satisfaction or adjustment. sub-section (3) of section 44-a of the code further lays down that provisions of section 47 of the code shall apply to such execution proceedings and the court can refuse execution of any such decree, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the decree falls within any of the exceptions specified in clauses (a) to (f) in section 13 of the code. 27. the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court is always exercised, based on pecuniary limits. it would be impossible to read into section 44-a of the code that even though the pecuniary jurisdiction of civil court is restricted, still for the purpose of execution of a foreign decree, it becomes the district court in respect to those matters which fall within the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court and the expression \"district\" defined under section 2(4) of the code will have to be given its true effect. to read the expression \"district court\" in section 44-a for execution of foreign decree, it will be construed to be a court holding ordinary original civil jurisdiction in terms of its pecuniary limits as being notified under section 5(2) of the 1966 act. 28. it leaves no manner of doubt that once the pecuniary jurisdiction at the given point of time exceeded rs 20 lakhs as notified by the high court under section 5(2) of the 1966 act (later vide notification dated 10-8-2015 (w.e.f. 26-10-2015) pecuniary limits has been revised to rs 2 crores), it is the high court of delhi which holds its exclusive jurisdiction as ordinary original civil jurisdiction to execute a foreign decree under section 44-a of the code and it goes without saying that execution always is in continuation of the proceedings. 29. section 24 of the punjab courts act, 1918, of which the division bench has put its emphasis, which is applicable to delhi, the court of district judge would be the principal civil court of original jurisdiction. under section 5(1) of the 1966 act, the high court of delhi exercises all such original, appellate and the other jurisdiction as was exercisable by the high court of punjab in the union territory of delhi. then, there is section 5(2) of the 1966 act which starts with a non obstante clause which empowers the high court of delhi to exercise its ordinary original civil jurisdiction in every suit where the pecuniary value exceeds, as being notified by the competent authority and thus, the high court of delhi indeed holds original civil jurisdiction in a suit where the value exceeds its pecuniary limits and if section 24 of the punjab courts act, 1918 is read with section 5(2) of the 1966 act, it is quite clear that certain jurisdiction has been taken away from the district court and conferred with the high court of delhi and this original civil jurisdiction is only in respect to the suits where the pecuniary limit exceeds as notified by the authority under section 5(2) of the 1966 act and that would make the high court of delhi, the principal court of original civil jurisdiction, for all practical purposes. 30. the division bench has proceeded on the basis of the expression \"district court\", as being referred under section 44-a of the code but it has not taken into consideration the other relevant provisions of which a reference has been made by us while coming to the conclusion that the expression \"district\" as defined under section 2(4) of the code only lays down the limits of the jurisdiction of the principal civil court of original jurisdiction and that includes the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court and once the pecuniary jurisdiction exceeds as being notified under the relevant statute, the jurisdiction vests exclusively with the high court as an ordinary original civil jurisdiction for execution of a foreign decree under section 44-a subject to the just objections which are available to the parties judgment-debtor as envisaged under section 13 of the code.\" 36. of greater significance is the decision of the supreme court in raja soap factory vs. s.p. shantaraj & others9. the issue which arose there was whether the high court of mysore would have the jurisdiction to exercise powers under section 105 of the trade and merchandise marks act, 1958 in the absence of it being enabled to exercise original jurisdiction and thus not falling within the meaning of a district court as defined by that statute. it becomes pertinent to note that the aforesaid enactment provided that the expression \"district court\" would have the same meaning as assigned to that phrase under the code. dealing with the aforesaid question, the supreme court pertinently observed as follows:\"4. exercise of jurisdiction by the high court of mysore is governed by mysore act 5 of 1962. the act is purely a regulatory act enacted for regulating the business and exercise of the powers of the high court in relation to the administration of justice: it (1965) 2 scr 800 does not purport to confer upon the high court any jurisdiction original or appellate. it is true that by section 12 of the mysore high court act 1 of 1884 enacted by the maharaja of mysore to amend the constitution of the high court of mysore, and to provide for the administration of justice by that court, the government of mysore was authorised by notification to invest the high court with ordinary original civil jurisdiction of a district court in all suits of a civil nature exercisable within such local limits as the government may from time to time declare and appoint in that behalf. but section 12 of the mysore act 1 of 1884 has been repealed by section 14 of mysore act 5 of 1962. 5. the high court of mysore is by its constitution primarily a court exercising appellate jurisdiction: it is competent to exercise original jurisdiction only in those matters in respect of which by special acts it has been specifically invested with jurisdiction. the high court is competent to exercise original jurisdiction under section 105 of the trade and merchandise marks act 43 of 1958 if it is invested with the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of a district court, and not otherwise, and the high court of mysore not being invested by any statute of under its constitution with that jurisdiction was incompetent to entertain a passing off action. 6. but it was urged that in a state the high court is at the apex of the hierarchy of civil courts and has all the powers which the subordinate courts may exercise, and it is competent to entertain all actions as a court of original jurisdiction which may lie in any court in the state. for this exalted claim, there is no warrant in our jurisprudence. jurisdiction of a court means the extent of the authority of a court to administer justice prescribed with reference to the subject-matter, pecuniary value and local limits. barring cases in which jurisdiction is expressly conferred upon it by special statutes, e.g. the companies act; the banking companies act, the high court of mysore exercises appellate jurisdiction alone. as a court of appeal it undoubtedly stands at the apex within the state, but on that account it does not stand invested with original jurisdiction in matters not expressly declared within its cognizance.\" 37. the aforenoted two decisions thus clearly highlight the distinction which must be acknowledged to exist between the powers exercised by a court while exercising its ordinary original jurisdiction as distinguished from a power which is specifically conveyed upon a judicial institution by statute. the learned single judge, as has been found by us above, was not exercising an original jurisdiction which inheres in the court but one which stands entrusted to it by the tma. it is this aspect which is of vital import and leads us to the conclusion that the lpa remedy is not ousted by section 13 of the 2015 act. 38. in view of the aforesaid conclusions, we find no reason to refer resilient innovations for the consideration of a larger bench. notwithstanding the said decision having omitted to deal with the impact of section 13 or the other provisions of the 2015 act, its ultimate conclusions would hold good for reasons assigned by us in the preceding parts of this order. accordingly, and for all the aforesaid reasons, the preliminary objection to the maintainability of the present appeal stands negatived. prima facie merits 39. as noticed hereinabove, the present appeal questions the judgement rendered by a learned single judge dismissing an application under section 57 of the tma. the appellant who was the original petitioner has sought removal of the mark \"hero group\" from the register of trademarks held by respondent no. 1 under class 10 for surgical, medical, dental and veterinary devices, instruments and apparatus (including artificial limbs, eyes and teeth) components, fittings, accessories and peripherals thereof, orthopaedic articles, stretchers, suture materials, inhalers, syringes, feeding bottles. 40. the dispute itself emanates from a family settlement agreement10 and a trade mark and name agreement11 which was executed on 20 may 2010 and in terms of which the businesses of the munjal group were divided in four family groups titled f1 family group, f2 family group, f3 family group and f4 family group. the appellant constitutes the f1 family group while respondent no. 1 represents the f3 family group. 41. puja investments private limited, the erstwhile avatar of respondent no.1 is stated to have applied for registration of the \"hero group\" mark in its favour on 01 november 2010. the respondent no.1 claimed itself to be the proprietor of the said trademark with a continuous use since 20 may 2010 in respect of medical products. the said application was accepted and advertised on 22 february 2016 in the trade marks journal and since registration was not opposed, it came to be registered in favour of respondent no. 1 on 30 august 2016, with effect from 01 november 2010. 42. the petition under section 57 came to be originally instituted before the intellectual property appellate board12, and thereafter came to be transferred to this court by virtue of the tra. the fsa tmna ipab appellant questions the decision rendered on that petition principally on the following grounds. 43. mr. sibal, learned senior counsel has referred to paragraph i of the fsa which sets out the broad principles underlying the settlement agreement as under:\"i. the broad principles to arrive at the family settlement arrangement were based on the premise that as far as possible the family member managing the business shall continue to run that business and similarly the residential houses occupied by a family member shall belong to that family member and all inter se loans and advances to be paid off/ adjusted and any guarantees provided to external authorities by a family group for the benefit of a business being managed by a member of another family group shall also be replaced by guarantee of that family group.\" 44. our attention was also invited to clauses 1.2 and 1.4 of the fsa which read as follows:\"1.2 for the purposes of separation of the business and property interests of the munjal group among the four distinct family groups, each family group and respective munjal family members have agreed to the cessation of joint ownership and control over business and property interests of munjal group and establishment of sole ownership, management ·and control of designated family group as more particularly set out in schedule 7 hereto. *** *** *** 1.4 the four family groups, pursuant to their desire to attain lasting peace amongst each of the family groups have by consensus and mutual agreement arrived at the four blocks listed in schedule 7, as realigned and rearranged (\"packages\"). the four family groups acknowledge and confirm that these four packages constitute fair allocation of munjal group entities and properties between the four family groups and their respective munjal family members\" 45. for the purposes of effectuating the broad terms of the family arrangement which stood embodied in the fsa, the four groups also entered into a tmna on 20 may 2010. in order to appreciate the challenge which stands raised in this appeal, it would be relevant to take note of the following definitions of various expressions used and appearing in the tmna:\"1.1.2 \"bicycle/automotive products\" means bicycles, tricycles, all parts, fittings & accessories thereof (including bicycle and tricycles tyres and tubes), and chassis and transmission of all kinds of vehicles ·and automotives. *** *** *** 1.1.5 \"bicycle/automotive trade marks\" means the trademark and name hero, with or without suffixes, registered or unregistered, owned and or used upon or in relation to or in connection with the bicycle/automotive products and services as defied herein. 1.1.6 \"f1 family group product and services\" means: a. existing trading business for exports; b. import in india of two wheeler electric vehicles & parts thereof and bicycle parts; c. electric/environment friendly vehicles (ie. non fuel land vehicles) and their components, and their related infrastructure; d. projects, plants & equipment, components in the field of solar energy, wind energy and other renewable energy; and e. medical products & lifestyle care equipment for hospitals, rehabilitation and homes. 1.1.7 \"f1 family group trade marks\" means: a. the trademark hero exports, registered or unregistered, owned and/or used upon or in relation to or in connection with the trading business of m/s hero exports for exports relating to sale, marketing of its trading items, other than those items covered in clause 1.1.7(d) below, and import in india of two wheeler electric vehicles & parts thereof and bicycle parts; b. the trademark hero electric, registered or unregistered, owned and/or used upon or in relation to or in connection with the electric/environment friendly vehicles (i.e. non fuel land vehicles) and components, and related infrastructure; c. the trademark hero eco, registered or unregistered, owned and/or used upon or in relation to or in connection with the business relating to projects, plants & equipment, components in the field of solar energy, wind energy and other renewable energy, and medical products & lifestyle care equipment for hospitals, rehabilitation & homes; and d. the trademark hero registered or unregistered and used for export of bicycles and bicycle parts by f1 family group for all territories, other than usa, russia, australia, new zealand, japan and european union (except uk, germany & turkey), which exclusively are retained by f4 family group. 1.1.8 \"other products and services\" means all types of goods and services currently manufactured, sold/marketed, distributed, offered and rendered by the parties and/or its affiliates, group companies, joint venture companies and subsidiary companies except for the bicycle/automotive products and services and f1 family group products and services as defined hereinabove; 1.1.9 \"other products and services trade marks\" means the trade mark and name hero, with or without suffixes registered or unregistered, owned and/or used upon or in relation to, or in connection with the other products and services as defined hereinabove. 1.1.10 \"future products and services\" means all goods and/or services which are not currently manufactured, sold/marketed, distributed, offered and rendered by the parties and/or their affiliates, group companies, joint venture companies and subsidiary companies. 1.1.11 \"future products and services trade marks\" means the trade mark and name hero with or without suffixes, registered or unregistered, to be owned and/or used upon or in relation to or in connection with future products and services as defined hereinabove.\" 46. the division of the various trademarks to be used by respective business groups was then elaborately set out in clause 2 which reads as under:\"2. understanding between the parties the parties fully understand and agree that the ownership and use of the trade mark and the name hero heretofore shall be in accordance with the following terms: (i) f4 family group shall have the exclusive right of ownership and use over bicycle/automotive trademarks; (ii) f1 family group shall have the exclusive right of ownership and use over f1 family group trade marks; (iii) f3 family group shall have the exclusive right of ownership and use over other products and services trade marks and future products and services trademarks; (iv) the parties agree that usage of trademarks and name „hero‟ upon, or in relation to or in connection with the future products and services by f4 family group and the decision to use shall be regulated as follows: a. brij mohanji and om prakashji shall jointly agree in writing on the manner and scope of usage by f4 family group of the hero trademark and name in relation to or in connection with the future products and services; b. in the unlikely event upon the demise of either brij mohanji or om prakashji or both of them, the right to decide on all such usage of trademark and name hero upon or in relation to or in connection with the future products and services shall absolutely and automatically vest with the f3 family group exclusively and for perpetuity; c. as outlined in clause 2 (iii) above and for the purposes of clarity and subject to the limited right of f4 family group under clause 2(iv)(a), all future products and services trademarks shall be owned and controlled by the f3 family group and the f3 family group shall take all reasonable and expedient steps to procure the filing and registration of all intellectual property rights under the applicable law for matter covered under clause 2(iii) above in the name of f3 family group exclusively and for perpetuity. (v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, f3 family group shall have the exclusive and perpetual right to own and use the legend „hero group‟ with or without devices upon or in relation to all other products and services and future products and services; (vi) f1 family group may, subject to the provisions of this agreement, use the names as agreed for entity name/firm name/company name in clause 3.5, towards procuring registration of and undertaking brand advertising of f1 family group trademarks in electronic media, internet, email server and domain names. (vii) f4 family group may, subject to the provisions of this agreement, use the names as agreed for entity name/firm name/company name in clause 3.6, towards procuring registration of and undertaking brand advertising of f4 family group trademarks in electronic media, internet, email server and domain names. (viii) for avoidance of doubt, each party hereby agrees that the only restriction on use of trademark and name will be for the products and services with the same name, monogram and trademark. for purpose of illustration, only f4 family group shall be entitled to engage in bicycle/automotive products and services with the trade mark and name hero, and the other three family groups may engage in the business of bicycle/automotive products and services without using the trademark and name hero, with or without prefixes or suffixes. it is further agreed that the f1 family group and f3 family group will use different monograms than the monogram being currently used by m/s hero cycles limited, a company owned by the f4 family group. (ix) all residuary rights relating to or in connection with the trademark and name hero either registered or pending registration or otherwise shall, except as stated hereinabove, exclusively vest with f3 family group for perpetuity, including but not limited to electronic media, internet, email server, domain names etc. (x) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, f1 family group and f4 family group shall have the right of ownership and use of trade mark and name for the businesses as agreed in this agreement only so long as such respective businesses are minimum 26% owned by f1 family group and f4 family group as the case may be. (xi) the confirming party acknowledges and confirms that it is jointly and severally liable with f4 family group in respect of the obligations of f4 family group under this agreement.\" 47. mr. sibal submitted that in terms of clause 2, the appellant constituting the f1 family group was accorded exclusive right of ownership and use over the f1 family group trade marks. it was pointed out that the f1 family group trade marks were referable to f1 family group product and services and which was defined to extend to medical products and lifestyle care equipment for hospitals, rehabilitation and homes. it was further emphasised that the tmna while defining \"other products and services\" had specifically excluded f1 family group products and services therefrom. similarly, mr. sibal pointed out that the tmna while defining \"other products and services trade marks\" had linked the mark and name \"hero\" to other products and services as defined. 48. the expression \"future product and services\" was explained in clause 1.1.10 to mean all goods or services which were not being currently manufactured, sold/marketed, distributed, offered and rendered by parties and/or their affiliates, group companies, joint venture companies and subsidiary companies. according to mr. sibal, clause 2 of the tmna had conferred exclusive ownership rights upon the f3 family group over other products and services trade marks as well as future products and service trade marks. 49. according to mr. sibal, clause 2(iii) when read together with clauses 1.1.6 and 1.1.7 of the tmna would clearly lead one to the inevitable conclusion that the f3 family group stood restrained from using the trademark in relation to medical products and lifestyle care equipment. the exclusion in this respect according to mr. sibal stands reiterated in clause 1.1.8 of the tmna. 50. it was further submitted that the learned single judge has clearly erred and misconstrued the provisions of the fsa and the tmna in holding otherwise. mr. sibal has also questioned the correctness of the view expressed by the learned single judge who while construing the expression \"currently manufactured\" has come to conclude of it being understood as referring to goods and services which were actually being manufactured on 20 may 2010. 51. according to mr sibal, the learned single judge has clearly erred in holding that the business realignment agreement13 also does not establish that the appellants were engaged in the manufacture of medical products on 20 may 2010. according to learned senior counsel, the emphasis laid on the phrase \"currently manufactured\" in any case pales into insignificance when one views the express language and intent underlying clauses 1.1.6 and 1.1.7 of the tmna. 52. it was further urged that the tmna conferred rights upon the f3 family group only in respect of other products and services and future products and services. according to mr. sibal, those provisions when read in conjunction with the other clauses of the tmna would clearly establish that the f3 family group could not have used the trademark in question with respect to medical products and services. 53. the aforesaid contentions were refuted by mr. sethi and mr. krishnan, learned senior counsels appearing for respondent no. 1, who bra submitted that a close reading of clause 1.1.7 of the tmna would establish that the appellants were granted exclusivity only in respect of the trade marks \"hero exports\", \"hero electric\", \"hero eco\" and \"hero\" when used in connection with the export of bicycles and bicycles parts. tested in light of the said clause, the respondents would contend that the appellant could have claimed a right only in respect of hero eco insofar as medical equipment is concerned. 54. according to learned senior counsels, the division between the four family groups was essentially sought to be effected bearing in mind the distinct streams of business which were to be pursued. it was submitted that clause 1.1.10 of the tmna clearly accorded a right upon respondent no. 1 to seek registration of the trademark in question since medical products and services did not fall within the ambit of \"currently manufactured\". 55. it was submitted that clause 1.1.11 conferred an unequivocal right upon the f3 family group to use the trade mark \"hero\", with or without suffixes in connection with all future products and services. it was additionally urged that regard must also be had to the long standing and uncontested position of the f3 family group to use the mark in question. it was submitted that in light of the aforesaid, the learned single judge had correctly come to the conclusion that the petition for cancellation was liable to be dismissed. 56. having considered the rival submissions addressed and noticed above, we prima facie find that the issues that stand raised would warrant a more detailed consideration of the various provisions of the fsa and the tmna. prima facie, the view taken in the impugned judgement if upheld would amount to stultifying the effect of clauses 1.1.6 and 1.1.8 read together with the other provisions of the tmna. the view expressed by the learned single judge also prima facie fails to correctly appreciate the import of the bra, which clearly acknowledged manufacturing activity of medical products being undertaken by the f1 family group. we further note that insofar as the question of a belated challenge is concerned, the learned single judge has in fact found in favour of the appellant. we were also informed of identical questions forming subject matter of arbitral proceedings as well as independent petitions for cancellation pending before this court. 57. consequently, let notice issue on the instant appeal. the represented respondents may file a reply within a period of three weeks from today. the petitioner shall have a week thereafter to file a rejoinder affidavit. 58. let the matter be called again on 05.09.2023 in the category of \"end of board\" matters. cm appl. 21725/2023(stay) 59. mr. sibal, learned senior counsel has prayed for the impugned judgement being placed in abeyance, bearing in mind the impact that it may have on the ongoing arbitration proceedings as well as the various rectification petitions which are pending consideration before this court. it was submitted that unless orders in terms as prayed for are granted, the appellant would be seriously prejudiced with the arbitral tribunal14 being bound by the impugned decision and the cancellation petitions which are presently pending disposal also being adversely impacted. 60. the prayer as made is opposed by learned senior counsels appearing for the first respondent who submitted that the cancellation petition had been filed belatedly and long after the grant of the registration in their favour. it was further pointed out that the trademark itself came to be registered without any opposition having been raised by the appellant here. 61. it was submitted that from the transcripts of the proceedings which ensued before the at, the appellant itself had contended that the decision impugned was distinguishable and would have no impact on the proceedings. in view of the above, it was submitted that it would not be open for the appellant to now assert that the impugned order would prejudice its rights and contentions. 62. as was noticed by us hereinabove, the issue of a delayed challenge has already been ruled upon by the learned single judge in favour of the appellant. that issue thus need not detain us at this stage. at however, we do find that not only are arbitration proceedings currently being pursued before the at, there are various rectification petitions pending consideration before this court. the rights of respective parties as asserted to flow from the fsa and the tmna constitutes one of the central subjects of contestation of those proceedings. 63. while it may be true that the appellant may have urged before the at that the impugned judgement is distinguishable, the same clearly appears to be a position that was struck prior to the present appeal being taken up for consideration. in any case, the transcript of proceedings equally establish that the impugned judgment is being heavily relied upon and pressed into aid by respondent no. 1. this clearly gives rise to an anomalous situation with parties faced with the judgment of the learned single judge on the one side and the present appeal on the other. 64. we also weigh in consideration that in light of the serious dispute that exists between the parties and the competing interpretations of the fsa and tmna which are canvassed, the operation of the impugned judgment would indubitably impact pending cancellation proceedings. we also cannot discount the possibility of conflicting opinions being rendered in those proceedings. 65. while it is true that even if the impugned judgement were to be stayed, it would neither revive the cancellation petition nor adversely impact the subsisting registration of the trademark in favour of the respondent no.1, in order to balance the interests of parties as well as to ensure that the impugned judgement does not adversely impact the rights and contentions of the appellant till we examine the appeal and parties are more elaborately heard, the ends of justice would warrant interim directions as prayed for being granted. 66. we are further constrained to observe that the first respondent cannot contend that the appellant is estopped from seeking interim protection and at the same time contend before different fora that the impugned order constitutes a final determination on the dispute that subsists. 67. accordingly, we provide that till the next date of listing, there shall be stay of the impugned judgement dated 06 march 2023. all rights and contentions of respective parties are kept open to be addressed in the proceedings pending before the at as well as in the cancellation petitions. yashwant varma, j. dharmesh sharma, j. august 04, 2023 neha"
