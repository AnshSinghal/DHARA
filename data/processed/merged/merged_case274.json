Jain, Senior Advocate, assisted by Mr. Siddhartha Jain,\n     Advocate for the decree-holder/respondent no. 1)\n\n\n\n                            Judgment\n            This        petition    under    Article     227     of   the\nConstitution       is    directed    against    the      order    dated\n18.04.2022 passed by VIth Additional Civil Judge, Seni or Division, Dehradun, whereby petitioner's objection under Section 47 C.P.C. was rejected. Petitioner has also challenged the judgment dated 02.09.2022 rendered by VIIth Additional District Judge, Dehradun, whereby his Revision against the order dated 18.04.2022 was dismissed. \n2. Facts, on which there is no dispute, are as follows:\nA suit for recovery of ` 90,400/- was filed by M/s Vigyan Chemical Industries (respondent no.1) against respondent nos. 2, 3 & 4 in the Court of Civil Judge, Dehradun, which was registered as Suit No. 103 of 1988. In the plaint, it was contended that plaintiff supplied hydrated lime to M/s Manorama Chemical Works Ltd., however, price of the supplied goods was not paid to him, therefore, he is entitled to recover a sum of ` 90,400/-. Respondent no. 1 also claimed pendente lite and future interest @ 24% per annum till realization of the amount. \n          M/s    Manorama         Chemical   Works       Ltd.\n(respondent     no.   2     herein)   had    taken      term loan/financial assistance from Odisha State Financial Corporation (petitioner herein) and had defaulted in re- payment of the loan, therefore, during pendency of the suit, petitioner took possession of M/s Manorama Chemical Works Ltd. by invoking power under Section 29 of the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951 (hereinafter referred to as 'the S.F.C. Act'. Plaintiff (respondent no. 1 herein) sought leave to amend the plaint by moving an application, in which he stated that since petitioner has taken over possession of M/s Manorama Chemical Works Ltd. under Section 29 of the S.F.C. Act, therefore, he be added as defendant no. 4 in the suit. Leave to amend/add certain paragraphs was also sought for contending that, in view of provision contained under Section 29 (5) of the S.F.C. Act, petitioner is liable for the amount claimed, as he has taken over possession of M/s Manorama Chemical Works Ltd. and the said industrial concern is now to be sued through defendant no. 4. \nThe amendment application was allowed and petitioner was added as defendant no. 4 in the suit. Petitioner filed written statement, admitting that due to default in re-payment of loan, he had taken possession of the industrial concern of defendant no. 1 on 18.08.1987 under Section 29 of the S.F.C. Act and thereafter sold the industrial concern of defendant no. 1 to one Shri T.R.K. Rao. Petitioner further contended that there is no privity of contract between him and the plaintiff, as such plaintiff is not entitled to raise demand of recovery of dues of defendant no. 1. Objection, regarding territorial jurisdiction of the Court at Dehradun, was also raised in the written statement. Learned trial Court framed as many as 9 issues, which are reproduced below:\n\"1. Whether plaintiff is a registered Firm and Vigyan Prakash has right to institute the suit on behalf of plaintiff's Firm?\n2. Whether defendant no. 1 is a Joint Venture Project with defendant no. 2 or defendant no. 2 has no relation with the suit?\n3. Whether plaintiff has dues of Rs. 65,954.65 against the supply of materials and carriage charge paid to truck owners towards defendants? \n4. Whether plaintiff is entitled to receive Rs. 6,229.29 as dues of Central Sales Tax and interest thereon? As it has been stated in para no. 34? \n5. Whether plaintiff is entitled to receive interest? If yes, then at what rate? \n6. Whether plaintiff is entitled to receive Rs. 300/- alongwith Rs. 82.40 against notice expense and Bank Commission? \n7. Plaintiff is entitled for which relief? \n8. Whether plaintiff is a Small Scale Unit? If yes, then its effect? \n9. Whether defendant no. 4 is not liable to pay any dues of defendant no. 1 to the plaintiff?\" \n3. The suit filed by respondent no. 1 was partially decreed by learned trial Court vide judgment dated 20.08.2001. Operative portion of the judgment is reproduced below:\n\"Plaintiff's suit is partially decreed for recovery of Rs. 84,170/- (Rs. Eighty four thousand, one hundred and seventy only) with interest @ 24% per annum w.e.f. 1.3.198 to 23.9.1992 and from 23.9.1992 till date of payment compound interest @ 2% per month with cost and suit for recovery of Rs. 6,229/- (Rs. Six thousand, two hundred and twenty nine only) is partially dismissed. \nDefendants are being ordered to pay abovementioned amount within a period of 3 months to the plaintiff.\" \n4. Issue no.9 was decided by the trial Court against the petitioner by holding that he raised a sum of `c 70,00,000/- from sale of properties of defendant no. 1 against the outstanding dues of defendant no. 1, which were to the tune of only ` 38,00,000/-; details regarding adjustment of excess money received through sale of properties of defendant no. 1 are not produced, consequently, petitioner has held the money received from sale of properties of defendant no. 1 in the capacity of trustee, therefore, he is bound to satisfy the claim of the plaintiff. On issue no. 5, learned trial Court recorded a finding that plaintiff is entitled to interest @ 24% per annum, as prevalent in business circles. \n5. Petitioner challenged the judgment & decree passed by learned trial Court by filing Civil Appeal No.182 of 2001. Plaintiff (respondent no. 1 herein) filed cross objection in the said Appeal. Learned Additional District Judge, F.T.C., VIth, Dehradun vide judgment dated 08.08.2006 dismissed petitioner's Appeal and allowed the cross objection filed by the plaintiff and decreed the suit in toto. \n6. The Second Appeal filed by petitioner was dismissed by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court vide judgment dated 07.05.2007. Petitioner approached Hon'ble Supreme Court against the judgment rendered in Second Appeal and Hon'ble Supreme Court dismissed the Appeal filed by petitioner vide judgment dated 23.11.2017. Thus, the decree passed by learned trial Court, as modified by first Appellate Court, became final. \n7. Respondent no. 1/decree holder sought execution of decree by filing an application, which was registered as Regular Execution Case No. 107 of 2018. Petitioner entered appearance before the Executing Court and filed objection under Section 47 read with Section 151 C.P.C., which was registered as Misc. Case No. 156 of 2021. The decree holder filed reply to the objection. The objection filed by petitioner under Section 47 C.P.C. was dismissed by the Executing Court vide order dated 18.04.2022. Petitioner challenged the order dated 18.04.2022 in a Revision Petition filed under Section 115 C.P.C., which was numbered as Civil Revision No. 40 of 2022. Learned VIIth Additional District Judge, Dehradun dismissed the Revision filed by the petitioner vide judgment dated 02.09.2022. Thus feeling aggrieved, petitioner has approached this Court. \n8. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that petitioner had furnished bank guarantee, which was sufficient to satisfy plaintiff's claim, as made in the suit, in the trial Court during pendency of the suit in the year 1999, therefore, petitioner cannot be made liable to pay any interest on the decreetal amount. Perusal of the record, however, indicates that the plaintiff had not furnished bank guarantee of his own volition, but he was directed by the trial Court to furnish security to the tune of ` 3,50,000/- vide order dated 13.05.1996. Petitioner challenged the said order in Appeal under Order 43 Rule (q) C.P.C., which was dismissed by learned IIIrd Additional District Judge, Dehradun vide judgment dated 03.06.1999. Petitioner then filed writ petition challenging the orders passed by learned trial Court and the Appellate Court in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 33425 of 1999, which was dismissed by Hon'ble Allahabad High Court vide judgment dated 10.08.1999. Thus, the security furnished by petitioner, in terms of order passed by learned trial Court, cannot be treated as a deposit made under Order 24 Rule 1 C.P.C. For ready reference Order 24 Rule 1 C.P.C. is extracted below:-\n\"1. Deposit by defendant of amount in satisfaction of claim.-The defendant in any suit to recover a debt or damages may, at any stage of the suit, deposit in Court such sum of money as he considers a satisfaction in full of the claim.\" \n9. A plain reading of Order 24 Rule 1 C.P.C. reveals that deposit of amount in satisfaction of the claim by the defendant should be voluntary and not by way of compulsion. The amount/bank guarantee deposited in Court by the plaintiff as security under an order of attachment passed under Order XXVIII Rule 5 CPC would be available to the plaintiff only in case his suit was decreed. Such deposit therefore cannot be treated under Order 24 Rule 1 C.P.C., as such, the contention raised by learned counsel for petitioner that petitioner is not liable to pay interest on the amount decreed, cannot be accepted. \n10. Learned counsel for petitioner submitted that the interest @ 24% per annum ordered to be paid by trial Court is on much higher side, and is thus impermissible in view of Section 34 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. However, the plea that interest awarded is contrary to Section 34 C.P.C. was not taken in the objection, in which it was contended that interest awarded is on higher side. \n11. It is not in dispute that the decree passed by learned trial Court, as modified by First Appellate Court, has attained finality. Respondent no. 1 in his plaint had claimed pendente lite and future interest @ 24% per annum. \n12. Learned trial Court had framed an issue regarding rate of interest to which plaintiff was entitled to and returned a finding that he is entitled to interest @ 24% per annum w.e.f. 01.03.1988 to 23.09.1992 and thereafter compound interest @ 2% per month. The said finding attained finality, therefore, learned Executing Court rightly did not reopen the question of interest. \n13. It is well settled that Executing Court can neither travel behind decree nor sit in appeal over the same or pass any order, jeopardizing the rights of the parties thereunder. In the case of Rajasthan Financial Corporation v. Man Industrial Corpn. Ltd., reported in (2003) 7 SCC 522, the judgment debtor had raised objection before the Executing Court against calculation of interest with half yearly rests, which was rejected. The revision petition filed by judgment debtor however was allowed by High Court, by holding that the decree holder is not entitled to charge interest on half yearly rests basis. In Appeal, Hon'ble Supreme Court set aside the judgment rendered by High Court and restored the order of Executing Court. Paragraphs 13 to 20 of the said judgment are reproduced below:-\n\" 13 . Reliance was also placed on the case of Bhawarlal Bhandari v. Universal Heavy Mechanical Lifting Enterprises [(1999) 1 SCC 558] . In this case the judgment-debtor challenged the decree, when it was before the executing court, on the ground that the award on which the decree was based was a nullity. It was submitted that the award had been filed in court by the arbitrator 4 years after it was passed. This Court held that the executing court could not go beyond the decree. It was held that the executing court had to take the decree according to its tenor and that the executing court could not entertain any objection that the decree was incorrect in law or on facts. \n14. Reliance was next placed on the case of Rameshwar Dass Gupta v. State of U.P. [(1996) 5 SCC 728] In this case it was held that the executing court cannot travel beyond the decree. It was held that the executing court has only got jurisdiction to execute the decree. It was held that the executing court could not have granted interest, on the money decree, when interest was not granted in the decree. \n15. Reliance was next placed on the case of C.V. Rajendran v. N.M. Muhammed Kunhi [(2002) 7 SCC 447] wherein it has been held that principles of res judicata applied even to different stages of the same proceeding. It has been held that if an issue has been decided at an earlier stage it cannot be allowed to be reagitated at a subsequent stage. \n16. Based on the above authorities Mr Divan submitted that the decree being clear, the executing court could not go beyond the decree on the basis that there was a mistake in the decree. He submitted that the decree had been passed after hearing arguments on behalf of both the parties on what the final decree should be as per the compromise deed. He submitted that even on principles of res judicata the appellants are precluded from now contending that they were entitled to interest on half-yearly basis. \n17. Finally Mr Divan made a with-prejudice offer. He stated that the respondents are willing to pay to the appellants a sum of Rs 75 lakhs in full and final settlement of all the claims of the appellants. \n18. We have considered the rival submissions. There can be no dispute to the proposition that the executing court cannot go beyond the decree. There can be no dispute that the executing court must take the decree according to its tenor. Also as has been set out in Greater Cochin Development Authority case [(2002) 2 SCC 573] when a decree is in terms of an award/document then the terms of that document have to be looked at. In this case the decree is in terms of the compromise deed. The decree does not provide that the compromise deed or any of its terms have been varied. To be remembered, that the decree is passed under Order 23 Rule 3 of the Civil Procedure Code. Under this provision normally the court passes the decree in terms of the compromise. Of course, the court can make a change. However, if the court was making a change it would have had to record why it was making the change and what change it was making. It could not then provide that the decree was in terms of the compromise. If the court was not passing the decree in terms of the compromise then this opening portion of the decree could not have been there. The subsequent portion is mere classificatory in nature as to which of the options was to be exercised. This does not govern or detract from the main terms of the decree which is a decree in terms of the compromise. Clauses 2 and 7 of the compromise deed make it very clear that the appellants were entitled to charge interest on half- yearly basis. We see no substance in the submission that the \"half-yearly rests\" were to apply only if the rate of interest was to be decided by the appellants. These words clearly applied to both the options. In the classificatory portion the words \"on half-yearly basis\" have not been mentioned because the portion is only clarifying how interest was to be calculated. This portion thus does not detract from the fact that the decree is in terms of the compromise deed. Merely because some other minor changes, which appear to be inadvertent changes, have crept in do not also detract from the fact that the decree is in terms of the compromise deed. We also do not find any uncertainty in the decree. \n19. In this view of the matter, we are unable to sustain the impugned judgment. It is accordingly set aside and the order of the executing court is restored. \n20. The appeal is allowed accordingly. There will be no order as to cost.\" \n14. In the case of Brakewel Automotive Components (India) Private Limited v. P.R. Selvam Alagappan, reported in (2017) 5 SCC 371, Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered and discussed the scope of inquiry under Section 47 CPC and held that exercise of power under Section 47 is microscopic and lies in a very narrow inspection hole and an executing court can allow objection to the executability of the decree if it is found that the same is void ab initio and is a nullity, apart from the ground that it is not capable of execution under the law, either because the same was passed in ignorance of some provision of law or the law was promulgated making a decree unexecutable after its passing. Relevant extract of the said judgment is reproduced below:-\n\"20. It is no longer res integra that an executing court can neither travel behind the decree nor sit in appeal over the same or pass any order jeopardising the rights of the parties thereunder. It is only in the limited cases where the decree is by a court lacking inherent jurisdiction or is a nullity that the same is rendered non est and is thus unexecutable. An erroneous decree cannot be equalled with one which is a nullity. There are no intervening developments as well to render the decree unexecutable. \n21. As it is, Section 47 of the Code mandates determination by an executing court, questions arising between the parties or their representatives relating to the execution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree and does not contemplate any adjudication beyond the same. A decree of court of law being sacrosanct in nature, the execution thereof ought not to be thwarted on mere asking and on untenable and purported grounds having no bearing on the validity or the executability thereof. \n22. Judicial precedents to the effect that the purview of scrutiny under Section 47 of the Code qua a decree is limited to objections to its executability on the ground of jurisdictional infirmity or voidness are plethoric. This Court, amongst others in Vasudev Dhanjibhai Modi v. Rajabhai Abdul Rehman [Vasudev Dhanjibhai Modi v. Rajabhai Abdul Rehman, (1970) 1 SCC 670 : AIR 1970 SC 1475 : (1971) 1 SCR 66] in essence enunciated that only a decree which is a nullity can be the subject-matter of objection under Section 47 of the Code and not one which is erroneous either in law or on facts. The following extract from this decision seems apt: (SCC pp. 672- 73, paras 6-7) \"6. A court executing a decree cannot go behind the decree: between the parties or their representatives it must take the decree according to its tenor, and cannot entertain any objection that the decree was incorrect in law or on facts. Until it is set aside by an appropriate proceeding in appeal or revision, a decree even if it be erroneous is still binding between the parties. \n7. When a decree which is a nullity, for instance, where it is passed without bringing the legal representative on the record of a person who was dead at the date of the decree, or against a ruling prince without a certificate, is sought to be executed an objection in that behalf may be raised in a proceeding for execution. Again, when the decree is made by a court which has no inherent jurisdiction to make it, objection as to its validity may be raised in an execution proceeding if the objection appears on the face of the record:\nwhere the objection as to the jurisdiction of the court to pass the decree does not appear on the face of the record and requires examination of the questions raised and decided at the trial or which could have been but have not been raised , the executing court will have no jurisdiction to entertain an objection as to the validity of the decree even on the ground of absence of jurisdiction.\"\n23. Though this view has echoed time out of number in similar pronouncements of this Court, in Dhurandhar Prasad Singh v. Jai Prakash University [Dhurandhar Prasad Singh v. Jai Prakash University, (2001) 6 SCC 534 : AIR 2001 SC 2552] , while dwelling on the scope of Section 47 of the Code, it was ruled that the powers of the court thereunder are quite different and much narrower than those in appeal/revision or review. It was reiterated that the exercise of power under Section 47 of the Code is microscopic and lies in a very narrow inspection hole and an executing court can allow objection to the executability of the decree if it is found that the same is void ab initio and is a nullity, apart from the ground that it is not capable of execution under the law, either because the same was passed in ignorance of such provision of law or the law was promulgated making a decree unexecutable after its passing. None of the above eventualities as recognised in law for rendering a decree unexecutable, exists in the case in hand. For obvious reasons, we do not wish to burden this adjudication by multiplying the decisions favouring the same view.\" \n15. Since the issue regarding interest was decided by trial Court and a finding was returned that plaintiff is entitled to interest at a certain rate and such finding became final, therefore, Executing Court was justified in not going into the question whether interest awarded is on higher side. \n16. In Aditya Mass Communications (P) Ltd. v. A.P. S.R.T.C., reported in (2003) 11 SCC 17, Hon'ble Supreme Court was dealing with a case in which amount of earnest money was unjustifiably retained by the respondent-corporation and the contractor was compelled to enter into series of litigation to get his money back. Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld the order passed by trial Court, whereby interest @ 12% per annum was ordered to be paid to the contractor and held that it is duty of the Court to see that the party whose money is wrongfully retained by other side is adequately compensated. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the said judgment are reproduced below:-\n\"8. The facts narrated hereinabove clearly show that the respondent has retained the money belonging to the appellant without authority of law and has driven the appellant to a series of litigations, therefore, this fact itself should have been sufficient to refuse the request of the respondent made before the High Court for reduction of the rate of interest. The quantum of interest a court may allow in a given case is governed by the facts of the case and not by any precedent law unless, of course, limited by a statute. If a court comes to the conclusion on a given set of facts that a party has been wrongly denied the use of its own money, it is the duty of the court to see that the said party is appropriately compensated. In the instant case, we are of the opinion that the respondent has deprived the appellant of its rightful use of the money. Therefore, the interest awarded by the trial court, to say the least, was most reasonable. We also notice that the High Court has not given any reason except referring to the judgments of this Court in the case of Sovintorg (India) Ltd. v. State Bank of India [(1999) 6 SCC 406] and Ghaziabad Development Authority v. Union of India [(2000) 6 SCC 113] . As stated above, the facts of this case do not justify the application of the principle laid down by this Court in those judgments. \n9. Hence, we allow this appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court to the extent it has reduced the interest granted by the trial court from 12% to 9% and restore the interest liable to be paid by the respondent to the appellant on the retained earnest money deposit of Rs 20 lakhs to 12% as directed by the trial court. The appeal is allowed with costs quantified at Rs 15,000.\"\n17. Learned counsel for petitioner then submitted that in view of provision contained under Section 15 (2) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, Execution Application was not maintainable before a Civil Court and it ought to have been filed before a Commercial Court. This plea however was not raised by petitioner in his objection before executing court nor it is raised in the writ petition. \n18. A decree may be executed either by the Court which passed such decree or by the Court to which it was sent for execution. The Court, which passed the decree, may on an application of the decree holder send it for execution to another Court of competent jurisdiction, if the Court which has passed the decree considers for any reason, which shall be recorded in writing that the decree should be executed by such other Court. Sub-section (3) of Section 39 provides that, for the purpose of Section 39, the Court shall be deemed to be a Court of competent jurisdiction, if at the time of making the application for the transfer of decree to it such Court would have jurisdiction to try the suit, in which such decree was passed. \n19. Admittedly, the decree was passed by the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Dehradun, therefore, by virtue of Section 38 of C.P.C., the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Dehradun is competent to execute the same. Chapter V of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 deals with transfer of pending suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value, from Civil Court to Commercial Court and proviso to sub-section (2) further provides that no suit or application, where the final judgment has been reserved by the Court prior to constitution of the Commercial Court shall be transferred under sub- section (2) , however, sub-section (5) of Section 15 further provides that if a suit/application relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value is not transferred in the manner specified in sub-section (2), then the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court may, on the application of any of the parties to the suit, transfer the same for trial or disposal to the Commercial Court. \n20. Thus, in view of Section 15 (5) of Commercial Courts Act, 2015, it was open to the petitioner to move application for transfer of the execution case from Civil Court to Commercial Court, however, he did not move such application. In the objection filed under Section 47 C.P.C. also, petitioner did not raise the question of jurisdiction of Civil Court to entertain the execution case. \n21. Even otherwise also, the decree was passed by the Civil Court on 20.08.2001, which was put to execution before establishment of Commercial Court at Dehradun. Although, Chapter V of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 provides for transfer of pending suits and applications, however, there is nothing to indicate that the Civil Court, which passed the decree, is divested of its jurisdiction to execute the decree. Sub- section (5) of Section 15 provides for transfer of suit or application by the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court on an application of a party to the proceedings, from Civil Court to Commercial Court, however, plain language of the said provision indicates that High Court may in an appropriate case refuse to transfer the suit/application to Commercial Court. Thus viewed, it cannot be said that the Civil Court, which passed the decree, lost the jurisdiction in view of provisions contained in the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Section 11 of the Commercial Courts Act makes jurisdiction of Commercial Court coextensive to that of a Civil Court. \n22. Thus, in my humble opinion, the contention raised on behalf of petitioner that the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Dehradun had no jurisdiction to entertain the execution application filed by respondent no. 1, cannot be accepted. \n23. There is yet another aspect of the matter. The suit was filed in the year 1988, which was decreed by learned Civil Judge on 20.08.2001. The decree which was affirmed by the highest Court is yet to be executed. The objection filed by petitioner before executing Court was rejected by learned VIth Additional Civil Judge (Junior Division), Dehradun vide order dated 18.04.2022, which was affirmed by VIIth Additional District Judge, Dehradun vide judgment dated 02.09.2022. Petitioner has challenged the judgment and orders passed by learned Courts below by invoking supervisory jurisdiction of this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \n24. Hon'ble Supreme Court has repeatedly held that power of superintendence under Article 227 has to be exercised very sparingly when manifest miscarriage of justice has been occasioned and such power is not to be exercised to correct a mistake of fact or of law. Hon'ble Supreme Court in a recent judgment in the case of Garment Craft v. Prakash Chand Goel, reported in (2022) 4 SCC 181 has held as under:-\n\"15. Having heard the counsel for the parties, we are clearly of the view that the impugned order [Prakash Chand Goel v. Garment Craft, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 11943] is contrary to law and cannot be sustained for several reasons, but primarily for deviation from the limited jurisdiction exercised by the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The High Court exercising supervisory jurisdiction does not act as a court of first appeal to reappreciate, reweigh the evidence or facts upon which the determination under challenge is based. Supervisory jurisdiction is not to correct every error of fact or even a legal flaw when the final finding is justified or can be supported. The High Court is not to substitute its own decision on facts and conclusion, for that of the inferior court or tribunal. [Celina Coelho Pereira v. Ulhas Mahabaleshwar Kholkar, (2010) 1 SCC 217 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 69] The jurisdiction exercised is in the nature of correctional jurisdiction to set right grave dereliction of duty or flagrant abuse, violation of fundamental principles of law or justice. The power under Article 227 is exercised sparingly in appropriate cases, like when there is no evidence at all to justify, or the finding is so perverse that no reasonable person can possibly come to such a conclusion that the court or tribunal has come to. It is axiomatic that such discretionary relief must be exercised to ensure there is no miscarriage of justice. \n16. Explaining the scope of jurisdiction under Article 227, this Court in Estralla Rubber v. Dass Estate (P) Ltd. [Estralla Rubber v. Dass Estate (P) Ltd., (2001) 8 SCC 97] has observed : (SCC pp. 101-102, para 6) \"6. The scope and ambit of exercise of power and jurisdiction by a High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is examined and explained in a number of decisions of this Court. The exercise of power under this article involves a duty on the High Court to keep inferior courts and tribunals within the bounds of their authority and to see that they do the duty expected or required of them in a legal manner. The High Court is not vested with any unlimited prerogative to correct all kinds of hardship or wrong decisions made within the limits of the jurisdiction of the subordinate courts or tribunals. Exercise of this power and interfering with the orders of the courts or tribunals is restricted to cases of serious dereliction of duty and flagrant violation of fundamental principles of law or justice, where if the High Court does not interfere, a grave injustice remains uncorrected. It is also well settled that the High Court while acting under this Article cannot exercise its power as an appellate court or substitute its own judgment in place of that of the subordinate court to correct an error, which is not apparent on the face of the record. The High Court can set aside or ignore the findings of facts of an inferior court or tribunal, if there is no evidence at all to justify or the finding is so perverse, that no reasonable person can possibly come to such a conclusion, which the court or tribunal has come to.\"\n25.

appeal (l) no.11950 of 2021 of bombay high court dated 1.10.2021 pnr,j & nbk,j cma no.69 of 2023 3 honourable sri justice p.naveen rao and hon'ble sri justice nagesh bheemapaka civil miscellaneous appeal no.69 of 2023 judgment: (per hon'ble sri justice p.naveen rao) it is apt to begin this judgment with the often quoted statement by joseph grynbaum. he said and quite rightly, 'an ounce of mediation is worth a pound of arbitration and a ton of litigation'. joseph grynbaum specializes in mediating complex multi-party commercial disputes. 2. heard learned senior counsel sri ashok ram kumar for sri p.satya venkateswara rao for the appellant and the learned counsel sri hemanth singh appearing for sri m.mallikarjun reddy for the respondent. parties herein are referred to as arrayed in the suit. 3. plaintiff and the respondent are the companies registered under the companies act, 2013. according to plaintiff, it is a century old business house engaged in business of marketing and/or manufacturing of diverse goods and services including packaged foods and beverages etc. it claims to be one of india's foremost private sector company having total income of about 62,336 crores in the financial year 2021-22 with market capitalization of about 3,08,882 crores as on 31.03.2022. it is rated amongst india's 50 biggest non-financial companies and ranked amongst the top 5 of india's most valuable companies for the years 2014 to 2019 by business today. it is also adjudged to be one of the world's top 250 most pnr,j & nbk,j regarded companies of 2019 by forbes magazine. it claims to enjoy enviable market position in foods business driven by renowned brads including 'aashirvaad salt'. defendant is also involved in various consumer products under the brand name 'tata'. defendant is also involved in manufacturing and selling of salt with the brand name 'shuddh by tata salt'. 4. according to the plaintiff, plaintiff is aggrieved against the defendant about its adoption, use and launch in december, 2022 of a trade dress which is a colourable and slavish imitation of 'aashirvaad salt' trade dress of the plaintiff. the adoption and use by the defendant of the new 'tata shuddh salt' trade dress for sale of salt is dishonest and motivated to trade upon the goodwill and reputation associated with plaintiff's 'aashirvaad salt'. plaintiff alleges that there is a deliberate attempt to not only copy the overall colour combination, but also the overall get-up and arrangement of features. the plaintiff alleges that impugned packaging/trade dress by the defendant can have no possible justification for adoption of several features in combination from the plaintiff's 'aashirvaad salt' packaging and get-up. plaintiff alleges that the 'shuddh tata salt' packaging trade dress is imitation of 'aashirvaad salt trade dress' of plaintiff. 5. plaintiff filed c.o.s.no.5 of 2023 in principal special court in the cadre of district judge for trial and disposal of commercial disputes, pnr,j & nbk,j hyderabad, under section 26 read with section 20, order vii rule 1 read with section 151 of code of civil procedure, 1908 and under sections 29 and 135 of trade marks act, 1999 to restrain infringement of trade mark registration nos.3335001 and 3335002, passing of, disparagement, rendition of accounts of profits/ damages, delivery etc. 6. plaintiff prayed to grant several reliefs, more particularly, decree of permanent injunction restraining the defendant, by itself and/or through its directors, group companies, associates, divisions, assignees in business, licensees, franchisees, agents, distributors and dealers from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising in any manner including on the internet, directly or indirectly dealing in salt or any other product under the impugned packaging and/or any other packaging/trade dress that may be deceptively similar, colourable imitation and/or substantial reproduction of the plaintiff's 'aashirvaad salt' trade dress amounting to infringement of plaintiff's registered trade mark nos.3335001 and 3335002 in clause-30 as enunciated in the plaint; a decree of permanent injunction restraining the defendant in any manner likely to cause confusion amounting to passing off and unfair competition, disparaging, defaming or denigrating the products; an order for rendition of accounts of profits illegally earned by the defendant and a decree for an amount found due or, in the alternative, a decree for 2 crores towards compensatory and penal damages. pnr,j & nbk,j 7. plaintiff filed affidavit expressing urgency in the matter praying the commercial court to entertain the suit without compelling the plaintiff to take recourse to mediation before filing the suit. in the affidavit, plaintiff states that in december, 2022, the plaintiff was shocked to learn that the defendant had re-launched its salt under the brand 'shuddh by tata' in a package, which is a slavish and colourable imitation of the plaintiff's 'aashirvaad salt trade dress'. by enclosing two images of respective products, plaintiff alleges dishonesty and the extent of copying of the defendant is evident from the comparative photographs. plaintiff alleges that unauthorized manufacture, offer for sale and sale of the salt under the impugned packaging has caused serious loss and damage to the plaintiff and will continue to cause loss and damage to the plaintiff unless the same are injected by the court. plaintiff further contended that visual identity and/or deceptive similarity between the product packaging of the plaintiff and that of the defendant is bound to confuse/mislead the unwary consumer with average intelligence and imperfect recollection into mistaking the defendant's product as that of the plaintiff. plaintiff alleges that this has been deliberately done by the defendant to ride piggyback on the tremendous reputation of the plaintiff and pass of its goods as those of the plaintiff. 8. plaintiff alleges that defendant is committing acts of infringement of trade mark, copyright, passing off within the jurisdiction of the hon'ble commercial court and unless defendant is restrained by way of an adpnr,j & nbk,j interim injunction from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising in any manner including on the internet, the products under the impugned packaging, plaintiff would suffer irreparable loss and grave hardship, which cannot be compensated in monetary terms. plaintiff therefore pleads that there is urgent need to restrain the defendant from further infringing the plaintiff's registered trade mark, copyright and committing acts of passing off. he therefore sought exemption from pre-institution mediation and settlement and to file the suit. plaintiff pleads that in extreme urgency the suit is filed and also filed application under order xxxix rules 1 and 2 of cpc for urgent ad-interim reliefs. he would contend that if the application is not allowed, the very purpose of initiating the suit by the plaintiff would be frustrated and as a result plaintiff would suffer irreparable damage and injury. 9. as averred in the affidavit to seek exemption under section 12a, plaintiff also filed i.a.no.26 of 2023 under order xxxix rules 1 and 2 of cpc praying to grant an order of interim injunction restraining the defendant, by itself and/or through its directors, group companies, associates, franchisees, agents, distributors and dealers from in any manner disparaging, defaming or denigrating the products of the plaintiff in any manner including on the internet directly or indirectly dealing in salt or any other product under the impugned packaging and/or any other packaging/trade dress that may be deceptively similar to plaintiff's pnr,j & nbk,j 'aashirvaad salt trade dress' in any manner whatsoever amounting to infringement of trade mark, copyright, passing off and unfair competition, disparaging, defaming, or denigrating the products of the plaintiff in any manner whatsoever. 10. the commercial court while issuing urgent notice, returnable by 20.02.2023, by order dated 01.02.2023, observed that though the words 'aashirvaad' and 'shuddh tata salt' are different, the shape and make of the packet, its size, the colour combination of the printed label containing yellow, orange, blue and white make the package appear similar and, therefore, it appears, prima facie, that the respondent is knowingly or unknowingly marketing its products in the package similar to the package used by the petitioner. the commercial court observed prima facie case is made out by the plaintiff and that if injunction is not granted, the plaintiff would put to un-measurable loss. thus, the trial court was inclined to grant ad-interim temporary injunction against the defendant directing them not to produce and release to the market the salt packets similar to the packets used by the plaintiff. the respondent was restrained from doing so by means of ad-interim injunction. however, the commercial court saved the retail marketing of the product already released into the market. aggrieved thereby, the present civil miscellaneous appeal is filed by the defendant. pnr,j & nbk,j 11. both counsel have made elaborate submissions on various aspects touching up on merits of the respective stands on alleged infringement of patent of the plaintiff concerning their 'aashirvaad' salt product by the defendant. in addition, learned senior counsel for defendant made preliminary submission on maintainability of the commercial suit. 12. it is contended that section 12-a of the commercial courts act, 2015 (act, 2015) was not complied before instituting the suit and that provision being mandatory, non-compliance thereof is sufficient to hold the suit as not maintainable. according to the learned senior counsel for defendant, scheme of the act envisages parties to a dispute first to take recourse to mediation as a measure to resolve inter se dispute and only on failure of the resolution of dispute by mediation, they should take recourse to filing a suit before the commercial court under the act. being a special provision with primary objective of curtailing litigation and encouraging the parties to resolve the inter se dispute by mediation prior to availing legal remedy, it must be strictly construed and complied. 13. per contra, according to the learned counsel for respondent, within ten months of launching its product, the defendant has changed packaging which in many respects similar to the packaging of 'aashirvad salt' of the plaintiff causing immense damage to its reputation and marketing prospects. the plaintiff is the prior user of its patented package. it has pnr,j & nbk,j been using packaging for the last two years and received tremendous response from consumers. only to knock away the sales of the plaintiff, the defendant has changed packaging to make it appear similar to the packaging of 'aashirvaad salt' of the plaintiff. 14. according to learned counsel, section 12-a of the act, 2015 has no application when an urgent relief contemplated by the plaintiff. as the defendant infringed the patent of the plaintiff permitting the defendant to continue to manufacture and distribute the salt under the brand name, 'shudh by tata salt' would cause serious hardship and huge business loss to the plaintiff and grave prejudice would be caused to the plaintiff. thus, there is urgency in seeking ad-interim injunction. according to the learned counsel, in the affidavit filed under section 12-a of the act, 2015, all the details are furnished why plaintiff is seeking indulgence of the commercial court to file the suit without availing the mediation process and the commercial court having convinced with the plea raised by the plaintiff, has rightly entertained the suit and granted injunction order. 15. he would submit that if the defendant is aggrieved by injunction order granted by the trial court, he ought to have filed appropriate application for vacating the injunction and prosecute the suit. he could not have rushed to this court challenging the injunction order without first seeking vacation of the said interim order. he would submit that even assuming that plaintiff pnr,j & nbk,j has not satisfied the ingredients of section 12-a of the act, 2015, it is no ground to file the appeal without first filing appropriate application before the commercial court. 16. though extensive submissions are made on various aspects, we are confining our consideration to the scope of section 12-a of the act, 2015 as accepting the contention of the defendant on maintainability of the suit would be going to the root of the litigation initiated by the plaintiff. 17. a dispute arising out of ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers and traders, export or import of merchandise, construction, infrastructure and technology development agreements, intellectual property rights relating to registered and unregistered trademarks, copyright, patent, design, to name a few is a civil dispute having commercial angle. hitherto, regular civil courts were dealing with all disputes of civil in nature including disputes involving commercial transactions. however, there is huge pendency of civil disputes in all the civil courts in the country. ordinarily, a civil dispute to say the least takes 5 to 10 years to conclude in a trial court. thereon, on appeal, it will be pending at least for another five years. pendency of civil litigation and inordinate delay in disposal impacts disputes involving commercial transactions. a stay in a case concerning an infrastructure project culminating in a decision after 10 years will have cascading effect on the project and all activities relating to the project. pnr,j & nbk,j 18. long pendency of litigation and more particularly litigation relating to business and commerce has caused severe dent in ensuring flow of foreign investments and multi-national companies showing interest in doing business in india. the multi-national companies and other investors fear long drawn litigation as a stumbling block in doing business in india. in order to promote foreign investments in india and dispel the impression of foreign investors that litigation is consuming long time for resolution, the government of india has initiated several measures. it has brought out the commercial courts act, 2015 creating separate adjudication process in cases involving commercial disputes. the act aims to fast track the disposal of cases involving commercial disputes. 19. on review of working of the act, the government brought out certain amendments to the act by amendment act 28 of 2018. the statement of objects and reasons to bring about these amendments are spelt out as under: \"the global economic environment has since become increasingly competitive and to attract business at international level, india needs to further improve its ranking in the world bank 'doing business report' which, inter alia, considers the dispute resolution environment in the country as one of the parameters for doing business. further, the tremendous economic development has ushered in enormous commercial activities in the country including foreign direct investments, public private partnership, etc., which has prompted initiating legislative measures for speedy settlement of commercial disputes, widen the scope of the courts to deal with commercial disputes and facilitate ease of doing business. needless to say that early resolution of commercial disputes of even lesser value creates a positive image amongst the investors about the strong and responsive indian legal system. it is, therefore, proposed to amend the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015.\" pnr,j & nbk,j (emphasis supplied) 20. significant change in perception is by introducing section 12-a to the act by amendment act 28 of 2018. why this provision introduced is highlighted in statement of objects and reasons. it reads as under: \"statement of objects and reasons.-1. the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015 was enacted for the constitution of commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division in the high courts for adjudicating commercial disputes of specified value and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 2. the global economic environment has since become increasingly competitive and to attract business at international level, india needs to further improve its ranking in the world bank \"doing business report\" which, inter alia, considers the dispute resolution environment in the country as one of the parameters for doing business. further, the tremendous economic development has ushered in enormous commercial activities in the country including foreign direct investments, public private partnership, etc. which has prompted initiating legislative measures for speedy settlement of commercial disputes, widen the scope of the courts to deal with commercial disputes and facilitate ease of doing business. needless to say, that early resolution of commercial disputes of even lesser value creates a positive image amongst the investors about the strong and responsive indian legal system. it is, therefore, proposed to amend the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015. 3. as parliament was not in session and immediate action was required to be taken to make necessary amendments in the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015, to further improve india's ranking in the \"doing business report\", the president promulgated the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts (amendment) ordinance, 2018 on 3-5-2018. 4. it is proposed to introduce the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts (amendment) bill, 2018 to replace the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts (amendment) ordinance, 2018, which inter alia, provides for the following namely-(i) to (iv) xxx (v) to provide for compulsory mediation before institution of a suit, where no urgent interim relief is contemplated and for this purpose, to introduce the pre-institution mediation and settlement mechanism and pnr,j & nbk,j to enable the central government to authorise the authorities constituted under the legal services authorities act, 1987 for this purpose. 5. the bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.\" 20.1. section 12-a of the act, 2015 reads as under: s.12a. pre-institution mediation and settlement.-(1) a suit, which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief under this act, shall not be instituted unless the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of pre-institution mediation in accordance with such manner and procedure as may be prescribed by rules made by the central government. (2) the central government may, by notification, authorise the authorities constituted under the legal services authorities act, 1987 (39 of 1987), for the purposes of pre-institution mediation. (3) notwithstanding anything contained in the legal services authorities act, 1987 (39 of 1987), the authority authorised by the central government under sub-section (2) shall complete the process of mediation within a period of three months from the date of application made by the plaintiff under subsection (1): provided that the period of mediation may be extended for a further period of two months with the consent of the parties: provided further that, the period during which the parties remained occupied with the pre-institution mediation, such period shall not be computed for the purpose of limitation under the limitation act, 1963 (36 of 1963). (4) if the parties to the commercial dispute arrive at a settlement, the same shall be reduced into writing and shall be signed by the parties to the dispute and the mediator. (5) the settlement arrived at under this section shall have the same status and effect as if it is an arbitral award on agreed terms under sub-section (4) of section 30 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996).\" 21. it is a game changer for two reasons. firstly, it aims to drive away warring parties to a dispute from litigating and to take recourse to mediation. no dispute is beyond resolution by means of mediation. in business, resolution of a dispute by mediation helps in building camaraderie. the case on hand is a case to highlight its importance. in the instant case, both pnr,j & nbk,j companies are leading companies, well established, have a good market share of their products and have built consumer confidence by decades of hard work and commitment to quality and durability of their products. both have enviable dominance in consumer products. it is not in the interest of business and consumer activity for these giants to fight litigation on a product, in this case, salt. we are confident that if they have taken recourse to mediation the dispute would have been resolved. 22. secondly, it seeks to decongest the courts from avoidable litigation. the flow of litigation involving commercial dispute has increased many fold. even the commercial courts are overloaded and taking lot of time for disposal of cases. unless they are decongested the main objective of creating the special courts gets defeated. it is thus necessary to mandate parties to a dispute to take recourse to mediation and discourage them to rush to the court. 23. it is necessary to encourage two warring parties to first explore means to resolve the dispute before rushing to the court and litigate. section 12-a of the act therefore mandates the plaintiff to first explore the mediation process before instituting the suit. however, it carves out exception to availing the remedy of mediation at pre-litigation stage only if the plaintiff requires urgent interlocutory orders. having regard to the purpose and object sought to be achieved, dispensing with the course of availing mediation and pnr,j & nbk,j directly instituting the suit is only when urgent interlocutory orders are required by the plaintiff and not as a matter of course. 24. in m/s. patil automation private limited and others vs. rakheja engineers private limited1, hon'ble supreme court held as under: \"91.4. spread over five sub-sections, this standalone section in chapter iii-a, no doubt, supported by the rules, in our view, substantially manifests a definite scheme to effectively deal with the perceived urgent problem of acute clogging of the justice delivery system, which had to be de-congested. section 12-a cannot be perceived as merely intended to reach quicker justice, and what is more, on terms, which are mutually acceptable to the parties concerned. even, more importantly, it was to produce a vital and significant effect on the very interest of the nation. we have perused the statement of objects and reasons. to attract foreign capital by enhancing its rather low standard in the ease of doing business, it was and is still necessary to showcase an efficient and quick justice delivery system in commercial matters. in fact, india, which was ranked at 142 out of 189 countries, in the ease of doing business index, in 2015, climbed up to only 130 in the year 2016. by 2020, india stood at the 63rd position. xxx 99.1. the act did not originally contain section 12-a. it is by amendment in the year 2018 that section 12-a was inserted. the statement of objects and reasons are explicit that section 12-a was contemplated as compulsory. the object of the act and the amending act of 2018, unerringly point to at least partly foisting compulsory mediation on a plaintiff who does not contemplate urgent interim relief. the provision has been contemplated only with reference to plaintiffs who do not contemplate urgent interim relief. the legislature has taken care to expressly exclude the period undergone during mediation for reckoning limitation under the limitation act, 1963. the object is clear. 99.2. it is an undeniable reality that courts in india are reeling under an extraordinary docket explosion. mediation, as an alternative dispute mechanism, has been identified as a workable solution in commercial matters. in other words, the cases under the act lend themselves to be resolved through mediation. nobody has an absolute right to file a civil suit. a civil suit can be barred absolutely or the bar may operate unless certain conditions are fulfilled. cases in point, which amply illustrate this principle, are section 80cpc and section 69 of the partnership act. 99.3. the language used in section 12-a, which includes the word \"shall\", certainly, goes a long way to assist the court to hold that the provision is mandatory. the entire procedure for carrying out the mediation, has been 2022 (10) scc 1 pnr,j & nbk,j spelt out in the rules. the parties are free to engage counsel during mediation. the expenses, as far as the fee payable to the mediator, is concerned, is limited to a one-time fee, which appears to be reasonable, particularly, having regard to the fact that it is to be shared equally. a trained mediator can work wonders. 99.4. mediation must be perceived as a new mechanism of access to justice. we have already highlighted its benefits. any reluctance on the part of the court to give section 12-a, a mandatory interpretation, would result in defeating the object and intention of parliament. the fact that the mediation can become a non-starter, cannot be a reason to hold the provision not mandatory. apparently, the value judgment of the lawgiver is to give the provision, a modicum of voluntariness for the defendant, whereas, the plaintiff, who approaches the court, must, necessarily, resort to it. section 12-a elevates the settlement under the act and the rules to an award within the meaning of section 30(4) of the arbitration act, giving it meaningful enforceability. the period spent in mediation is excluded for the purpose of limitation. the act confers power to order costs based on conduct of the parties. 100. in the cases before us, the suits do not contemplate urgent interim relief. as to what should happen in suits which do contemplate urgent interim relief or rather the meaning of the word \"contemplate\" or urgent interim relief, we need not dwell upon it. the other aspect raised about the word \"contemplate\" is that there can be attempts to bypass the statutory mediation under section 12-a by contending that the plaintiff is contemplating urgent interim relief, which in reality, it is found to be without any basis. section 80(2)cpc permits the suit to be filed where urgent interim relief is sought by seeking the leave of the court. the proviso to section 80(2) contemplates that the court shall, if, after hearing the parties, is satisfied that no urgent or immediate relief need be granted in the suit, return the plaint for presentation to the court after compliance. our attention is drawn to the fact that section 12-a does not contemplate such a procedure. this is a matter which may engage attention of the lawmaker. again, we reiterate that these are not issues which arise for our consideration. in the fact of the cases admittedly there is no urgent interim relief contemplated in the plaints in question.\" (emphasis supplied) 25. in deepak raheja vs. ganga taro vazirani2, the bombay high court held that the use of the word \"shall\" in a statute generally raises presumption that the provision is mandatory and held that section 12-a is mandatory. it held, \"16. it is no doubt correct that if the plain meaning of the words of a statute leads to anomaly and absurdity, then the court can look into the purpose for which the statute is enacted and try to reconcile the interpretation with the purpose of the statute. however, commercial appeal (l) no.11950 of 2021 of bombay high court dated 1.10.2021 pnr,j & nbk,j if the words of the statute are plain and obvious and do not result in any anomaly, then the court must give effect to the words as used in the statute. the use of the word \"shall\" in a statute generally raises a presumption that the provision is mandatory. this presumption can be rebutted by looking at the object and scope of the statute and the consequences flowing from the construction. to displace the presumption, the intention of the legislature is to be considered. xxx 24. section 12a does not come into play if the suit contemplates an urgent relief. if a commercial suit (of specified value) contemplates urgent relief, it can be instituted in the court straightaway. therefore, two classes of commercial disputes are contemplated under section 12a. one in which an urgent interim relief is not contemplated and second where urgent interim relief is contemplated. section 12a provides different schemes for these two classes of disputes. where there is no urgent interim relief to first exhaust the remedy of pre-institution mediation. where there is an urgent interim relief contemplated to approach the court directly. the emphasis is that for a particular type of dispute particular kind of remedy is more appropriate. section 12a segregates commercial disputes depending on their urgency. making segregation at the inception of a commercial dispute is a considered legislative instrument to speed up the disposal of commercial disputes. court adjudication is not the only type of dispute resolution mechanism. negotiations and mediation also resolve the dispute by finding a mutually acceptable solution. the parties can negotiate themselves or through a private person or machinery provided under the statute. once the authority conducts the mediation under section 12a, the mutually acceptable outcome can be enforced like an arbitral award. for some disputes with urgent interim reliefs, adjudication in courts can be a suitable remedy, while for some disputes, resolution through mediation can be more appropriate. section 12a is recognition of this fact by the legislature. a clear legislative intent emerges from the plain reading of section 12a that commercial dispute which contemplates an urgent interim relief, dispute resolution by courts is primary, when there is no such interim relief contemplated, preinstitution mediation for mutual resolution of disputes to be attempted first should be appropriate. xxx 34. thus, we hold that section 12a of the act of 2015 is mandatory, and a commercial suit of specified value which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief under the act of 2015, cannot not be instituted unless the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of preinstitution mediation in accordance with such manner and procedure as may be prescribed by rules made by the central government. considering the object and purpose of section 12a of being rooted in the public interest, there is no question of it being waived by a party. the findings in the impugned order to the contrary are set aside.\" pnr,j & nbk,j 26. we are moving towards pre-litigation resolution of disputes by alternate means such as negotiation, conciliation and mediation. many statutes made in the last few years have incorporated provisions to avail alternative mode of resolution of disputes. resolution of disputes by mediation is being encouraged. in india, mediation is taking its roots firmly. government of india is encouraging mediation to resolve disputers and is keen to make resort to mediation as mandatory. it seeks to introduce a bill in the indian parliament to make pre-litigation mediation mandatory in any litigation. amendment act, 28 of 2018 is in that direction. legislative measures initiated and put in place in the recent past clearly point out to direction in which we are progressing towards resort to mediation to resolve a dispute as mandatory pre-requisite before taking recourse to availing civil/criminal law remedy. 27. coming to the case on hand, plaintiff and defendant are well established and are market leaders in several consumer products. they have built enviable positions in the country. according to plaintiff, its total earnings in the financial year 2021-22 is 62,336 crores. the figures of tata may also be same if not more. both companies are also involved in manufacture and sale of salt. the sticky point on which these two leading companies are fighting this litigation is in marketing the salt. the dispute concerns marketing salt in a particular package. market share of salt in various forms and packaging is a small percentage of their total earnings. pnr,j & nbk,j 28. in the facts of this case, the court has to satisfy that plaintiff has made out a case to dispense with availing mediation process, that he requires urgent orders and that not permitting him to institute the suit immediately without seeking recourse to mediation would cause irreparable injury and hardship. 29. there was no consideration on urgency to file suit and seek urgent interlocutory orders. dispensing from availing the mediation to resolve the dispute before instituting a suit is not a matter of course. the trial court has not even looked into the mandatory nature of availing mediation as per section 12-a. it has not applied its mind on whether the plaintiff has made out a case to dispense with taking recourse to mediation. it amounts to error of jurisdiction. having regard to statutory mandate, we set aside the order under challenge and remit the matter to the commercial court to consider the maintainability of suit without availing the mediation as required by section 12-a of the act. 30. the appeal is accordingly, allowed. no costs. miscellaneous applications, if any pending, stand closed. _________________________ p.naveen rao, j _________________________ nagesh bheemapaka, j
