This is a petition filed under section 11 of the Arbitration and\n\n                                    Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short \"Aca\") whereby the petitioner has\n\n                                    prayed for appointment of an arbitral tribunal to adjudicate the disputes\n\n                                    and differences between the parties, which have arisen         under       two\n\n                                    Agreements entered by the petitioner with the respondent both dated 30\n\n                                    June, 2012 for Design, Procure, Manufacture, Supply and Supervision of\n\n                                    Erection and Commissioning of one no. 75 Tph Mcr Capacity, 72.5 kg/ \n\n                                    cm2(g) pressure, 515C  5C steam temperature Multi fuel fired Boiler\n\n                                    with accessories for 12.5 Mw      - Generation Project being set up at \n\n                                    Alegaon, Tal. Madha, Dist. Solapur, Maharashtra. There is no dispute in\n\n                                    regard to the arbitration agreement as contained in both the\n\n                                    agreements, which is contained in Clauses 15 and 14 of the respective\n\n                                    agreements. \n                                         2                          7.ARP79_2022.doc\n\n2.     As disputes and differences had arisen between the parties, the\n\npetitioner by its advocate's notice dated 3 December, 2020 invoked the\n\narbitration agreement and called upon the respondent to appoint a sole\n\narbitrator to adjudicate the disputes which have arisen between the\n\nparties. The name of the nominee arbitrator was also suggested in\n\nparagraph 5 of such notice. As set out in paragraph 4, of such notice the\n\npetitioner invoked arbitration in respect of both the agreements. The\n\npetitioner's   claim    against   the       respondent   is   of   an    amount\n\nRs.1,33,37,723/-.      As the notice invoking arbitration was not replied,\n\nthe present petition was required to be filed by the petitioner. \n\n\n3.    This petition was initially filed on the Original Side of this Court,\n\nas a Commercial Arbitration Petition, on the assumption that the dispute\n\nbetween the parties being a commercial dispute the same was required\n\nto be filed on the original side of this Court although no cause of action\n\nto invoke such jurisdiction had arisen within Mumbai. Such petition was\n\npermitted to be transferred to the Appellate Side by an order dated 7\n\nMarch, 2022 passed by this Court. It is accordingly listed before the\n\nCourt on the appellate side. \n\n\n4.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that there clearly\n\nexists an arbitration agreement as contained in Clauses 15 and 14 as\n\nnoted above. He submits that also there is a lawful invocation of such\n                                       3                         7.ARP79_2022.doc\n\narbitration agreement.       It is submitted that the Court in these\n\ncircumstances needs to exercise jurisdiction to appoint an arbitral\n\ntribunal for adjudication of the disputes which have arisen between the\n\nparties under the said two agreements. He makes a statement that the\n\nCourt fees in both the agreements have been paid on the proceedings. \n\n\n5.     On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent has raised an\n\nobjection to the maintainability of this petition, before the High Court\n\nreferring to the provisions of Section 10 (3) of the Commercial Courts Act,\n\n2015. The submission as made by learned counsel for the respondent is to\n\nthe effect that the present proceedings being in the nature of Commercial\n\nArbitration proceedings, this Court would not have jurisdiction under\n\nsection 11(6) of the Aca Act to appoint an arbitrator inasmuch as sub-\n\nsection (3) of Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act, provides that if an\n\narbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all\n\napplications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions\n\nof Aca would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of original\n\njurisdiction in a district (not being a High Court), which shall be filed and\n\nheard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial\n\njurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial Court has been\n\nconstituted. It is his submission that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 is a\n\nlegislation subsequent to the Aca which was brought into force on the 23 rd\n\nday of October, 2015, as sub-section (3) of Section 1 would provide. It is\n\nhence his submission that the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in\n                                        4                      7.ARP79_2022.doc\n\nthe present proceeding would be the designated Court at Pune or the\n\nCompetent Court, either at Akluj, District Solapur or Pune, as agreed\n\nbetween the parties in the Arbitration Clause. It is on such premise learned\n\ncounsel for the respondent has submitted that the petition ought not to be\n\nentertained and be directed to be presented before the designated\n\nCommercial Court/Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction who would\n\nexercise jurisdiction to appoint an arbitral tribunal.\n\n\n6.    Learned counsel for the petitioner, in opposing the above contention\n\nas urged on behalf of the respondent, would submit that such contention as\n\nurged on behalf of the respondent would not be the correct position in law. \n\nIt is his contention that the jurisdiction to appoint an arbitral tribunal\n\nunder section 11 of the Aca would vest exclusively with the High Court. It\n\nis his submission that such powers are not conferred in a manner known to\n\nlaw with the principal court of civil jurisdiction and hence sub-section (3)\n\nof Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act cannot be applied to the\n\nproceedings under Section 11 of the Aca being the subject matter of the\n\npresent proceeding.\n\n\n7.    To appreciate the objection as urged on behalf of the respondent, it\n\nwould be necessary to consider the purport and the effect of the provisions\n\nof Section 11 as also the provisions of Section 10 of the Commercial Courts\n\nAct, 2015. These provisions reads thus:\n                                    5                           7.ARP79_2022.doc\n\n11 Appointment of arbitrators. --\n\n(1) A person of any nationality may be an arbitrator, unless otherwise\nagreed by the parties. \n\n(2) Subject to sub-section (6), the parties are free to agree on a\nprocedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators. \n\n(3) Failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (2), in an\narbitration with three arbitrators, each party shall appoint one\narbitrator, and the two appointed arbitrators shall appoint the third\narbitrator who shall act as the presiding arbitrator. \n\n(4) If the appointment procedure in sub-section (3) applies and--\n\n       (a) a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days from\n       the receipt of a request to do so from the other party;

and\n\n       (b) where the matters referred to in sub-sections (4), (5), (6),\n(7), (8) and sub-section (10) arise in any other arbitration, the\nreference to the \"Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court\"\n                                         7                             7.ARP79_2022.doc\n\n     in those sub-sections shall be construed as a reference to the \"High\n     Court\" within whose local limits the principal Civil Court referred to in\n     clause (e) of sub-section (1) of section 2 is situate, and where the High\n     Court itself is the Court referred to in that clause, to that High Court.\n\n     (13) An Application made under this Section for appointment of an\n     arbitrator or arbitrators shall be disposed of by the Supreme Court or\n     the High Court or the person or institution designated by such Court, as\n     the case may be, as expeditiously as possible and an endeavour shall be\n     made to dispose of the matter within a period of sixty days from the\n     date of service of notice on the opposite party.\n\n     (14) For the purpose of determination of the fees of the arbitral\n     tribunal and the manner of its payment to the arbitral tribunal, the\n     High Court may frame such rules as may be necessary, after taking into\n     consideration the rates specified in the Fourth Schedule.\n\n     (Amendment inserted by Act No. 3 of 2016 with retrospective effect from\n     23.10.2015)\n\n\n     Section 10 of Commercial Courts Act: Jurisdiction in respect of\n     arbitration matters.\n     10. Where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute\n     of a Specified Value and- \n     (1) If such arbitration is an international commercial arbitration, all\n     applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the\n     provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996)\n     that have been filed in a High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by\n     the Commercial Division where such Commercial Division has been\n     constituted in such High Court. \n     (2) If such arbitration is other than an international commercial\n     arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration\n     under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26\n     of 1996) that have been filed on the original side of the High Court,\n     shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such\n     Commercial Division has been constituted in such High Court.\n     (3) If such arbitration is other than an international commercial\n     arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration\n     under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26\n     of 1996) that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of\n     original jurisdiction in a district (not being a High Court) shall be filed\n     in, and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising\n     territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial\n     Court has been constituted.\"\n                                                          (emphasis added) \n\n8.   It needs to be observed that the amendment to the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act by Act No. 3 of 2016, incorporating amendments to\n                                     8                       7.ARP79_2022.doc\n\nSection 11 and more particularly the insertion of the various sub-\n\nsections (as highlighted in the said provision as extracted above) were\n\nbrought into effect from 23 October, 2015. This date has significance\n\ninasmuch as it corresponds to the date on which also the Commercial\n\nCourts Act was brought into force namely from 23 October, 2015. This\n\nwould have some relevance in deciding the issue in hand. \n\n\n9.    On a perusal of Section 11 of the Aca and more particularly the\n\npowers conferred on the High Court read with sub-section (6) , it\n\nappears to be quite clear that where under an appointment procedure as\n\nagreed between the parties in a manner as set out in clauses (a) to (c) of\n\nsub-section (6) of Section11 namely when a party fails to act as required\n\nunder that procedure; the parties or two arbitrators, fail to reach an\n\nagreement expected of them under that procedure; or a person,\n\nincluding an institution fails to perform any function entrusted to him or\n\nit under that procedure, it is provided that a party may request the\n\nSupreme Court or as the case may be the High Court or any person or\n\ninstitution designated by such Court to take the necessary measure,\n\nunless the agreement on the appointment procedure provides other\n\nmeans for securing the appointment. Sub-section 6-A throws light on the\n\nSupreme Court and the High Court exercising jurisdiction under Section\n\n11(6) to provide that the Supreme Court or the High Court while\n\nconsidering any application under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or \n                                     9                        7.ARP79_2022.doc\n\nsub-section (6), shall nothwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of\n\nany Court, confine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration\n\nagreement. Sub-section 6-B of Section 11 is required to be read in the\n\ncontext of what has been provided in sub-section (6), namely, in the\n\nevent apart from the Supreme Court or High Court, if any person or\n\ninstitution is designated by such Courts to take measures to appoint an\n\narbitral tribunal, the designation of any person or instiution by the\n\nSupreme Court or High Court, as the case may be, for the purposes of\n\nSection 11 \"shall not\" be regarded as a delegation of \"judicial power\" by\n\nthe Supreme Court or the High Court. \n\n\n10.    On the holistic reading of Section 11 of the Aca it is clear that it\n\nis the jurisdiction either of the Supreme Court or the High Court to\n\nappoint arbitrators under section 11 (6) with an exception of the\n\nSupreme Court and the High Court designating any person or institution\n\nto make such appointment and even if such person or institution is so\n\nappointed, it shall not amount to Court conferring any judicial power by\n\nthe Supreme Court or the High Court.\n\n\n11.   It however needs to be seen as to whether the powers of the High\n\nCourt as conferred under section 11 of the Aca, in any manner would\n\nstand divested by operation of sub-section (3) of Section 10, which is\n\nalso a provision which has been brought into force on the same day an\n                                     10                       7.ARP79_2022.doc\n\namendment to Section 11 Aca as noted above was brought into force,\n\nnamely, on 23 October, 2015. Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act\n\nprovides for \"Jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters\". It provides\n\nthat where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute\n\nof a specified value and as provided for in sub-section (1) if such\n\narbitration is an international commercial arbitration, all applications or\n\nappeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 that have been filed in a High\n\nCourt, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division where\n\nsuch Commercial Division has been constituted in such High Court. Sub-\n\nsection (2) of Section 10, provides that if such arbitration is other than\n\nan international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals\n\narising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration\n\nand Conciliation Act, 1996 that have been filed on the original side of\n\nthe High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial\n\nDivision where such Commercial Division has been constituted in such\n\nHigh Court. Thus, sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of Section 10 deal\n\nwith matters \"which have been filed\" and where the subject of\n\narbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value. Sub-section (3)\n\nof Section 10 provides that if such arbitration is other than an\n\ninternational commercial arbitration, \"all applications or appeals arising\n\nout of such arbitration\", under the provisions of the Arbitration and\n                                          11                           7.ARP79_2022.doc\n\nConciliation Act, 1996 that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil\n\ncourt of original jurisdiction in a district (not being a High Court) shall\n\nbe filed in, and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court\n\nexercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such\n\nCommercial Court has been constituted. The use of words \"Commercial\n\nCourt\" in sub-section (3) are to be understood in the context of\n\ndefinition of \"Commercial Court\" as contained in Section 2(b), which\n\ndefines \"Commercial Court\" to mean the Commercial Court constituted\n\nunder section (1) of Section 3.            Section 6 defines \"Jurisdiction of\n\nCommercial Court\". Section 3(1) and Section 6 of the Commercial\n\nCourts Act, reads thus:\n\n      \"Section 3. Constitution of Commercial Courts:-\n\n      (1) The State Government, may after consultation with the concerned\n      High Court, by notification, constitute such number of Commercial\n      Courts at District level, as it may deem necessary for the purpose of\n      exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on those Courts under\n      this Act;\n\n            Provided that with respect to the High Courts having ordinary\n      original civil jurisdiction, the State Government may, after consultation\n      with the concerned High Court, by notification, constitute Commercial\n      Courts at the District Judge level; \n\n             Provided further that with respect to a territory over which the\n      High Courts have ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the State\n      Government may, by notification, specify such pecuniary value which\n      shall not be less than three lakh rupees and not more than the\n      pecuniary jurisdiction exercisable by the District Courts, as it may\n      consider necessary.\"\n\n      Section 6: Jurisdiction of Commercial Court.\n      6 . The Commercial Court shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and\n      applications relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value\n      arising out of the entire territory of the State over which it has been\n      vested territorial jurisdiction. \n                                          12                            7.ARP79_2022.doc \n\n      Explanation.-For the purposes of this section, a commercial dispute\n      shall be considered to arise out of the entire territory of the State over\n      which a Commercial Court has been vested jurisdiction, if the suit or\n      application relating to such commercial dispute has been instituted as\n      per the provisions of sections 16 to 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure,\n      1908 (5 of 1908).\" \n\n\n\n12.   On a cumulative reading of the provisions of Sub-section (3) of\n\nSection 10 read with Section 3(1) and Section 6 of the Commercial\n\nCourts Act, it is quite clear that in no manner the jurisdiction of the\n\nHigh Court under section 11 has been either disturbed or divested in\n\nmatters of appointment of an arbitral tribunal as provided for under\n\nsection 11 of the Aca. The words \"all applications or appeals arising out\n\nof such arbitration\" as used in sub-section (3) would certainly not\n\ncontemplate an application to be filed under section 11 of the Aca\n\nwhich is required to be filed before the High Court. Sub-section (3) of\n\nSection 10 confers the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court in\n\nsubstitution of any principal civil court of original jurisdiction, namely,\n\nbeing the position prior to the Commercial Courts Act being brought into\n\nforce, being such applications or appeals which otherwise would have\n\nlied before the Court, namely, the principal civil court of original\n\njurisdiction, which would now lie before the Commercial Court, if the\n\nsubject matter of arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value. \n\nThus, to read into sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the Commercial\n\nCourts Act to take within its ambit the jurisdiction and power in relation\n\nto the appointment of an arbitral tribunal, to be                 exercised by the \n                                    13                           7.ARP79_2022.doc\n\nCommercial    Court   exercising   territorial   jurisdiction     over    such\n\narbitration, when the exclusive jurisdiction to make appointment of an\n\narbitral tribunal within the meaning of section 11 of the Aca, is\n\nconferred on the High Court or the Supreme Court as the case may be\n\nunder section 11 of the Aca, it would amount to a complete misreading\n\nof sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act, and in\n\nfact would lead to an absurdity. Such an interpretation can never be\n\naccepted in terms of what Section 11 categorically provides qua the\n\npowers of the High Court to appoint an arbitral tribunal.           Thus, the\n\nobjection as urged on behalf of the respondent that the present\n\napplicatioin would lie before the Commercial Court at Pune or at Akluj\n\nmerely because the Commerical Court has been constituted is totally\n\nuntenable. \n\n\n13.   The next contention as urged on behalf of the respondent is\n\ntaking a clue from what has been provided below sub-clause(c) of sub-\n\nsection (6) of Section 11 of the Aca, namely that the Commercial Court\n\nneeds to be regarded as any person or institution designated by the High\n\nCourt to exercise powers under section 11. In my opinion, such an\n\nargument is totally unacceptable inasmuchas the Commercial Court can\n\nnever be any person or institution as understood in either sub-section\n\n(6) of Section 11 or sub-section (6-A) of Section 11 of Aca. It becomes\n\nclear from the provisions of sub-section (6-B) of Section 11 which\n                                    14                      7.ARP79_2022.doc\n\ncategorically provide that any person or institution which may be\n\ndesignated by the Supreme or High Court, for the purposes of Section 11\n\nshall not be regarded as a delegation of any judicial power by the\n\nSupreme Court or the High Court. It would be absurdity to accept such\n\nargument inasmuch as the Commercial court would be a \"Court\"\n\nexercising judicial powers as clear from the provisions of Commercial\n\nCourts Act, 2015. Thus, sub-section (6) of Section 11 of the Aca when\n\nuses the word \"any person or institution\" necessarily it would be a\n\nperson or any institution which is not a Court and which would not have\n\nany judicial power and by virtue of such designation under sub-section\n\n(6-B) of Section 11, it shall not be regarded as a delegation of judicial\n\npower by the Supreme Court or the High Court. This objection as urged\n\non behalf of the respondent also needs to be rejected. \n\n\n14.   Thus what remains is to examine as to whether a valid arbitration\n\nagreement exists between the parties. The arbitration agreement\n\nbetween the parties is contained in Clause 15 and 14 respectively of the\n\nagreement(s) in question, which is not in dispute. There is also no\n\ndispute on the invocation of the arbitration agreements. It is a settled\n\nposition in law that in exercising jurisdiction under section 11(6) read\n\nwith sub-section (6-A), the Court is required to examine the existence of\n\nan arbitration agreement, and when the arbitration agreement subsists\n\nand other requirements as provided for under section 11 being satisfied,\n                                     15                       7.ARP79_2022.doc\n\nit will be necessary for this Court to exercise jurisdiction under section\n\n11 (See: Duro Felguera, S.A. vs. Gangavaram Port Ltd., (2017) 9 Scc\n\n729 and M/s. Mayavati Trading Pvt. Ltd. vs. Pradyuat Deb Burman,\n\n(2019) 8 Scc 714). Thus all the requirements for this Court to exercise\n\njurisdiction under Section 11(6) of the Aca are eminently present as\n\nclearly seen from the facts as noted above. \n\n\n15.   At this stage, learned counsel for the parties inform that the seat\n\nand venue of the arbitration proceedings shall be at Pune. \n\n\n16.   In the above circumstances, the petition would be required to be\n\nallowed. It is accordingly allowed by the following order:\n\n\n                          Order \n(i) Mr. Anurag M. Jain, Advocate is appointed as a sole arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes between the parties which have arisen under the Agreements in question. \n(ii) The learned sole arbitrator,  before entering the arbitration reference, shall forward a statement of disclosure as per the requirement of Section 11(8) read with Section 12(1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,1996, to the Prothonotary & Senior Master of this Court, to be placed on record of this application with a copy to be forwarded to both the parties;\n(iii) All contentions of the parties including the contentions of 16 7.ARP79_2022.doc the respondents on sufficiency of stamp duty on the documents are expressly kept open;\n(iv) At the first instance, the parties shall appear before the arbitral tribunal within a period of 15 days from the date the copy of the order is available.\n(v) The arbitral tribunal shall make an endeavour to adjudicate the disputes and differences between the parties as expeditiously as possible as provided for under section 29A of the ACA. \n(vi) The fees payable to the arbitral tribunal shall be as prescribed under the Bombay High Court (Fees Payable to Arbitrators) Rules,2018 and shall be borne by the parties in equal proportion. \n(vii) The petition is disposed of in the above terms.

(bsnl) on 8 april, 2022 author: anand pathak bench: anand pathak 1 w.p.no.4895/2022 high court of madhya pradesh bench at gwalior :single bench: {hon'ble shri justice anand pathak} writ petition no.4895/2022 (anil kumar tripathi through its proprietor vs. doorsanchar nigam ltd. (bsnl) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------shri akarsh chaturvedi, learned counsel for the petitioner. shri rajendra bhargav, learned counsel for the respondent. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------************* order (passed on 8th day of april, 2022) present petition under article 226 of the constitution of india has been preferred by petitioner/contractor being crestfallen by order dated 6.1.2022 passed by commercial court, district gwalior, whereby learned court below sought original record of arbitrator before considering the application under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (hereinafter referred as to 'the act') finally. 2. precisely stated facts of the case are that petitioner is a proprietor firm owned, managed and controlled by its proprietor shri girish chandra dubey engaged in construction business as contractor. respondent-bharat sanchar nigam limited (b.s.n.l.) is engaged as service provider in the field of telecommunication and is instrumentally of such state within the meaning of article 12 of the constitution of india. 3. it appears from the submissions and record that some contract was given by respondent to petitioner for laying o.f.c. cable but petitioner could not complete the work within the stipulated time and therefore, contract was cancelled vide order dated 8.7.2003 and placed under blacklist. matter went into arbitration and vide order dated 9.5.2011 (annexure p/1) sole contractor (shri m.n. singh, general manager telecommunication (retired) bhopal) passed arbitral award and partly allowed the claim of petitioner. 4. being aggrieved by that, respondent preferred application for setting aside arbitral award under section 34 of the act before the seventh additional sessions judge, gwalior. vide order dated 30.11.2011, application under section 34 of the act was dismissed. thereafter, arbitration appeal under section 37 of the act was preferred before division bench of this court vide arbitration appeal no.01/2012 (general manager bsnl vs. anil kumar tripathi). vide order dated 22.04.2016, division bench of this court quashed the order dated 30.11.2011 passed by the court below and remitted the matter to the court below for adjudication of the objections preferred by the respondent in the application under section 34 of the act by passing a speaking order. 5. again matter was considered and vide order dated 18.10.2016, learned court below set aside the award dated 9.5.2011 passed by the arbitrator and matter was remanded back to the arbitrator for adjudication on the basis of documents and pleadings advanced by the parties. 6. this time taking exception to the said order, petitioner preferred an arbitration appeal no.3/2016 (anil kumar tripathi vs. mahaprabhandak, doorsanchar nigam limited) before the division bench of this court and vide order dated 11.2.2019 considering the judgment rendered by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of kinnari mullick and another vs. ghanshyam das damani, 2018 (11) scc 328, in which earlier judgment of the supreme court mcdermott international inc. vs. burn standard co. ltd and others, 2006 (11) scc 181, learned division bench of this court came to the conclusion that while deciding the application under section 34 of the act, the court below has no jurisdiction to remand the matter to the arbitrator for afresh decision. 7. therefore, impugned order of remand was set aside and while restoring the proceedings under section 34 of the act before the court below with a direction to the commercial court to exercise the jurisdiction/ discretion conferred under sub-section (4) of section 34 of the act and adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal and an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or take such other action as in the opinion of arbitral tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. 8. thereafter, matter got revived before commercial court and proceedings are still pending. many a time counsel sought time, thereafter, shadow of covid-19 pandemic loomed over court proceedings and record was not available. therefore, on 6.1.2022 commercial court directed for requisition of original record of arbitrator before proceeding for final hearing for application under section 34 of the act. 9. being aggrieved by order dated 6.1.2022, whereby record has been called, petitioner/contractor preferred this petition under article 226/227 of the constitution of india. 10. it is the submission of learned counsel for the petitioner that matter is pending for a very long period before commercial court and instead of deciding the case, commercial court asked for original record of the arbitrator and therefore, effectively remanded the matter back to the arbitrator and same is not permissible. therefore, this petition has been filed. learned counsel for the petitioner placed the order of the supreme court in the case of i-pay clearing services private limited vs. icici bank limited, reported in 2022 (3) scc 121 and submitted that learned commercial court erred in calling the record as it amounts to remanding the matter back to the arbitral tribunal. according to him, learned court below erred illegality and perversity. 11. per contra, learned counsel for the respondent opposed the prayer and submitted that only record has been called and remand order is not being passed, therefore, no case for interference is made out. according to him, learned court below would consider the rival submissions after requisition of record in original from arbitral tribunal. he supported the impugned order. 12. heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and perused the documents appended thereto. 13. this is a case where petitioner/contractor is aggrieved by the order dated 6.1.2022 passed by commercial court, gwalior, whereby record is being called for from arbitral tribunal at the time of final hearing. 14. grievance of petitioner as reflected in the submissions is that the commercial court remitted the matter to the arbitral tribunal which is not permissible as per the section 34 (4) of the act and the judgment rendered by the apex court in the case of kinnari mullick (supra) and icici bank limited (supra). 15. on close scrutiny, it appears that commercial court below has not remitted the matter to the arbitral tribunal as per the section 34 (4) of the act, whereas in fact after revival of application under section 34 of the act before the commercial court, direction was given to the court below to exercise the jurisdiction/discretion conferred under sub-section 4 of section 34 of the act. direction as given by the learned division bench in its order dated 11.2.2019 in arbitration appeal no.3/2016 is reproduced for ready reference:15. . thus, being settled that, the court while deciding the petition under section 34 of 1996 act has no jurisdiction to remand the matter to the arbitrator for a fresh decision; therefore, the impugned order to the extent it set asides the award and remand the matter to the 'arbitrator' for fresh decision, cannot be approved. however, since the trial court was in seisin with the petition under section 34 of 1996 act on its remand by order dated 22.04.2016 passed in a.a.no. 1/2012 for adjudication on the objection afresh preferred by the general manager, bsnl. and since the trial court formulated an opinion that the said objection and the cogent material whereon the objections were raised were not considered by the arbitrator; therefore, while setting aside the impugned order, the proceedings under section 34 of 1996 act before the trial court is restored with a direction to the trial court to exercise the jurisdiction/discretion conferred under sub-section (4) of section 34 of 1996 act; and adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of arbitral tribunal will eliminate the ground for setting aside the arbitral award. the appeal is disposed of finally in above terms. no costs.\" 16. therefore, apparently the court below is trying to fathom the controversy in correct perspective and trying to conclude it finally, therefore, proceedings under section 34 of the act is still pending, ergo, contention of petitioner that matter has been remanded back does not hold ground. only direction given in the impugned order is sent for record or to requisition the record so that application under section 34 of the act can be decided on its own merits. at this stage, exemption regarding remand appears to be misplaced and an attempt to pre-empt the controversy. 17. it is true that recent judgment of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of icici bank limited (supra), the apex court has given guidance in following words regarding remand in paras 19 to 21 :19. as contended by learned senior counsel for the appellant, it is true that section 34 (4) of the act is couched in a language, similar to article 34 (4) of the uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration. in the case of akn & anr. v. alc & ors.4, by considering legislative history of the model law, it was held by singapore court of appeals that remission is a 'curative alternative'. in the case of kinnari mullick and anr. v. ghanshyam das damani, relied on by learned senior counsel for the appellant, the question which fell for consideration was whether section 34 (4) of the act empowers the court to relegate the parties before the arbitral tribunal after setting aside the arbitral award, in absence of any application by the parties. in fact, in the said judgment, it is held that the quintessence for exercising power under section 34 (4) of the act is to enable the tribunal to take such measures which can eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award, by curing the defects in the award. in the judgment in the case of dyna technologies pvt. ltd. v. crompton greaves ltd., it was a case where there was no inquiry under section 34 (4) of the act and in the said case, this court has held that the legislative intention behind section 34 (4) of the act, is to make the award enforceable, after giving an opportunity to the tribunal to undo the curable defects. it was not a case of patent illegality in the award, but deficiency in the award due to lack of reasoning for a finding which was already recorded in the award. in the very same case, it is also clearly held that when there is a complete perversity in the reasoning, then the same is a ground to challenge the award under section 34 (1) of the act. the case of som datt builders limited v. state of kerala is also a case where no reasons are given for the finding already recorded in the award, as such, this court held that in view of section 34 (4) of the act, the high court ought to have given arbitral tribunal an opportunity to give reasons. 20. the aforesaid case law cited by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant, is distinguishable on facts and would not render any assistance in this case. when it is the specific case of the respondent that there is no finding at all, on point no.1 viz. \"whether the contract was illegally and abruptly terminated by the respondent?\", remission under section 34 (4) of the act, is not permissible. in our view, section 34(4) of the act, can be resorted to record reasons on the finding already given in the award or to fill up the gaps in the reasoning of the award. there is a difference between 'finding' and 'reasons' as pointed out by the learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent in the judgment in the case of income tax officer, a ward, sitapur v. murlidhar bhagwan das. it is clear from the aforesaid judgment that 'finding is a decision on an issue'. further, in the judgment in the case of j. ashoka v. university of agricultural sciences and ors., this court has held that 'reasons are the links between the materials on which certain conclusions are based and the actual conclusions'. in absence of any finding on point no.1, as pleaded by the respondent and further, it is their case that relevant material produced before the arbitrator to prove 'accord and satisfaction' between the parties, is not considered, and the same amounts to patent illegality, such aspects are to be considered by the court itself. it cannot be said that it is a case where additional reasons are to be given or gaps in the reasoning, in absence of a finding on point no.1 viz. \"whether the contract was illegally and abruptly terminated by the respondent?\" 21. further, section 34 (4) of the act itself makes it clear that it is the discretion vested with the court for remitting the matter to arbitral tribunal to give an opportunity to resume the proceedings or not. the words \"where it is appropriate\" itself indicate that it is the discretion to be exercised by the court, to remit the matter when requested by a party. when application is filed under section 34 (4) of the act, the same is to be considered keeping in mind the grounds raised in the application under section 34 (1) of the act by the party, who has questioned the award of the arbitral tribunal and the grounds raised in the application filed under section 34 (4) of the act and the reply thereto. merely because an application is filed under section 34 (4) of the act by a party, it is not always obligatory on the part of the court to remit the matter to arbitral tribunal. the discretionary power conferred under section 34 (4) of the act, is to be exercised where there is inadequate reasoning or to fill up the gaps in the reasoning, in support of the findings which are already recorded in the award. under guise of additional reasons and filling up the gaps in the reasoning, no award can be remitted to the arbitrator, where there are no findings on the contentious issues in the award. if there are no findings on the contentious issues in the award or if any findings are recorded ignoring the material evidence on record, the same are acceptable grounds for setting aside the award itself. under guise of either additional reasons or filling up the gaps in the reasoning, the power conferred on the court cannot be relegated to the arbitrator. in absence of any finding on contentious issue, no amount of reasons can cure the defect in the award. a harmonious reading of section 31, 34 (1), 34 (2a) and 34 (4) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, make it clear that in appropriate cases, on the request made by a party, court can give an opportunity to the arbitrator to resume the arbitral proceedings for giving reasons or to fill up the gaps in the reasoning in support of a finding, which is already rendered in the award. but at the same time, when it prima facie appears that there is a patent illegality in the award itself, by not recording a finding on a contentious issue, in such cases, court may not accede to the request of a party for giving an opportunity to the arbitral tribunal to resume the arbitral proceedings. further, as rightly contended by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent, that on the plea of 'accord and satisfaction' on further consideration of evidence, which is ignored earlier, even if the arbitral tribunal wants to consciously hold that there was 'accord and satisfaction' between the parties, it cannot do so by altering the award itself, which he has already passed.\" 18. now, if the guidance given by the supreme court is seen in juxta position to section 34 of the act, then the very provisions rendered the case of petitioner devoid of merit. section 34 of the act is reproduced as under:34. application for setting aside arbitral award :(1) recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3). (2) an arbitral award may be set aside by the court only if-(a) the party making the application [establishes on the basis of the record of the arbitral tribunal that](i) a party was under some incapacity, or (ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or (iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration; provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or (v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this part from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this part; or (b) the court finds that-(i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force, or (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of india. [explanation.1. --for the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that that an award is in conflict with the public policy of india, only if,(i) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81; or (ii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice] [explanation 2.for the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law shall not be entail a review on the merits of the dispute.] [(2a) an arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the court, if the court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence. (3) an application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal: provided that if the court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter. (4) on receipt of an application under subsection (1), the court may, where it is appropriate and it is so requested by a party, adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of arbitral tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. [(5) an application under this section shall be filed by a party only after issuing a prior notice to the other party and such application shall be accompanied by an affidavit by the applicant endorsing compliance with the said requirement.] [(6) an application under this section shall be disposed of expeditiously, and in any event, within a period of one year form the date on which the notice referred to in sub-section (5) is served upon the other party.]\" 19. perusal of section 34 (2) (a) of the act reveals that court may set aside the award if the party making the application establishes on the basis of record of arbitral tribunal, meaning thereby that court can certainly go for perusal of the record and therefore, requisition of record from arbitral tribunal is not akin to remanding the matter to arbitral tribunal but to ascertain the exact nature of dispute through record of case. therefore, case of the petitioner is not supported by relevant provision itself. 20. since it is not a case of remand per se, therefore, judgments relied upon by the petitioner are not applicable in the present set of facts. the commercial court is within a domain to call for the record from arbitral tribulnal for deciding the application under section 34 (1) and (4) of the act. 21. resultantly, petition fails and is hereby dismissed.
