This appeal is directed against order dated 30th January 2021 passed by learned Commercial Court, Naya Raipur by which, appellant's application under Order 21 Rule 46-A read with Section 151 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as also an application under Section 47 r/w Order 21 Rule 58 Cpc has been rejected. \nDispute between the parties as aforesaid led to reference of the dispute for arbitration to the Arbitrators. The Arbitration proceedings eventually culminated in an Award dated 11.6.2018. \nAs the pleadings revealed, appellant filed an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short \"the Arbitration Act\") before the High Court of Delhi. Prayer was made for setting aside the Award. Said application was, however, dismissed vide an order dated 3.4.2019 on the grounds of limitation only. \nIt is further revealed from the pleadings that an Appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act has also been preferred which is said to be pending before the appellate forum. \n2. The respondent, however, moved an execution application for execution of Award before the learned Commercial Court, Naya Raipur. It is also disclosed on facts that remedy has also been taken seeking stay of operation of the arbitral Award and additional Award passed by the Arbitrators, wherein orders have been passed and various proceedings are pending. \n3. Learned Commercial Court, Naya Raipur, however, passed an order on 23 rd January 2020 issuing directions towards attachment of an amount of Rs.15,52,96,141/- lying in the bank account of judgment debtor/appellant herein. Thereafter, respondent- decree holder also filed application on 7.3.2020, purporting to be an application under Section 151 Cpc seeking issuance of further direction for transfer of the aforesaid amount to the Bank accounts of the Court and, thereafter, release of the same in favour of the decree holder. \n4. While matter stood thus, the appellant moved various applications including two applications, with which we are concerned in the present case, one being an application under Order 21 Rule 46-A r/w Section 151 Cpc and another being an application under Section 47 r/w Order 21 Rule 58 Cpc. Both these applications came to be rejected by the impugned order giving rise to this appeal. \n5. The respondent, however, raised preliminary objection regarding maintainability of the instant Arbitration Appeal mainly relying upon two decisions of the Supreme Court in the case of Kandla Export Corporation & Another (2018) 14 Scc 715 and Bgs Sgs Soma Jv Vs. Nhpc Ltd. (2020) 4 Scc 234. Learned senior counsel appearing for respondent made pointed submission that as the order impugned does not fall in the category of orders as exhaustively enumerated in Section 37 of the Arbitration Act read with Section 13 of the Commercial Court Act, 2015, the appeal is not maintainable. \n6. Replying to the said objection, learned counsel for the appellant argued that proviso to sub-Section (1A) of Section 13 of the Commercial Court Act has to be interpreted liberally and widely to include within its scope and ambit, the orders of the nature which have been passed by the Commercial Court and impugned in the appeal. Referring to the provision contained therein and relying upon decisions in the cases of Hubtown Limited Vs. Idbi Trusteeship Service 2016 Scc On-line Bombay 9019, order dated 5th July 2021 passed by the High Court of Delhi in the case of Delhi Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Pvt. L td. & Anr. and order dated 16.3.2020 passed by the High Court of Delhi in D & H India Ltd. Vs. Superon Schweisstechnik India Ltd. , it has been contended that the appeal in the present case would certainly be maintainable under the statutory scheme of appeal engrafted under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. \n7. After hearing learned counsel for the parties and the judgment cited at the bar before us, we are of the considered view that objection to the maintainability of the appeal has to be sustained in view of authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme Court in the cases of Kandla Export Corporation (supra) and BGS SGS Soma JV (supra).\n8. In the case of Kandla Export, Their Lordships in the Supreme Court examined statutory scheme of appeals under the Arbitration Act as also under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. Taking into consideration the statement of objects and reasons of the Commercial Courts Act and various provisions contained in Sections 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 21 of the Commercial Courts Act, it was held as below :-\n\"13. Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, with which we are immediately concerned in these appeals, is in two parts. The main provision is, as has been correctly submitted by Shri Giri, a provision which provides for appeals from judgments, orders and decrees of the Commercial Division of the High Court. To this main provision, an exception is carved out by the proviso. The primary purpose of a proviso is to qualify the generality of the main part by providing an exception, which has been set out with great felicity in CIT v. Indo-Mercantile Bank Ltd., thus: (SCR pp.-266-67: AIR pp 717-18 paras 9-10)\n\"9... The proper function of a proviso is that it qualifies the generality of the main enactment by providing an exception and taking out as it were, from the main enactment, a portion which, but for the proviso would fall within the main enactment. Ordinarily it is foreign to the proper function of a proviso to read it as providing something by way of an addendum or dealing with a subject which is foreign to the main enactment. \n'8.......It is a fundamental rule of construction that a proviso must be considered with relation to the principal matter to which it stands as a proviso'.\nTherefore, it is to be construed harmoniously with the main enactment. (Per Das, C.J. in Abdul Jabar Butt v. State of Jammu & Kashmir [(1957) SCR 51, 59]).\nBhagwati, J., in Ram Narain Sons Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax [(1955) 2 SCR 483, 493]:\n'10. It is a cardinal rule of interpretation that a proviso to a particular provision of a statute only embraces the field which is covered by the main provision. It carves out an exception to the main provision to which it has been enacted as a proviso and to no other.\"\n10. Lord Macmillan in Madras & Southern Maharatta Railway Co. v. Bezwada Municipality [(1944) LR 71 IA 113, 122] laid down the sphere of a proviso as follows:\n'..... The proper function of a proviso is to except and deal with a case which would otherwise fall within the general language of the main enactment, and its effect is confined to that case. Where, as in the present case, the language of the main enactment is clear and unambiguous, a proviso can have no repercussion on the interpretation of the main enactment, so as to exclude from it by implication what clearly falls within its express terms.' The territory of a proviso therefore is to carve out an exception to the main enactment and exclude something which otherwise would have been within the section. It has to operate in the same field and if the language of the main enactment is clear it cannot be used for the purpose of interpreting the main enactment or to exclude by implication what the enactment clearly says unless the words of the proviso are such that that is its necessary effect. (Vide also Corporation of City of Toronto v. Attorney- General for Canada [(1946) AC 32, 37] .)\" \nApplying aforesaid principles of law, the scope and ambit of the proviso to sub- Section (1A) of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act as also provision contained in Section 37 of the Arbitration Act was examined and Their Lordships held as below:-\n\" 14. The proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by the Commercial Division of the High Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure Code, 1908, and Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. It will at once be noticed that orders that are not specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the CPC would, therefore, not be appealable, and appeals that are mentioned in Section 37 of the Arbitration Act alone are appeals that can be made to the Commercial Appellate Division of a High Court. \n15. Thus, an order which refers parties to arbitration under Section 8, not being appealable under Section 37(1)(a), would not be appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. Similarly, an appeal rejecting a plea referred to in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 16 of the Arbitration Act would equally not be appealable under Section 37(2)(a) and, therefore, under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. \" \n9. The aforesaid decision was again relied upon in subsequent judgment in the case of BGS SGS Soma JV (supra). It was further enunciated that there is no independent right of appeal under Section 13 (1) of the Commercial Courts Act 2015, as below:-\n\"13. Given the fact that there is no independent right of appeal under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, which merely provides the forum of filing appeals, it is the parameters of Section 37 of the Arbitration Act,1996 alone which have to be looked at in order to determine whether the present appeals were maintainable. Section 37(1) makes it clear that appeals shall only lie from the orders set out in sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) and from no others. The pigeonhole that the High Court in the impugned judgement has chosen to say that the appeals in the present cases were maintainable is sub-clause (c). According to the High Court, even where a Section 34 application is ordered to be returned to the appropriate Court, such order would amount to an order \"refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section 34\".\n14. Interestingly, under the proviso to Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, Order XLIII of the CPC is also mentioned. Order XLIII Rule(1)(a) reads as follows:\n\"1. Appeals from orders.- An appeal shall lie from the following orders under the provisions of Section 104, namely- (a)an order under Rule 10 of Order VII returning a plaint to be presented to the proper Court except where the procedure specified in rule 10A of Order 7 has been followed;\"\nThis provision is conspicuous by its absence in Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of filing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the impugned judgment is the words \"under Section 34\". \nThus, the refusal to set aside an arbitral award must be under Section 34, i.e., after the grounds set out in Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question, and after the Court has turned down such grounds. Admittedly, on the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special Commercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application filed under Section 151 read with Order VII Rule 10 CPC, determining that the Special Commercial Court at Gurugram had no jurisdiction to proceed further with the Section 34 application, and therefore, such application would have to be returned to the competent court situate at New Delhi. \"\n10.The aforesaid authoritative pronouncements of the Supreme Court in the two decisions leave no scope for further arguments relying upon decision passed in other judgments referred to herein above as the Supreme Court has very clearly held that the proviso to sub-Section (1-A) of Section 13 of the Commercial Court Act goes on to hold that remedy of appeal under the provision of the aforesaid two Acts is available only against those orders which are specifically and exhaustively enumerated therein and orders which do not fall within the scope and ambit of the orders specified therein, appeal shall not lie.\n11.Indisputably, in the present case, the order which has been impugned in this case is not one which has been provided under the Law. \nIt is well settled that unless there is an express provision for appeal, no appeal would lie and such a right cannot be implied. \n12.Inescapable conclusion, therefore, is that the present appeal is not maintainable under the Law and the appellant's remedy lies elsewhere. \n13.The objection to the maintainability of the appeal is, therefore, sustained and the appeal is dismissed as not maintainable, however, leaving the appellant to work out its remedy as may be available to it under the Law. \n                           Sd/-                                       Sd/- - \n                (Manindra Mohan Shrivastava)                 (Vimla Singh Kapoor) \n            14.

sharma judgment reportable 22/08/2019 (per hon'ble mr. justice mohammad rafiq) these three matters, two appeals and a writ petition, raise a common question of law as to which of the two courts;principal civil court, having the original jurisdiction in a district i.e. the court of district and sessions judge, as defined under section 2(1)(e) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (for short 'the arbitration act') or the commercial court constituted under section 3(1) of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015 (for short 'the commercial courts act') and as defined in section 2(b) of that act, (3 of 19) [cma-12/2019] would be competent to execute an arbitral award, on a \"commercial dispute\" passed under the arbitration act? before adverting to the rival submissions, we deem it appropriate to briefly notice the facts of these matters. appeal no. 12/2019 has been filed by the appellant ess kay fincorp limited assailing order dated 20.10.2018 passed by the commercial court, ajmer (for short 'the commercial court'), dismissing execution application no. 06/2018 seeking execution of the award dated

interest @ 18% per annum from 01.02.2018 till the same is realized as also a sum of rs. 2,000/towards arbitration fee and cost to the appellant. writ petition no. 4379/2019 seeks to challenge order dated 21.12.2018 passed by the commercial court no.1, jaipur (rajasthan) in cis/case no. ex.42/2018. in this case, respondent no. 1, m/s. solcon engineers private limited filed a civil suit against (4 of 19) [cma-12/2019] the petitioner, rajasthan state cooperative oilseed growers federation limited and respondent no.2, national heavy engineering cooperative limited in the court of civil judge, senior division, pune (maharashtra) for recovery of a sum of rs. 21,95,833/-. the suit was filed on the basis of agreement executed between respondent no. 1 and respondent no. 2. on request of respondent no. 2, the court referred the matter to the arbitral tribunal for adjudication of the disputes between them. the arbitral tribunal by award dated 24.07.2004 allowed the claim of respondent no. 1. respondent no. 2 filed objections against the award before district and sessions judge, pune (maharashtra) which were dismissed vide judgment dated 23.04.2008. it is thereafter that the application under section 36 of the arbitration act was filed seeking execution of the award before the court of district and sessions judge, pune. on application of respondent no.1, the said execution application was transferred to the court of district and sessions judge, jaipur metropolitan, jaipur, who transferred the same to the commercial court no.1, jaipur. thereafter, the petitioner received show cause notice but the commercial court no. 1, jaipur vide order dated 28.11.2018 transferred the execution application to the court of district and sessions judge, jaipur metropolitan, jaipur directing the parties to appear before that court. according to the petitioner, presiding officer of the commercial court no.1, jaipur sent letter to the district and sessions judge, jaipur metropolitan and observed that necessary order from that court be awaited. the matter was adjourned to 14.12.2018 and thereafter, it was again adjourned to 21.12.2018. however, on 21.12.2018, learned commercial court resumed the execution proceedings observing that since no (5 of 19) [cma-12/2019] response has been received from the district court, jaipur metropolitan, jaipur to its letter dated 12.12.2018, the proceedings can not be kept pending indefinitely. the petitioner has filed this writ petition challenging the competence of the commercial court no. 1, jaipur to execute the arbitral award. mr. himanshu sharma, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants in the aforementioned two appeals argued that an application for execution of the award filed under section 36 of the arbitration act, as per section 10(3) of the commercial courts act, would ordinarily lie before the court of original jurisdiction in a district. this, however, is subject to section 15(2) of the commercial courts act, which inter alia provides that all suits and applications, including applications under the arbitration act, relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a commercial court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such commercial court. a conjoint reading of section 10(3) and 15(2) of the commercial courts act thus makes it clear that application under section 36 of the arbitration act for execution of the award, subject matter of which is a commercial dispute, would lie only before the commercial court and not before the principal civil court, i.e. the court of district judge. it is argued that the learned commercial court has wrongly relied upon the judgment of the supreme court in sundaram finance limited represented by j. thilak, senior manager (legal) vs. abdul samad and another, (2018) 3 scc 622. the supreme court therein held that arbitral proceedings stand terminated upon passing of final award and in that context, observed that it is not appreciated how section 42 of the said act, (6 of 19) [cma-12/2019] which deals with the jurisdiction issue in respect of the arbitral proceedings, would have any relevance. learned counsel, in support of his argument, relied upon judgment of the supreme court in state of west bengal & others vs. associated contractors, (2015) 1 scc 32. the supreme court in that case held that section 42 applies in all applications made before, during or after the arbitral proceedings are over. thus, the judgment delivered in sundaram finance limited represented by j. thilak, senior manager (legal) (supra) being in direct conflict with latter judgment delivered in state of west bengal & others vs. associated contractors (supra) to the extent of applicability of section 42 of the arbitration act after passing the award, the latter judgment will prevail. it is argued that termination of arbitral proceedings in any case would not make the arbitration act inapplicable on applications filed for execution of the arbitral award. learned commercial court wrongly arrived at the conclusion that only if objection against the award is filed before the commercial court, the application for execution of award under section 36 of the arbitration act would be considered as an application arising out of that act as per section 10(3) of the commercial courts act and not otherwise. the commercial court illegally held that since objections under the arbitration act were not preferred before the commercial court, the application under section 36 of the arbitration act cannot be said to be an application arising out of that act as per section 10(3) of the commercial courts act. learned counsel for the appellants further argued that the commercial court committed grave error in not following the judgment of gujarat high court in m/s. oci corporation vs. (7 of 19) [cma-12/2019] kandla export corporation (misc. civil application (for transfer) no. 2969 of 2016 filed in misc. civil application no. 2977 of 2016 decided on 11.11.2016). in support of his arguments, learned counsel has also relied upon the judgments of gujarat high court in m/s. oci corporation (supra), which has been upheld by the supreme court while dismissing petition for special leave to appeal (c) no. 6557/2017, kandla export corporation & others vs. m/s. oci corporation vide order dated 03.03.2017; vadodara mahanag seva sadan formaly known as municipal corporation vs. m s khurana engineering ltd. (r/special civil application no. 13736 of 2018 decided on 06.09.2018); judgment of bombay high court in jet airways (india) limited vs. subrata roy sahara, 113 (6) bom lr 3835; judgment of high court of chhattisgarh at bilaspur in south eastern coal fields ltd. vs. m/s. tirupati construction district burhar (tpc no. 4 of 2018 decided on 10.01.2018), 2018 scc online chh 63. mr. vikas jain, learned counsel for the respondent in writ petition no. 4379/2019 argued that the court of superior most jurisdiction in the district is the court defined by section 2(1)(e) of the arbitration act as interpreted by the supreme court in state of maharashtra through executive engineer, road development division no. 111, panvel & another vs. atlanta limited, (2014) 11 scc 619. while the jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matter is provided in section 10 of the commercial courts act, section 15 thereof contemplates transfer of all suits and applications including applications under the arbitration act pending in civil courts in any district or pending in high court where commercial (8 of 19) [cma-12/2019] division is constituted or area in respect of which the commercial courts have been constituted. therefore, it is clear that in respect of commercial dispute, the commercial court would be the only competent court to execute the award passed under the arbitration act and not the ordinary civil court. learned counsel in support of his arguments relied upon judgments of gujarat high court in vijay cotton and fiber company vs. agarwal cotton spinning private limited, r/appeal no. 216 of 2018 decided on 11.02.2019; m/s. oci corporation (supra); vadodara mahanag seva sadan formaly known as municipal corporation (supra); judgment of bombay high court in sushila singhania & others vs. bharat hari singhania & others, 2017 (3) abr 357. mr. alok garg, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner in writ petition no. 4379/2019 argued that section 2 of the commercial courts act nowhere prescribes that the execution application shall be entertained by the commercial court. reading of section 15(2) of the commercial courts act would make it clear that the word \"application\" referred to therein is the original application like application filed under sections 9 and 34 of the arbitration act. the object of the creation of commercial court is speedy disposal of commercial matters involving trade and commerce to ease the business transactions. as such, execution application is not maintainable before the commercial court and has to be transferred to the court of district and sessions judge. in fact, the commercial court no. 1, jaipur vide order dated 14.12.2018 required the parties to give appearance before the court of district and sessions judge, jaipur metropolitan and further (9 of 19) [cma-12/2019] directed to reduce the file from pendency list for the purpose of statistics. the commercial court thereafter could not resume the proceedings of execution petition. learned counsel in support of his arguments relied upon the judgment of high court of chhattisgarh at bilaspur in south easters coalfields limited (secl) through the chief general manager, secl, sohagpur area, district shahdol, madhya pradesh vs. padam kumar singhaniya (tpc no. 59 of 2017 decided on 22.01.2018) and submitted that aforesaid judgment has been upheld by the supreme court while dismissing petition for special leave to appeal (c) no. 14884/2018 south eastern coal fields ltd. (secl) vs. padam kumar singhaniya decided on 05.07.2018. we have given our anxious consideration to rival submissions, carefully perused the material on record and studied the cited precedents. the commercial court, ajmer has relied upon the judgment of the supreme court in sundaram finance limited represented by j. thilak, senior manager (legal) (supra) in holding that an application under section 36 of the arbitration act for execution of award cannot be treated as an original or independent application de hors the main arbitration proceedings in which final award has already been rendered, thus resulting into termination of arbitration proceedings. in the aforesaid case, respondent abdul samad defaulted in payment of a loan taken for vehicle from the appellant financial institution. an ex-parte award was passed against the respondents. case of the appellant before the supreme court was that the award being enforceable as a decree under section 36 of the arbitration act, execution (10 of 19) [cma-12/2019] proceedings were filed in the jurisdiction of the courts at morena, madhya pradesh under section 47 read with section 151 and order 21 rule 27 cpc. plea of the respondent was that the vehicle concerned was stolen. the trial court returned the execution application on the ground of jurisdiction. due to conflicting views of various high courts, the appellant therein directly approached the supreme court against the order of the trial court. in those facts, the supreme court held that some high courts are of the incorrect view that transfer of decree should first be obtained before filing the execution petition before the court where the assets are located, while other high courts are of the correct view that an award is to be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the cpc in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court as per section 36 of the arbitration act, which does not imply that the award is a decree of a particular court, and it is only a fiction. thus, the award can be filed for execution before the court where the assets of the judgment debtor are located. section 36 of the arbitration act would show that an award is to be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the cpc in the same manner as if it were a decree. it was in that context that the supreme court held that line of reasoning supporting the award to be filed in a so-called court of competent jurisdiction and then to obtain a transfer of the decree is primarily based on the jurisdiction clause found in section 42 of the arbitration act, which applies with respect to an application being filed in court under part i. the jurisdiction is over the arbitral proceedings. the subsequent application arising from that agreement and the arbitral proceedings are to be made in that court alone. however, the supreme court further observed that what has (11 of 19) [cma-12/2019] been lost sight of is section 32 of the arbitration act, which provides for arbitral proceedings to be terminated by the final arbitral award. thus, when an award is already made, of which execution is sought, the arbitral proceedings already stand terminated on the making of the final award. thus, section 42 of the arbitration act, which deals with the jurisdiction issue in respect of arbitral proceedings, does not have any relevance. the supreme court, therefore, held that the decree of civil court is liable to be executed primarily by the court which passes the decree where an execution application has to be filed at the first instance. an award under section 36 of the arbitration act is equated to a decree of the court for the purposes of execution and only for that purpose, an award passed by the arbitral tribunal is deemed to be a decree under section 36 of the arbitration act. there is no deeming fiction anywhere to hold that the court within whose jurisdiction the arbitral award is passed should be taken to be the court, which passed the decree. the arbitration act actually transcends all territorial barriers. thus, the enforcement of an award through its execution can be filed anywhere in the country where such decree can be executed and there is no requirement for obtaining a transfer of the decree from the court, which would have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings. clearly, the supreme court in the aforementioned case of sundaram finance limited represented by j. thilak, senior manager (legal) (supra) did not have the occasion to deal with inter play of section 36 of the arbitration act with sections 10(3) and 15(2) of the commercial courts act. the supreme court in state of west bengal & others vs. associated contractors (supra) was dealing with a case (12 of 19) [cma-12/2019] where an item rate tender was executed and signed between associated contractors and the concerned superintending engineer for execution of the work of excavation and lining of teesta-jaldhaka main canal from chainage 3 kms. to 3.625 kms. in police station mal, district jalpaiguri, west bengal. para 25 of the said contract contained an arbitration clause. the respondent therein filed an application under section 9 of the arbitration act for interim orders in the high court of calcutta. a learned single judge of the high court after granting leave under clause 12 of the letters patents, passed an ad-interim ex-parte injunction order, which was confirmed on 10.12.1998. meanwhile, a retired hon'ble judge was appointed as arbitrator under section 11 of the arbitration act to adjudicate upon the disputes between the parties. recall application filed by the state was dismissed on 20.01.2000. an appeal was filed against order dated 10.12.1998, confirming injunction order, before division bench in which operation of the same was stayed. learned arbitrator, however, passed the award on 30.06.2004. the state of west bengal filed an application under section 34 of the arbitration act to set aside the arbitral award before the principal civil court of the learned district judge at jalpaiguri, west bengal, which issued notice to the respondent. the respondent filed an application under article 227 of the constitution challenging the jurisdiction of the court of learned district judge at jalpaiguri. learned single judge of the high court of calcutta allowed the petition vide judgment dated 11.04.2005. the supreme court on examining definition of \"court\" given in section 2(1)(e) and provision of section 42 of the arbitration act, which are corresponding to provisions of section 2(c) and 31(4) of the arbitration act, 1940, observed thus: (13 of 19) [cma-12/2019] \"11. it will be noticed that section 42 is in almost the same terms as its predecessor section except that the words \"in any reference\" are substituted with the wider expression \"with respect to an arbitration agreement\". it will also be noticed that the expression \"has been made in a court competent to entertain it\", is no longer there in section 42. these two changes are of some significance as will be pointed out later. section 42 starts with a nonobstante clause which does away with anything which may be inconsistent with the section either in part i of the arbitration act, 1996 or in any other law for the time being in force. the expression \"with respect to an arbitration agreement\" widens the scope of section 42 to include all matters which directly or indirectly pertain to an arbitration agreement. applications made to courts which are before, during or after arbitral proceedings made under part i of the act are all covered by section 42. but an essential ingredient of the section is that an application under part i must be made in a court. 21. one other question that may arise is as to whether section 42 applies after the arbitral proceedings come to an end. it has already been held by us that the expression \"with respect to an arbitration agreement\" are words of wide import and would take in all applications made before during or after the arbitral proceedings are over. in an earlier judgment, kumbha mawji v. dominion of india, air 1953 sc 313, the question which arose before the supreme court was whether the expression used in section 31(4) of the 1940 act \"in any reference\" would include matters that are after the arbitral proceedings are over and have culminated in an award. it was held that the words \"in any reference\" cannot be taken to mean \"in the course of a reference\", but mean \"in the matter of a reference\" and that such phrase is wide enough and comprehensive enough to cover an application made after the arbitration is completed and the final award is made (see air pp. 317-18, paras 13-16). as has been noticed above, the expression used in section 42 is wider being \"with respect to an arbitration agreement\" and would certainly include such applications. 25. our conclusions therefore on section 2(1)(e) and section 42 of the arbitration act, 1996 are as follows: (a) xxxxxxxx (b) xxxxxxx (c) xxxxxxx (14 of 19) [cma-12/2019] (d) xxxxxxx (e) xxxxxxx (f) section 42 will apply to applications made after the arbitral proceedings have come to an end provided they are under part i. (g) xxxxxxxx.\" it may be noted that the judgment of the supreme court in sundaram finance limited represented by j. thilak, senior manager (legal) (supra) was delivered by two judges bench and judgment of the supreme court in state of west bengal & others vs. associated contractors (supra), which specifically dealt with provisions of section 10 and 15 of the commercial courts act, was delivered by three judges bench. therefore, in view of categorical finding recorded in state of west bengal & others vs. associated contractors (supra), it has to be accepted that section 42 of the arbitration act would govern the field not only in respect of the applications made to the court, before and during arbitral proceedings but also qua those filed after the arbitral proceedings are over provided that such applications are made in part i of the arbitration act. the expression \"with respect to an arbitration agreement\" as used in section 42 of the arbitration act, as held by the supreme court, are words of wider import and would take in its sweep all applications filed before, during or after, the arbitral proceedings are over provided such applications are made under part i, which, obviously would also include an application under section 36 of the arbitration act as it is very much covered by part i of the said act. gujarat high court in m/s. oci corporation (supra) was dealing with a case where m/s. oci corporation filed application (15 of 19) [cma-12/2019] under section 15(5) of the commercial courts act read with section 2(1)(e)(ii) and section 47 of the arbitration act seeking clarification and appropriate direction for transfer of execution petition pending before the district court, gandhidham-kutch either to the high court of gujarat or to appropriate commercial court/commercial division. gujarat high court on analysis of provisions of sections 2(e), 47 of the arbitration act and section 2(1)(i), section 6, 10, 15 of the commercial courts act in para 11 of the report held as under: \"11.00. the sum and substance of the above discussion would be, (1) where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, all the applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the commercial division where such commercial division has been constituted in the high court i.e. in the present case high court of gujarat. (2) where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute but not of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, considering the provisions of arbitration and conciliation (amendment) act, 2015 the same shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the concerned high court. (3) where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is other than international arbitration, all the applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 shall be filed in and heard, decided and disposed of by the commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial court has been constituted. considering section 15 of the commercial courts act, all the applications/appeals in question under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, therefore, are required to be transferred to the concerned commercial division of the high court of gujarat or (16 of 19) [cma-12/2019] before the gujarat high court or before the concerned commercial court and as observed hereinabove and as the case may be.\" the aforesaid judgment was subjected to challenge before the supreme court by kandla export corporation & others by filing petition for special leave to appeal (c) no. 6557/2017, which was dismissed vide order dated 03.03.2017. similar dispute again cropped up before gujarat high court at ahmedabad in vadodara mahanag seva sadan formaly known as municipal corporation (supra) wherein division bench of gujarat high court, relying upon its earlier judgment in m/s. oci corporation (supra), reiterated the same view. the question as to which court would be competent to exercise jurisdiction for execution of award passed under the arbitration act was also answered by the gujarat high court in vijay cotton and fiber company (supra) holding that the commercial court of competent jurisdiction would be the court to execute the decree and not the ordinary civil court constituted under gujarat civil courts act. section 10(3) and 15(2) of the commercial courts act both are relevant for deciding the controversy involved in the present matters and they are reproduced as under: \"10. jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters.-where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and(1) xxxxxxxxxxxxxx (2) xxxxxxxxxxxxxx (3) if such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district (not (17 of 19) [cma-12/2019] being a high court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial court has been constituted.\" \"15. transfer of pending cases.-(1) xxxxxxxxxxx (2) all suits and applications, including applications under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a commercial court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such commercial court: provided that no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the court prior to the constitution of the commercial division or the commercial court shall be transferred either under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2). (3) xxxxxxxxxxx (4) xxxxxxxxxxx (5) xxxxxxxxxx\" a conjoint reading of section 10(3) and 15(2) of the commercial courts act makes it clear that an application under section 36 of the arbitration act, seeking execution of award, satisfies the requirement of \"being application arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the act of 1996\". if such application is pending before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district, the same shall be transferred to commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial court has been constituted. in view of section 10(3) of the commercial courts act, since the awards in the present set of cases have been rendered in arbitral proceedings, their execution applications filed under section 36 of the arbitration act having regard to provisions of section 15(3) of the commercial courts act, which contemplates transfer of all such pending applications to commercial court, as a legal corollary thereto, would also be liable to be filed and maintained before the commercial (18 of 19) [cma-12/2019] court and not the ordinary civil court/principal court of district judge. in so far as judgment of chattisgarh high court in south eastern coalfields limited vs. padam kumar singhaniya (supra) relied by mr. alok garg, learned counsel for the petitioner is concerned, we are, with great respect, not inclined to concur with the view taken by that court that word, \"application\" mentioned in sub-section (2) of section 15 of the commercial courts act would only mean an original application and not an application for execution, which is preferred after the award has been delivered. in our considered opinion, there is no warrant for taking such narrow interpretation of section 15(2) of the commercial courts act. analogy which the learned judges of chhattisgarh high court have taken from proviso to section 15(2) of the commercial courts act is that since no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the court prior to the constitution of the commercial division or the commercial court, shall be transferred either under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of section 15 of the commercial courts act, therefore, application subsequently filed for execution of the award could also not be entertained by the commercial court. however, in our view, that is not the correct interpretation of proviso to section 15(2) of the commercial courts act, which has been engrafted therein only with a limited purpose of ensuring that cases in which arguments have been heard and judgments reserved, are given finality and not required to be reopened so as not to repeat those proceedings all over again. in view of above, we answer the question of law formulated in the beginning of this judgment in the terms that the (19 of 19) [cma-12/2019] commercial court constituted under section 3(i) of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015, as defined in section 2(b) of that act, would be the only competent court to execute an arbitral award on a \"commercial dispute\" passed under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 and not the principal civil court having the original jurisdiction in the district i.e. the court of district and sessions judge as defined under section 2(1)(e) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. in view of our opinion recorded above, appeals no. 12/2019 and 5890/2018 deserve to succeed and are accordingly allowed. the orders impugned therein are set aside. writ petition no. 4379/2019 is however dismissed. all the pending stay applications as also other interim applications, if any, stand disposed of. office is directed to place a copy of this judgment on record of each connected matter.
