For the sake of clarity, the Plaintiff and the Defendants in the suit shall be referred to as per their original nomenclature i.e. Appellants herein as the Defendants and the  Respondent herein as the Plaintiff. \n2. Heard Mr. O. A. Das, learned Counsel representing the Defendants and Mr. Kishor P. Vig learned Counsel representing the Plaintiff.\n3. This Appeal filed under Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the Act of 2015) seeks to challenge the order dated 2 nd December 2020 passed by the District Judge - 2, Thane whereby the application moved by the Appellants - Defendants under Order VII Rule 10 and Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Code\") read with Section 19(6) to (10) of Basavraj Page|2 362.21-ao.docx the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Recovery Act, 1993) has been rejected. \n4. The facts of the case which can be culled out from the pleadings available on record and the submissions made by the learned counsel for the respective parties are that the Plaintiff - Respondents instituted Commercial Suit No.6 of 2019 against the Appellants-Defendants for recovery of loss and damages and compensation of Rs.100 Crores + Rs.10,10,733/- together with interest on the said amount @ 13.95% p.a. from the date of institution of the suit till final realization. \n5. The said suit has been filed with the plaint allegations, inter alia, that the plaintiff is a partnership firm engaged in the business of builders and contractors since 1987 and that the Defendants fraudulently invoked the measures under the guise of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the SARFAESI Act) to grab the property of the partner of the Plaintiff.\n6. It has been submitted on behalf of the Appellants that Defendant No.1 sanctioned and granted cash credit limit of Rs.10 Basavraj Page|3 362.21-ao.docx Crores and further credit facility to the Plaintiff for their working capital requirement and that the credit facilities were sanctioned and granted vide sanction letter dated 24th January 2013 and Modified Sanctioned letter dated 28 th January 2013. Further submission on behalf of the Defendants is that in order to secure the credit facility, the Plaintiff executed certain security documents such as Demand Promissory Note for Rs.10 Crores dated 5th February 2013 in respect of the Cash Credit Facility, Bearer Letter for Rs.10 Crores dated 5 th February 2013 in respect of the Cash Credit Facility, Hypothecation-cum-Loan Agreement for Rs. 15 Crores dated 15 th February 2013 and a Composite Agreement dated 5th February 2013 . The Defendants further state that on the request of the Plaintiff, the Defendants issued Bank Guarantee dated 27th February 2013 for a sum of Rs.9,67,000/- which was valid till 26th February 2014. It is also stated that the Defendant No.1 sanctioned and granted additional cash credit / temporary Over Draft limit of Rs. 1 Crore to the Plaintiff for their working capital requirement as per the terms and conditions stipulated in the Memorandum of Sanction dated 12th October 2013. It is also the claim of the Defendants that as security towards the additional cash credit limit of Rs.1 Basavraj Page|4 362.21-ao.docx Crores, the Plaintiffs executed loan / security documents on 14 th October 2013 and further that equitable mortgage was also extended in respect of certain immovable properties. \n7. Further submission of the Defendants is that the Plaintiff committed default in repayment and accordingly, the account was declared as Non Performing Assets (NPA) on 27 th July 2014 and accordingly action under the SARFAESI Act was initiated by issuing Demand Notice under section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act. It is further asserted on behalf of the Defendants that since the outstanding dues were not paid by the Plaintiff even after receipt of the notice under Section 13(2), symbolic possession of the mortgage properties was taken on 3rd March 2015 under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act and further that the Defendants took physical possession of the property at Maruti House, Plot No.63, Sector 1, Shiravane, Nerul and also Bungalow named GODATEER at Plot No.11A Sector 21, Nerul, Navi Mumbai.\n8. Learned Counsel for the Defendants has further stated that the Defendants have filed Original Application bearing No.575 of 2017 against the Plaintiff before the Debts Recovery Tribunal No.3 at Mumbai (Vashi) for the recovery of a sum of Basavraj Page|5 362.21-ao.docx Rs.18,81,66,435/- which according to the Defendants is due against the Plaintiff on account of default in repayment of the credit facility sanctioned and granted to the Plaintiff. The said Original Application has been preferred under Section 19 of the Recovery Act, 1993. \n9. It has been further stated by the Defendants that in the Commercial Suit No.6 of 2019 filed by the Plaintiff an Application under Order VII Rule 10 and 11(d) of the CPC was preferred by the Defendants with a prayer that the plaint be rejected on the ground that jurisdiction to entertain the suit between the borrower and the Bank i.e. the Plaintiff and Defendants is with DRT at Mumbai and not the learned Trial Court. The Application moved by the Appellants further prayed, alternatively, that the plaint be returned to the Plaintiff for filing before appropriate forum. \n10. The said Application was contested by the Plaintiff. Learned Trial Court, by means of order dated 2nd December 2020 which is under challenge before us in this appeal, rejected the said Application by observing, inter alia, that the suit filed by the Plaintiff is based on the assertion of fraud and accordingly Basavraj Page|6 362.21-ao.docx declaration has been sought along with other reliefs and that such a relief as sought by the Plaintiff can be entertained by it, as the jurisdiction of the DRT is confined to hold inquiry and to adjudicate the issues brought before it within the scope of Section 17 of the Recovery Act, 1993. It has further been held by the learned Trial Court in the judgment under appeal herein that scope of inquiry relating to commission of any alleged fraud by the bankers is outside the scope of Section 17 of the Recovery Act, 1993 and hence, the prayer made by the Defendants in the Application moved under Order VII Rule 10 and Rule 11(d) of the CPC was liable to be rejected.\n11. It is this order dated 2nd December 2020 passed by the learned Trial Court which is under challenge in this appeal filed under Section 13 (1A) of the Act of 2015, whereby the Application moved by the Defendants with the prayer for rejecting the plaint or in the alternative, for returning the plaint has not been acceded to. \n12. At the outset of the arguments, the question which cropped up for consideration of this Court is to the maintainability of this appeal before the Division Bench of this Court keeping in view Basavraj Page|7 362.21-ao.docx the proviso appended to Section 13(1) of the Act of 2015 which provides that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court which are enumerated specifically under Order XLIII of the CPC and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 . The objection as to the maintainability of this appeal, thus, is that since the order under challenge herein is not enumerated under Order XLIII of the CPC and hence this appeal, in view of operation of the proviso appended to Section 13(1A) of the Act of 2015, is not entertainable and hence is liable to be dismissed.\n13. To appreciate the issue concerning maintainability of this appeal, it will be apposite to consider the provisions of Section 13 of the Act of 2015 before and after its amendment which has been effected w.e.f. 3rd May 2018. Section 13 which existed prior to its amendment in the year 2018 is quoted hereunder:\n\"Section 13 : Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions- - (1) Any person aggrieved by the decision of a Commercial Court or Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order, as the case may be.\nProvided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court Basavraj Page|8 362.21-ao.docx that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 as amended by this Act and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\" (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\"\n14. Section 13, after its amendment vide Act No.28 of 2018 reads as under:\n\"13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions. -\n(1) Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court below the level of a District Judge may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order. \n(1A) Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order:\nProvided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 as amended by this Act and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\" \nBasavraj                                                             Page|9                                                  362.21-ao.docx 15. If we compare the unamended provision with the amended provision of Section 13 of the Act of 2015, what we find is that earlier an appeal was provided against a \"decision\" of a Commercial Court or Commercial Division of a High Court to the Commercial Division of that High Court, whereas, after the amendment the expression \"decision\" has been substituted by the expression \"judgment or order\". It is also noticeable that the proviso appended to sub section (1) of section 13 which earlier existed has been retained in the amended provision as well. To determine as to whether the instant appeal is maintainable, we may also refer to sub section (2) of section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act which begins with a non-obstante clause and provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree under Section 13 otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the said Act. \n16. In our opinion, sub section 2 of Section 13 unequivocally provides that any appeal against a decree or order of a Commercial Court or Commercial Division shall lie only in accordance with the provisions of the Act and in view of what Basavraj Page|10 362.21-ao.docx has been provided for in sub section 2 of Section 13, the proviso appended to Section 13 assumes importance. \n17. Sub Section 1A of Section 13 provides that a person aggrieved by a judgment or order can file an appeal, however, the said provision is to be read in conjunction with the proviso which specifically states that an appeal shall lie only from orders which are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the CPC. The occurrences of the expression \"shall\" and \"specifically\" in the proviso has to be noted for correctly understanding the legislative intent in framing the scheme of Section 13 of the Act of 2015. It is also noteworthy that the order under challenge in this appeal has been passed by the learned trial court rejecting the Application moved by the Defendants under Order VII Rule 10 and Rule 11(d) of the CPC. Such an order is not enumerated in Order XLIII of the CPC, though Rule 1(a) of Order XLIII enlists an order passed under Order VII Rule 10 for returning the plaint. Thus, Order XLIII enlists the order passed on an Application under Order VII Rule 10 if it is allowed, however, it does not enlist the order in case such an Application is rejected. Order XLIII also does not enlist any order passed on an Application under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the CPC. \nBasavraj                                                             Page|11                                                                362.21-ao.docx 18 .        Learned       Counsel         for   the   Appellant,         however,           has emphasized that in view of the law laid down by Delhi High Court in the case of D & H India Ltd. Vs. Superon Schweisstechnik India Ltd.1 and in the case of Delhi Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Himgiri Realtors Pvt. Ltd. and Another2 , this appeal is maintainable. Learned Counsel for the Defendants has also referred to a judgment of Division Bench of this Court in the case of Skil- Himachal Infrastructure & Tourism Ltd. & Ors. Vs IL and FS Financial Services Ltd.3 19. So far as the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of D & H India Ltd. (supra) is concerned, it is to be noticed that the appeal in the said case was filed before a Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court from an order passed by the Commercial Division of that High Court. It is noteworthy that the appeal before the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court in this case was filed against an order under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC by the learned Single Judge exercising jurisdiction of Commercial Division of the High Court under the Commercial 1 268 (2020) Delhi Law Times 15 (DB) 2 2021 SCC Online Del 3603 3 2022 SCC Onine Bom 3152. \nBasavraj                                                                         Page|12                                                    362.21-ao.docx Courts Act. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of D & India Ltd. (supra) held the appeal to be maintainable by observing that the Court in that case was not concerned with the challenge to the order passed under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, rather under Order V of Chapter II of the 2018 Rules of the High Court, which reads as under:\n5. Appeal against Registrar's Order - Any person aggrieved by any order made by the Registrar under Rule 3 of this Chapter may within 15 days of such order appeal against the same to the Judge in Chambers. The appeal shall be in the form of the petition bearing court fees of Rs.2.65\". \n20 . We may also notice that as per the facts narrated in the judgment in the case of D & H India Ltd. (Supra) under the Rules of Delhi High Court, an Application to amend the plaint, petition, written statements, the Application or subsequent proceedings where amendment sought is formal in nature, is decided by the Registrar and in the said case such an Application was decided by the Registrar against which a Petition was filed before the Learned Single Judge who passed an order in his capacity as Commercial Division of the High Court against which an appeal was preferred before the Division Bench i.e. before the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court. It is in these Basavraj Page|13 362.21-ao.docx facts it has been held by the Delhi High Court that the appeal was maintainable giving the reason that it emanated from the order passed under rule 5 of Chapter 2 of Delhi High Court Original Side Rules and thus the Commercial Appellate Division of High Court was concerned with the order referable to Rule 5 of the Chapter 2 of the Delhi High Court Original Side Rules and not with the order referable to Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC.\n21. In the aforesaid facts of the case the Delhi High Court held the appeal to be maintainable, whereas, in the instant case the appeal before us has been filed against the order of the learned District Judge in his capacity as a Commercial Court under the Act of 2015. The order passed by a Court rejecting an Application preferred under Order VII Rule 10 and Rule 11(d) of the CPC, is not enumerated in order XLIII. Thus, the judgment of Delhi High Court in the case of D & H India Ltd. (supra) is clearly distinguishable and does not have any application to the present case. \n22. As far as the reliance placed by the learned counsel for the Defendants on the judgment of the Delhi Court in the case of Delhi Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Pvt. Ltd.\nBasavraj                                                                 Page|14                                                    362.21-ao.docx (supra) is concerned, we find that in the said judgment itself the Division Bench expressed doubts as to the correctness of the view taken in the judgment of D & H India Ltd. (supra), however, did not feel any need to make a reference of the question to a larger bench for the reasons disclosed in the said judgment. Paragraph 25 of the judgment in the Delhi Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Pvt. Ltd. (supra) is extracted hereinbelow:\n\"25. Though we, with due deference to the members of the Division Bench in D&H India Ltd. supra, entertain doubts as to the correctness of the view taken in D&H India Ltd. but do not, in the facts of the present case, feel the need to make a reference of the question to a larger bench; the reason is, that Bhandari Engineers & Builders Pvt. Ltd. supra, on which the impugned orders are based, while laying down the law laid down therein, also directs all Courts to abide thereby, resulting in plethora of similar challenges as made herein and it is deemed expedient to settle the law in that regard and which would remain pending if the question of maintainability of the appeal were to be referred to a larger bench.\"\n23. Thus, in view of the observations made by the Delhi High Court in paragraph 25 of the judgment in the case of Delhi Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Pvt. Ltd. (Supra), the said judgment also does not have any application so far as the instant appeal is concerned. \nBasavraj                                                             Page|15                                                            362.21-ao.docx 24. Reliance placed by the learned counsel for the Defendants on the judgment of a coordinate bench of this court in the case of Skil-Himachal Infrastructure (supra) is also highly misplaced. The said judgment analyses the unamended as also the amended provisions of Section 13 of the Act of 2015 along with various other provisions of the Act of 2015 and has, inter alia, thus concluded that an appeal from order granting conditional leave to defend any summons for judgment in a commercial summary suit is not maintainable. It is to be noticed at this juncture that an order granting conditional or unconditional leave to defend any summons for judgment passed under Order XXXVII Rule 5 of the CPC is not enumerated in order XLIII of the CPC. \n25. The Division Bench of this Court in the case of Skil- Himachal Infrastructure (supra) has taken note of the judgment in the case of Shailendra Bhadauria Vs. Matrix Partners India Investment Holdings LLC 2018 SCC OnLine Bom 13804 wherein it has been held that the judgments in the case of Hubtown Ltd. Vs. IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd., 2016 SCC OnLine Bom 9019 and Sigmarq Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Manugraph India Ltd. 2017 SCC OnLine Bom Basavraj Page|16 362.21-ao.docx 9191. Paragraph 44 of the judgment in the case of Shailendra Bhadauria (supra) is relevant which is extracted hereunder:\n\"44. Now, the Commercial Courts (Amendment) Act, 2018 amends the Act 4 of 2016 and deletes the word \"decision\"\nfrom Section 13. We have already reproduced it above. Thus, the earlier view in Hubtown Limited (supra) and Siqmarq Technologies (supra) will have to give way and all the more after the Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court delivered in the case of Fuerst Day Lawson Limited v. Jindal Exports Limited, reported in (2011) 8 SCC 333 and the authoritative and binding pronouncement in the case of Kandla Export Corporation (supra). The statute has to confer a right of appeal. That has to be conferred in clear words. We cannot, as suggested by Mr. Andhyarujina, by an interpretative process carve out a right of appeal, when the law is not creating it.\" \n26. The judgment in the case of Skil-Himachal Infrastructure & Tourism Ltd. & Ors. (supra) also takes note of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Kandla Export Corporation Vs. OCI Corporation (2018) 14 SCC 715. The observations made by the Division in paragraph 44 of the Skil-Himacahal Infrastructure & Tourism Ltd. & Ors. (supra) is also relevant which is extracted hereunder:\n\"44. In the Supreme Court decision in Kandla Export Corporation, Section 13 was addressed like this. First, that Section 13(1) of the CC Act is in two parts. The main provision deals with appeals from judgments, orders and decrees to the Commercial Division of the High Court. To this, the proviso is an exception. Second, the proviso must be construed harmoniously with the main provision, not in derogation of it. It operates in the same field. If main Basavraj Page|17 362.21-ao.docx provision is in clear language, the proviso cannot be used to 'interpret' the main part, or to exclude - let along by implication - any part of the main provision; except, of courts, if the proviso plainly contemplates such an exclusion. Under the proviso, appeals against orders are restricted to those orders under Order 43 of the CPC, and Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. Therefore, no appeal lies to the Commercial Appellate Division against any order not specifically listed in Order 43 of the CPC (or an order not under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act).\n27. Referring to the order which was under appeal in Skil- Himachal Infrastructure & Tourism Ltd. & Ors. (supra), the Division Bench in this case held that an order of conditional leave under Order XXXVII of the CPC is not enumerated in Order XLIII and that it is only an order and not a decree and therefore, in view of the law laid down in Kandla Export Corporation and Shailendra Bhadauria (supra), such an order is not appealable under the Act of 2015. \n28. Thus, from the discussion made above, we are clear in our mind that an appeal under Section 13(1A) of the Act of 2015 would lie only against the judgment and orders which are enumerated or enlisted under Order XLIII of the CPC. An order rejecting an Application moved under Order VII Rule 10 or Order VII Rule 11(d) of the CPC is not enumerated or enlisted in Order XLIII of the CPC hence, such an order is not appealable following the law Basavraj Page|18 362.21-ao.docx laid down by this court in the case of Skil-Himachal Infrastructure & Tourism Ltd. & Ors.

petitions' [hereinafter 'cmps' in plural and 'cmp' in singular for the sake of brevity]. 2. captioned cma is directed against an order dated 30.04.2024 made in arbitration original petition no.1 of 2024 (cnr no.tnsa 23000002-2024) by the commercial court, (district judge cadre), salem. this '30.04.2024 order' shall hereinafter (in this judgment/order) be referred to as 'impugned order' and 'commercial court, (district judge cadre), salem' shall be referred to as 'said commercial court', both for the sake of brevity, convenience and clarity. 3. to be noted, impugned order has been made in a section 9 application at the instance of four partners qua a 'partnership deed dated 26.05.2020' [hereinafter 'said partnership deed' for the sake of convenience] as regards a compendious name, i.e., partnership firm which goes by the name 'm/s.narasu's spinning mills' [hereinafter 'said firm' for the sake of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis brevity, convenience and clarity]. the aforementioned said partnership deed (dated 26.05.2020) has seven partners, i.e., seven individuals. this court is informed that two of them namely thiru.k.r.ramanujam s/o.k.v.radhakrishnan and tmt.r.indrani, w/o.k.r.ramanujam are no more. as already alluded to supra, four partners moved the said commercial court by way of a section 9 application and the fifth partner was arrayed as first respondent [r1]. bankers qua said firm, i.e., the two branches of a bank were arrayed as respondents 2 and 3 [r2 & r3] (hdfc, salem main branch and hdfc, omalur branch respectively). the firm itself has been arrayed as fourth respondent [r4] (a partnership firm is not a juristic person and it is only a compendious name but leave it at that owing to the perimeter of the legal drill on hand). in the aforementioned section 9 application, one thiru.p.sivanantham filed an application to implead himself saying he continues to be a partner in said firm. this implead application was allowed by the said commercial court in and by an order dated 20.03.2024 made in i.a.no.2/2024. this implead order was assailed in this court by four aforementioned applicants. this 'commercial appellate division' ('cad' for the sake of brevity) vide c.m.a.(cad) (sr) no.41810 of 2024 disposed of the appeal by a judgment /order dated 08.04.2024, which reads as follows: https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 'in the high court of judicature at madras dated: 08.04.2024 coram the hon'ble mr.justice m.sundar and the hon'ble mrs. justice k. govindarajan thilakavadi c.m.a (cad) (sr) no.41810 of 2024 1.v.pranav

the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 read with section 13 of commercial courts act, 2015 to set aside the impugned order dated 20.03.2024 passed in i.a.no.2 of 2024 in arb.o.p.no.1 of 2024 by the district judge, commercial court, salem. for appellants : mr.m.s.seshadri for respondents : ms.s.subashiny judgment [judgment of the court was delivered by m.sundar, j.] captioned 'civil miscellaneous appeal' [hereinafter 'cma' for the sake of brevity] has been filed in this court on 26.03.2024 assailing an order dated 20.03.2024 made in i.a.no.2 of 2024 in arb.o.p.no.1 of 2024 [cnr no.tnsa23-000002-2024] made by the 'court of district judge, commercial court, salem' [hereinafter 'salem commercial court' for convenience]. this '20.03.2024 order' made by salem commercial court shall be referred to as 'impugned order' for the sake of convenience. 2. in and vide the impugned order, salem commercial court has allowed an implead application taken out by a partnership firm and its partner seeking to implead themselves as respondents 4 and 5 [r4 & r5] in arb.o.p.no.1 of 2024. to be noted, arb.o.p.no.1 of 2024 is an application under section 9 of 'the arbitration and conciliation act (act no.26 of 1996)' https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis [hereinafter 'a and c act' for the sake of convenience and clarity]. to put it with precision, it is an application under section 9(1)(ii)(e) of a and c act with a prayer for temporary/mandatory injunction, directing hdfc bank to permit operation of a bank account in the name of 'm/s.narasus spinning mill (a partnership firm)' [hereinafter 'said firm' for the sake of brevity and convenience] and a temporary injunction restraining one of the partners of said partnership firm from interfering in the affairs of the said firm. 3. to be noted, captioned cma has been listed under the cause list caption 'for maintainability' as registry has entertained doubts as to whether an appeal under section 37(1)(b) of a and c act would lie as impugned order has acceded to an implead prayer i.e., it has neither granted nor refused any measure under section 9 of a and c act. 4. mr.m.s.seshadri, learned counsel for appellants is before us and for the sake of completion of facts, we deem it appropriate to say that four appellants before us have filed a petition under section 11 of a and c act in this court vide o.p.no.3 of 2024 and this section 11 petition is predicated on arbitration agreement ['arbitration agreement' within the meaning of section 2(1)(b) read with section 7 of a and c act] which is in the form of a clause in a 'partnership deed dated 26.05.2020' [hereinafter 'said partnership deed' for the sake of convenience]. this court is informed that this section 11 op is pending. aforementioned arb.o.p.no.1 of 2024 i.e., section 9 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis application is 'before' arbitral proceedings is learned counsel's say. to be noted, the date of commencement of arbitral proceedings i.e., commencement within the meaning of section 21 of a and c act is 17.06.2023 as that is the date on which noticee received trigger notice dated 12.06.2023. 5. this court, having captured the essentials, now deems it appropriate to get it into the legal drill qua maintainability of captioned cma. 6. mr.m.s.seshadri, learned counsel placed reliance on three orders. one is an order dated 24.02.2020 made in v.g.santhosam and others vs. shanthi gnanasekaran and others reported in 2020 scc online mad 560 by a hon'ble single judge of this court, the second is an order dated 02.02.2021 in m.mythrai vs. t.ramesh and others reported in 2021 scc online mad 13704 made by another hon'ble single judge of this court and the third is an order dated 24.07.2023 in arupri logistics pvt. ltd., vs. vilas gupta and others reported in 2023 scc online del 4297 made by a hon'ble single judge of delhi high court. 7. the aforementioned three orders were relied on by the learned counsel to say that the captioned cma is maintainable though it is an order acceding to an implead prayer by a section 9 court. learned counsel predicated his campaign on his sheet anchor submission that 'implead' is an 'order under section 9' and that it is an 'order under section 9(1)(ii)(e) of a and c act to be precise'. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 8. before we proceed further with the maintainability drill on hand, we deem it appropriate to say that the expression '(and from no others)' occurring in parenthesis in sub-section (1) of section 37 of a and c act is a clear negative import qua statutory expression, it came up for consideration before hon'ble supreme court in fuerst day lawson limited vs. jindal exports limited reported in (2011) 8 scc 333 and relevant paragraphs are paragraphs 89 to 91 and the same read as follows: \"89.it is, thus, to be seen that arbitration act, 1940, from its inception and right through to 2004 (in p.s. sathappan [(2004) 11 scc 672] ) was held to be a selfcontained code. now, if the arbitration act, 1940 was held to be a self-contained code, on matters pertaining to arbitration, the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, which consolidates, amends and designs the law relating to arbitration to bring it, as much as possible, in harmony with the uncitral model must be held only to be more so. once it is held that the arbitration act is a self-contained code and exhaustive, then it must also be held, using the lucid expression of tulzapurkar, j., that it carries with it \"a negative import that only such acts as are mentioned in the act are permissible to be done and acts or things not mentioned therein are not permissible to be done\". in other words, a letters patent appeal would be excluded by the application of one of the general principles that where the special act sets out a self-contained code the applicability of the general law procedure would be impliedly excluded. 90.we, thus, arrive at the conclusion regarding the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis exclusion of a letters patent appeal in two different ways; one, so to say, on a micro basis by examining the scheme devised by sections 49 and 50 of the 1996 act and the radical change that it brings about in the earlier provision of appeal under section 6 of the 1961 act and the other on a macro basis by taking into account the nature and character of the 1996 act as a self-contained and exhaustive code in itself. 91.in light of the discussions made above, it must be held that no letters patent appeal will lie against an order which is not appealable under section 50 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996.\" 9. reverting to the maintainability legal drill on hand, we tested the aforementioned argument of learned counsel on a demurrer i.e., accepting the argument that impugned order is an order under section 9(1)(ii)(e) of a and c act. the neat question is, whether this is a interim measure of protection, even if tested on a demurrer in this manner, it does not answer in the affirmative the straight /neat question i.e., whether the impugned order will tantamount to 'granting or refusing an interim measure under section 9 of a and c act'. we do not propose to further this legal drill as we are leaving open this question as learned counsel for appellants at this stage fervently submitted that it will suffice if right to contest the impugned order is left open after the salem commercial court takes a decision i.e., either grants or refuses the prayer in section 9 application and that such contesation will be only as part of a section 37(i)(b) appeal against section 9 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis order either as an applicant or as a respondent as that would depend on outcome of pending section 9 application. 10. as we are leaving open the question that has arisen, we refrain from expressing any opinion one way or the other on aforementioned two orders of hon'ble single judges of this court in v.g.santhosam case, m.mythrai case and order of hon'ble single judge of delhi high court in arupri logistics case. however, as a matter of good order, we deem it appropriate to say that we have noticed that v.g.santhosam case has been carried to hon'ble supreme court by way of s.l.p (c) nos.92349237/2020 and hon'ble supreme court has made the following order: https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 11. the aforementioned order makes it clear that v.g.santhosam case remains an order of hon'ble single judge of this court. the reason is doctrine of merger has not kicked in owing to kunhayammed principle i.e., kunhayammed and others vs. state of kerala and another reported in (2000) 6 scc 12. in other words, the aforementioned order has been made prior to issue of notice in the first part of article 136 of constitution of india and therefore, there is no doctrine of merger. paragraph 80 of v.g.santhosam case wherein and whereby hon'ble single judge has left open rights qua a civil suit also becomes relevant as hon'ble supreme court has notice this in dismissing slp i.e., not granting leave. 13. in m.mythrai case vide paragraph 70, hon'ble single judge has only followed v.g.santhosam case. arupri logistics being an order of another hon'ble high court, we deem it appropriate to say that we are not expressing any opinion at this juncture and we reserve for a matter where a legal drill becomes https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis imperative. 14. the petitioners in the implead application, namely, the firm and its partner, who are r1 and r2 in captioned cma have lodged a caveat qua anticipated crp but learned counsel for appellants has been very fair in favouring the learned counsel for caveator copies of the captioned matter and ms.suba shiny, learned counsel for caveator is also before this court. as the matter is listed for maintainability, learned counsel for caveator does not have a say. to be noted, counsel for caveator would not have a say even if the matter is tested for admission. learned counsel for caveator would get audience only when the question of granting interim order is considered. therefore, we deem it appropriate to just record the factual position that learned counsel for caveator is also before this court when this proceedings unfurled and we leave it at that. 15. in the light of the narrative thus far, the following order is made: i) the learned judge presiding over the commercial court, salem is requested to dispose of arb.o.p.no.1 of 2024 as expeditiously as the business of the court would permit but in any event on or before 30.04.2024. to be noted, in making this request this court has also noticed the pendency in the salem commercial court as reflected in the 'national judicial data grid' ('njdg'); ii) salem commercial court to decide the section 9 application de hors this order i.e., untrammelled by this order; https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis iii) this means that on or before 30.04.2024, salem commercial court would either grant or refuse interim measure sought for under section 9 of a and c act; iiv) this court is informed that the next listing before the salem commercial court is 24.04.2024. it is open to the parties to make a prayer to advance the hearing; v) after salem commercial court decides arb.o.p.no.1 of 2024 either by granting or refusing the interim measure, it will be open to any party /parties aggrieved to come before this court by way of appeal/appeals under section 37(1)(b) of a and c act. vi) if an appeal as above is filed in this court, we make it clear that the question as to the correctness of the commercial court acceding to the implead prayer in i.a.no.2 of 2024 or in other words the correctness of the impugned order is left open to be tested. to put it differently, parties to such a petition under section 37(1)(b) can raise the plea that the commercial court ought not to have acceded to the implead prayer and counter argument which will be considered as part of section 37(1)(b) legal drill if that be so. 16. with the above directions and observations, this cma is disposed of at the sr stage itself. there shall be no order as to costs. (m.s.,j.) (k.g.t.,j.) 08.04.2024' 4. the aforementioned judgment is tell-tale qua factual matrix and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis therefore, we refrain from setting out the factual matrix as well as the trajectory the matter had taken upto that point of time. suffice to say that judgment in c.m.a.(cad) (sr) no.41810 of 2024 shall now be read as part and parcel of the matter. pursuant to the aforementioned judgment, said commercial court proceeded with the aforementioned section 9 application, dismissed the same in and by an order dated 30.04.2024. the aforementioned four applicants are in appeal before this cad. 5. as regards first respondent, mr.ashokapathy of m/s.pass associates (law firm) {who has come by way of change of vakalath in place of mr.ashwin kumar} is before us on 'vc' ('videoconferencing') platform. to be noted, this is hybrid hearing, which is a routine/regular/daily feature in this court. as regards second and third respondents, it is evident from the vacation bench order dated 24.05.2024 that m/s.king and partridge (law firm) has accepted notice and as regards respondents 4 and 5, ms.s.subashiny is before us. 6. mr.m.s.seshadri, learned counsel drew our attention to an earlier deed as amongst the partners of said firm dated 01.04.2002, which reads as https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis follows : \" deed of partnership this instrument of partnership drawn on the 1st day of april, 2002, among (1) smt.mahalakshmi ammal charities, represented by its trustee r.p.sarathy, (2) r.p.sarathy, son of late k.v.radhakrishna chettiar, (3) k.r.ramanujam, son of late

all of whom have their permanent addresses as 16, court road, salem-7. whereas parties (1) to (4), 6, 7 of us along with sri.p.sivanantham, son of r.p.sarathy, salem have been carrying on business in the name and style of \"narasu's spinning mills\" in accordance with terms and conditions of the deed of partnership entered into on the 1st day of april 2001 and, whereas the above said sri.p.sivanantham has retired from the partnership and the party of the fifth part smt.r.indrani has been admitted into partnership with effect from 01.04.2002. whereas we have decided to continue the said business under the following terms and conditions. 1. the parties shall remain partners in the business of the firm's spinning mill, which shall be continued to be carried on with its office at 16, court road, salem-7, in the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis same name and style of \"narasu's spinning mills\". 2. the firm may carry on any other business or businesses at any other places also. 3. the balance standing to the credit of the accounts of the partners shall be treated as their capital. 4. interest at the rate of 12% per annum shall be payable by the firm on the amounts standing to the credit of the accounts of the partners except that of party no.1; in the event of insufficiency of books profits for payment of interest as above, the partners shall be paid pro-rata a lower rate of interest reducing the firm's income per income-tax act to 'nil'. 5. partners no:3 and 4 viz., k.r.ramanujam and r.visweswaran have agreed to devote their time and attention to the conduct of the affairs of the firm, as the circumstances and business needs may require; in consideration of such services rendered, they shall be entitled to a total remuneration to be calculated annually in the following manner . in respect of : i. 1st rs.75,000/of book profit rs.50,000/or 90% of the book profit whichever is higher ii. next r.75,000/of book profit 60% thereof iii. balance of book profit 40% thereof the expression \"book profit\" shall mean the amount computed as defined by section 40(b) of the income tax act, 1961, as may be applicable for the relevant period. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis such total remuneration shall be divided and payable annually to the above two working partners as follows :k.r.ramanujam 55% r.visweswaran 45% 6. the partnership shall be one 'at will'. 7. all the parties to the partnership are authorised to operate the bank accounts of the partnership firm jointly or severally, they are also authorised to borrow funds and avail credit facilities from banks and others, on behalf of the firm jointly and severally. 8. true and proper accounts of the partnership shall be maintained and the profit or loss after deducting interest and salary to partners, with effect from 01.04.2002 shall be shared among the partners as follows : profit % loss % (1) smt. mahalakshmi ammal charities 2 nil (2) r.p.sarathy 10 12 (3) k.r.ramanujam

with the partnership ceases by retirement or otherwise, such partner shall be entitled to receive only the amount standing to his/her account. 11. should any dispute arise among any of the partners in matters concerning the partnership, such dispute shall be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis referred to arbitration for settlement. 12. in respect of matters not specifically stated herein, the provisions of the indian patnership act, 1932, shall apply. in witness whereof, the parties have set their hands hereunto.\" 7. adverting to aforementioned deed, learned counsel submitted that fifth respondent (p.sivanantham) has since retired from said firm but we express no opinion on this submission owing to the trajectory the matter is taking, which will be set out infra. suffice to say that both 'earlier partnership deed' (dated 01.04.2002) and the aforementioned 'said partnership deed' (dated 26.05.2020) contain arbitration clauses i.e., clauses 11 and 8 respectively and the same read as follows : clause 11 in earlier partnership deed dated 01.04.2002 : 'should any dispute arise among any of the partners in matters concerning the partnership, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration for settlement.' clause 8 of said partnership deed, dated 26.05.2020 : 'should any dispute arise between the partners in matters concerning the partnership, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration for settlement.' aforementioned clauses serve as 'arbitration agreements', i.e., 'arbitration agreement' between the parties within the meaning of section 2(1)(b) read https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis with section 7 of 'the arbitration and conciliation act (act no.26 of 1996)' [hereinafter 'a and c act' for the sake of convenience and clarity]. 8. it is the specific case of fifth respondent that aforementioned 01.04.2002 deed (earlier partnership deed) has been unilaterally thrust on fifth respondent and as alluded supra, we are not expressing any opinion on the same as it would now be part of the remit of arbitral tribunal about which there will be allusion infra. 9. a point of paramount importance is, the counsel for appellants and first respondent submit in one voice that section 11 petition in arb.o.p.(com.div) no.3 of 2024 has been filed in this court and the same is scheduled to be listed before section 11 court, day after tomorrow i.e., on 20.06.2024. what is of greater significance is, both learned counsel submitted that they have agreed on a sole arbitrator i.e., a designated senior counsel (a learned member of this bar). to be noted, mr.m.k.kabir, senior advocate has been agreed to be the sole arbitrator. in the light of the consensus arrived at by both learned counsel and this joint request for appointment of thiru m.k.kabir as sole arbitrator, this court appoints thiru.m.k.kabir to be the sole arbitrator. both counsel submit that they https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis would report this to section 11 court and give a closure to arb.o.p.(com.div) no.3 of 2024, in an appropriate manner. 10. in the aforementioned backdrop, we find that fifth respondent has filed a suit in o.s.no.10 of 2020 on the file of additional district judge-i, salem, with a prayer to declare that fifth respondent continues to be a partner qua said firm. 11. there cannot be a civil suit and arbitration proceedings simultaneously when the issues are dovetailed and inextricably intertwined. therefore, it was agreed that the suit will be given a closure and fifth respondent will become a party to the arbitration before the aforementioned sole arbitrator. all questions including the question as to whether fifth respondent continues as partner qua said partnership and whether 01.04.2002 deed has been thrust on fifth respondent are left open to be decided by arbitral tribunal. therefore, on this order being uploaded in official website of this court, the suit in o.s.no.10 of 2020 on the file of learned additional district judge i, salem will stand dismissed as withdrawn leaving all questions open and the lis qua suit also to be decided by learned https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis sole arbitrator. likewise, as regards section 9 prayer, appellants have got the benefit of interim order dated 24.05.2024 in c.m.p.no.11113 of 2024 in captioned main appeal but now that the arbitral tribunal is constituted, (this court is acutely conscious of arcelor mittal principle, being arcelor mittal nippon steel india limited vs. essar bulk terminal limited reported in (2022) 1 scc 712 qua sub section (3) of section 9 of a and c act), we deem it appropriate to say that section 9 prayer should also now be decided by arbitral tribunal in terms of powers under section 17 and add that the interim order dated 24.05.2024 will cease to operate from today and prayer thereat will stand governed by any order which the arbitral tribunal makes. we make it clear that this is not owing to sub section (3) of section 9 of a and c act and that this is owing to facts of the case on hand as the bank amounts/balance cannot be tilted in favour of any party between today and first sitting of at. 12. we make it clear that arbitral tribunal will decide the prayer in section 9 application, now treating the application as section 17 application dehors the judicial orders which have been made. 13. with regard to sub-section (2) of section 9, the commercial division of this court in cholamandalam investment and finance https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis company limited vs. harkhabhai amarshibhai vaghadiya [arb.a.no.40 of 2022, etc. batch, dated 16.02.2022] has inter alia held that sub-section (2) is a statutory expression of firm ashok traders principle [firm ashok traders vs. gurumukh das saluja reported in (2004) 3 scc 155], i.e., that there can not be an interim order in perpetuity and that manifest intention to arbitrate is sine qua non for a pre arbitration section 9 application, though in the case on hand, we notice that the date of commencement of arbitral proceedings within the meaning of section 21 of a and c act is 17.06.2023 vide a trigger notice dated 12.06.2023 and section 9 application is dated 20.01.2024, as we are now relegating the matter to arbitral tribunal, we are only confirming cholamandalam common order dated 16.02.2022 to be the correct obtaining position of law qua section 9, more particularly, subsections (2) and (3) of section 9 but we refrain from expressing any opinion in this matter as interim order under section 9 ceases and at will be in seizin under section 17. this is also owing to the consensus arrived at between the counsel as regards the arbitral tribunal and as regards leaving it to the arbitral tribunal to decide section 9 prayer treating the same as section 17 application. in another matter where there is a contest, we shall apply cholamandalam which we have confirmed and affirmed to be correct https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis position of law qua section 9 legal drills. 14. learned counsel for appellants and learned counsel for first respondent submit that they would bring to the notice of hon'ble section 11 court this order and give a suitable closure to aforementioned section 11 application day after tomorrow i.e., 20.06.2024 and this would also mean that learned counsel for fifth respondent can also bring it to the notice of the section 11 court. 15. we request learned senior counsel [arbitral tribunal] to hold the first sitting as expeditiously as possible considering the nature of the interim prayer. however we also record the position that salaries of workmen of said firm continued to be paid until today. 16. captioned c.m.a. and captioned c.m.ps. are disposed of in the aforesaid manner inter-alia recording the limited consensus between the counsel. there shall be no order as to costs.
