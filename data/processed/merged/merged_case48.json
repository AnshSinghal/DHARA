The suit is filed seeking a decree of mandatory injunction directing the defendant/respondent to quit  from the plaint schedule building and for damages for user and occupation from the date of suit till delivery of possession . After filing written statement, the respondent filed I.A.No. 1 of 2021, seeking transfer of the suit to the Commercial Court having jurisdiction. According to the respondent, the transaction among the parties is a commercial transaction and the dispute, a 'commercial dispute' as defined under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 ('the Act', for short). The plaintiff objected, contending that the subject matter of the suit will not fall within the definition of 'commercial dispute' under Section 2(1)(c) of the Act and the 'Specified Value' of the suit is less than Rs.3 lakhs. Despite the objection, learned Munsiff issued the impugned order, transferring the suit to the Commercial Court under Section 15(2) of the Act. Aggrieved, the plaintiff has come up in revision. \n2. Sri.B.Krishnan, learned counsel for the petitioner raised the following contentions;\nThe dispute raised in the suit is not a 'commercial dispute' as defined under the Act. The term 'specified value' under the Act should be read in harmony with the provisions of the Kerala Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1959 (for short, 'the Court Fees Act'). Section 15 of the Act, dealing with transfer of suits, is applicable only to suits that were pending as on the date on which the Act came into force. \n3. In elaboration, learned counsel submitted that Section 2(1)(c)(vii) will come into play only if the agreement is relating to immovable property 'used' exclusively in trade or commerce. Referring to the terms of Annexure A3 agreement and the averments in Annexure A4 plaint, it is submitted that the building was given on licence for conducting business, which was yet to commence and therefore the agreement is not one relating to property 'being used' for trade or commerce, but property 'to be used' for such purpose. In support of the contention, reliance is placed on the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court in Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd. v. K.S.Infraspace LLP and Another [(2020) 15 SCC 585], with specific reference to paragraphs 11 to 14 therein. \n4. As regards the second contention, learned counsel drew attention to the relief sought in the suit and submitted that the valuation of a suit has to be in accordance with the Court Fees Act, even if the relief pertains to a right in immovable property. It is pointed out that the relief sought in the plaint is for a mandatory injunction directing the defendant to quit from the plaint schedule building with damages for loss of user and occupation and the court fee is paid under Section 27(c) of the Court Fees Act, in accordance with the estimated value for the relief of mandatory injunction. Being so, the specified value is way below Rs.3,00,000/- and the suit will have to continue before the Munsiff's Court itself, being the court of lowest grade competent to try it. In support of the contention, reliance is placed on the decision of the High Court of Delhi in Mrs. Sony Dave v Trans Asian Industries Expositions Pvt. Ltd (AIR 2016 Delhi 186).\n5. To buttress the third point, reference is made to Section 15 of the Act. According to the learned counsel, the provision contemplates transfer of suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute for a specified value pending on the date of commencement of the Act and not transfer of suits filed after coming into force of the Act. Once the suit is accepted on file, the only option available to the court is to return the plaint under Order VII Rule 10 of CPC. \n6. Replying to the contentions, Sri.G.Sreekumar Chelur raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the civil revision petition, since the order under challenge, if made in favour of the petitioner, will not have the effect of disposing the suit. As regards the contention that the dispute involved does not fall within the definition of the Act, learned counsel referred to the agreement and the plaint to contend that the agreement relates to immovable property used exclusively for trade or commerce. It is submitted that the building is constructed as a commercial building and cannot be put to any other use. The learned counsel put forth an alternative contention that the licencee of the premises is actually a firm of which the petitioner is also a partner, and therefore, the dispute is also with respect to the partnership agreement and will hence, fall under Section 2(1)(c)(xv) of the Act also. Referring to Section 21 of the Act, it is submitted that the provisions of the Act will override the provisions of the Court Fees Act and hence, the specified value has to be determined in the manner provided under Section 12 of the Act.\n7. The objection of the learned counsel for the respondent regarding the maintainability of the civil revision petition is not being dealt with in detail, since the legal question arising for consideration is of general importance. Moreover, even if the objection is found to be valid, it is open for this court to consider the revision petition as one under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \n8. To resolve the issue arising for consideration, it is essential to understand the objective of the enactment with reference to the relevant provisions. The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 was enacted with the objective of providing an independent mechanism for early resolution of high-value commercial disputes involving complex facts and questions of law, so as to create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive Indian legal system. By Act 28 of 2018, amendments were brought about to the Act, on realising that early resolution of commercial disputes of lesser value would create a more positive image amongst investors. As mandated by Section 3, the State Government, in consultation with the High Court, has constituted Commercial Courts at the district level. As per Section 6, such courts have jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value. Section 2(1)(c) defines the term \"Commercial dispute\" as follows;\n\"2.(1)(c). \"Commercial dispute\" means a dispute arising out of-- (i) ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents, including enforcement and interpretation of such documents;\n(ii) export or import of merchandise or services;\n(iii) issues relating to admiralty and maritime law;\n(iv) transactions relating to aircraft, aircraft engines, aircraft equipment and helicopters, including sales, leasing and financing of the same;\n(v) carriage of goods;\n(vi) construction and infrastructure contracts, including tenders;\n(vii) agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce;\n(viii) franchising agreements;\n(ix) distribution and licensing agreements;\n(x) management and consultancy agreements;\n(xi) joint venture agreements;\n(xii) shareholders agreements;\n(xiii) subscription and investment agreements pertaining to the services industry including outsourcing services and financial services;\n(xiv) mercantile agency and mercantile usage;\n(xv) partnership agreements;\n(xvi) technology development agreements; (xvii) intellectual property rights relating to registered and unregistered trademarks, copyright, patent, design, domain names, geographical indications and semiconductor integrated circuits;\n(xviii) agreements for sale of goods or provision of services;\n(xix) exploitation of oil and gas reserves or other natural resources including electromagnetic spectrum;\n(xx) insurance and re-insurance;\n(xxi) contracts of agency relating to any of the above; and (xxii) such other commercial disputes as may be notified by the Central Government. \nExplanation.--A commercial dispute shall not cease to be a commercial dispute merely because-- (a) it also involves action for recovery of immovable property or for realisation of monies out of immovable property given as security or involves any other relief pertaining to immovable property;\n(b) one of the contracting parties is the State or any of its agencies or instrumentalities, or a private body carrying out public functions;\"\nAs per Section 2(1)(i), \"specified value\", in relation to a commercial dispute, means the value of the subject-matter in respect of a suit, as determined in accordance with Section 12, which shall not be less than three lakh rupees or such higher value, as may be notified by the Central Government. Section 12 prescribes the methodology for determination of Specified Value as under;\n\"12. Determination of Specified Value.- (1) The Specified Value of the subject-matter of the commercial dispute in a suit, appeal or application shall be determined in the following manner:-\n(a) where the relief sought in a suit or application is for recovery of money, the money sought to be recovered in the suit or application inclusive of interest, if any, computed up to the date of filing of the suit or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining such specified value;\n(b) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to movable property or to a right therein, the market value of the movable property as on the date of filing of the suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining such specified value;\n(c) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to immovable property or to a right therein, the market value of the immovable property, as on the date of filing of the suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining specified value; and (d) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to any other intangible right, the market value of the said rights as estimated by the plaintiff shall be taken into account for determining Specified Value;\n(2) The aggregate value of the claim and counter- claim, if any, as set out in the statement of claim and the counter-claim, if any, in an arbitration of a commercial dispute shall be the basis for determining whether such arbitration is subject to the jurisdiction of a Commercial Division, Commercial Appellate Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be....\" \nSection 15(2) stipulates that all suits and applications, including applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a Commercial Court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such Commercial Court. As per the proviso to Section 15, no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the court prior to the constitution of the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court shall be transferred either under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2). In order to achieve the objective of speedy disposal of commercial disputes, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 has been amended as postulated under Section 16 of the Act extracted here under;\n\"16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes.--\n(1) The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule. \n(2) The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value. \n(3) Where any provision of any Rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail.\" \n9. The very purpose of the Act is to provide for speedy disposal of commercial disputes. This purpose will be defeated if every other suit is transferred to Commercial Courts, on finding that the dispute involved has shades of a commercial dispute. In this regard, it may be pertinent to note that, considering the exponential increase in the number of suits in Commercial Courts, there is a proposal to increase the minimum specified value from Rs.3 lakhs to Rs.10 lakhs and to notify all Subordinate Judges' Courts in the State as Commercial Courts. \n10. For a suit to fall under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, the following twin conditions are to be satisfied;\n(i) it shall be a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act; and (ii) such commercial disputes are of a specified value as per Section 2(i) of the Act. \nTherefore, the sustainability of the impugned order depends on the meaning of the words \"agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce\". This question was considered by the High Court of Gujarat in Vasu Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. v. Gujarat Akruti TCG Biotech Ltd. [AIR 2017 Guj. 153]. Therein, the court observed that on a plain reading of the clause it is clear that the expression used means 'actually used' or 'being used' and if the intention of the legislature was to expand the scope, the phraseology used would have been different as for example \"likely to be used\" or \"to be used\". The court concluded by holding that the word used denotes 'actually used' and it cannot be said to be either 'ready for use' or 'likely to be used' or 'to be used'. In Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd. (supra), the Apex Court agreed with the view expressed in Vasu Healthcare (supra) and also referred to a decision in Federation of A.P. Chambers of Commerce & Industry and Ors. v. State of A.P and Ors. [(2006) 8 SCC 550], wherein, while interpreting a similar provision under Section 3(d) of the Andhra Pradesh Non- Agricultural Lands Assessment Act, 1963, the Apex Court opined that the user should be 'in praesenti'.\n11. As far as the instant case is concerned, there cannot be any dispute to the fact that no commercial activity or trade was being conducted in the plaint schedule building and by the licence agreement the respondent is permitted to conduct restaurant, bakery, hyper market etc. It is hence clear that there was no user 'in praesenti' and the agreement cannot be termed as one relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. The alternative contention raised by the learned counsel for the respondent that the petitioner is also a partner of the firm which is the actual licencee cannot be counternamed, since the agreement is executed by the respondent in his capacity as the sole proprietor and Director of a concern by name 'Savory Restaurant'.\n12. I also find merit in the contention that the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act and the Court Fees Act should be interpreted harmoniously. Section 27 of the Court Fees Act deals with suits for injunction. As per Section 27(c), where the subject matter of the suit has a market value or not, fee shall be computed on the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint or on Rs.500/- whichever is higher. The relief in the instant suit is for a decree of mandatory injunction directing the defendant to quit from the building described in plaint A and B schedules with damages for loss of user and occupation at the rate of Rs.10,42,125.00 per month from the date of suit till delivery of possession and the petitioner has paid court fees under Section 27(c). In a suit for injunction simplicitor, it is the value of the relief claimed and not the value of the property involved that determines the jurisdiction. \"Subject matter\" is the substance for adjudication and has reference to the right which the plaintiff seeks to enforce and the valuation of the suit depends upon the value of the subject matter. Similar question was considered by the High Court of Delhi in Mrs.Soni Dave (supra). After careful scrutiny of Section 12 of the Act and the relevant provision of the Court Fees Act, it was held as follows;\n\"27. In my view Section 12 of the Commercial Courts Act providing for determination of specified value as defined in Section 2(i) thereof is not intended to provide for a new mode of determining the valuation of the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction and court fees. It would be incongruous to hold that while for the purpose of payment of court fees the deemed fiction provided in the Court Fees Act for determining the value of the property is to apply but not for determining the specified value under the Commercial Courts Act. \n28. In my opinion Section 12 of the Commercial Courts Act has to be read harmoniously with the Court Fees Act and the Suits Valuation Act and reading so, the specified value of a suit where the relief sought relates to immovable property or to a right thereunder has to be according to the market value of the immovable property only in such suits where the suit as per the Court Fees Act and/or the Suits Valuation Act has to be valued on the market value of the property and not where as per the Court Fees Act and the Suits Valuation Act the valuation of a suit even if for the relief of recovery of immovable property or a right therein is required to be anything other than market value as is the case in a suit by a landlord for recovery of possession of immovable property from a tenant.\" \nSame view was taken by the Karnataka High Court in Fine Footwear Pvt. Ltd. Represented by its Director v. Skechers USA Inc. and Another [2019 SCC Online Kar. 1024]. I am in respectful agreement with the above judgments. No doubt, the specified value of a suit is liable to be computed in accordance with the market value of the immovable property in such suits where, even as per the Court Fees Act, the value is to be determined on the basis of the market value of the property. In respect of suits where the valuation under the Court Fees Act is based on anything other than market value of the immovable property, the valuation under the Court Fees Act should be the basis for deciding the pecuniary jurisdiction. \n13. The final issue is whether the court below could have transferred the suit to the Commercial Court in exercise of the power under Section 15 of the Act. In accordance with the mandate of Section 15, all suits falling within the ambit of 'commercial dispute' above the specified value got transferred to the jurisdictional Commercial Courts after the Act came into force. If the suit or application is not transferred, the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court can, in exercise of the power under Section 15(5), withdraw the suit or application from the court before which it is pending and transfer the same for trial or disposal to the Commercial Court having territorial jurisdiction. Therefore, the learned Munsiff could not have transferred the suit, by usurping the power vested with the High Court. Having accepted the plaint and numbered the suit, the learned Munsiff could have only returned the plaint under Order VII Rule 10 of CPC. In this regard it may also be pertinent to note that even under Section 24 of CPC, the power to transfer suits is vested only with the High Court and the District Court. \nIn the result, the civil revision petition is allowed. The impugned order, transferring O.S.No.151 of 2020 from the Munsiff's Court, Vadakara to the Commercial Court, Kozhikokde, is set aside. \nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN, JUDGE vgs PETITIONER ANNEXURE ANNEXURE A1 TRUE COPY OF THE PETITION BY DEFENDANT I.A. 1/2201 IS PRODUCED AND MARKED. \nANNEXURE A2 TRUE COPY OF THE COUNTER AFFIDAVIT BY PLAINTIFF IN IA 1/2021 BEFORE THE MUNSIFF COURT, VATAKARA. \nANNEXURE A3 TRUE COPY OF LICENSE AGREEMENT DATED 10.07.2017. \nANNEXURE A4 TRUE COPY OF PLAINT IN O.S. 51/2020 O THE FILE OF MUNSIFF COURT, VATAKARA .",

v. for costs of the suit; 13.though, c.s.no.59 of 2018 was filed as early as 22.09.2016, it was numbered just few months prior to cp/355/(ib)/2018 being taken up for hearing by the national company law tribunal single bench, chennai. 14.in view of the pendency of c.s.no.59 of 2018, the national company law tribunal, chennai dismissed the said company application filed under section 9 of the insolvency and bankruptcy code 2016 read with rule 6 of the insolvency and bankruptcy (application to adjudicating authority) rules, 2016 by its order dated 09.07.2018. 15.under these circumstances, the respondent filed the present suit vide c.s.no.632 of 2018 to recover rs.72,48,440 and interest thereon. while instituting c.s.no.632 of 2018, the respondent also filed application no.6948 of 2018 under order xii rule 6 of cpc, 1908 for passing a judgment and decree on admission of liability. http://www.judis.nic.in6/38 16.the appellant filed written statement in c.s.no.632 of 2018 and also a counter affidavit in application no.6948 of 2018 and prayed for dismissal of the said application filed under order 12 rule 6 of cpc, 1908. 17.by an order dated 31.01.2019, the learned single judge has partly allowed the said application to the extent of rs.72,48,440/-. it is this order which has been impugned before us in this appeal. 18.at the outset the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that an interim insolvency resolution professional has been appointed by the national company law tribunal, chennai in an insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings initiated against the respondent/plaintiff. it was therefore submitted that in terms of section 14 (1) (a) of the insolvency and bankruptcy code 2016 no further proceedings can be carried forward by or against the respondent. 19.it was further submitted that the present appeal may deferred by staying the operation of the impugned order dated http://www.judis.nic.in7/38 31.01.2019 passed by the learned single judge. both counsels were therefore asked the address this preliminary objection raised by the learned counsel. 20.the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that in view of the section 14(1)(a) of insolvency and bankruptcy code, 2016, the institution of suits or continuation of the pending suits or proceedings against a \"corporate debtor\" including execution of any judgment, decree or order in any court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or any other authority or proceedings are prohibited pursuant to an order of adjudicating authority under the aforesaid code. 21.in this connection, the learned counsel for the appellant and the respondent drew attention to the decision of the delhi high court in power grid corporation of india ltd. vs jyothi structures ltd, 2017 scc online del 12189. 22.the learned counsel for the respondent/plaintiff submitted that there is no bar under the insolvency and bankruptcy code, 2016 to restrain a corporate debtor from further proceeding with http://www.judis.nic.in8/38 the beneficial proceedings. in absence of an express prohibition, a corporate debtor cannot be restrained from recovering amounts that are due to it. 23.we examined the provision of insolvency and bankruptcy code, 2016. section 14 of the act reads as under:14.moratorium 1) subject to provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3), on the insolvency commencement date, the adjudicating authority shall by order declare moratorium for prohibiting all of the following, namely:(a) the institution of suits or continuation of pending suits or proceedings against the corporate debtor including execution of any judgment, decree or order in any court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or other authority; (b) transferring, encumbering, alienating or disposing of by the corporate debtor any of its assets or any legal right or beneficial interest therein; (c) any action to foreclose, recover or enforce any security interest created by the corporate debtor in respect of its property including any action under the securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest (sarfaesi) act, 2002; (d) the recovery of any property by an owner or lessor where such property is occupied by or in the possession of the corporate debtor. (2) the supply of essential goods or services to the corporate debtor as may be specified shall not be http://www.judis.nic.in9/38 terminated or suspended or interrupted during moratorium period. (3) the provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply to such transactions as may be notified by the central government in consultation with any financial sector regulator. (4) the order of moratorium shall have effect from the date of such order till the completion of the corporate insolvency resolution process: provided that where at any time during the corporate insolvency resolution process period, if the adjudicating authority approves the resolution plan under sub-section (1) of section 31 or passes an order for liquidation of corporate debtor under section 33, the moratorium shall cease to have effect from the date of such approval or liquidation order, as the case may be. 24.an adjudicating authority under the insolvency and bankruptcy code can by an order declare a moratorium prohibiting institution of suits or continuation of pending suits or proceedings against the corporate debtor including execution of any judgment, decree or order in any court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or other authority. 25.the language of section 14 (1) (a) of the insolvency and bankruptcy code, 2016 is clear. only proceedings \"against\" a corporate debtor including execution of any judgment and decree or http://www.judis.nic.in10/38 order in any court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or other authority is prohibited. it does not prohibit institution of a proceedings by a corporate debtor against his debtor. 26.thus, section 14 (1) (a) of the insolvency and bankruptcy code 2016 merely prohibits institution or continuation of proceedings against the corporate debtor. 27.therefore, the declaration of moratorium by an adjudicating authority under the insolvency and bankruptcy code, 2016 under section 14 (1) (a) does not prohibit continuation of proceedings by a corporate debtor. 28.in our view, the respondents were not only entitled to file c.s.no.632 of 2018 against the appellant to recover the amounts but also proceed further. 29.the respondents have also informed that the interim insolvency resolution professional has also given a permission to them to proceed with c.s.no.632 of 2018 and defend the order passed by the learned single judge in the present appeal. http://www.judis.nic.in11/38 30.we therefore answer the preliminary objection raised by the appellant in the negative. accordingly, the preliminary objection raised by the appellant stands overruled. 31.we shall therefore now proceed with merits of the case and examine the correctness of the impugned order passed by the learned single judge under order xii rule 6 of cpc. 32.the learned counsel for the appellant submits that c.s.no.59 of 2018 is pending before the court against the respondent by the appellant. it was submitted that it is a prior in time. it was filed to recover the excess amount paid to the respondent and for damages. therefore, both the suits should be heard together. 33.the learned counsel for the appellant also submits that c.s.no.59 of 2018 also arises out of the same agreement. 34.the learned counsel for the appellant further submits that invocation of order xii rule 6 of cpc, 1908 by the respondent for http://www.judis.nic.in12/38 the alleged outstanding amount of rs.72,48,440/after adjusting the amount of rs.13,94,400/remitted towards service tax is misplaced in as much as there is no admission of liability by mere payment of service tax to the central government vide suit document no.3. 35.it was further submitted that the appellant is entitled to recover excess amount paid to the respondent and damages for the losses suffered on account of incomplete work and the delay in handing over possession. therefore, the court ought to have ordered for a joint trial instead of allowing the application based on the alleged admission in final bill/invoice dated 31.03.2013. 36.according to the appellant, it has got a good case on merits and the issues can be decided only after the trial by letting in oral and documentary evidence. it was further submitted that the original of document no.2 has not been filed and the admissibility of the such documents are a matter for trial. 37.it is further submitted that suit document no.2 i.e the final bill/invoice dated 31.03.2013 was signed by mr.shreyans http://www.judis.nic.in13/38 lunawath who is not a director of the appellant company and therefore it was submitted that there was neither admission of liability nor not binding on the appellant. 38.the learned counsel further submitted that the admission is only a piece of evidence which can be explained and does bind a party unless it amounts to estoppel in terms of section 17 of the indian evidence act and it cannot be readily and straight away inferred. 39.whether there is an admission of liability particularly in the light of the fact that there are cross suits cannot be decided summarily without trial. 40.it is further stated that the admission in documents can be proved to be erroneous and in this case the appellant can explain the entire transaction during the oral evidence. in this connection, the learned counsel for the appellant relied on the following cases:i. jeevan diesels and electricals ltd., vs jasbir singh chadha and others (2010) 6 scc 601. ii. union of india vs ibrahim uddin and http://www.judis.nic.in14/38 another (2012) 8 scc 148. iii. himani allots ltd, vs tata steel ltd (2011) 15 scc 273. iv. s.m.asif vs virender kumar bajaj (2015) 9 scc 287. 41.it is further submitted that the learned single judge having noted that c.s.no.59 of 2018 was pending and that both were in the nature of cross suits and if two suits are tried in different courts can lead to anomalies and possible conflicting orders/ decrees has still allowed application under order xii rule 6 of cpc. 42.it was further submitted that the issue can be determined only after the trial. after having held the that it is matter for trial, the question of passing judgment on admission does not arise as suit document no.2 cannot be looked in isolation. 43.it was further submitted that issue cannot be decided without consideration of overall evidence to be let-in in both suits. the learned counsel for appellant further submits that when issues in both the suits arise out of same causes of action under the same turnkey agreement and where rival claims are pending adjudication, invocation of order xii rule 6 of cpc was misplaced and therefore it http://www.judis.nic.in15/38 was not proper for the court to have allowed the applications without trial. 44.per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent/plaintiff submits that the order of the learned single judge is well reasoned and requires no interference. it was submitted that though there are few contradictions in paragraph nos.19 and 20 of the impugned order, nevertheless, the conclusion and the decision arrived by the learned single judge cannot be set aside, particularly, in the light of admission in suit document no.2 and 3. 45.it was further submitted that the final amount in final bill/invoice dated 31.03.2013 (suit document no.2) was arrived after reconciliation of all the accounts after giving due credit to the payments already made. 46.final amount in final invoice/bill dated 31.03.2013 (suit document no.2) was accepted by a responsible officer of the appellant and therefore in view of the admission of liability, there is no case made out for interference with the impugned order of the learned single judge. http://www.judis.nic.in16/38 47.it was submitted that the issue is squarely covered by the decision of this court in o.s.a.no.274 2018 order dated 13.03.2019 between indus ind bank vs m r. selvakumar. 48.it was submitted that as per the decision in indus ind bank vs m.r.selvakumar admission of liability alone is relevant. in the present case, the appellant has not only admitted the liability but had also acted in furtherance of the suit document no.2 namely final bill/invoice dated 31.03.2013 by remitting proportionate amount of rs.13,94,400/as service tax, on 28.09.2013 vide suit document no.3. 49.it is submitted that pendency of c.s.no.59 of 2018 at the behest of the appellant was of no consequence as it was merely a ploy to delay the respondent from recovering admitted liability and was intended to create a confusion. 50.it was further submitted that the respondent had earlier issued a notice dated 27.07.2016 to wind up the appellant. thereafter, the respondent filed c.p.no.361 of 2016 to wind up the http://www.judis.nic.in17/38 appellant under the provisions of the companies act, 1956 on 20.09.2016. though the appellant presented the plaint in c.s.no.59 of 2018 before this court on 22.9.2016, it was deliberately kept pending in sr stage for nearly two years without numbering it. 51.it was numbered just in time to scuttle the winding up proceedings which was subsequently transferred to the national company law tribunal and thereby thwarting the respondent from winding up the appellant herein. 52.we have considered rival submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant and the respondent. we have also perused the suit documents and the case laws submitted by the learned counsel on behalf of the appellant and the respondent. 53.the delhi high court in p.c.gulati vs lajya ram air 1969 del 632 has held that when there are three suits and one of the suits can be disposed on merits on the admission of the defendants, keeping that case pending would be unjustified merely because admission have not been made in the other suits. http://www.judis.nic.in18/38 54.the respondent raised a final invoice/bill dated 31.03.2013 vide suit document no.2 inclusive of service tax amount of rs.13,94,400/-. the appellant's employee/representative had also received and accepted the said document. 55.the appellant has also paid the service tax mentioned in the said document to the credit of the central government. thus, there is a strong presumption that the appellant had tacitly accepted the liability in final invoice/bill dated 31.03.2013 vide suit document no.2. 56.the appellant and the respondent have exchanged various correspondence which culminated in filing of a rival suit vide c.s.no.59 of 2018 by the appellant against the respondent. the said suit is pending when the above application was allowed. 57.though there is a \"commercial dispute\" within the meaning of section 2(1)(c) of the commercial courts act, 2015 interse between the parties and both the suits were to be tried together, yet application under order xii rule 6 of cpc was filed and allowed. http://www.judis.nic.in19/38 58.order vii, order xii rule 6, order xv and under order xxxvii of civil procedure code contemplate summary disposal of suit without trial. 59.order xiii-a of the civil procedure code as incorporated by the commercial courts act, 2015 also contemplates a summary disposal of the commercial disputes by the commercial courts/ commercial division of the high court without trial. 60.applicability of order xiii a of cpc to summary suits filed under order xxxvii of cpc has been expressly barred for resolution of commercial dispute under the commercial courts act, 2015. 61.it would therefore be apposite to refer to some of the provision of the commercial courts act, 2015 and compare them with order xii rule 6 of the civil procedure code which are applicable to civil suits filed under civil procedure code. 62.before referring to the provision of the commercial courts act, 2015, we shall refer to law under order xii rule 6 of cpc. the http://www.judis.nic.in20/38 object of the order xii rule 6 is to enable the plaintiff to obtain a speedy judgment to the extent of admission of liability by the defendant either in the pleading or otherwise. 63.while passing order under order xii rule 6 of cpc, the court has to keep in mind that a judgment on admission is a judgment without trial which permanently denies any remedy to the defendant, by way of an appeal on merits. 64.therefore, unless the admission is clear, unambiguous and unconditional, the discretion cannot be exercised denying the valuable right of a defendant to contest the claim. 65.in himani alloys ltd. vs tata steel ltd., 2011 (3) civil court cases 721, it was held that discretion should be used only when there is a clear \"admission\" which can be acted upon. [see also uttam singh duggal & co. ltd. vs. united bank of india, 2000 (7) scc 120, karam kapahi vs. lal chand public charitable trust, 2010 (4) scc 753 and jeevan diesels and electricals ltd. vs. jasbir singh chadha, 2010 (6) scc 601]. http://www.judis.nic.in21/38 66.in nagubai ammal and others vs. b. shama road and others, air 1956 sc 593, it was observed that merely because of written admission was made in a different context, such admission may not become relevant if the party making it has a reasonable explanation of that further observed that an admission is not conclusive as to the truth of the matter stated therein. 67.in razia begum vs. sahebzadi anwar begum, 1958 sc 886, it was held that order xii rule 6 should be read along with proviso to rule 5 of order viii of cpc. the court is not bound to relief on a mere admission of the claim by the defendant, if the court has reason to insist upon a clear proof apart from admissions. 68.in karam kapahi & others vs. m/s lal chand public charitable & another, (2010) 4 scc 753, following the dictum of lord jessel, the master of rolls, in thorp vs holdsworth [1876) 3 ch d 637] in chancery division at p. 640, it was observed that the principles behind order xii rule 6 is to give the plaintiff a right to speedy judgment. under this rule either party may get rid of so much of the rival claims about \"which there is no controversy\". http://www.judis.nic.in22/38 69.the court there further referred to the 54th law commission report which suggested amendments to enable the court to give a judgment not only on the application of a party but on its own motion. it was also observed that the amendment was brought about to further the ends of justice and give these provisions a wider sweep by empowering the judges to use it \"ex debito justitiae\", a latin term, meaning a debt of justice and the thrust of the amendment is that in an appropriate case, a party, on the admission of the other party, can press for judgment, as a matter of legal right. however, the court always retains its discretion in the matter of pronouncing judgment. 70.question here to be examined is whether under the commercial courts act, 2015 the commercial courts/ commercial division of the high court can entertain an application under order xii rule 6 of the code in the light of xiii a of the code as inserted by the commercial courts act, 2015 for commercial disputes. 71.under rule 3 of order xiii a of code as inserted by the commercial courts act, 2015, an applicant is entitled to file http://www.judis.nic.in23/38 applications for summary judgment. such application has to be filed after summons have been served on the defendant. 72.under order xiii-a rule 3 of code, the commercial courts/ commercial division of the high court may pass following against a plaintiff or a defendant on a claim, if it considers, that:i. the plaintiff has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim; or ii. the defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim, iii. as the case may be; and iv. where there are no other compelling reason as to why the claim should not be disposed of before recording of oral evidence. 73.thus, it is evident that commercial courts can dispose a \"commercial dispute\" even before recording evidence without trial. rule 4 (1) of order xiii-a reads as under:(1)an application for summary judgment to a court shall, in addition to any other matters the applicant may deem relevant, include the matters set forth in sub-clauses (a) to (f) mentioned hereunder: (a)the application must contain a statement that it is an application for summary judgment made under this order; (b)the application must precisely disclose all http://www.judis.nic.in24/38 material facts and identify the point of law, if any; (c)in the event the applicant seeks to rely upon any documentary evidence, the applicant must,-(d)include such documentary evidence in its application, and (e)(ii) identify the relevant content of such documentary evidence on which the applicant relies; (f) the application must state the reason why there are no real prospects of succeeding on the claim or defending the claim, as the case may be; (g)the application must state what relief the applicant is seeking and briefly state the grounds for seeking such relief. 74.rule 4(2) of order xiii-a stipulates that \"where a hearing for summary judgment is fixed, the respondent must be given at least thirty days' notice of:— i. the date fixed for the hearing; and ii. the claim that is proposed to be decided by the court at such hearing.\" 75.under rule 4(3) of order xiii-a, the respondent may within a period of 30 days of receipt of notice of application for a summary judgment or notice of hearing (whichever is earlier), file a reply addressing the matters set forth in clauses (a) to (f) http://www.judis.nic.in25/38 mentioned hereunder in addition to any other matters that the respondent may deem relevant:— (a)the reply must precisely-(i)disclose all material facts; (ii) identify the point of law, if any; and (iii)state the reasons why the relief sought by the applicant should not be granted; (b)in the event the respondent seeks to rely upon any documentary evidence in its reply, the respondent must— i. include such documentary evidence in its reply; and ii. identify the relevant content of such documentary evidence on which the respondent relies; (c)the reply must state the reason why there are real prospects of succeeding on the claim or defending the claim, as the case may be; (d)the reply must concisely state the issues that should be framed for trial; (e)the reply must identify what further evidence shall be brought on record at trial that could not be brought on record at the stage of summary judgment; and (f) the reply must state why, in light of the evidence or material on record if any, the court should not proceed to summary judgment.\" 76.as per rule 6 of order xiiia, the commercial court/commercial division of the high court may pass such orders as it may deem fit in the facts of the case including the following:http://www.judis.nic.in26/38 i. judgment on claims; ii. conditional order in accordance with rule 7 of order xiii a of cpc; iii. dismissing the application; iv. dismissing part of the claim and a judgment on part of the claim that is not dismissed; v. strikeout the pleadings (whether in whole or in part); or vi. further direction to proceed for case management under order xv-a of the cpc. 77.thus, it is evident that the commercial court/commercial division of the high court can dismiss a part of the claim and give a judgment on part of the claim that is not dismissed. 78.the commercial courts/commercial division of high courts can also pass an order including a judgment on claims without trial. to us it appears that this power is similar to the power of the court under order xii rule 6 of cpc. 79.under rule 7 of order xiii -a, the commercial court/commercial division of the high court may make a conditional order as set sought in rule 6(1)(b) subject to all or any of the following conditions:— i. require a party to deposit a sum of money in the court; http://www.judis.nic.in27/38 ii. require a party to take a specified step in relation to the claim or defence, as the case may be; iii. require a party, as the case may be, to give such security or provide such surety for restitution of costs as the court deems fit and proper; iv. impose such other conditions, including providing security for restitution of losses that any party is likely to suffer during the pendency of the suit, as the court may deem fit in its discretion; and 80.however, before making such order, the court has to record its reason for making such order. the commercial court/commercial division of the high court while making a conditional order also has to specify the consequence of the failure to comply with the conditional order, including passing a judgment against the party who fails to comply with the conditional order passed by it. 81.as per section 16 of the commercial courts act, 2015, the commercial courts and commercial division of high courts have to follow the provisions of the civil procedure code, 1908 as amended by it while dealing with \"commercial dispute\" of the specified value. 82.at the same time under section 16 of the commercial courts act, 2015, where any provision of any rule of the http://www.judis.nic.in28/38 jurisdictional court or any amendment to the civil procedure code, 1908 by the state government are in conflict with the provisions of the civil procedure code, 1908, as amended by the said act, provisions of the civil procedure code, 1908 as amended by the act shall prevail. 83.though not all the provisions of cpc have been made inapplicable for resolving commercial dispute, some have been made inapplicable expressly while some by implication. if there is a conflict, civil procedure code,1908 as amended by the act will prevail over provisions of civil procedure code for resolving of commercial disputes. 84.there is an apparent overlap between the powers of the civil court to dispose a civil suit in a summary manner under order xii rule 6 of the civil procedure code, 1908 and powers of the commercial courts / commercial division of high court to dispose commercial dispute in a summary manner under order xiii-a of cpc in the light of order xv-a of cpc inserted to the civil procedure code, 1908 by the commercial courts act, 2015. http://www.judis.nic.in29/38 85.the act contemplates disposal of the commercial dispute in a time bound manner by fixing specific timelines to be adhered by the parties. order xv-a of cpc as inserted by the commercial courts act, 2015 contemplates \"case management hearing\". 86.commercial courts/commercial division of the high court are to hold the first case management hearing not later than four weeks from the date of filing of affidavit of admission or denial of documents by all parties to the suits. it is intended to set up a road map for resolution of commercial disputes so as to speed track the disposal of commercial dispute. 87.from a reading of order xv a to cpc as inserted by the commercial courts act,2015, it is evident that after first case management hearing, if it is found that there are issues of facts and law which are required to be tried, the commercial courts/commercial division of the high court as the case may be may pass and orderi. framing the issues between the parties in accordance with order xiv of the civil procedure code, 1908 after examining pleadings, documents and documents produced before it, and on examination conducted by the court under rule 2 of order x, if required. http://www.judis.nic.in30/38 ii. listing witness is to be examined by the parties; iii. fixing the date by which affidavit of evidence to be filed by the parties; iv. fixing the date on which evidence of witnesses of the parties to be record; v. fixing the date by which written arguments are to be filed before the court by the parties: vi. fixing the date on which oral arguments are to be heard by the court; and vii.setting time limits for parties and their advocates to address oral arguments. 88.applicability of order xv of code is barred under the act for resolution of commercial disputes. though the order xv of the code in applicable to commercial disputes, the commercial court/ commercial division of the high court can still pronounce judgment at the first case management hearing of the commercial disputes under rule of order xv-a of the code where it is found that parties are not issue in the same manner as a civil court would dispose a suit under order xv rule 1 of the code where parties are not in issue. 89.wherever, petitions/applications under order xiii a are filed, the commercial courts/commercial divisions of high court have to first dispose applications filed under order xiii a of cpc before proceeding further under order xva of cpc. http://www.judis.nic.in31/38 90.the commercial courts/commercial division of the high court under rule 6 order xv-a of the code as made applicable to commercial disputes have power to:i. prior to the framing of issues, hear and decide any pending application filed by the parties under order xiii-a; ii. direct parties to file compilations of documents or pleadings relevant and necessary for framing issues; iii. extend or shorten the time for compliance with any practice, direction or court order if it finds sufficient reason to do so; iv. adjourn or bring forward a hearing if it finds sufficient reason to do so; v. direct a party to attend the court for the purposes of examination under rule 2 of order x; vi. consolidate proceedings; vii.strike off the name of any witness or evidence that it deems irrelevant to the issues framed; viii.direct a separate trial of any issue; ix. decide the order in which issues are to be tried; x. exclude an issue from consideration; xi. dismiss or give judgment on a claim after a decision on a preliminary issue; xii.direct that evidence be recorded by a commission where necessary in accordance with order xxvi; xiii.reject any affidavit of evidence filed by the parties for containing irrelevant, inadmissible or argumentative material; xiv.strike off any parts of the affidavit of evidence filed by the parties containing irrelevant, inadmissible or argumentative material; 22 (o) http://www.judis.nic.in32/38 delegate the recording of evidence to such authority appointed by the court for this purpose; xv.pass any order relating to the monitoring of recording the evidence by a commission or any other authority; xvi.order any party to file and exchange a costs budget; xvii.issue directions or pass any order for the purpose of managing the case and furthering the overriding objective of ensuring the efficient disposal of the suit. 91.the commercial courts/commercial division of the high court have power to make the above orders subject to conditions, including a condition to pay a sum of money into court; and specify the consequence of failure to comply with the order or a condition. 92.thus, the amendments to the civil procedure code by the commercial courts act, 2015 provides for separate method for disposing commercial litigation/disputes. the disposal has been speed tracked. 93.the commercial courts act read with civil procedure code, 1908 is a complete code by itself for resolution of \"commercial disputes\". remedy provided under order xiii-a of cpc covers situations contemplated under order xii rule 6 of cpc though they http://www.judis.nic.in33/38 are paraphrased differently and a separate treatment is accorded under the said act. 94.in our view , the remedy under order xiii -a of the civil procedure code, 1908 as made applicable to a commercial dispute subsumes the remedy under order xii rule 6 of civil procedure code, 1908 and enables a commercial court/ commercial division of the high court to pass a \"summary judgment\" independent of the procedure prescribed under order xxxvii of cpc. 95.in our view, while it was open to the party to file application under order xiii a of cpc as amended by the commercial courts act, 2015 in a commercial dispute, invocation of order xii rule 6 of cpc was misplaced in the facts of the present case in view of the special dispensation provided under the act and in view of the pendency of a prior suit flowing from the same cause of action. therefore, invocation of application under order xii rule 12 of cpc in our view was unwarranted in the facts of the case. 96.further, payment of service tax to the credit of central government by the appellant on reverse charge basis ipso facto http://www.judis.nic.in34/38 cannot amount to admission of liability though such an inference can be drawn that there was a tacit admission of liability after trial. 97.payment of service tax merely implies, compliance with the tax liability cast under the finance act, 1994 on the appellant and nothing more. 98.document no.3 and document no.2 are only a piece of evidence which can be explained during trial. they can be shown to be erroneous or untrue, so long as the person to whom it was made has not acted upon it to his detriment, when it might become conclusive by way of estoppel. 99.therefore, there can no case for admission of liability except for document no.3 read with document no.2 which in our view needs to explained. the appellant has also stated that the original has not been filed. in our view, the appellant deserves a fair chance to explain their defence in a trial. 100.that apart, admittedly, there is a commercial dispute between the parties and both the parties have filed cross suit http://www.judis.nic.in35/38 against each other. the resolution of the commercial dispute would be under the mechanism prescribed under the provision the civil procedure code (cpc) as amended by of the commercial courts act, 2015. 101.further, the learned judge has also noted that both the suits were in the nature of cross suits and therefore they cannot be tried separately as such exercise may lead to anomalies and possible conflicting order/decrees. that being the case, order under order xii rule 6 has the propensity to deny justice to the appellant. therefore, we are inclined to interfere with the impugned order by modifying the order/ directions contained therein. 102.to meet the ends of justice, we direct the appellant to deposit the balance of the amount as ordered vide impugned order to the credit of c.s.no.632 of 2018 within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. 103.on such compliance, both the suits i.e c.s.no.59 of 2018 and c.s.no.632 of 2018 shall be listed together for final disposal in http://www.judis.nic.in36/38 accordance with the amended provisions of the civil procedure code as made applicable to the \"commercial disputes\" under the provisions of the commercial courts act, 2015. 104.in case there is no compliance of the order by the appellant, this order will come to an end sine die at the expiry of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. 105.the impugned order is modified accordingly. the present original side appeal stands partly allowed with the above observations. no cost. consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
