Niranjan Reddy, learned  Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Sri Vivekananda Virupaksha, learned counsel for the petitioner in this application ( the respondent in the main appeal ).\nRRR,J & HN,J 2. The parties are being referred to, in the present order, as they are arrayed in the main appeal. \n3. The appellant and respondent herein, had entered into an agreement, dated 26.11.2010, for the establishment and supply of Air Separation Plants to aid the appellant in the manufacture of steel and steel products. Certain disputes arose between the appellant and the respondent, leading to the constitution of an Arbitral Tribunal to decide its disputes. In the process of deciding these disputes, the Arbitral Tribunal had been passing various procedural orders. One such procedural order was passed on 25.05.2024. Under this order, the Air Separation plants were to be tested; upon successful testing the appellant was to pay Rs.388.44 crores to the respondent and upon receipt of the aforesaid amount, the respondent was to handover the Air Separation Plants to the appellant. \n4. The respondent, having certain objections to the order dated 25.05.2024, had filed two applications. Certain modifications of the order dated 25.05.2024 were sought in one application and stay of operation of the order dated 25.05.2024 to the extent the said order requires the respondent to share passwords with the appellant was sought in the second application. The Arbitral Tribunal, by order dated 04.07.2024, had stayed the operation of the direction, in the order dated 25.05.2024 to the extent of handing over of the Air Separation Plants by the respondent to the appellant. \nRRR,J & HN,J 5. The appellant, being aggrieved by the said order, dated 04.07.2024, had approached this Court by way of C.M.A.No.489 of 2024 under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the Arbitration Act').\n6. This Court by order dated 19.07.2024, had granted an interim order staying the operation of the order dated 04.07.2024, for a period of three weeks.\n7. The respondent had, then, filed I.A.No.5 of 2024 seeking to vacate the order dated 19.07.2024. In this application, the respondent raised various grounds for vacating the order dated 29.07.2024. One of the grounds raised in the present application, is the ground of jurisdiction. The respondent contends that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the appeals arising out of Section 37 of the Arbitration Act either as a Court, as defined under Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act or as a Commercial Court under the provisions of Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the Commercial Courts Act).\n8. Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Sri Vivekananda Virupaksha, learned counsel for the appellant/petitioner, in support of the application, contends that the Court, which would have jurisdiction under the Arbitration Act, in relation to any appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, would be the District Court or a High Court, which RRR,J & HN,J has ordinary civil jurisdiction. In relation to commercial disputes, which are the subject matter of arbitration, the Courts which would have jurisdiction would be the Commercial Court established under the Commercial Courts Act and having jurisdiction over the area where such dispute has arisen. Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Counsel would contend that the said Commercial Court would be the Commercial Court in Visakhapatnam. Reliance is placed on Pandey & Co. Builders (P) Ltd., vs. State of Bihar and Anr.,1; Upadhyay Construction Pvt., Ltd., vs. Prism Infra Projects, Arbitration Application No.56 of 2020; Simplex Projects Ltd., vs. State of Manipur2; Vaidya Industries vs. State of Jarkhand3; and Raveendran K.V. vs. Shriram Transport Finance Company Ltd.,4.\n9. Apart from this, Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Counsel would also contend that the appellant, being aggrieved by certain interim awards, passed in the present arbitration proceedings, had approached the Commercial Court, Visakhapatnam, under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. This would show that the appellant had accepted that it is the Commercial Court at Visakhapatnam, which has jurisdiction. He would further submit that even otherwise, Section 42 of the Arbitration Act would preclude the appellant from approaching this Court as all proceedings would have to be continued before the Court where the initial application came to be filed. (2007) 1 SCC 467 2020 SCC Online Mani 66 2019 SCC Online Jhar 1790 2012 SCC Online Ker 31676 RRR,J & HN,J 10. Sri Arvind Nayyar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Sri K. Kiran Kumar Vadlamudi, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, would submit that this Court has jurisdiction for the following reasons:\na) Any direction granting or refusing interim measure under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act by an Arbitral Tribunal is amenable to an appeal before the Court under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.\nb) The term Court has been defined under Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act. However, Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act, states that the Court mentioned in the Arbitration Act would be the Commercial Court or the commercial division of the High Court. \nc) There has been an argument that the Commercial Court would be the Commercial Court constituted under Section 3 of the Commercial Courts Act. However, the jurisdiction of a Commercial Court constituted under Section 3, which is stipulated under Section 6 of the Commercial Courts Act, is to try all suits and applications. There is no provision for deciding any appeal. \nd) On the other hand, Standing Order 245(11) of the A.P. High Court Standing Orders provides for appeals to be filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. \ne) Section 10, of the Commercial Courts Act, which provides for appeals against the orders under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, provides RRR,J & HN,J for three eventualities and confers jurisdiction on separate Courts / commercial divisions depending upon the category under which appeals filed. \nf) Under Section 10(1) all appeals or applications etc., relating to international arbitration would have to be filed before the commercial division of the High Court. Under Section 10(2) of the Commercial Courts Act, all appeals or applications etc., arising out of the Arbitration Act would have to be dealt with by the commercial division of the High Court wherever such a commercial division is established. By virtue of notifications dated 10.06.2016, commercial division and commercial appellate division have been constituted in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. Section 10 (3) provides for Commercial Courts to take up these matters where the Commercial Division, of the High Court, has not yet been set up. \ng) Section 17 of the A.P. Civil Courts Act, 1972 stipulates that any appeal above the value of Rs.50 lakhs would be filed only before the High Court and it is only the appeals up to Rs.50 lakhs that can be filed before the District Court. In the present case, the value of the dispute is in excess of Rs.388 crores. Consequently, the District Courts would not have jurisdiction in the matter. \nh) Section 6 of the Commercial Courts Act does not provide any appeal to be heard by a Commercial Court constituted under Section 3 of the Commercial Courts Act. It is settled law that the jurisdiction for appeals has to RRR,J & HN,J be provided expressly and there cannot be any implied power to hear the appeals. Reliance is placed on Ganga Bai vs. Vijay Kumar and Ors., 5 ; Shankar Kerba Jadav and Ors., vs. State of Maharashtra 6; and ITI Ltd., vs. Alphion Corporation United States of America and Anr.,7.\n11. Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Counsel, in reply, would contend as follows:\na) Section 37 of the Arbitration Act provides for appeals against the orders passed under Section 37(1), by the Court refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under Section 8, refusing of granting any measure under Section 9 or setting aside or refusing to set aside an Arbitral Award under Section 34.\nThe inclusion of appeals from Section 37 in Standing order No.245 would relate to orders passed under Section 37(1) and as such the inclusion of appeals from orders under Section 37 cannot be extended to mean appeals in relation to the orders passed under Section 37(2).\nb) Reliance placed on Section 6 of the Commercial Courts Act, to contend that the Commercial Court has no jurisdiction to hear appeals would apply equally to the jurisdiction of commercial divisions of High Courts under Section 7, as there is no provision for appeals being heard under Section 7. He would submit that Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act creates a separate jurisdiction in favour of the Commercial Courts and commercial (1974)2 SCC 393 (1969) 2 SCC 793 2022 SCC Online KAR 1631 RRR,J & HN,J divisions of High Courts. In that view of the matter, the restrictions under the Civil Courts Act restricting appeals beyond a value of Rs.50 lakhs to the High Court does not mean that the Commercial Courts would not have jurisdiction to hear appeals under Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act, even after the value of the appeal exceeds Rs.50 lakhs. Further, the Civil Courts Act precedes the Commercial Courts Act and the non obstante clause in the Commercial Courts Act would permit appeals to be heard by the Commercial Courts even if the value of such appeals exceed Rs.50 lakhs. Consideration of the Court:\n12. The order, under challenge, is an order passed under section 17 of the Arbitration Act. Section 37 of the Arbitration Act provides for appeals to a Court, against any order passed by an Arbitral Tribunal, under section 17, granting or refusing to grant interim measures. Section 37 reads as follows:\n37. Appealable orders.--(1) 2[Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, an appeal] shall lie from the following orders (and from no others) to the Court authorized by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the order, namely:--\n(a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8;\n(b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9; \n(c) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34. \n(2) Appeal shall also lie to a court from an order of the arbitral tribunal-- RRR,J & HN,J (a) accepting the plea referred to in sub-section (2) or sub- section (3) of section 16; or (b) granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under section 17. \n(3) No second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or takeaway any right to appeal to the Supreme Court. \n13. The Court mentioned in Section 37 is defined in Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, as follows:\n2.(1)(e) Court means-- (i) in the case of an arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a suit, but does not include any Civil Court of a grade inferior to such principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes;\n(ii) in the case of international commercial arbitration, the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a suit, and in other cases, a High Court having jurisdiction to hear appeals from decrees of courts subordinate to that High Court;\n14. The consistent view taken by various High Courts and the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been that the Court defined in Section 2(1)(e) of the RRR,J & HN,J Arbitration Act would be the District Judge of the District within whose jurisdiction the matter arises. It may also be noted that this definition includes the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in State of West Bengal v. Associated Contractors8, after reviewing the law on this issue, had held that even high courts which have original jurisdiction would fall within the definition of Court, under section 2 (1)\n(e) of the Arbitration Act. \n15. In the present case, the appeal has been filed under Section 37(2) of the Arbitration Act, by the appellant, being aggrieved by certain proceedings of the Arbitral Tribunal, under Section 17 of the Act. This would mean that the appeal should be heard by the Court as defined under Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act. That would be the District court or the High court, where such High Court exercises original civil jurisdiction. However, the Commercial Courts Act brings in certain changes in relation to appeals to be heard under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. \n16. Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act, stipulates that all applications and appeals arising out of Commercial Arbitration would lie before the courts, mentioned in Section 10, which reads as follows:\nSection 10. Jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters.-- Where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a Specified Value and-- (2014) 1 SCC 32 RRR,J & HN,J (1) If such arbitration is an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that have been filed in a High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such Commercial Division has been constituted in such High Court. (2) If such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that have been filed on the original side of the High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such Commercial Division has been constituted in such High Court. \n(3) If such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district (not being a High Court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial Court has been constituted. \n17. The issue before this Court is whether the appeal before this Court can be heard by this Court or whether the appeal would have to be heard by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over Visakhapatnam. \nRRR,J & HN,J 18. Under Section 10 (1) of the Commercial Courts Act, all applications and appeals arising out of international Commercial Arbitration would have to be filed before the Commercial Division of the High court. Under Section 10 (2) of the Commercial Courts Act, all applications and appeals arising out of any arbitration other than international Commercial Arbitration, which have been filed on the original side of the High Court would have to be heard by the Commercial Division of the High court. Under Section 10 (3) of the Commercial Courts Act, all applications and appeals arising out of any arbitration other than international Commercial Arbitration, which would normally be filed before the principal civil court of original district in the district would have to be heard by the Commercial Court exercising jurisdiction over the said arbitration. \n19. To start with, the language of section 10 (2), may require some clarification. This provision speaks of applications /appeals which have been filed on the original side. The words have been filed, on a first reading, in this provision, would mean that the provision is only catering to applications/appeals which have been filed prior to the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act. Another way of understanding this provision is that the applications/appeals, under this provision, have to be filed initially, on the original side of the High court, where such filing is permitted, and thereafter the applications/appeals would have to be placed before the Commercial Division of the High Court, for hearing and disposal. The first view would not RRR,J & HN,J advance the purpose of the Commercial Courts Act and this provision must be understood, in terms of the second view, to mean all prior and current applications/appeals. \n20. Another issue that comes up, while understanding Section 10 (2) of the Commercial Courts Act, is the constitution of the commercial Division. Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act provides for constitution of the Commercial Division of the High Court. This section reads as follows:\n4. Constitution of Commercial Division of High Court.--\n(1) In all High Courts, having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the Chief Justice of the High Court may, by order, constitute Commercial Division having one or more Benches consisting of a single Judge for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under this Act.\n(2) The Chief Justice of the High Court shall nominate such Judges of the High Court who have experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be Judges of the Commercial Division. \n21. Under this Section, the Commercial Division would consist of only single judges of that High Court. Further, a Commercial Division can be constituted only in a High Court having Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction. Section 10 (2) of the Commercial Courts Act also speaks of the Commercial Division hearing matters which have been filed on the original side of that High Court. Section 4 does not permit constitution of a commercial division in a RRR,J & HN,J High court which does not have Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction. This would lead to one difficulty. Section 10 (1) of the commercial Courts Act, requires applications and appeals from international arbitrations to be filed before the commercial Division of the High Court. If no such commercial divisions can be formed, under section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act, an aggrieved party would have no remedy against any award or other proceeding, in an international commercial arbitration. The only way this conundrum can be resolved is by holding that a commercial division constituted in a High court, which does not have Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction, can take up matters relating only to international arbitrations and not in relation to domestic arbitration. \n22. The High Court of Andhra Pradesh does not have Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction. However, a Commercial Division has been constituted, in the High court of Andhra Pradesh, by a notification dated 08.06.2016, which was published on 10.06.2016. It must also be noted that, this notification had been issued prior to the amendment of the Commercial Courts Act in 2018, wherein the words Ordinary Original civil Jurisdiction were added to the Statute. Consequently, the commercial division created in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh cannot hear appeals arising out of Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, in domestic arbitrations, either on the original side or by the commercial division constituted in the High Court. \nRRR,J & HN,J 23. This issue can be looked at in another way. Under Section 10 (2) matters which can be filed on the original side of the High court can be heard by a Commercial Division of the High Court. Matters which would normally be filed before the Court of original principal jurisdiction are to be heard by the commercial court having Jurisdiction over that area. In the present case, there is no original jurisdiction, under which an appeal under section 37 of the Arbitration Act can be filed. On the other hand, an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act would lie before the District court. Section 10(3) would be applicable and the appeal would have to be filed before the Commercial Court at Visakhapatnam. \n24. Another significant aspect requires to be mentioned. Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act, stipulates that a commercial Division would consist of a single judge while Section 5 stipulates that, a Commercial Appellate Division will consist of a Division Bench. A Bench of two Judges is normally referred to as a Division Bench. \n25. While the jurisdiction of the Commercial Division of the High Court is set out in Section 7 of the said Act, the Jurisdiction of the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court is set out in Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. Under this provision, only appeals from the decisions of the commercial Division of the High court and the decisions of the commercial court will be heard by the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court. \nRRR,J & HN,J The present appeal is against the order of the Arbitral Tribunal and an appeal against such an order does not fall within the ambit of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. \n26. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant relied upon a Division Bench of the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in ITI Ltd., vs. Alphion Corporation United States of America and Anr., This judgment came to be rendered in a case where an objection was taken on the maintainability of a commercial appeal under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, in an international commercial dispute, before the commercial appellate division of the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka. The objection raised, in this regard, was that the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act should have been heard by the commercial division of the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka and not the Commercial Appellate Division. \n27. The Division Bench of the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka, had gone into the question of whether the High Court of Karnataka which does not exercise ordinary original civil jurisdiction, can establish a commercial division and whether, the commercial appellate division established in terms of Section 5 of the commercial Courts Act could exercise powers over such international commercial arbitral awards. This Judgment is in accord with the interpretation placed by this court on the provisions of the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act. \nRRR,J & HN,J 28. The question of the pecuniary jurisdiction of the District courts, under the Andhra Pradesh Civil Courts Act, would not be relevant. The Jurisdiction of the Commercial Courts is created under the Commercial Courts Act and not under the Civil Courts Act. The District Judge rank officer is not sitting as a District Court, in a commercial dispute falling within the ambit of the Commercial Courts Act. He would be sitting as a Commercial Court, whose pecuniary jurisdiction is fixed under the Commercial Courts Act. We are also of the opinion that the reply of the respondent, set out in paragraph 11 of this order, is an answer to the contentions of the Appellant, set out in paragraph 10 of this order. \n29. The principles that can be adduced, from the above consideration are:\nA. A High Court which does not have ordinary Original Civil jurisdiction, cannot, ordinarily, constitute a Commercial Division, under Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act. \nB. However, a High Court, which does not have Ordinary Original Civil jurisdiction, can constitute a commercial Division for the purposes of hearing matters only in relation to International arbitrations, as set out in Section 10 (1) of the Commercial Courts Act. \nRRR,J & HN,J C. The Commercial Division constituted by a High Court, which does not have Ordinary Original Civil jurisdiction, cannot hear appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, arising out of domestic arbitrations. \nD. In the absence of a Commercial Division, which is capable of hearing appeals under section 37 of the Arbitration Act, the Commercial Court, having territorial jurisdiction over the domestic arbitration, would have jurisdiction to hear appeals under section 37 of the Arbitration Act. \nE. The Jurisdiction of the Commercial Appeal Division of the High Court, to hear appeals, is set out in Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, which reads as follows:\n13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions.--(1) 1 [Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court below the level of a District Judge may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order. (1A) Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order: Provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and section 37 of the RRR,J & HN,J Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996). ] (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act 30. As this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal, under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, I.A.No.5 of 2024 would have to be allowed. \n31. Accordingly, I.A.No.5 of 2024 is allowed. Consequently, the order of this Court dated 09.07.2024 in I.A.No.4 of 2023 is vacated and I.A.No.4 of 2024 is dismissed. \n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ R.

(ii) even accepting that the appeal is barred by limitation then also the same is fit to be condoned in view of the provision of section 14 of the limitation act, 1963 which provides that the period consumed in the pending proceeding will have to be excluded from the period of limitation. argument advanced on behalf of the respondent: 6. while on the other hand, mr. anish kr. mishra, learned counsel appearing for the respondents, has vehemently opposed the submission made on behalf of the appellant by raising the grounds in dismissing the appeal on the ground of limitation. 7. it has been contended by referring to the provision of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 wherein page 3 statutory period has been provided for filing the appeal, i.e., within a period of 60 days. 8. it has been contended that the aforesaid provision of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 has been interpreted by hon'ble apex court in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited [(2021) 6 scc 460] wherein the consideration has been given regarding the applicability of the provision of section 5 of the limitation act, 1963. 9. learned counsel for the respondent, in order to strengthen his augment, has relied upon a judgment rendered by the hon'ble apex court in government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer) vs. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) wherein the hon'ble apex court while stretching the period of limitation in exceptional circumstances has observed that the limitation is to be condoned by way of exception and not by way of rule, i.e., only in case where a party has otherwise acted bona fide and not in a negligent manner. 10. it has been contended basing upon the aforesaid proposition of law as has been settled by hon'ble apex court in the case of government of maharashtra (water page 4 resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) that in the matter of commercial disputes, where the primary object is to have the expeditious disposal of the disputes and that is the reason the statutory period has been provided under the provision of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 to file appeal within a period of 60 days. 11. therefore, the power has been conferred to the court for condoning the delay in exceptional cases by allowing the application filed under section 5 of the limitation act, 1963 and in the rarest of rare cases, the said power can be exercised but herein, even no interlocutory application has been filed for condonation of delay which shows negligent approach of the appellant. 12. hence, according to the learned counsel, in the instant case if the litigant is able to show the sufficient cause which caused delay in filing the appeal, then only in exceptional circumstances the delay in filing the instant appeal can be condoned. 13. it has been submitted by referring to the factual aspect of the present case that the suit was filed before the commercial court having its jurisdiction which has been dismissed vide order dated 12.07.2018. page 5 14. the appellant preferred an appeal before this court being commercial appeal no.08 of 2019 but the coordinate division bench of this court has dismissed the said appeal, however, with the liberty to the appellant to file a fresh commercial appeal after getting necessary correction in the judgment and decree in commercial case no.478 of 2011 within a period of three months from the date of the order. 15. the submission, therefore, has been made that the limitation cannot be counted from the date of order passed by the coordinate division bench whereby and whereunder liberty has been granted to file appeal within a period of three months, rather, the period of three months has only been given for the purpose of filing appeal and, as such, it cannot be presumed that the limitation will be counted from the date of passing of the order by the coordinate bench in commercial appeal no.08 of 2019. 16. the reference of the provision of order xxiii rule 2 of the c.p.c. has also been made whereby and whereunder it has been provided that in any fresh suit instituted on permission granted under the last preceding rule, the plaintiff shall be bound by the law of limitation in the same manner as if the first suit had not been instituted. 17. the office, based upon the aforesaid provision of law, as provided under rule xxiii rule 2 of the c.p.c., has pointed page 6 out the limitation, then in such circumstances, it cannot be said that the said office note is improper and not acceptable. 18. the \"sufficient cause\" has also been taken into consideration in the judgment rendered in government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) whereby and whereunder it has been dealt with that the \"sufficient cause\" will only be said to be sufficient cause if the party concerned without any negligent approach has followed the legal procedure in filing the appeal with all due diligence. 19. herein, it cannot be said that the appellant has not shown the negligent attitude since, vide order dated 03.03.2021 the order under challenge was sent to the commercial court, ranchi for correction for which the appellant had filed i.a. no.5489 of 2020 but after two years, when the matter came up on board, learned counsel for the appellant stated that the corrected copy of the judgment and decree in commercial case no.478 of 2011 is still defective, as such, the said appeal was dismissed by the co-ordinate division bench of this court with a liberty to file a fresh one, which itself shows that the appellant had not approached the court with all due diligence, rather, the appellant had approached this court in a very negligent manner. page 7 20. the argument, therefore, has been advanced that in such circumstances if the period of limitation will be waived to be counted from the date of the liberty so granted by the court of law, then the very purpose and object of the commercial courts act, 2015 will be frustrated. 21. the further argument has been advanced that there is no dispute about the proposition of law regarding the applicability of section 14 of the limitation act, 1963 since section 14 is made to be applicable in a case where the litigant has approached the wrong forum after filing the appeal within statutory period and in such circumstances, the period consumed in pending litigation before the incorrect forum is to be excluded but that is not the factual aspect herein, rather, here the question of negligent approach and due diligence is the matter of concern since, the appellant had approached to the correct forum but in a negligent manner and without due diligence. 22. thus, the instant case is neither the case of pending litigation before incorrect forum, rather, the forum was correct which suggests the negligent approach of the appellant and the lack of diligence in pursuing the remedy of appeal. 23. the learned counsel, based upon the aforesaid ground, has submitted that since the delay is of 1022 days and based page 8 upon the aforesaid reasons, the instant appeal is fit to be dismissed on limitation. analysis and consideration: 24. heard learned counsel for the parties. 25. this court, before appreciating the rival submissions made on behalf of the parties, is of the view that the issue of limitation is to be dealt with herein for the purpose of showing the sufficient cause. 26. the consideration of meaning of 'sufficient cause' has been made in basawaraj & anr. vrs. spl. land acquisition officer, [(2013) 14 scc 81], wherein, it has been held at paragraphs 9 to 15 which read hereunder as:\"9. sufficient cause is the cause for which the defendant could not be blamed for his absence. the meaning of the word \"sufficient\" is \"adequate\" or \"enough\", inasmuch as may be necessary to answer the purpose intended. therefore, the word \"sufficient\" embraces no more than that which provides a platitude, which when the act done suffices to accomplish the purpose intended in the facts and circumstances existing in a case, duly examined from the viewpoint of a reasonable standard of a cautious man. in this context, \"sufficient cause\" means that the party should not have acted in a negligent manner or there was a want of bona fide on its part in view of the facts and circumstances of a case or it cannot be alleged that the party has \"not acted diligently\" or \"remained inactive\". however, the facts and circumstances of each case must afford sufficient ground to enable the court concerned to exercise discretion for the reason that whenever the court exercises discretion, it has to be exercised judiciously. page 9 the applicant must satisfy the court that he was prevented by any \"sufficient cause\" from prosecuting his case, and unless a satisfactory explanation is furnished, the court should not allow the application for condonation of delay. the court has to examine whether the mistake is bona fide or was merely a device to cover an ulterior purpose. (see manindra land and building corpn. ltd. v. bhutnath banerjee [air 1964 sc 1336], mata din v. a. narayanan [(1969) 2 scc 770 : air 1970 sc 1953] , parimal v. veena [(2011) 3 scc 545 : (2011) 2 scc (civ) 1 : air 2011 sc 1150] and maniben devraj shah v. municipal corpn. of brihan mumbai [(2012) 5 scc 157 : (2012) 3 scc (civ) 24 : air 2012 sc 1629] .) 10. in arjun singh v. mohindra kumar [air 1964 sc 993] this court explained the difference between a \"good cause\" and a \"sufficient cause\" and observed that every \"sufficient cause\" is a good cause and vice versa. however, if any difference exists it can only be that the requirement of good cause is complied with on a lesser degree of proof than that of \"sufficient cause\". 11. the expression \"sufficient cause\" should be given a liberal interpretation to ensure that substantial justice is done, but only so long as negligence, inaction or lack of bona fides cannot be imputed to the party concerned, whether or not sufficient cause has been furnished, can be decided on the facts of a particular case and no straitjacket formula is possible. (vide madanlal v. shyamlal [(2002) 1 scc 535 : air 2002 sc 100] and ram nath sao v. gobardhan sao [(2002) 3 scc 195 : air 2002 sc 1201] .) 12. it is a settled legal proposition that law of limitation may harshly affect a particular party but it has to be applied with all its rigour when the statute so prescribes. the court has no power to extend the period of limitation on equitable grounds. \"a result flowing from a statutory provision is never an evil. a court has no power to ignore that provision to relieve page 10 what it considers a distress resulting from its operation.\" the statutory provision may cause hardship or inconvenience to a particular party but the court has no choice but to enforce it giving full effect to the same. the legal maxim dura lex sed lex which means \"the law is hard but it is the law\", stands attracted in such a situation. it has consistently been held that, \"inconvenience is not\" a decisive factor to be considered while interpreting a statute. 13. the statute of limitation is founded on public policy, its aim being to secure peace in the community, to suppress fraud and perjury, to quicken diligence and to prevent oppression. it seeks to bury all acts of the past which have not been agitated unexplainably and have from lapse of time become stale. according to halsbury's laws of england, vol. 28, p. 266: \"605. policy of the limitation acts.--the courts have expressed at least three differing reasons supporting the existence of statutes of limitations namely, (1) that long dormant claims have more of cruelty than justice in them, (2) that a defendant might have lost the evidence to disprove a stale claim, and (3) that persons with good causes of actions should pursue them with reasonable diligence.\" an unlimited limitation would lead to a sense of insecurity and uncertainty, and therefore, limitation prevents disturbance or deprivation of what may have been acquired in equity and justice by long enjoyment or what may have been lost by a party's own inaction, negligence or laches. (see popat and kotecha property v. sbi staff assn. [(2005) 7 scc 510] , rajender singh v. santa singh [(1973) 2 scc 705 : air 1973 sc 2537] and pundlik jalam patil v. jalgaon medium project [(2008) 17 scc 448 : (2009) 5 scc (civ) 907] .) 14. in p. ramachandra rao v. state of karnataka [(2002) 4 scc 578 : 2002 scc (cri) 830 : air 2002 sc 1856] this court held that judicially engrafting principles of limitation amounts to legislating and page 11 would fly in the face of law laid down by the constitution bench in abdul rehman antulay v. r.s. nayak [(1992) 1 scc 225 : 1992 scc (cri) 93 : air 1992 sc 1701] . 15. the law on the issue can be summarised to the effect that where a case has been presented in the court beyond limitation, the applicant has to explain the court as to what was the \"sufficient cause\" which means an adequate and enough reason which prevented him to approach the court within limitation. in case a party is found to be negligent, or for want of bona fide on his part in the facts and circumstances of the case, or found to have not acted diligently or remained inactive, there cannot be a justified ground to condone the delay. no court could be justified in condoning such an inordinate delay by imposing any condition whatsoever. the application is to be decided only within the parameters laid down by this court in regard to the condonation of delay. in case there was no sufficient cause to prevent a litigant to approach the court on time condoning the delay without any justification, putting any condition whatsoever, amounts to passing an order in violation of the statutory provisions and it tantamounts to showing utter disregard to the legislature.\" 27. thus, it is evident that the sufficient cause means that the party should not have acted in a negligent manner or there was a want of bona fide on its part in view of the facts and circumstances of a case or it cannot be alleged that the party has \"not acted deliberately\" or \"remained inactive\". however, the facts and circumstances of each case must afford sufficient ground to enable the court concerned to exercise discretion for the reason that whenever the court exercises discretion, it has to be exercised judiciously. the page 12 applicant must satisfy the court that he was prevented by any \"sufficient cause\" from prosecuting his case, and unless a satisfactory explanation is furnished, the court should not allow the application for condonation of delay. 28. it is thus evident from the aforesaid proposition of law that the said judgment has been passed on consideration of the issue of condonation of delay while entertaining the application under section 5 of the limitation act, 1963. 29. thus, it is evident that the aforesaid judgment has considered the applicability of section 5 of the limitation act to be made applicable in a case where the delay is to be condoned depending upon the sufficient cause if shown by the concerned litigant that is the general principle of applicability of section 5 of the limitation act. 30. herein, section 14 of the limitation act is also required to be dealt with, for ready reference the same is referred herein:\"14. exclusion of time of proceeding bona fide in court without jurisdiction.--(1) in computing the period of limitation for any suit the time during which the plaintiff has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance or of appeal or revision, against the defendant shall be excluded, where the proceeding relates to the same matter in issue and is prosecuted in good faith in a court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it. (2) in computing the period of limitation for any application, the time during which the applicant page 13 has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance or of appeal or revision, against the same party for the same relief shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it. (3) notwithstanding anything contained in rule 2 of order xxiii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), the provisions of sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to a fresh suit instituted on permission granted by the court under rule 1 of that order, where such permission is granted on the ground that the first suit must fail by reason of a defect in the jurisdiction of the court or other cause of a like nature. explanation.--for the purposes of this section,-(a) in excluding the time during which a former civil proceeding was pending, the day on which that proceeding was instituted and the day on which it ended shall both be counted; (b) a plaintiff or an applicant resisting an appeal shall be deemed to be prosecuting a proceeding; (c) misjoinder of parties or of causes of action shall be deemed to be a cause of a like nature with defect of jurisdiction.\" 31. it is evident from the provision of section 14 of the limitation act that the period in approaching the appellate forum even after the due diligence of the concerned litigant if the appeal has been filed before incorrect forum and subsequently the same has not been entertained and liberty if granted to approach the appropriate forum, then the page 14 pending proceeding before the incorrect forum is to be excluded. 32. the word \"diligence\" is having bearing over the applicability of section 14 of the limitation act, 1963 which means that if the party has approached with due diligence but not before the correct forum, rather, before the incorrect forum, in such circumstances, the period consumed in pending litigation before the incorrect forum is to be excluded. 33. but we are here dealing with a special enactment, i.e., commercial courts act, 2015. therefore, the basic object of the commercial courts act, 2015 is to be taken into consideration which is mainly for the purpose of expeditious disposal of the commercial disputes. 34. the commercial courts act, 2015 has been brought into force even though the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 was in vogue the day when the commercial courts act, 2015 was enacted. but, under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, there was no rigid principle has been made applicable in condoning the delay and that is the reason the commercial courts act, 2015 has been enacted by carving out a forum as under section 13 thereof, for ready reference section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 is being quoted hereunder as :\"13. appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions.--(1) 1 [any person page 15 aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court below the level of a district judge may appeal to the commercial appellate court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order. (1a) any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court at the level of district judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order: provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996).] (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\" 35. it is evident from the provision of section 13 that the appeal is to be filed before the high court having appellate jurisdiction within a period of 60 days from the date of judgment/decree. 36. the aforesaid provision does not refer about the applicability of section 5 of the limitation act, as per the original enactment. however, the hon'ble apex court in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse page 16 brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) has taken into consideration the aforesaid issue by taking into consideration the fact that the rigid principle of section 5 of the limitation act is not applicable in the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 but the applicability of section 5 of the limitation act, 1996 has been made applicable with all rigidity if the provision of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 will be taken into consideration. 37. the hon'ble apex court, by taking into consideration the very object and intent of the commercial courts act, 2015 as under the relevant paragraph has considered the issue of applicability to condone the delay whereby and whereunder the application of section 5 of the limitation act has been held to be acceptable but with the condition that the same is to be applied with all circumspection in a case where there is delay if caused in filing the appeal by taking into consideration the bona fide approach of the litigant concerned and it is not in the negligent manner. 38. this court since has referred the judgment rendered by the hon'ble apex court in government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer) vs. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) wherein the prayer for condonation of delay of 131 days was there for which explanation was page 17 furnished of file pushing and administrative exigency; further while refusing to condone the delay of 75 days due to the procedural approval and the ground since the appellant is a public entity under the energy department of the state government the delay caused in filing the appeal has been said to be bona fide and as such deserves to be condoned but such explanation, does not find the same as sufficient ground for condonation of delay. even the delay of 200 days in filing the appeal was refused to be condoned while passing order in s.l.p. (c) no. 18079 of 2020, for ready reference, paragraphs 53,58, 63 and 64 of the aforesaid judgment are being quoted herein: \"53. however, the matter does not end here. the question still arises as to the application of section 5 of the limitation act to appeals which are governed by a uniform 60-day period of limitation. at one extreme, we have the judgment in n.v. international [n.v. international v. state of assam, (2020) 2 scc 109 : (2020) 1 scc (civ) 275] which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and at the other extreme, we have an open-ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown. it is between these two extremes that we have to steer a middle course. 58. given the object sought to be achieved under both the arbitration act and the commercial courts act, that is, the speedy resolution of disputes, the expression \"sufficient cause\" is not elastic enough to cover long delays beyond the period provided by the appeal provision itself. besides, the expression \"sufficient cause\" is not itself a loose panacea for the page 18 ill of pressing negligent and stale claims. . 63. given the aforesaid and the object of speedy disposal sought to be achieved both under the arbitration act and the commercial courts act, for appeals filed under section 37 of the arbitration act that are governed by articles 116 and 117 of the limitation act or section 13(1-a) of the commercial courts act, a delay beyond 90 days, 30 days or 60 days, respectively, is to be condoned by way of exception and not by way of rule. in a fit case in which a party has otherwise acted bona fide and not in a negligent manner, a short delay beyond such period can, in the discretion of the court, be condoned, always bearing in mind that the other side of the picture is that the opposite party may have acquired both in equity and justice, what may now be lost by the first party's inaction, negligence or laches. 64. coming to the facts of the appeals before us, in the civil appeal arising out of slp (c) no. 665 of 2021, the impugned judgment of the high court of bombay, dated 17-12-2020 [state of maharashtra v. borse bros. engineers & contractors (p) ltd., 2020 scc online bom 10453] , has found that the government of maharashtra had not approached the court bona fide, as follows : (borse brothers case [state of maharashtra v. borse bros. engineers & contractors (p) ltd., 2020 scc online bom 10453] , scc online bom para 7) \"7. i have carefully gone through the papers. there can be no doubt in view of the documentary evidence in the form of copy of the application tendered by the advocate representing the applicant for obtaining a certified copy (ext. r-1) that in fact, after pronouncement of the judgment and order in the proceeding under section 34 of the act, the advocate concerned had applied for certified copy page 19 on 14-5-2019. the endorsement further reads that it was to be handed over to mr a.d. patil of the irrigation department, dhule, who is a staff from the office of the applicant. the further endorsements also clearly show that the certified copy was ready and was to be delivered on 27-52019. inspite of such a stand and document, the applicant has not controverted this or has not come up with any other stand touching this aspect. it is therefore apparent that the applicant is not coming to the court with clean hands even while seeking the discretionary relief of condonation of delay. 66. in the civil appeal arising out of slp (c) no. 15278 of 2020, the impugned judgment of the high court of madhya pradesh dated 27-12020 [m.p. poorv kshetra vidyut vitran co. ltd. v. swastik wires, 2020 scc online mp 3003] relies upon consolidated engg. [consolidated engg. enterprises v. irrigation deptt., (2008) 7 scc 169] and thereby states that the judgment of this court in n.v. international [n.v. international v. state of assam, (2020) 2 scc 109 : (2020) 1 scc (civ) 275] would not apply. the judgment of the high court is wholly incorrect inasmuch as consolidated engg. [consolidated engg. enterprises v. irrigation deptt., (2008) 7 scc 169] was a judgment which applied the provisions of section 14 of the limitation act and had nothing to do with the application of section 5 of the limitation act. n.v. international [n.v. international v. state of assam, (2020) 2 scc 109 : (2020) 1 scc (civ) 275] was a direct judgment which applied the provisions of section 5 of the limitation act and then held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days. the high court was bound to follow n.v. international [n.v. international v. state of assam, (2020) 2 scc page 20 109 : (2020) 1 scc (civ) 275] , as on the date of the judgment of the high court, n.v. international [n.v. international v. state of assam, (2020) 2 scc 109 : (2020) 1 scc (civ) 275] was a judgment of the two learned judges of the supreme court binding upon the high court by virtue of article 141 of the constitution. on this score, the impugned judgment of the high court deserves to be set aside. 67. that apart, on the facts of this appeal, there is a long delay of 75 days beyond the period of 60 days provided by the commercial courts act. despite the fact that a certified copy of the district court's judgment was obtained by the respondent on 27-4-2019, the appeal was filed only on 9-9-2019, the explanation for delay being: \"2. that, the certified copy of the order dated 1-4-2013 was received by the appellant on 27-4-2019. thereafter the matter was placed before the cgm purchase mppkvvcl for the compliance of the order. the same was then sent to the law officer, mppkvvcl for opinion. 3. that after taking opinion for appeal, and approval of the authorities concerned, the officer-in-charge was appointed vide order dated 23-7-2019. 4. that, thereafter due to bulky records of the case and for procurement of the necessary documents some delay has been caused however, the appeal has been prepared and filed pursuant to the same and further delay. 5. that due to the aforesaid procedural approval and since the appellant is a public entity formed under the energy department of page 8 of 20 commercial appeal no. 20 of page 21 2019 the state government, the delay caused in filing the appeal is bona fide and which deserve[s] to be condoned.\" 68. this explanation falls woefully short of making out any sufficient cause. this appeal is therefore allowed and the condonation of delay is set aside on this score also. 69. in the civil appeal arising out of slp (c) diary no. 18079 of 2020, there is a huge delay of 227 days in filing the appeal, and a 200-day delay in refiling. the facts of this case also show that there was no sufficient cause whatsoever to condone such a long delay. the impugned judgment of the high court of delhi dated 15-102019 [union of india v. associated construction co., 2019 scc online del 10797] cannot be faulted on this score and this appeal is consequently dismissed.\" 39. the reference is also required to be made of the provision of order xxiii rule 2 of the code of civil procedure wherein it has been provided that the liberty can be granted by the concerned court but while granting liberty, the limitation is to be counted as if the subsequent suit is the first one, i.e., from the date of original judgment, for ready reference, rule xxiii rule 2 is being quoted herein :\"2. limitation law not affected by first suit.--in any fresh suit instituted on permission granted under the last preceding rule, the plaintiff shall be bound by the law of limitation in the same manner as if the first suit had not been instituted.\" 40. adverting to the factual aspect of the present case, herein the case was filed by the appellant/plaintiff before the commercial court having its jurisdiction. the plaint was page 22 rejected vide order dated 12.07.2018. the said order was challenged before this court by filing appeal being commercial appeal no.08 of 2019 but in the said order it has been observed that by an order dated 03.03.2021, the order under challenge was sent to the commercial court, ranchi for correction for which the appellant had filed i.a. no. 5489 of 2020 but after two years, when the matter was taken up on board, learned counsel for the appellant stated that the corrected copy of the judgment and decree in commercial case no.478 of 2011 is still defective, the commercial appeal was dismissed as withdrawn with a liberty to file a fresh one along after getting necessary correction in the aforesaid judgment and decree in commercial case no. 478 of 2011 within a period of three months from the date of the order. for ready reference the order dated 16.03.2023 is being quoted hereunder :\"this appeal was filed on 22nd october 2018 with defects. besides opportunities granted to the appellant on 19th june 2019 and 14th may 2019, the defects pointed out by the registry were not removed and on 19th june 2019 when this matter (at that time fa no. 407 of 2018) was listed before the court, the nomenclature of the case was permitted to be corrected. thereafter, this matter again was listed before the joint registrar (judl.) on 14th october 2019 and the registrar general on 1st july 2020 for removing the defects. page 23 on 30th september 2020, a coordinate bench of this court has noticed the following defects which was still subsisting: \"07/30.09.2020 mr. pradeep kr. deomani, learned counsel for the appellant prays for and is allowed two weeks' time to remove the following defects: (i) nomenclature & case number may be corrected in presentation form and vak. (ii) limitation pet. may be filed. (iii) 2nd set of memo may be filed. (iv) present address of sole appellant's representative may be corrected in memo, affidavit & vak. as per c.c. of decree. (v) paragraph no. given at para-3 of affidavit may be corrected. (vi) execution of representative of sole appellant differs in vak from name in memo. (vii) cause title may be corrected at page-1. mr. mithilesh singh, g.a.-iv appears for the state. let his name be reflected in the cause list henceforth in place of the erstwhile state counsel.\" it appears that thereafter by an order dated 3rd march 2021 the order under challenge was sent to the commercial court, ranchi for correction for which the appellant had filed ia no. 5489 of 2020. after about two years, this matter has come up on board and now the learned counsel for the appellant states that the corrected copy of the judgment and decree in commercial case no. 478 of 2011 is still defective. while so, we permit the appellant to withdraw the commercial appeal no. 08 of 2019 with liberty to challenge the judgment dated 12th july 2018 passed in commercial case no. 478 of 2011 and the decree signed on 23rd july 2018 after getting necessary correction in the aforesaid judgment and decree in page 24 commercial case no. 478 of 2011, within a period of three months from today. this commercial appeal no. 08 of 2019 is dismissed as withdrawn with the aforesaid liberty to the appellant.\" 41. the interpretation which is being given by the learned counsel for the appellant by placing the order passed by the co-ordinate division bench that since the liberty was granted to the appellant to file appeal within a period of three months, hence, the appeal was to be filed within the period of three months and accordingly, the instant appeal has been filed within the said period and, therefore, it is not the case where the limitation is to be counted from the date of the order dated 12.07.2018 passed by the commercial court, ranchi in commercial case no. 478 of 2011. 42. this court is not in agreement with the aforesaid interpretation of the order dated 16.03.2023 in view of the fact the co-ordinate division bench has simply granted liberty by giving maximum time to prefer appeal, i.e., within the period of three months, that does not mean while granting such liberty the provision under order xxiii rule 2 is given a go bye. 43. granting liberty to file an appeal within the period of three months does not mean that the limitation will not be the issue if the appeal will be filed within the period of three months. page 25 44. the provision of c.p.c. since contains a provision that the period of limitation is to be counted in case of liberty having been granted to approach the court and the period of limitation will be counted from the date of judgment/decree. otherwise, keeping into consideration the very object and intent of commercial courts act, 2015 in the present facts of the case, the object of the said act will be redundant which is mainly for the expeditious disposal of the commercial disputes. if such thing will be allowed to be carried out, then the party concerned will be indulged in such practice which will ultimately lead to lingering of the commercial disputes and will ultimately frustrate the very object and intent of the commercial courts act, 2015. 45. therefore, the aforesaid object has been taken into consideration by the hon'ble apex court also in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) as per the paragraphs which have been referred hereinabove wherein also the object of the commercial courts act, 2015 has been taken into consideration based upon that the hon'ble apex court has laid down the proposition that although the section 5 of the limitation act has limited applicability under the statutory provision as contained in the commercial courts act, 2015 but conferring page 26 discretionary power to the concerned court in the rarest of rare case to condone the delay of a very shorter period depending upon the sufficient cause as also if there is no negligent approach of the party concerned. 46. the negligent approach has been taken into consideration and the due diligence said to be the sufficient cause for condoning the delay is the two parameters for the purpose of condoning the delay as per the judgment passed by hon'ble apex court in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra). 47. sufficient cause has also been interpreted by hon'ble apex court in the judgment referred hereinabove and if the spirit of the judgments will be taken into consideration in the context of the commercial courts act, 2015, it would be evident that for the purpose of expeditious disposal, it is the bounden duty of the concerned court that in the rarest of rare case the principle is to be made applicable in view of the judgment rendered in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra), as such, the conduct of the party concerned is to be taken into consideration so as to reach to the conclusion as to whether the conduct of the page 27 parties is in negligent manner or any due diligence is there or not. 48. herein, it is the admitted case of the appellant that due to the copy of the judgment and decree in commercial case no.478 of 2011 being defective, the appeal was sought to be withdrawn and accordingly the court has granted such leave, however with the liberty to file commercial appeal afresh. 49. herein, taking into consideration the admitted case of the appellant that without getting the necessary correction in the judgment and decree in commercial case no.478 of 2011 at the time of filing of the appeal at the first instance, i.e. commercial appeal no.08 of 2019, therefore, according to our considered view, it cannot come under the fold of rarest of rare case. 50. further, the period of delay is also of 1022 days, the hon'ble apex court, in the government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) has refused to condone the delay of 75 days, 131 days and 200 days. 51. the learned counsel for the appellant however has tried to impress upon the court by applying the provision of section 14 of the limitation act, 1963. 52. but the applicability of section 14 of the limitation act is not in dispute, rather, the applicability of section 14 is to page 28 be taken into consideration in the light of the judgment rendered by hon'ble apex court in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) where the specific act, i.e., commercial courts act, 2015 has been taken into consideration. 53. further, it is not the case herein that incorrect forum was approached by the litigant concerned/appellant, rather, the forum was correct but the pleading was not proper and the documents were not appended with the memo of appeal, therefore, in that view of the matter also, it is not a case where the principle laid down under section 14 of the limitation act is to be made applicable. 54. the period of delay is 1022 days in the present case and the explanation so furnished by the appellant is that the appeal since has been filed within the period of three months, hence, the appeal cannot be said to be barred by limitation of 1022 days, save and except that, there is no explanation. 55. since we have already dealt with that the limitation is to be counted in view of the provision as contained under the commercial courts act, 2015 from the date of judgment and the appeal to be filed within the period of 60 days. page 29 56. the office by taking into consideration the aforesaid statutory provision, since has pointed out the delay of 1022 days, but there is no explanation save and except the explanation that the appeal has been filed within the period of three months from the date of order passed by the coordinate division bench of this court on 16.03.2023 in commercial appeal no.08 of 2019. 57. the law is settled that the things are to be done strictly in accordance with the statutory provision and there cannot be interpretation beyond the statutory provision. reference in this regard may be taken from the judgments rendered by the hon'ble apex court in state of uttar pradesh vs. singhara singh and ors., air (1964) sc 358 (para-25), babu verghese and ors. vs. bar council of kerala and ors., (1999) 3 scc 422 (para-31,32), commissioner of income tax, mumbai vs. anjum m.h. ghaswala & ors., (2002) 1 scc 633 (para-27), state of jharkhand & ors. vs. ambay cements & anr., (2005) 1 scc 368 (para-26) and zuari cement ltd. vs. regional direction esic hyderabad & ors., (2015) 7 scc 690 (para-14,26). 58. the order passed by the coordinate division bench if taken into consideration the principle of harmonious interpretation of the statutory provision as contained under section 13 of the act 2015, it would be evident that the purport of the order passed by the coordinate division bench page 30 is only to file the appeal within the period of three months which does not mean that the statutory mandate to file appeal within the period of 60 days from the date of decree/judgment is to be waived out. 59. further, the instant appeal has been filed on 14.06.2023 but even after lapse of more than one year, no interlocutory application for condonation of delay has been filed. 60. in view of the discussion made by referring the provision of rule xxiii rule 2 c.p.c. and the principle laid down by hon'ble apex court in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra), this court is of the view that the instant appeal is hopelessly barred by limitation which the office has rightly pointed out. 61. accordingly, the instant appeal deserves to be dismissed and the same is hereby dismissed.
