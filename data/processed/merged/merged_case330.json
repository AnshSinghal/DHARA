The petitioner has preferred to invoke the power of superintendence vested in this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution impugning the order dated 10.04.2023 passed by learned District Judge  (Commercial Court) -01, West, Tis Hazari Court, Delhi (in short \"Commercial Court\") in CS (COMM) No. 320/2021 titled as \"Sh. Naveen Sabharwal Proprietor M/s Nav Prints vs Shr. Rajesh Wadhawan Proprietor M/s Global Trendz\"\nwhereby petitioner's written statement was not allowed to form part of the record in view of non-conformity to Order VI Rule 15A of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short \"CPC\") thereby striking of his defence in the suit. \n2. It would be apposite to elucidate the relevant facts starting with the respondent filing a suit for recovery of Rs. 33,50,081/- against the petitioner before the learned Commercial Court wherein the summons were issued to the petitioner on 13.08.2021. The petitioner was served with summon of the suit through WhatsApp and email on 26.08.2021. On 23.10.2021, the petitioner did not appear before the learned Commercial Court and hence was proceeded ex-parte. Later that day, the petitioner appeared before the Court and was apprised of the order passed and an application for setting aside ex-parte order was moved on the same day. The application of the petitioner was allowed on 25.11.2021 and the ex-parte order was set aside by the learned Commercial Court and the matter was posted for filing of written statement subject to issue of limitation on 05.01.2022.\n3. Thereafter, the petitioner on 04.01.2022 filed the written statement along with the affidavit through the email and also filed the physical copy of the same on 06.01.2022 before the learned Commercial Court. \n4. Upon filing of the written statement, the respondent filed replication along with an application under Order VI Rule 15A CPC for striking the petitioner's written statement off the record on the ground that the written statement as filed by the petitioner does not comply with the mandate of Order VI Rule 15A CPC as the same is not duly supported by the statement of truth and signatures are not appended on each and every page of the written statement. \n5. Due to non-appearance of the petitioner, the learned Commercial Court on 09.05.2022 again proceeded ex-parte against the petitioner and posted the matter for ex-parte plaintiff's evidence. Upon learning of this, petitioner filed an application under Order IX Rule 7 CPC seeking to set aside the said ex-parte order dated 09.05.2022 which was allowed vide order dated 26.11.2022 subject to cost of Rs. 4,000. Matter was then fixed for reply and consideration of the application of the respondent under Order VI Rule 15A CPC on 24.01.2023.\n6. Subsequently, the petitioner filed reply to the said application of the respondent and also moved an application under Order V Rule 1 read with Section 151 CPC seeking condonation of delay in filing the written statement after curing the defective written statement supported by statement of truth and with signatures appended on each and every page. Respondent filed reply to the application of the petitioner and the arguments were heard on 18.03.2023. Vide the impugned order, the learned Commercial Court dismissed the petitioner's application under Order V Rule 1 CPC and allowed the application of the respondent under Order VI Rule 15A CPC thereby striking off the written statement from the record by not allowing the petitioner to rely on it. Hence, the present petition before this Court. Contentions of the Parties 7. Mr. Tarun Satija, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that petitioner had filed the written statement on 04.01.2022 and its physical copy was placed on record on 06.01.2022 which is within the extended time of limitation as provided by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, (2021) 17 SCC 231, however, the learned Commercial Court erred in dismissing application holding that no explanation was given by the petitioner for not curing the defects in the written statement within reasonable period once the defects came into petitioner's knowledge. \n8. Learned counsel vehemently submitted that provisions under Order VI Rule 15A CPC are directory in nature and non-compliance will not render the filing of the written statement non-est as the said defects are curable in nature. Thus, limitation would also stop running the moment the written statement is filed. \n9. Learned counsel further submitted that delay in re-filing of the written statement has to be treated on a different footing than delay in filing the original written statement, specifically when the defects are not material and only procedural not affecting the substance of the written statement, the delay in re-filing could be condoned. \n10. Learned counsel also submitted that the written statement after removing defects could not be immediately filed as the petitioner's son was undergoing continuous treatment for a serious medical ailment and was admitted to the Hospital for 15 days. The learned Commercial Court has ignored the said fact while considering his application. \n11. In this regard, the learned Counsel in support of his contentions placed reliance on various judgements set hereinbelow:\n1. Udai Shankar Triyar v. Ram Kalevar Prasad Singh, 2005 SCC OnLine SC 2. Delhi Development Authority v. Durga Construction Co., (2013) SCC OnLine Del 4451 3. M/s Unilec Engineer Ltd. v. HPL Electric and Power Ltd, 2023 SCC OnLine Del 5162 4.

Ltd. v. Hindustan Steelworks Construction Ltd., 2021 SCC OnLine Cal 2457 12. Per contra, Mr. Rajesh Mahindra, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the petitioner has been delaying the present suit since its inception and therefore, the conduct of the petitioner is required to be seriously looked at. Moreso, due to non-appearance of the petitioner on various dates, the learned Commercial Court had proceeded ex-parte twice, which orders were set aside subsequently on the applications moved by the petitioner before the learned Commercial Court. However, petitioner had been deliberately delaying the proceedings of respondent's suit on flimsy grounds. \n13. Learned counsel submitted that petitioner has failed to furnish any explanation for not filing the written statement after alleged removal of defects within a reasonable time period from filing of the first written statement i.e. 04.01.2022.\n14. It was contended that the petitioner has no right to file the subsequent written statement as under no provision of law without seeking amendment, a second written statement is permissible to be placed on record, more so, the said written statement is to be tested from date of filing and limitation is to be calculated from date of service. Since, subsequent written statement was filed on 13.01.2023, almost after one year which is beyond 120 days, thus, the said written statement which is highly belated, it cannot be taken on record and is liable to be rejected. \n15. It was further submitted although no limitation period is prescribed for curing the defects, however, it cannot be more than the total period of limitation provided for filing a written statement. Reliance, was placed on Prayag Polytech P. Ltd. vs Raj Kumar Tulsian, 2023 SCC OnLine Del 6058.\n16. Concluding his submissions, the learned counsel submitted that the case before the learned Commercial Court is at the final stage and even the written submissions in support of the arguments has been filed by the respondent and thus the petitioner cannot be permitted to restart the entire trial after more than three years having been passed since the filing of the suit. \nReasons and Conclusion 17. Before coming to the factual matrix of the case, it will be apposite to produce the provision under Order VI Rule 15A of CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, which is hereunder:\n\"[15A Verification of pleadings in a commercial dispute -- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in Rule 15, every pleading in a commercial dispute shall be verified by an affidavit in the manner and form prescribed in the Appendix to this Schedule. \n(2) An affidavit under sub-rule (1) above shall be signed by the party or by one of the parties to the proceedings, or by any other person on behalf of such party or parties who is proved to the satisfaction of the Court to be acquainted with the facts of the case and who is duly authorised by such party or parties. (3) Where a pleading is amended, the amendments must be verified in the form and manner referred to in sub-rule (1) unless the Court orders otherwise. (4) Where a pleading is not verified in the manner provided under sub-rule (1), the party shall not be permitted to rely on such pleading as evidence or any of the matters set out therein. \n(5) The Court may strike out a pleading which is not verified by a Statement of Truth, namely, the affidavit set out in the Appendix to this Schedule.]\n18. The aforesaid provision mandates the verification of pleadings by way of an affidavit, which ensures that the statements made in the pleadings are duly authenticated and verified under oath and in absence of such verification, the pleadings cannot be relied as evidence. Even if the pleading is to be amended, the same has to be abided by the rigors of Order VI Rule 15A CPC and non-compliance of which may result in the Court rejecting the pleading or would require the party to have such defects rectified.\n19. The statement of truth accompanying a pleading is sworn by the deponent who on oath undertakes that the contents of the accompanying pleading have been drafted as under his directions and instructions and moreso are true and correct to his knowledge. The said affidavit has to be attested, signed and to be filed along with the pleading. Therefore, this reflects the importance of strict compliance with the mandate of verification of pleadings. \n20. The learned Single Judge of this Court in Raj Kumar Gupta vs M/s Narang Constructions & Financiers Pvt. Ltd., 2023 IV AD (Delhi) 535 held that non-attesting of a an accompanying affidavit was a mere irregularity which was a curable defect and would not render the filing as non-est. \n21. In Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. vs Joint Venture of Sai Rama Engineering Enterprises (Sree) and Ors., MANU/DE/0049/2023, this Court while dealing with an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, held that filing of an affidavit in support of an application is a procedural requirement. The statement of truth by way of an affidavit is also a procedural matter and it would not render the aforesaid application as non-est but only defective. \n22. Further, the learned Division Bench of this Court in Prayag Polytech Pvt. Ltd and Another vs Raj Kumar Tulsian, 2023 SCC OnLine Del 6058 had categorically held that mere non-signing of each and every page of the pleadings is per se a defect, but the same could very well be cured. \nLikewise, any defect in verification of an affidavit in the nature of Statement of truth is also curable. \n23. Needless to say, after occurrence of such defects, whether the same can be condoned or allowed to be cured will depend on facts and circumstances of each case based on factor such as stage of proceedings in the suit as well as law of limitation. \n24. In the present case, the written statement was filed by the petitioner on 04.01.2022 through email and also on 06.01.2022 physically in Court. It is also true that period of limitation with respect to all kinds of limitations was extended by Hon'ble Supreme Court vide Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation (supra), from 15.03.2020 till 28.02.2022 by granting further time up to May, 2022 for the purposes of limitation. Therefore, the filing of the written statement was not challenged on the ground of limitation. \n25. It is not disputed that petitioner has taken considerable time in curing the defects. The learned Commercial Court while considering the application filed by the petitioner under Order V Rule 1 CPC and the application filed by the respondent under Order VI Rule 15A CPC came to the conclusion that petitioner was negligent in filing the application for curing the defects by a period of more than four months specifically when the petitioner had already became aware of the defects in the written statement. \n26. It is noticed that on 09.05.2022 the petitioner was proceeded ex-parte and the same was set aside on 26.11.2022, thereafter, time was granted to the petitioner to file reply to respondent's application under Order VI Rule 15A CPC and matter was directed to be listed on 24.01.2023. It is further noticed that on 24.01.2023, at the request of the petitioner matter was adjourned to 31.01.2023. On the said date, the petitioner took steps for curing the defects in the written statement. \n27. Indisputably, the written statement initially filed suffered from defects inasmuch as each and every single page of the same were not duly appended by the signatures and moreso, the written statement was not supported by the statement of truth. Therefore, the written statement indeed suffered from defects. However, It is now well settled that defects such as noted above, are not fatal defects and are very much curable. The said defects will also not render the written statement being non-est. From the aforesaid cited authorities, it is clear that the filing of statement of truth is a procedural matter and as well as no signatures appended on each and every page is also a curable defect. \n28. The rectified written statement filed after curing the aforesaid defects was filed by the petitioner on 24.01.2023 by moving an application under Order V Rule 1 CPC seeking condonation of delay in filing the written statement duly supported by statement of truth and as well as signatures appended on each and every page of the written statement. Moreso, it is also undisputed that the subsequent written statement has not been changed in any manner in substance other than the defects being cured, thus written statement filed on 24.01.2023 relates back to having being filed on 04.01.2022. The respondent had already filed its replication to the written statement dated 04.01.2022/06.01.2022.\n29. It is settled law, the rigors of procedure are handmaid of justice and it has to be ensured that substantive justice is done to both the parties. The technicalities should be applied in a manner that promotes fairness and upholds the rights of all the parties. \n30. Having considered the aforesaid and taking into account the peculiar facts of the present case, the impugned order dated 10.04.2023 is set aside and the written statement, as cured after removing of the defects by the petitioner on 24.01.2023, is allowed to be taken on record, subject to the petitioner paying the cost of Rs. 35,000/- to the respondent, due to the delay caused by the petitioner in not pursuing the case diligently. The aforesaid cost to be paid before the learned Commercial Court on the next date of hearing. \n31. Accordingly, the petition is allowed and the pending application stands disposed of. \nSHALINDER KAUR, J.\nAUGUST 01, 2024 SU",

        "cleaned_text": "telangana high court narayana educational institutions vs mrs. paruchuri janaki on 14 august, 2024 hon'ble justice moushumi bhattacharya and hon'ble justice m.g.priyadarsini civil revision petition no.2243 of 2024 order: (per hon'ble justice moushumi bhattacharya) the present civil revision petition (c.r.p) arises out of an order dated 29.06.2024 passed by the special judge for trial and disposal of commercial disputes, ranga reddy district at l.b. nagar (commercial court), in c.o.p.no.18 of 2024 filed by the petitioner under section 37(2)(b) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. 2. the petitioner's commercial original petition (c.o.p.no.18 of 2024) was directed against an order dated 15.05.2024 passed by the respondent no.2 telangana regional micro and small enterprises facilitation council (council) under section 18(3) of the micro, small and medium enterprises development act, 2006 (msmed act). the council had rejected the petitioner's interlocutory application under section 17(1) of the 1996 act. the petitioner filed c.o.p.no.18 of 2024 before the commercial court challenging the order of rejection of the council. the proceedings culminated in the order dated 29.06.2024, which is impugned in the present c.r.p. 3. the issue which falls for a decision is whether the commercial court could have entertained the c.o.p. under section 37(2) (b) of the 1996 act. 4. learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner had initially sought to withdraw the c.r.p. on the ground that the petitioner was wrongly-advised to file an appeal under section 37 of the 1996 act before the commercial court as the petitioner's application under section 17(1) of the 1996 act was not maintainable. learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent no.1 raised a strong objection on the prayer for withdrawal of the c.r.p. 5. the court hence proceeded to hear the parties on the merits of the case. 6. the facts relevant to the adjudication are as follows: 6.1. the petitioner is the 'buyer' as defined under section 2(d) of the msmed act and opposed a reference made by the respondent no.1 (seller) to the council in respect of the amount allegedly due to the respondent no.1. the reference under section 18(1) of the msmed act progressed to the stage of arbitration under section 18(3) of the act. the petitioner filed an interlocutory application before the council seeking reframing of the issues in the arbitration and for bringing further evidence on record. the petitioner made this interlocutory application under section 17(1) of the 1996 act. the council dismissed the interlocutory application on 15.05.2024 on the ground that the petitioner (respondent before the council) was given sufficient opportunity to make final submissions but failed to do so and the council hence proceeded with preparing the award. the council noted that the arbitration proceedings cannot be extended on the sole request of the petitioner. 6.2. the petitioner filed c.o.p.no.18 of 2024 before the commercial court under section 37(2) (b) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, for setting aside the order passed by the council dated 15.05.2024. the council was made a party in the c.o.p. as respondent no.2. 7. the only point taken by learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner (petitioner before the commercial court) is that the c.o.p. was not maintainable since the petitioner's application before the council could not be treated as an application under section 17(1) of the 1996 act. counsel submits that the commercial court lacked inherent jurisdiction for entertaining the c.o.p. filed under section 37(2) of the 1996 act. 8. learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent no.1 (claimant before the council) submits that the petitioner cannot be permitted to take the plea of inherent jurisdiction since the petitioner's only objective is to obliterate the findings and observations of the commercial court against the petitioner. counsel argues against the maintainability of the present c.r.p. 9. we have heard senior counsel appearing for the parties on all points. 10. we first wish to deal with the arguments pertaining to the maintainability of the present civil revision petition. 11. we are first of the view that the commercial court was not the forum non-judice in lacking competence to entertain the c.o.p/appeal under section 37 of the 1996 act. the commercial court at ranga reddy district is a court constituted under section 3 of the commercial courts act, 2015 and has been conferred jurisdiction under section 6 of the said act. there is no dispute that the commercial court is the competent court to hear the c.o.p in terms of specified value , territorial jurisdiction and the nature of the dispute i.e., commercial dispute. 12. we disagree with the contention that the commercial court lacked inherent jurisdiction to entertain the c.o.p. there is a difference between maintainability and entertainability of an application. the c.o.p. was maintainable before the commercial court regardless of whether the commercial court proceeded to pass the impugned order upon entertaining the application. we thus hold that the commercial court did not lack inherent jurisdiction to entertain the c.o.p/appeal. 13. civil revision petitions enumerate from the power conferred upon high courts under article 227 of the constitution of india in the matter of superintendence over the district courts and tribunals within its territorial jurisdiction. while the powers of a high court are plenary in the sense of calling for records, issue of rules and regulating the practice and proceedings of such courts, the power is not without limits. 14. a high court in exercise of the authority under article 227 of the constitution should be circumspect in exercising powers within the bounds of their authority. the exercise of jurisdiction must be within the well-recognized limits and the high court must not act as an appellate court and re-appreciate evidence. it is useful to remember that the high court under article 227 of the constitution is not vested with any unlimited prerogative to correct wrong decisions made by the subordinate courts. the interference must be restricted to cases of serious dereliction of duty and violation of the fundamental principles of law and justice. the high court must be certain that grave injustice would occur unless the high court involves the power under article 227 of the constitution: shri jai bhagwan jain v. municipal corporation of delhi 1. 15. we may add that the high court should be even more circumspect in interfering with the jurisdictional courts and tribunals where the pertinent facts point to irresponsible conduct on the part of the revision petitioner. the facts in the present case fall within such a template. 16. the relevant facts are briefly stated below: 16.1 the respondent no.1 supplier filed its claim before the council under section 18(1) of the msmed act. the petitioner filed a writ petition being w.p.no.27376 of 2021 before the high court taking the point of maintainability of the reference by reason of the same being barred by limitation. 16.2 a single bench of this court disposed of the writ petition by an order dated 06.03.2023 by directing the council to decide on the point of limitation. 16.3 the council decided in favour of the respondent no.1 by its order dated 19.08.2023 that the reference was within 2010 9 scc 385 the period of limitation. the petitioner has not challenged this order of the council till date. 16.4 the petitioner failed to file the statement of defence in the arbitration before the council but filed 2 applications seeking leave of the council for cross-examination of expert witness/chartered accountant. the petitioner sought for setting aside of the interim award passed by the council on 21.12.2023. the council rejected both the applications by its order dated 21.12.2023. 16.5 the petitioner filed 2 commercial original petitions (c.o.ps) c.o.p.nos.2 and 3 of 2024 for setting aside the order passed by the council on 21.12.2023. both these c.o.ps. were allowed by the commercial court, ranga reddy district at l.b. nagar, on 24.02.2024 permitting the petitioner to cross-examine the expert and directing the council to adjudicate on the claim as expeditiously as possible and conclude the proceedings within 4 weeks from 24.02.2024. 16.6 the petitioner filed another interlocutory application for reframing of the issues, bringing further evidence on record, marking of documents and submitting oral and written arguments before the council. this application was at the stage of final arguments in the arbitration. the council rejected the application on 15.05.2024 and the petitioner filed an appeal (c.o.p.) under section 37 of the 1996 act before the commercial court for setting aside the order dated 15.05.2024. 16.7 the commercial court rejected the petitioner's c.o.p. by the order dated 29.06.2024 which is impugned in the present civil revision petition. 17. several significant factors would be evident from the above sequence. i. the petitioner itself invoked the jurisdiction of the commercial court by filing the 2 c.o.ps. under section 34 of the 1996 act for setting aside the interim award passed by the council. the petitioner hence cannot complain of the commercial court lacking inherent jurisdiction to hear the commercial original petitions including c.o.p.no.18 of 2024 which forms the basis of the present civil revision petition. ii. the petitioner has filed at least 5 applications including a writ petition against the reference/claim of the respondent no.1. two of these applications were for nearly identical reliefs. the inescapable conclusion would be that the petitioner, as the 'buyer', faced with a claim and an arbitration from the respondent no.1 supplier, tried every statutory ploy to frustrate and delay the reference and the arbitration pending before the facilitation council. iii. the petitioner has not shown to the court or in the recordings of any of the proceedings that the petitioner has complied with section 19 of the msmed act which requires the applicant to deposit 75% of the amount before the matter is entertained by the court for setting aside of any award, decree or order made by the council. the petitioner had filed 2 c.o.ps under section 34 of the 1996 act for setting aside the interim award passed by the council on 21.12.2023. 18. the conduct of the petitioner by all means is manipulative and in abuse of the process of the court. the most striking feature of the conduct is that the petitioner, having repeatedly invoked the jurisdiction of the commercial court and having invited the court for a decision, has now turned around to question the jurisdiction of the court to pass orders, including the one impugned in the present civil revision petition. if this conduct is not reckless and self-serving, then nothing is. 19. thus, the principle that 'no man can take advantage of his own wrong' squarely fits in the facts of the present case. the petitioner certainly cannot manipulate the court process to perpetuate an illegality to the detriment of the respondent: mumtaz yarud dowla wakf v. badam balakrishna hotel pvt. ltd 2. in that case, the supreme court noticed a subsequent plea on the part of the party questioning the jurisdiction of the forum after receiving an adverse verdict. 20. the power of superintendence of a high court not only pertains to orders passed by courts and tribunals within its jurisdiction but must also covers the conduct of parties which result in orders which form part of the civil revision petition. the high court steps in where there has been grave dereliction of duty or flagrant abuse of the fundamental principles of law or justice. 2023 scc online sc 1378 21. the peculiar facts of the present case would actually call for appropriate superintendence over litigants, like the petitioner herein, who take the court process for granted and try their best to delay and frustrate pending proceedings. the power of superintendence must be informed with equitable considerations. equity should be exercised in favour of the respondent no.1 and against the appellant in the case before us. 22. the decision of the single bench of the high court of jammu and kashmir in ircon international limited v. union territory of jammu & kashmir 3, relied on by the petitioner, is with regard to the power of the arbitral tribunal under section 17 of the 1996 act, but loses relevance in the light of the c.r.p. not being maintainable. hindustan zinc limited (hzl) v. ajmer vidyut vitran nigam limited 4 involved a statutory arbitration under section 86(1)(f) of the electricity act, 2003, where the supreme court held that the commission did not have jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator under section 86(1)(f) of the electricity act 2020 scc online j&k 29 2019 17 scc 82 since the dispute did not relate to licences and generating companies. this case does not assist the petitioner. 23. whether the petitioner's interlocutory application under section 17 of the 1996 act was misconceived is a matter of statutory interpretation. the reliefs sought in the said application were, inter alia, for reframing of issues, providing reasonable opportunity to the petitioner (respondent before the council) and to bring additional evidence on record. section 17(1) of the 1996 act provides for interim measures in the form of orders passed by the arbitral tribunal under various heads from clauses (i) and (ii) (a-e) thereof for the overall preservation of the subject matter of the arbitration. section 37(2) (b) provides that an appeal shall also lie from an order of the arbitral tribunal granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under section 17 of the 1996 act. hence the order appealed from under section 37(2)(b) presupposes the order passed by the arbitral tribunal to be within the contours of section 17(1) of the 1996 act. 24. we have already concluded that the commercial court was statutorily-vested with the power to entertain the c.o.p. and that the c.o.p. was therefore maintainable before the said court. the decision of the commercial court is not without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction. it cannot also be said that the decision of the commercial court resulted in a grave miscarriage of justice. 25. the fundamental issue of the civil revision petition not standing up to the test of maintainability outweighs all other considerations. the impugned order of the commercial court upon entertaining the appeal filed by the petitioner may be open to interpretation under the 1996 act but certainly cannot be an argument which the petitioner can leverage to the continuing detriment of the respondent-claimant. 26. the impugned order contains findings which are justified in the facts of the case. the trial court has not committed any illegality, patent or otherwise, in rejecting the c.o.p. (appeal) filed by the petitioner against the council's order dated 15.05.2024. needless to say, there is also no instance of grave injustice warranting correction of the impugned order. we also do not find the order to be perverse or unreasonable so as to invoke the power under article 227 of the constitution for granting the relief claimed in the civil revision petition. in fact, we hold that the civil revision petition is not maintainable at all. 27. c.r.p.no.2243 of 2024, along with all connected applications, is dismissed. there shall be no order as to costs. _________________________________ moushumi bhattacharya, j ______________________________ m.g.priyadarsini, j date: 14.08.2024 note: l.r. copy to be marked va"
