73 of 2023  \n Appellant :- National Highways Authority Of India, Through Its  Project Director  \n Respondent :- Satyanam And 2 Others  \n Counsel for Appellant :- Madhukar Ojha  \n\n \nHon'ble Om Prakash Shukla, J.\n \n\n \n(APPLICATION FOR CONDONATION OF DELAY) INRODUCTION (1) The above-captioned appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 have been filed by the appellant, National Highway Authority of India, beyond time by 290 days, 232 days, 318 days, 183 days, 269 days, 231 days, 184 days, 246 days, 178 days, 115 days, 231 days, 238 days, 238 days, 210 days, 289 days, 209 days, 213 days, 241 days, 271 days, 239 days and 257 days, respectively.\n(2) Through the above-captioned appeals, the National Highway Authority of India (hereinafter referred to as 'NHAI'), which is a statutory body constituted under the provisions of the National Highways Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as 'Act, 1956'), has questioned the legality of the judgment and order passed by the learned Additional District & Sessions Judge, Barabanki on an application preferred by NHAI under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 against the award dated 20.05.2015 relating to compensation granted for the construction of National Highway No. 28 from Kilometre 9 to Kilometre 360.57 (Lucknow to U.P Bihar Border) to the various land-owners including respondent.\n(3) Since the above-captioned appeals arise out of the award dated 20.05.2015 relating to compensation granted for the construction of National Highway No. 28 from Kilometre 9 to Kilometre 360.57 (Lucknow, U.P. to Bihar Border) to the various land-owners, whose land were acquired by NHAI due to the aforesaid project, therefore, with the consent of the learned Counsel for the parties, all the appeals have been collectively heard together are being decided vide the present common order.\nFACTUAL MATRIX (4) The appellant- NHAI is a statutory body constituted under the provisions of \"the National Highways Act, 1956\" (hereinafter referred to as 'Act, 1956'). The provisions contained in the Act, 1956 deals with the acquisition and determination of compensation for the land being acquired for the purpose of widening and construction of road in public interest and in access to public transport. \n(5) For the purpose of construction of National Highway No. 28 from Kilometre 9 to Kilometre 360.57 (Lucknow, U.P. to Bihar Border), NHAI had issued a notification under Section 3A of the Act, 1956 on 26.05.2004, which was published in two daily newspapers, namely, Rashtriya Ekta Lahar and Dainik waris-E Awadh on 08.08.2004 and 07.08.2004, respectively. \n(6) Apparently, after disposing of the objection under Section 3C of the Act, 1956, a notification under section 3(D)(1) of the Act, 1956 was issued on 24.03.2005. Thereafter, objections were invited with regard to determination of the said compensation in two daily newspapers i.e., \"Dainik Hindustan\" and \"Dainik Jagran\" on 21.04.2005. \n(7) Vide award dated 07.12.2005, the Prescribed Authority proceeded to determine the compensation as per Section 3(g)(7) of the Act, 1956. Records reveal that the Prescribed Authority (Special Land Acquisition Officer, Barabanki) has called upon the sale deeds from the Office of the Sub-Registrar, Nawabganj, Barabanki of preceding three years from the date of notification issued under Section 3A of the Act, 1956. The Prescribed Authority, thereafter, has noted that prior to the date of notification i.e., three years, total numbers of sale deeds were 28 in numbers, which was certified by the Acquisition Amin. Spot inspection was also conducted and in terms of the spot inspection, sale deed nos. 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 16, 19, 21, 25, 26 and 27 were found to be far away from the acquired area, and as such, it was found to be not an example for determining the compensation. Further, sale value of the sale deed nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 22, 23 and 28 were very less and as such, it was also not treated as representative sale deeds for determination of the compensation. Sale Deed No. 20 was found to be more than market value and sale deed nos. 8 and 24 include the case, and as such it cannot be the representative of determination of the compensation. The Prescribed Authority, thus, has observed that the sale deed No. 14 was adjacent to the acquired land and it was executed on 02.09.2005 by one Lal Ji, son of Ramphal, Sri Rajesh Singh. The status of the land was similar to the acquired land, and as such, it cannot be selected as representative for the determination of the compensation as it represent the real market value of the land. The Prescribed Authority has further gone into the circle rate and has carefully absorbed the different types of land and its circle rates and, accordingly, after dealing with the entire issue with regard to determination of the compensation, has determined the compensation in reference to market value/ potential value of the land. The Prescribed Authority has also included the structures over the acquired land and the trees after obtaining valuation of the expert valuers and has included in the final determination of the award. \n(8) After the award dated 07.12.2005 was passed by the Prescribed Authority/competent authority in exercise of powers conferred under Section 3D of the Act, 1956, the entire amount as awarded by the competent authority was deposited with the said authority by NHAI under Section 3H of the Act, 1956. Further, all the owners including the respondents have accepted the award passed by the Prescribed Authority/competent authority and has received their compensation without any protest and has enjoyed the compensation for five years without putting any objection. \n(9) Against the award dated 07.12.2005, the respondent filed an arbitration application under Section 3(g)(5) of the Act, 1956 on 23.06.2010 i.e., after a lapse of about more than 5 years only on the ground that the land is of commercial use and as such compensation may be enhanced. NHAI filed an objection to the said arbitration application, taking specific ground that the arbitration application under Section 3(g)(5) of the Act, 1956 is highly belated and the determination of compensation by the Prescribed Authority/competent Authority was in accordance with law, treating its nature of land as existing on the date of notification under Section 3A of the Act, 1956 and as such, the Prescribed Authority/competent authority has not committed any irregularity.\n(10) However, the learned Arbitrator/the District Magistrate appointed by the Central Government, decided the objection filed on behalf of the NHAI against them and has passed the award dated 20.05.2015. \n(11) Against the aforesaid award dated 20.05.2015, the NHAI had filed an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 by stating that the arbitral award dated 20.05.2015 was contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law and is patently illegal. \n(12) Apparently, the learned Additional District Judge heard the contention of NHAI as well as the respondent and recorded that the learned Arbitrator, while passing the award dated 20.05.2015, has returned a finding of fact that the land in question was adjacent to the Highway and, therefore, payments should have been made at the rate fixed for commercial or industrial land and not as agricultural land. The learned Additional District Judge has also observed that the learned Arbitrator considering various factors like location of the acquired land being adjacent to the National Highway and that too, being within a radius of 100 meters of the Highway has reached to the conclusion that it should be valued at the rate fixed for non-agricultural land. Thus, the learned Additional District Judge did not find any fault in the finding of the learned Arbitrator as well his calculation of appropriate development cost at the rate of non-agricultural land at the rate of Rs. 700/- per square meter with 30 per cent deduction and the final rate having arrived to Rs. 490/- per square meter and further, over and above the rate so determined in accordance with the provisions under Section 3H (5) of the Act, 1956, interest rate of 9% having been granted from the date of acquisition to the date of award. The learned Additional District Judge also negated the argument of NHAI relating to limitation. Thus, the objection filed by NHAI under Section 34 came to be dismissed by the Additional District Judge, Barabanki, which has been sought to be challenged by NHAI under Section 37 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 in the above-captioned appeals. \nC. SUBMISSIONS (13) Heard Shri Ashok Kumar Pandey and Shri Madhukar Ojha, learned Counsel representing the appellants and Shri Vijay Kumar Tewari, learned Counsel representing the respondent on the application for condonation of delay in filing the above-captioned appeals. \n(14) Learned Counsel representing the appellant drawing attention to Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"Act, 1996\"), has submitted that a perusal of Section 37 of the Act, 1996 reveals that no limitation is provided under Section 37 of the Act, 1996, however, Section 34 of the Act, 1996 mandates that Indian Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to the arbitration as it applies to the proceedings in the Court. He submits that on receipt of the order passed by the learned Additional District & Sessions Judge, Barabanki under Section 34 of the Act, 1996, permission/guidance was sought by the Project Director of NHAI from the Regional Office, NHAI, Lucknow for filing the arbitration appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 on obtaining opinion from its counsel. The Regional Office of NHAI, Lucknow had accorded his concurrence/approval for filing of the appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 on 25.11.2022 and the same was communicated to the Project Director vide letter dated 10.01.2023 and immediately thereafter the above-captioned appeals have been filed. The submission of the learned Counsel is that there is no deliberate latches or delay on the part of the appellant in filing the appeals before this Court under Section 37 of Act, 1996. \n(15) Placing reliance upon the judgments of the Apex Court in N. Balakrishnan Vs. M. Krishnamurthy : (1998) 7 SCC 123, Esha Bhattacharjee Vs. Managing Committee of Raghunathpur Nafar Academy and others : JT 2013 (2) SC 450, State of Haryana Vs. Chandra Mani and others : (1996) 3 SCC 132, Collector, Land Acquisition, Anantnag and another Vs. Mst. Katiji and others : AIR 1987 SC 1353, learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted that when substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each other, then, the cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred, for the other side cannot claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay. In the instant case, it is an admitted position that pursuant to the award passed by the Prescribed Authority/competent authority, respondent had initially accepted the amount of compensation without any protest and had also enjoyed the fruits of compensation provided to the respondent for about five years, but after five years, the respondent had filed an application under Section 3 (g) (5) of the Act, 1956, which was decided in favour of the respondent by the learned Arbitrator vide award dated 20.05.2015 without considering the fact that, there was delay in filing the application under Section 3(g)(5) of the Act, 1956. The submission of the learned Counsel is that, on one hand, the respondent had agitated the belated claim after five years and on the other, the respondent in the instant appeals has raised the issue that the appeals are time-barred. Thus, the learned. Counsel prayed that since the delay in filing the appeals is not deliberate, hence the same is liable to be condoned. \n(16) Per contra, learned Counsel representing the respondent has vehemently opposed the aforesaid submissions of the learned Counsel for the appellant and has argued that unlike Section 34 Act, 1996, Section 37 of the Act, 1996, does not include Section 5 of the Limitation Act, as a consequence of which even if the 90 days period is over and if a condonation application is made under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, it should be considered on its own merits notwithstanding, the length of delay. \n(17) Learned Counsel for the respondent, while supporting the impugned judgment under appeals, has invited attention towards Annexure No.A and Annexure No.B to the affidavit filed in support of application for condonation of delay and argued that heading of the aforesaid Annexure Nos. A and B transpires that Office of Project Director, NHAI, who sought permission to file an appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 before this Court and the Office of Regional Officer (U.P.-East), NHAI, Lucknow, from whom the Project Director, NHAI had sought permission to file an appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996, are in the same building. It is an admitted position that the Regional Office of NHAI, Lucknow had accorded permission to file the appeals under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 on 15.11.2022, however, the same was communicated to the Project Director on 10.01.2023. But, even then, the appeals have been filed by the appellant with inordinate delay. Thus, the delay in filing the appeals are deliberate on the part of the appellant and since no reasonable explanation/sufficient cause has been made in the affidavit filed in support of the application for condonation of delay, therefore, the learned Counsel prays that all the appeals are liable to be dismissed on ground of latches in filing the appeals. \n(18) In support of his submission, learned Counsel for the respondent has placed reliance upon the judgment of the Apex Court in M/s N.V. International Vs. the State of Assam & others (Civil Appeal No. 9244 of 2019 arsing out of SLP (C) No. 23808 of 2019, decided on 06.12.2019) and has argued that in M/s N.V. International (supra), the Apex Court had placed reliance upon the decision dated 17.09.2018 passed in SLP (C) No. 23155 of 2013 : Union of India Vs. Varindera Const. Ltd., and having regard to the object of speedy resolution of all arbitral disputes, which was uppermost in the minds of the framers of the 1996 Act and which has been strengthened from time to time by amendments made thereto; the Apex Court dismissed the appeal on the ground that it has been filed beyond 120 days. The submission of the learned Counsel is that, in the instant case, all the appeals have been filed over and above 120 days, therefore, in view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in M/s N.V. International (supra), the appeals are also liable to be dismissed on the ground of latches. \nANALYSIS & FINDINGS (19) Having regard to the submissions advanced by the learned Counsels for the parties on the application for condonation of delay and going through the record available before this Court in the above-captioned appeals, it is required to be noted herein that in Nusli Neville Wadia v. Ivory Properties : (2020) 6 SCC 557, the issue before the Apex Court was whether the issue of limitation can be determined as a preliminary issue under Order XIV Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure or not. The three-judge Bench of the Apex Court observed that if the issue of limitation is based on an admitted fact, it can be decided as a preliminary issue under Order XIV Rule (2) (b) of the Code of Civil Procedure and if the facts surrounding the issue of limitation are disputed, it cannot be decided as a preliminary issue. This Court finds that the facts surrounding the issue of limitation is not disputed. \n(20) As an abundant precaution, both the parties were, as such, directed to address their arguments on the point of limitation and file their respective pleadings to that effect. As far as the respondents are concerned, they have filed civil miscellaneous application dated 12.09.2023 and have pointed out that the present appeals have been filed with inordinate delay (referred hereinabove in paragraph-1). The learned. Counsel for respondent has submitted that NHAI had been negligent in filing the appeals and the entire affidavit in support of application for condonation of delay does not show any reasonable or satisfactory or sufficient cause which prevented them from filing the appeals within limitation period. In any case, they have submitted that, in case, the explanation of NHAI is taken to be truth, there is still no explanation for six month delay, as allegedly, the permission was granted to them for filing the appeals on 25.11.2022 and the same was communicated to the Project Director of NHAI vide letter dated 10.01.2023 and the appeals came to be filed only sometimes in the month of July, 2023. According to the learned Counsel for respondent, interestingly, NHAI has tried to misguide this Court by quoting wrong Sections, Articles and Act of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 as well as the Limitation Act, which this Court proposes to deal independently. \n(21) Per contra, the learned Counsel for the appellant has also filed a civil miscellaneous application on 06.10.2023 modulated as a reply to the aforesaid application of the respondent. Essentially, the application in reply filed by NHAI is reiteration of the appeal, which they have filed and additionally they have also referred to the judgment of Apex Court in the case of BSNL & Another Vs M/s Nortel Networks India Pvt. Ltd. : (2021) 5 SCC 738 to agitate that the period of limitation for filing an application under Section 11 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 is three years. The learned Counsel for appellant also placed reliance upon the judgment of the Apex Court in State of West Bengal and others Vs Somdeb Bandyopadhyaya and others : AIR 2009 SC 1989 and Ashwani Kumar Dhingra Vs State of Punjab : , [AIR 1992 SC 974].\n( 22) There is no quarrel about the aforesaid proposition of law, however, as far as the issue being decided in the present matter is related to limitation for preferring an appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996, the said judgment does not help NHAI in this regard. \n(23) Similarly, so far as Somdeb Bandyopadhyaya (supra) is concerned, it supports the case of the respondent in as much as, it says that the present appeal should not be heard on merits without first deciding the application for condonation of delay. The mention of judgment passed by the Apex Court in Ashwani Kumar Dhingra (supra) is all on merits. \n(24) As far as the limitation for filing the present appeals are concerned, there had been no endeavour by NHAI to explain the cause of delay and only a cryptic application has been sought to be filed, which is neither satisfactory nor comes within the periphery of sufficient cause as has been propounded by the Apex Court in a catena of judgment. \n(25) At the end, the learned Counsel has made a futile attempt by submitting that although the permission has been granted to file an appeal as early as on 22.01.2023, however, the appeal could not be filed within six months on account of serious ailment of the counsel to whom the matter was nominated. Again, no document nor any specific averment has been made to explain such delay. The learned Counsel for NHAI has referred to various judgment on condonation of delay like Balakrsishnan Vs. M Krishnamurty (supra), Esha Bhattacharjee V/s managing Committee of Raghunathpur Nafar Academy (supra), Haryana Vs. Chandra Mani & Others (supra), Collector, Land Acquisition and Anantnag and another Vs. Mst. Katijli and Others (supra), however, none of the judgments can come to the rescue of the appellant. \n(26) At this juncture, it would be apt to mention that Section 37 of Act, 1996 provides for a general provision for appeal under the said Act. The said provision also mentions that an appeal lie against order passed under section 34 of the Act, 1996. The said Section inter-alia provides as follows :-\n\"(1) [Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, an appeal] shall lie from the following orders (and from no others) to the Court authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the order, namely:--\n[(a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8;\n(b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9;\n(c) Setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34.\n(2) Appeal shall also lie to a court from an order of the arbitral tribunal-- (a) accepting the plea referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of section 16; or (b) granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under section 17.\n( 3) No second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or take away any right to appeal to the Supreme Court.\" \n(27) Apparently, the Act does not provide any specific limitation for filing such appeals, however, Section 43 of the Act, 1996 provides that the Limitation Act, 1963 ('Limitation Act') shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in Court. \n(28) This Court may not go into the definition of Court as mentioned under the Act, 1996 lest, it wanders away from the core issue of limitation engaging attention in the present bunch of matters. Suffice to say, that Articles 116 and 117 of the Schedule of the Limitation Act provide for a limitation period of 90 days for filing an appeal from any other Court to a High Court and a period of 30 days for filing an intra-Court appeal, i.e., order passed by a Single Bench to the Division Bench, provided the law provides for such an Appeal before the Division Bench. Having quoted and mentioned Article 116 and 117 of the Schedule of the Limitation Act, applicable ordinarily for the aforesaid nature of appeals, it goes without saying, that in case of any delay in preferring any such appeals, Section 5 of the Limitation Act provides for extension of the prescribed limitation period, provided the applicant satisfies the Court that there was a 'sufficient cause' for such delay. \n(29) Further, the aforesaid view gets fortified by the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Consolidated Engineering Enterprises v. Irrigation Department : (2008) 7 SCC 169], wherein it was held that where the Limitation Act prescribes a period of limitation for appeals or applications to any Court, and the special Act does not prescribe any period of limitation, then the limitation prescribed in the Limitation Act will be applicable along with Sections 4 to 24 thereof, unless they are expressly excluded by the special Act. Thus, by necessary implication, the period for preferring an Appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 ought to be 90 days as per Article 116 of the Schedule of the Limitation Act. \n(30) However, with the advent of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 ('Commercial Courts Act'), the limitation period for preferring an Appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act also changed. Apparently, Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act provides that Commercial Courts shall decide all applications and appeals which arise out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, where the subject matter is a commercial dispute of the specified value. Thus, all arbitration matters are construed to be decided and adjudicated under the jurisdiction of the commercial court, provided the commercial dispute being agitated is more than the specified value. If we look into the definition of 'specified value' as could be found in Section 2(1)(i) of the commercial Act, the same says :-\n\"(i) 'Specified Value', in relation to a commercial dispute, shall mean the value of the subject-matter in respect of a suit as determined in accordance with section 12 [which shall not be less than three lakh rupees] or such higher value, as may be notified by the Central Government.\"\n(31) Thus, as per the aforesaid definition, specified value cannot be less than INR 3,00,000.00 and as such, it can be safely construed that all those Arbitration, which has a commercial dispute of more than INR 3,00,000.00 are to be adjudicated under the provisions of Commercial Court Act, 2015.\n(32) Further, with the promulgation of the Commercial Court Act, a new regime of limitation for filing of the Appeals came to fore. Section 13 of the said Act inter-alia states:\n\"Section 13: Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions.\n(1)  [Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court below the level of a District Judge may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order. \n(1A)  Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order:\nProvided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996).] (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\"\n(33) Having said so, it would be safely concluded that the proviso to Section 13(1A) specifically provides that an appeal under Section 37 of the Act would lie before the Commercial Court and such appeal must be filed within 60 days. \n(34) Thus, the limitation for preferring of an Appeal under section 37 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, in view of the Commercial Court Act, is 60 days only. However, there is a caveat, in as much as the Hon'ble Supreme Court when faced with a similar issue of limitation for filing of an appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 did not take into account both the provisions of Commercial Courts Act and the decision in Consolidated Engg in the case of Union of India v. Virendera Constructions Ltd (2020) 2 SCC 111, wherein the Apex Court judicially engrafted a limitation period of 120 days from the date of passing of the order and held that any further delay beyond 120 days cannot be allowed. The Hon'ble Supreme Court noted that since a Section 34 application has to be filed within a maximum period of 120 days including a grace period of 30 days, therefore, an appeal filed from the same should also be covered by the same drill, in the following words: \n\"Ordinarily, we would have applied the said judgment to this case as well. However, we find that the impugned Division Bench judgment dated 10.04.2013 has dismissed the appeal filed by the Union of India on the ground of delay. The delay was found to be 142 days in filing the appeal and 103 days in refiling the appeal. One of the important points made by the Division Bench is that, apart from the fact that there is no sufficient cause made out in the grounds of delay, since a Section 34 application has to be filed within a maximum period of 120 days including the grace period of 30 days, an appeal filed from the self-same proceeding under Section 37 should be covered by the same drill. Given the fact that an appellate proceeding is a continuation of the original proceeding, as has been held in Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul and Others vs. Keshwar Lal Chaudhuri and Others, AIR 1941 Federal Court 5, and repeatedly followed by our judgments, we feel that any delay beyond 120 days in the filing of an appeal under Section 37 from an application being either dismissed or allowed under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 should not be allowed as it will defeat the overall statutory purpose of arbitration proceedings being decided with utmost despatch.\" \nIn this view of the matter, since even the original appeal was filed with a delay period of 142 days, we are not inclined to entertain these Special Leave Petitions on the facts of this particular case.\" \n(35) The Hon'ble Apex Court did not condone the delay of 142 days in the filing of appeal under section 37 of the Act, 1996 in the aforesaid Virendra Construction Ltd. (supra). To the same effect was another judgment of the Apex court in M/s N. V. International v. the State of Assam and Ors. (supra), wherein the Apex Court reiterated the position as stated in Virendra Constructions Ltd. (supra) and refused to condone a delay of 189 days from the 90 days in filing an appeal under section 37 of the Act. The Supreme Court in the said judgment also placed emphasis upon the main object of the Act, i.e., speedy disposal of arbitral disputes and held that, any delay beyond 120 days cannot be condoned in the following terms:\n\"5) We may only add that what we have done in the aforesaid judgment is to add to the period of 90 days, which is provided by statute for filing of appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, a grace period of 30 days under Section 5 of the Limitation Act by following Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul and Others (supra), as also having regard to the object of speedy resolution of all arbitral disputes which was uppermost in the minds of the framers of the 1996 Act, and which has been strengthened from time to time by amendments made thereto. The present delay being beyond 120 days is not liable, therefore, to be condoned.\" \n(36) Notably, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in both the aforesaid Judgments held that an appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 cannot be filed after 120 days from the decision of the Court under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 and no condonation of delay is permissible beyond this 120 day period. However, neither Virendra Constructions Ltd. (supra) nor M/s N.V. International (Supra), referred to the provisions of Commercial Courts Act which deal with the limitation period for filing of appeals under Section 37 of the Act, 1996. It must also be noted that neither the Act, 1996 nor the Commercial Courts Act, provide for this cap of 120 days or limit the period up to which an application for condonation of delay can be allowed. \n(37) The correctness of the law laid down in Virendra Constructions Ltd. (supra) and M/s N.V. International (supra) has come under a cloud before a three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court in Government of Maharashtra V/s M/s Borse Brothers Engineers & Contractors Pvt. Ltd. : 2021 SCC OnLine SC 233, wherein the Apex Court noted the conflicting position. The Apex Court relied on Consolidated Engineering Ltd (supra) and held that, if the specified value of the subject matter is INR 3,00,000.00 or more, then an appeal under Section 37 of the Act must be filed within 60 days from the date of the order as per Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act. However, in those rare cases, where the specified value is for a sum less than INR 3,00,000.00 then the appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 would be governed by Articles 116 and 117 of the Schedule of the Limitation Act, as the case may be. \n(38) Regarding the applicability of the Limitation Act, the Apex Court overruled its decision in M/s N. V. International (supra) and held that Section 37 of the Act, 1996 when read with Section 43 of the Act, 1996 and Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, makes it clear that Section 5 of the Limitation Act will apply to the appeals filed under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 and in holding the said applicability, the Apex Court noted with affirmative that Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act does not contain any provision akin to section 34(3) of the Act, 1996 and merely provides for a limitation period of 60 days from the date of the judgment or order appealed against, without going into whether delay beyond this period can or cannot be condoned. However, the Apex Court also noted that condonation of delay, although allowed, cannot be seen in complete isolation of the main objective of the Act, i.e. speedy disposal of disputes. In the light of the same, the Apex Court observed that the expression 'sufficient cause' under Section 5 of the Limitation Act is not elastic enough to cover long delay and merely because sufficient cause has been made out, there is no right to have such delay condoned. The Apex Court further held that only short delay can be condoned by way of an exception and not by the way of rule, and that too, only when the party acted in a bona fide manner and not negligently. The Apex Court has inter alia held as follows:\n\"61. Given the aforesaid and the object of speedy disposal sought to be achieved both under the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act, for appeals filed under section 37 of the Arbitration Act that are governed by Articles 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act or section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, a delay beyond 90 days, 30 days or 60 days, respectively, is to be condoned by way of exception and not by way of rule. In a fit case in which a party has otherwise  acted bona fide and not in a negligent manner, a short delay beyond such period can, in the discretion of the court, be condoned, always bearing in mind that the other side of the picture is that the opposite party may have acquired both in equity and justice, what may now be lost by the first party's inaction, negligence or laches.\" \n(39) The Apex Court has not only provided the much-needed clarification on an important point of law but has also re-emphasized the main objective of speedy disposal of disputes under the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. In the said facts of a connected case arose from the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, the Apex Court also refused to condone the delay of 75 days beyond the period of 60 days provided by the Commercial Courts Act. Further, the Apex Court went a step ahead and also observed that be it a private party or a public sector company, the same yardstick will be applicable for condonation of delay, and no special treatment can be afforded merely because the government is involved.\n(40) Coming to the facts of the present case, this Court finds that there is delay (referred in paragraph-1 hereinabove) in filing the appeals beyond 60 days time period as provided under section 13(1A) of the Commercial Court Act, 2015. The condonation delay application and supporting affidavit filed by NHAI makes for an interesting reading and this Court finds its appropriate to quote the relevant part of the affidavit which inter-alia also would show as to whether any \"sufficient cause\" has been made out by the appellant to condone the long delay in filing the appeals or not. The affidavit for delay condonation inter-alia states :-\n\"3. That a perusal of the aforesaid provisions, provided under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 clearly shows that there no limitation is provided under section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, but section 34 of the Arbitration and conciliation Act, 1996, mandates that the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to the arbitration as it applies to the proceedings in the court.\n4. That it is stated that after receiving the order under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, a permission/guidance has been sought by the deponent from the regional Office, National Highway Authority of India, Lucknow for filing the Arbitration Appeal, under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, after obtaining opinion from its counsel. Trus copy of the letter dated 24/25.11.2022, is being filed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE NO.A to this Affidavit. \n5. That the Regional officer, National Highways Authority of India, Lucknow has accorded his concurrence/ approval for filing of the Appeal under section 34 of the Act, 1996, on 10.01.2023. True copy of the letter dated 10.01.2023, is being filed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE NO.3 tot his affidavit. \n6. That after obtaining due approval/sanction from the office of the Regional Officer, National highways Authority of India, Lucknow, the present Appeal is being preferred without any delay within the timed a prescribed under section 43 of the Act, 1996. \n7. That there is no deliberate latches or delay on the part of the deponent in filing the present Arbitration Appeal before this Hon'ble Court, under section 37 of the Act, 1996.\" \n(41) It is apparent from the aforesaid affidavit that as per the own showing of NHAI, the Regional Officer, National Highways Authority of India, Lucknow has accorded his concurrence/ approval for filing of the appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996, on 10.01.2023, however still the Appeal came to be filed only sometime in the month of July, 2023, i.e., after a gap of six months. There is no explanation much less, a sufficient cause for this gap of six months. During the course of hearing, a feeble attempt was made by the learned Counsel for the appellant that counsel for the appellant had been down with serious ailments during this six months period. Neither any record nor averment has been made as to what ailment and as to how the learned Counsel or the NHAI had been trying to diligently pursue the filing of the present appeal. In the facts of the present bunch of appeals, this Court is of the considered view that no \"sufficient cause\" or rather no cause has been made out by the appellant to condone the delay in filing of the appeals under Section 37 of Act, 1996. \n(42) In any case, as also held by the Hon'ble Apex Court that it must be remembered that merely because sufficient cause has been made out in the facts of a given case, there is no right in the appellant to have delay condoned. This was felicitously put in Ramlal Vs. Rewa Coalfields Ltd., (1962) 2 SCR 762 as follows :-\n\"It is, however, necessary to emphasise that even after sufficient cause has been shown a party is not entitled to the condonation of delay in question as a matter of right. The proof of a sufficient cause is a condition precedent for the exercise of the discretionary jurisdiction vested in the court by s. 5. If sufficient cause is not proved nothing further has to be done; the application for condoning delay has to be dismissed on that ground alone. If sufficient cause is shown then the Court has to enquire whether in its discretion it should condone the delay. This aspect of the matter naturally introduces the consideration of all relevant facts and it is at this stage that diligence of the party or its bona fides may fall for consideration; but the scope of the enquiry while exercising the discretionary power after sufficient cause is shown would naturally be limited only to such facts as the Court may regard as relevant. It cannot justify an enquiry as to why the party was sitting idle during all the time available to it. In this connection we may point out that considerations of bona fides or due diligence are always material and relevant when the Court is dealing with applications made under s. 14 of the Limitation Act. In dealing with such applications the Court is called upon to consider the effect of the combined provisions of ss. 5 and 14. Therefore, in our opinion, considerations which have been expressly made material and relevant by the provisions of s. 14 cannot to the same extent and in the same manner be invoked in dealing with applications which fall to be decided only under s. 5 without reference to s. 14.\" \n(43) The counsel for NHAI has vehemently argued that NHAI is engaged in construction of road to access the public transportation in the public interest and being a public body should be given a different treatment as there had been no deliberate attempt to delay the filing of the appeal and this Court should ignore the technical objections of delay in the interest of justice. The said argument of the learned Counsel appears to be attractive at the first blush, but as already held herein above, there has been no explanation of \"sufficient cause\" for condoning the delay and the Apex Court emphatically held in M/s Borse Brothers Engineers & Contractors (supra), that there are no special concession in the context of limitation to a Government body as far as the Commercial Court Act is concerned. The Apex Court, relevant to the context, observed and held as follows:\n\"57. Likewise, merely because the government is involved, a different yardstick for condonation of delay cannot be laid down. This was felicitously stated in Postmaster General v. Living Media India Ltd., (2012) 3 SCC 563 [\"Postmaster General\"], as follows:\n\"27. It is not in dispute that the person(s) concerned were well aware or conversant with the issues involved including the prescribed period of limitation for taking up the matter by way of filing a special leave petition in this Court. They cannot claim that they have a separate period of limitation when the Department was possessed with competent persons familiar with court proceedings. In the absence of plausible and acceptable explanation, we are posing a question why the delay is to be condoned mechanically merely because the Government or a wing of the Government is a party before us. \n28. Though we are conscious of the fact that in a matter of condonation of delay when there was no gross negligence or deliberate inaction or lack of bona fides, a liberal concession has to be adopted to advance substantial justice, we are of the view that in the facts and circumstances, the Department cannot take advantage of various earlier decisions. The claim on account of impersonal machinery and inherited bureaucratic methodology of making several notes cannot be accepted in view of the modern technologies being used and available. The law of limitation undoubtedly binds everybody, including the Government. \n29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, their agencies and instrumentalities that unless they have reasonable and acceptable explanation for the delay and there was bona fide effort, there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the file was kept pending for several months/years due to considerable degree of procedural red tape in the process. The government departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties with diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception and should not be used as an anticipated benefit for the government departments. The law shelters everyone under the same light and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few.\"\n58. The decision in Postmaster General (supra) has been followed in the following subsequent judgments of this Court:\ni)  State of Rajasthan v. Bal Kishan Mathur, (2014) 1 SCC 592 at paragraphs 8-8.2;\nii)  State of U.P. v. Amar Nath Yadav, (2014) 2 SCC 422 at paragraphs 2-3;\niii) State of T.N. v. N. Suresh Rajan, (2014) 11 SCC 709 at paragraphs 11-13; and iv)  State of M.P. v. Bherulal, (2020) 10 SCC 654 at paragraphs 3-4.\n59. In a recent judgment, namely, State of M.P. v. Chaitram Maywade, (2020) 10 SCC 667, this Court referred to Postmaster General (supra), and held as follows:\n\"1. The State of Madhya Pradesh continues to do the same thing again and again and the conduct seems to be incorrigible. The special leave petition has been filed after a delay of 588 days. We had an occasion to deal with such inordinately delayed filing of the appeal by the State of Madhya Pradesh in State of M.P. v. Bherulal [State of M.P. v. Bherulal, (2020) 10 SCC 654] in terms of our order dated 15-10-2020. \n2. We have penned down a detailed order in that case and we see no purpose in repeating the same reasoning again except to record what are stated to be the facts on which the delay is sought to be condoned. On 5-1-2019, it is stated that the Government Advocate was approached in respect of the judgment delivered on 13-11-2018 [Chaitram Maywade v. State of M.P., 2018 SCC OnLine HP 1632] and the Law Department permitted filing of the SLP against the impugned order on 26-5-2020. Thus, the Law Department took almost about 17 months' time to decide whether the SLP had to be filed or not. What greater certificate of incompetence would there be for the Legal Department! \n3. We consider it appropriate to direct the Chief Secretary of the State of Madhya Pradesh to look into the aspect of revamping the Legal Department as it appears that the Department is unable to file appeals within any reasonable period of time much less within limitation. These kinds of excuses, as already recorded in the aforesaid order, are no more admissible in view of the judgment in Postmaster General v. Living Media (India) Ltd. [Postmaster General v. Living Media (India) Ltd., (2012) 3 SCC 563 : (2012) 2 SCC (Civ) 327 : (2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 580 : (2012) 1 SCC (L&S) 649] \n4. We have also expressed our concern that these kinds of the cases are only \"certificate cases\" to obtain a certificate of dismissal from the Supreme Court to put a quietus to the issue. The object is to save the skin of officers who may be in default. We have also recorded the irony of the situation where no action is taken against the officers who sit on these files and do nothing. \n5. Looking to the period of delay and the casual manner in which the application has been worded, the wastage of judicial time involved, we impose costs on the petitioner State of Rs 35,000 to be deposited with the Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee. The amount be deposited within four weeks. The amount be recovered from the officer(s) responsible for the delay in filing and sitting on the files and certificate of recovery of the said amount be also filed in this Court within the said period of time. We have put to Deputy Advocate General to caution that for any successive matters of this kind the costs will keep on going up.\" \nCONCLUSION (44) In view of the authoritative Judgments of the Apex Court in M/s Borse Brothers Engineers & Contractors (supra), it must be held that an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 should be filed within 60 days from the date of the order as per Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. However, in those rare cases where the specified value is for a sum less than INR 3,00,000.00 then the appeal under Section 37 would be governed by Articles 116 and 117 of the Schedule of the Limitation Act, as the case may be. \n(45) Further, Section 5 of the Limitation Act will apply to the appeals filed under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 and in holding the said applicability, the Apex Court noted with affirmative that Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act does not contain any provision akin to section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 and merely provides for a limitation period of 60 days from the date of the judgment or order appealed against, without going into whether delay beyond this period can or cannot be condoned. \n(46) Further, the expression 'sufficient cause' under Section 5 of the Limitation Act is not elastic enough to cover long delays and merely because sufficient cause has been made out, there is no right to have such delay condoned. The Apex Court further held that only short delays, can be condoned only by way of an exception and not by the way of rule, and that too only when the party acted in a bona fide manner and not negligently.\n(47) Since, in the present bunch of appeals, the impugned order passed by the Additional District Judge, Barabanki under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 has been sought to be challenged by NHAI by filing a belated appeal under Section 37 of the Act, 1996 beyond the permissible 60 days without any \"sufficient cause\", the above-captioned appeals are held to be time barred.\n(48) For all the aforesaid reasons, application for condonation of delay in filing the above-captioned appeals are hereby rejected. Consequently, all the appeals are dismissed on the point of limitation. \n(49) In the facts of the present case, there shall be no order as to costs. \n(Om Prakash Shukla, J.)

(x) whether the claimant is entitled to get interest on the sum awarded, if any, and if so, @ 18% per annum till date of actual payment? 8. before the learned district commercial court, west tripura, the respondent filed an application being cm (arb) 06/2022 (in respect of arb. a. no. 05/2023) and another being cm (arb) 07/2022 (in respect of arb. a. 06/2023) under section 34 of the act for setting aside the arbitral award dated 25.07.2022 along with condonation application marked as cm (condonation)50/2022 and cm (condonation)51/2022 respectively seeking condonation of delay of 30 days in preferring the application. once again, it is reiterated that it has been admitted by the respondent that the award dated 25.07.2022 in respect of both the arbitration matters were received on the same date, i.e. 25.07.2022. 9. the appellant herein raised the question of limitation in preferring the section 34 application and also lack of territorial jurisdiction to entertain the said petition under section 34 of the act as the subject matter of the case was situated within longtharai valley, dhalai district, i.e. within the jurisdiction of learned commercial court, dhalai, ambassa. by the impugned orders dated 25.07.2023 passed in both the cases the learned court allowed the condonation of 30 days delay and also held that it had territorial jurisdiction to entertain the application under section 34 of the act in view of section 2(1)(e) of the act read with section 20 of cpc. the court also held that the provisions of section 12(1) of the limitation act will be applicable in condoning the delay of 30 days in preferring application under section 34 of the act in view of the decision in state of himachal pradesh vs. himachal techno engineers & anr. reported in (2010) 12 scc 210. 10. before this court, the appellant has raised the following grounds of appeal: (a) whether learned commercial court, agartala could have entertained the petition under section 34 of the act when the work in question was executed at longtharai valley, which falls in the territorial jurisdiction of the learned commercial court at dhalai district? (b) whether a commercial court can condone a delay beyond 30 days, after expiry of three months from the date of receipt of the arbitral award? (c) whether the explanation offered by the respondent for seeking condonation of delay is sufficient to condone the delay? (d) whether the learned commercial court is competent to hear and adjudicate a commercial appeal? 11. in support of the grounds, learned senior counsel for the appellant has submitted that from a plain reading of the substantive provisions of section 34(3) of the act, it would be clear that it provides for twin limitations for presentation of a petition for setting aside an arbitral award, namely, (i) three months from the date on which the party making that petition had received the arbitral award; or (ii) if a request under section 33 of the act is made, three months from the date on which that request is disposed of by the arbitral tribunal. 12. according to the appellant, the period of limitation is to be counted from the date the party had received the arbitral award, i.e. 25.07.2022. section 5 of the act mandates that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by part-i, no judicial authority shall intervene, except where so provided in the said part-i of the act. since section 34 falls within part-i, it is subject to section 5 of the act. therefore, the judicial authority which empowers a commercial court under section 34 of the act or a commercial appellate court under section 37 of the act could not intervene in matters governed by part-i unless the same is expressly authorized to intervene. it is further submitted that an issue of limitation ousts the jurisdiction of a court. therefore, the court would not have jurisdiction, if a subject matter is otherwise barred by limitation. in view of the express provision contained in section 5 of the act, the aid of section 12(1) of the limitation act, 1963 cannot be taken. even otherwise, section 29(2) of the limitation act, 1963 expressly provides where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application, a period of limitation, different from the period prescribed by the schedule of the said act, the provisions of section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period prescribed by the schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions of section 4 to 24 of the limitation act shall apply insofar as, and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. 13. it is further submitted that a contrast of section 12(1) of the limitation act, 1963 and the substantive part of section 34(3) of the act would show that the date of commencement of limitation, prescribed in the two different statutes are at variance and in fact, they run in tangents. therefore, the special limitation, provided in section 34(3) of the act would override the general prescriptions contained in the limitation act, 1963 both under the principles of (i) special law always supersedes a general law (generalia specialibus non derogant); and (ii) section 29(2) of the limitation act, 1963 mandates that when a special prescription is made in a special law, the provisions of sections 4 to 24 of the limitation act would yield to the prescriptions contained in the said special act; and (iii)section 43(1) of the act mandates that the limitation act, 1963 shall apply to the arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in court. learned counsel for the appellant has, therefore, submitted that the period for limitation for presentation of a petition under section 34 of the act commences from the date of receipt of the arbitral award by a party and not from the day following the receipt of the award. he has placed reliance on the following decisions in support of his submission: (i) union of india vs. tecco trichy enginers & contractors, (2005) 4 scc 239 (para 4, 6, 8 & 9) (ii) state of maharashtra & ors. vs. ark builders pvt. ltd., (2011) 4 scc 616 (para 1 & 14) (iii) anil kumar jinabhai patel vs. pravin chandra jinabhai patel & ors., (2018) 15 scc 178 (para 13.2 & 18) (iv) p radha bai & ors. vs. p ashok kmar & anr. (2019) 13 scc 445 (para 32.1, 32.2 & 32.3) (v) dakshin haryana bijli vitran nigam ltd., vs navigant technologies private limited., (2021) 7 scc 657 (para 2, 10, 11, 18, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34 & 35) 14. learned senior counsel for the appellant submits that applying the principles laid down in the aforesaid decisions and the language of section 34(3) of the act the period of limitation for filing objection to the award would commence from the day the copy of the award was received, i.e. 25th july, 2022. according to the appellant, the expressions ̳three months' and ̳thirty days' used in substantive part of section 34(3) and its proviso in cumulative effect would be interpreted to mean a total period of 90 + 30 days, total 120 days to be reckoned from the date of receipt of a signed award from the arbitral tribunal. he has further placed reliance upon bhimashankar sahakari sakkare karkhane niyamita vs. walchandnagar industries limited (wil), reported in (2023) 8 scc 453 (para 3, 45, 52 & 58). as per the calculation of the appellant, the period of 120 days reckoned from the date of receipt of the award expire on 21st november, 2022. therefore, the application under section 34 of the act filed on 24.11.2022 was barred by delay of three days which is not condonable, in view of the specific decision rendered by the apex court in union of india vs. tecco trichy engineers & contractors, reported in (2005) 4 scc 239 and the expression ―but not thereafter‖ contained in the proviso to section 34(3) of the act. therefore, the learned commercial court fell into patent error of law in computing the period of limitation in both the section 34 petitions and condoning the delay. 15. in respect of issue no. (ii), learned senior counsel for the appellant has submitted that admittedly the works were executed at longtharai valley, which fall under the subject matter jurisdiction of the learned commercial court, dhalai district, ambassa, and therefore, applying the statutory prescriptions contained in section 2(1)(e) of the act read with section 5 and section 42 thereof, it is beyond any dispute that only the learned commercial court, dhalai district would have jurisdiction to decide and adjudicate a petition under section 34 of the act. 16. in respect of issue no. (iii), learned senior counsel for the appellant has referred to the provisions of section 2(1)(e) of the act and submitted that learned commercial court, holding the substantive post of additional district judge (as contradistinguished from district judge) is incompetent to hear and adjudicate the commercial appeal. it suffers from the vice of coram non judice and inherent lack of jurisdiction. 17. in respect of issue no.(iv), learned senior counsel for the appellant has submitted that from a reading of the condonation application it would transpire that the respondent has offered stereotype explanation referring to red tape which cannot be accepted under the proviso to section 34(3) of the act. based on these submissions it is prayed that the impugned orders may be set aside and wholly unsustainable in law. 18. the counting of 90+30, total 120 days from the date of receipt of the award, i.e. 25th july, 2022 has been placed in a tabular chart which is also extracted hereunder: ―i. july, 2022 from 25.07.2022 to 31.07.2022 (both days + 7 days inclusive) ii. august, 2022 + 31 days iii. september, 2022 + 30 days iv. october, 2022 + 31 days v. 21.11.2022 + 21 days total = 120 days thus, 120 days had expired on 21.11.2022.‖ 19. on behalf of the respondent, it has been submitted that the appellant entered appearance before the learned commercial court, west tripura on receipt of the summons but chose not to file any written objection against the condonation petition filed by the respondent herein in each of the cases. however, at the time of hearing the counsel for the appellant verbally raised two fold legal objection: (i) learned commercial court, west tripura has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the section 34 application as the subject matter of the case is situated within longtharai valley sub-division, dhalai tripura within the jurisdiction of learned commercial court, dhalai ambassa; and (ii) the delay is beyond 30 days after the expiry of three months from the date of receipt of the award which expired on 23.11.2022. this fact is admitted as stated in the memo of appeal. 20. however, the learned court allowed the condonation application holding that in view of section 2(1)(e) of the act read with section 20 of the cpc, the court had the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the application under section 34. it further held that there is only a delay of 30 days under section 34(3) and in view of section 12(1) of the limitation act and the decision rendered in the case of himachal techno engineer (supra) the reasons for delay were successfully explained in the condonation application., it is, however, submitted that in the memo of appeal the appellant has set out four questions of law for consideration by this court which are available at para 2.1 (i) to (iv) at page 21 of the paper book. 21. learned counsel for the respondent has in answer to those issues made the following submissions. in reply to issue no. (i) it has been submitted by the respondent that in view of section 20 of the cpc, since the appellant-sole defendant resides at agartala within the jurisdiction of the district commercial court, west tripura the cause of action in part arose at agartala as the impugned award was also passed at agartala. therefore, the learned court rightly held that it had territorial jurisdiction over the case to decide the petition under section 34 of the act and the connected condonation petition. 22. it is further submitted that though the appellant has challenged the jurisdiction of the district commercial court, west tripura, agartala but he has himself filed an execution application against the above awards on 23rd march, 2023 being execution (m)19/2023 and execution(m)20/2023 arising out of the same awards which are under challenge and subject matter of application under section 34 of the act. so the appellant cannot be allowed to take dual stand before two different forums of law for two different subject matters. even if for sake of argument it is presumed that the court below had no territorial jurisdiction to deal with the subject matter of the case then the remedy lies under order vii rule 10 & 10a of cpc to return the plaint/application to present it before the appropriate court by fixing a date for presentation and appearance of parties and hearing from the same stage but not dismissal of the application. he has referred to the decision of the apex court in oriental insurance company ltd. vs. tejparas associates and exports pvt. ltd., reported in (2019) 9 scc 435, paragraphs 3, 8, 11 and 14. 23. in response to the 2nd issue i.e. whether a commercial court can condone a delay beyond 30 days after expiry of three months from the date of receipt of the arbitral award the learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that it is the settled law that no application under section 34(3) of the act beyond the period of ―three months‖ plus 30 days from the date of receipt of award is maintainable and the same is barred by law of limitation and no court can condone the delay ―thereafter‖. it is the case of the respondent that in preferring the application under section 34 of the act there was a delay of 30 days and the same has been explained. to decide the actual period of limitation as prescribed under section 34(3) of the act, i.e. ―may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award‖ and if the appellant is prevented by sufficient reason within three months period it may entertain the application ―within further period of thirty days but not thereafter‖ there is need to understand the meaning of the period of ̳three months' and ̳from' and to know the true intention of the legislature for using the term ̳three months' and not ̳90 days' wherein the proviso mentions 30 days but not ̳one month'. the terms ̳month' has been defined under section 3(35) of the general causes act, 1897. ̳month' means a month reckoned according to the british calendar. section 4 of the said act further provides that this definition will be applicable to all central acts made after the 3 rd january, 1868 and all regulations made on or after the fourteenth day of january, 1887. so, it is applicable to find out the actual period of ̳three months' as per said act. 24. the learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that as per british calendar month a month may be of 28/29/30 or 31 days. so the period of three months will vary as per actual calendar month which may be 89/90/91 or 92 days. as per section 9(1), (2) of the general clauses act, 1897 the term ̳from' be used by excluding the first in a series of days or any other period of time, and for the purpose of the use of the word ̳to' to include the last day in a series. similar provisions [section 12(1) and (2)] contained in the limitation act, 1963 provide for calculation of limitation, whereby the first day from which the period is reckoned shall be excluded. therefore, the respondent has submitted that in calculating the period of limitation the date of receipt of award will be excluded as per section 12(1) of the limitation act, 1963 read with section 9(1) and (2) of the general clauses act, 1897. 25. it is further submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent that on a plain reading of sections 43(1) & (3) of the arbitration and conciliation act read with section 29(2) of the limitation act, 1963 it becomes clear that the provisions of limitation act applies to arbitration matters and thereby sections 4 to 24 of the limitation act will be applicable in proceeding under section 34 of the act as operation of these provisions are not specifically excluded by the arbitration & conciliation act except section 5. therefore, the submission of the appellant regarding nonapplicability of section 12(1) of the limitation act in counting the period of limitation, and expiry of period of ̳three months plus 30 days' on 23.11.2022 and thereby the application filed on 24.11.2022 being barred by law is nothing but a misconceived one. the period of ―three months‖ as prescribed under section 34(3) of the act does not mean 90 days. in support of his above contentions, the learned counsel for the respondent has referred to the following decisions of the apex court: (i) consolidated engineering enterprises vs. principal secretary, irrigation department & ors., (2008) 7 scc 169, para 10,11,13,14 & 15 (ii) state of himachal pradesh & anr., vs. himachal techno engineers & anr., (2010) 12 scc 210 , para 3, 5, 8, 9, 10,11 & 12 (iii) simplex infrastructure limited vs. union of india (2019) 2 scc 505 : air 2019 sc 505, para 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 & 12 26. in response to issue nos. (iii) & (iv), learned counsel for the respondent submits that these issues have been raised for the first time before this court. as such, these should not be entertained. it is further submitted that the constitution of commercial court for the west tripura district, i.e. the court of the additional district judge, court no.2, agartala as commercial court, west tripura was done as per section 3(1) & (3) of the commercial courts act, 2015 by the state government after consultation with the high court by notification in the official gazette and till date there is no challenge to the appointment or designation of the said post. as such, the same cannot be raised before this court at the appellate stage. if the submission of the appellant is accepted it would create a judicial chaos as regards the fate of all the orders passed by that court since its designation. 27. we have considered the submission of the parties at length. we have also gone through the relevant provisions of the arbitration & conciliation act, 1996 as amended, the commercial courts act, 2015, the limitation act, 1963 and the general clauses act, 1897. the basic issue which seeks an answer in the present appeal is whether the application under section 34 of the act was barred by delay or not. in order to appreciate this issue, it is relevant to refer to the provisions of section 34(3) of the act. ―(3) an application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal: provided that if the court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.‖ 28. section 34(3) provides that an application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making the application had received the arbitral award. rest of the provision following thereafter under section 34(3) does not have relevance in determination of the issue at hand. 29. according to the appellant, this expression does not permit any other interpretation relying upon section 12(1) of the limitation act, 1963 or section 9 of the general clauses act, 1897 in view of the specific language used in section 5 of the act and section 29(2) of the limitation act. 30. on the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent has placed reliance on the provision of section 12(1) of the limitation act and section 9(1) and (2) of the general clauses act. both the parties have placed reliance upon certain decisions in support of their submissions. in order to answer this issue, we proceed to deal with the cases cited on behalf of the parties hereinafter. 31. in the case of union of india vs. tecco trichy engineers & contractors, reported in (2005) 4 scc 239 the question which arose for decision in appeal was: which is the effective date on which the appellant was delivered with and received the arbitral award as that would be date wherefrom the limitation within the meaning under section 34(3) of the act would be calculated. the apex court held that under section 34(3) of the arbitration and conciliation act, the limitation of three months commences from the date on which the party making the application had received the arbitral award. in the facts of the said case it was held that the service of arbitral award on the general manager by way of receipt in his inwards office could not be taken to be sufficient notice so as to activate the department to take appropriate steps in respect of and in regard to the award passed by the arbitrators to constitute the starting point of limitation for the purposes of section 34(3) of the act. it was further held that delivery of an arbitral award under section 31(5) is not a matter of mere formality rather a matter of substance. the stage of termination of the arbitral proceedings under section 32 arises only after the stage under section 31 has passed. the delivery of arbitral award to the party, to be effective, has to be received the party. the opinion of the apex court at para 8 of the report is extracted hereunder: \"8. the delivery of an arbitral award under sub-section (5) of section 31 is not a matter of mere formality. it is a matter of substance. it is only after the stage under section 31 has passed that the stage of termination of arbitral proceedings within the meaning of section 32 of the act arises. the delivery of arbitral award to the party, to be effective, has to be ―received‖ by the party. this delivery by the arbitral tribunal and receipt by the party of the award sets in motion several periods of limitation such as an application for correction and interpretation of an award within 30 days under section 33(1), an application for making an additional award under section 33(4) and an application for setting aside an award under section 34(3) and so on. as this delivery of the copy of award has the effect of conferring certain rights on the party as also bringing to an end the right to exercise those rights on expiry of the prescribed period of limitation which would be calculated from that date, the delivery of the copy of award by the tribunal and the receipt thereof by each party constitutes an important stage in the arbitral proceedings.‖ 32. in the case of state of maharashtra vs. ark builers (p) ltd., reported in (2011) 4 scc 616, the question which arose for consideration in the appeal was whether the period of limitation for making an application under section 34 of the act for setting aside an arbitral award is to be reckoned from the date a copy of the award is received by the objector by any means and from any source, or it would start running from the date a signed copy of the award is delivered to him by the arbitrator. the apex court laid emphasis on para 8 of the decision of tecco trichy engineers & contractors (supra) and held that the period of limitation prescribed under section 34(3) of the act would start running only from the date a signed copy of the award is delivered to or received by the party making the application for setting it aside under section 34(1) of the act. if the law prescribes that a copy of the order/award is to be communicated, delivered, dispatched, forwarded, rendered or sent to the parties concerned in a particular way and in case the law also sets a period of limitation for challenging the order/award in question by the aggrieved party, then the period of limitation can only commence from the date on which the order/award was received by the party concerned in the manner prescribed by law. at para 15 of the judgment the apex court held: \"15. the highlighted portion of the judgment extracted above, leaves no room for doubt that the period of limitation prescribed under section 34(3) of the act would start running only from the date a signed copy of the award is delivered to/received by the party making the application for setting it aside under section 34(1) of the act. the legal position on the issue may be stated thus. if the law prescribes that a copy of the order/award is to be communicated, delivered, dispatched, forwarded, rendered or sent to the parties concerned in a particular way and in case the law also sets a period of limitation for challenging the order/award in question by the aggrieved party, then the period of limitation can only commence from the date on which the order/award was received by the party concerned in the manner prescribed by the law.‖ 33. in the case of anil kumar jinabhai patel vs. pravin chandra jinabhai patel & ors., reported in (2018) 15 scc 178 some of the parties were not individually served with copy of the award. in those circumstances it was observed that receipt of the signed copy of award by all the parties is not necessary when such parties were represented by the head/common power-ofattorney holder who received the award on their behalf, he being the person directly connected with and in control of the proceedings. by cumulative reading of section 34(3) and section 31(5) of the act, it was clear that the limitation period prescribed under section 34(3) of the act would commence only from the date of signed copy of the award delivered to the party making the application for setting it aside. 34. in the case of oriental insurance company limited, vs. tejparas associates & exports (p) ltd., reported in (2019) 9 scc 435 the proceedings under section 34 of the act were dismissed on grounds of limitation which also led to the dismissal of the appeal under section 37 of the act. the primary consideration in the said appeal was whether the dismissal of the section 34 petition on limitation grounds was justified. in that case, the petition under section 34 was initially filed within the prescribed time frame but was returned and re-presented after a delay, leading to a contention regarding the condonation of delay. the apex court referred to subsequent amendments to the cpc which provided clarity on the procedure for representation, indicating that it may not always be treated as a fresh filing. the appellant's petition under section 34 of the act was initially filed within the limitation period but was returned by the court at jaipur under order 7 rule 10 cpc for re-representation before the competent court fixing a date for appearance. the appellant failed to re-present the petition on the specified date, resulting in an 8-day delay when it was re-presented eventually at the district court in jodhpur. the respondent filed an application under section 3 of the limitation act, prompting the appellant to file an application under section 14 of the limitation act seeking condonation of delay. the delay in this case pertained to the re-presentation of the petition, not the initial filing, and thus, the application for exclusion of time was available under section 14 of the limitation act. therefore, the apex court held that denying consideration of the proceedings under section 34 of the act on its merits based solely on the delay in re-presentation would not be justified in that context. 35. in p radha bai & ors. vs. p ashok kumar & anr., reported in (2019) 13 scc 445, the apex court explained the scheme of limitation for challenging the arbitral award under section 34(3) and held that provisions of limitation act are excluded. the scheme of section 29(2) of the limitation act was explained. it was held that the period of limitation under section 34(3) of the act commences from the date of receipt of the award. the apex court also considered the decision in himachal techno engineers (supra), assam urban water supply and sewerage board vs. subash projects and marketing limited, reported in (2012) 2 scc 624, consolidated engineering enterprises vs. principal secretary, irrigation department & ors., reported in (2008)7 scc 169 (cited by the respondent herein) and union of india vs. popular construction co., reported in (2001) 8 scc 470 and at para 44 held as under: ―44. in view of the above, we hold that once the party has received the award, the limitation period under section 34(3) of the arbitration act commences. section 17 of the limitation act would not come to the rescue of such objecting party.‖ 36. in the case of dakshin haryana bijli vitran nigam ltd. v. navigant technologies (p) ltd., reported in (2021) 7 scc 657 the issue was whether the period of limitation for filing the petition under section 34 of the act would commence from the date on which the draft award was circulated to the parties, or the date on which the signed copy of the award was provided. it was held that the period of limitation for challenging the award under section 34 would commence from the date on which the party making the application had received a signed copy of the arbitral award, as required by section 31(5) of the act, i.e. only after a valid delivery of the award (including dissenting opinion, if any). the decision in himachal techno engineers (supra) was also considered by the apex court. para 46 of the judgment is extracted as under: ―46. we are of the considered opinion that the period of limitation for filing objections would have to be reckoned from the date on which the signed copy of the award was made available to the parties i.e. on 19-5-2018 in the instant case.‖ 37. in the case of bhimashankar sahakari sakkare karkhane niyamita v. walchandnagar industries ltd., reported in (2023) 8 scc 453 the central issue in the case was whether on the last day of condonation period of 30 days under section 34(3) of arbitration and conciliation act falls on a holiday or during the court vacation, would the benefit of section 10 of the general clauses act, 1897 be available? the apex court upheld the decision of the high court and the ld. additional district and session judge. it held that the benefit of exclusion of period during which court is closed is available only when application setting aside award is filed within prescribed period of limitation i.e., the period of 3 months prescribed in the main part of section 34(3) of the act. the same is not applicable in respect of period which may be extended by court in exercise of its discretion under proviso to section 34(3) of the act. the apex court, therefore, held that section 4 of limitation act and section 10 of general clauses act would not be applicable. 38. learned counsel for the respondent has also relied on simplex infrastructure limited vs union of india, reported in (2019) 2 scc 445. the issue concerning this case relates to condonation of delay amounting to 514 days for filing application under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act where the learned single judge of the high court allowed the application. one of the pleas raised by the respondent relates to the fact that application was presented before the wrong forum. analyzing the issue, the hon'ble apex court, highlighted two underlying points: (i) whether benefit under section 5 and section 14 of the limitation act can be extended to the respondents? (ii) whether delay beyond the specific statutory limitation prescribed under section 34(3) of the 1996 act could be condoned? answering the same, the apex court relied on the decision of union of india v. popular construction company, (2001) 8 scc 470, which held that section 5 of the limitation act has no application to an application challenging an arbitral award under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act. the issue of applicability of section 14 of limitation act was also addressed by the apex court and reliance was placed on the decision of consolidated engg enterprises v. irrigation dept, (2008) 7 scc 169. it held that indeed section 14 of the 1963 act is applicable to section 34 of the 1996 act for setting aside the arbitral award but it does not provide for a fresh period of limitation instead exclusion of certain period of limitation. however, the apex court set aside the order of the ld. single judge on the ground that analyzing facts no justification for administration difficulties as reason for delay can be condoned. this decision does not support the case of the respondent that the period of limitation under section 34(3) of the act commences from the date following the date of receipt of the award. 39. the principle which falls from a reading of the aforesaid decisions is that the period of limitation commences from the date of receipt of the award under section 34(3) of the act and not from the date following the date of receipt of the award as is the principle enshrined under section 9(1) and (2) of the general clauses act, 1897 and also section 12(1) of the limitation act, 1963. the reason being that in terms of section 29(2) of the limitation act, 1963, the provisions of section 34(3) providing a limitation period of three months and the outer limit of 30 days therefrom are a special law in themselves. therefore, the provisions of the limitation act or the general clauses act would not apply. in fact, proviso to section 10 of the general clauses act, 1897 which relates to computation of time, provides that nothing in this section would apply to any act or proceeding to which the indian limitation act, 1877 applies. section 12(1) of the limitation act, 1963 provides that in computing the period of limitation for any suit, appeal or application, the day from which such period is to be reckoned, shall be excluded. however, in view of the express language used in section 34(3) of the act that ―an application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award .‖ and the decisions rendered by the apex court, there is no scope for any other interpretation. 40. learned counsel for the respondent has heavily relied upon the case of himachal techno engineers & anr. (supra) to support the argument that section 9 of the general clauses act and application of provisions of section 12 of the limitation act, particularly sub-section (1) thereof is not excluded in reckoning the period of limitation under section 34(3) of the act of 1996. this judgment is also on the proposition that the period of three months provided under the substantive part of section 34(3) would not mean a period of thirty days but the actual period of a calendar month. the proviso uses the word 30 days while referring to the outside limit of condoning the delay. the legislature had the choice of describing the periods of time in the same units, that is to describe the periods as ̳three months' and ̳one month' respectively or by describing the periods as ̳ninety days' and ̳thirty days' respectively. it did not do so. therefore, the legislature did not intend that the period of three months used in sub-section (3) to be equated to 90 days, nor intended that the period of thirty days to be taken as one month. 41. in the said case, the award was delivered in the office of the party on a non-working day, the date of such physical delivery is not treated as the date of receipt. it was held that the delivery of the award to the beldar or watchman present on a non-working day would not amount to delivery to a party. the date of receipt necessarily had to be the next working day. the award delivered to a beldar on a holiday could not be construed to be a valid receipt by the appellant. however, it is worthwhile to mention here that in the subsequent decision rendered by the apex court in the case of p radha bai & ors. vs. p ashok kumar & anr., reported in (2019) 13 scc 445 and in the case of dakshin haryana bijli vitran nigam limited vs. navigant technologies private limited reported in (2021) 7 scc 657 the decision in the case of himachal techno engineers & anr. (supra) have been specifically taken note of and, thereafter, the apex court has held that the date of commencement of limitation would be reckoned from the date of receipt of the award in view of the specific language used in section 34(3) of the act. as such, this court is bound to follow the subsequent decisions of the apex court on this issue which has been rendered after taking due notice of the decision in the case of himachal techno engineers & anr. (supra). 42. treating the date of receipt of the award as the effective date for calculation of the period of limitation, the three months and thirty days have been counted as reflected in the tabular chart below: no. of days in relevant months monthwise calculation 1st month julyaugust 25.07.2022 to 24.08.2022 2nd month augustseptember 25.08.2022 to 24.09.2022 3rd month septemberoctober 25.09.2022 to 24.10.2022 total3 months octobernovember (7 days) 25.10.2022 to 31.10.2022 november23 days 01.11.2022 to 23.11.2022 extended 30 days 43. the legislature has categorically used the expression ̳three months' in the substantive part of section 34(3) of the act whereas the proviso thereto has used the expression ̳thirty days' for the purposes of condoning the delay in making such an application under section 34(3) beyond the period of three months. the legislature has consciously used two expressions in the same provision instead of using ̳three months' and ̳one month' respectively or ̳90 days' and ̳30 days' respectively. therefore, the expression ̳months' has to be understood as ̳calendar months'. the manner in which computation of ̳calendar months' has to be done is dealt with in the case of rameshchandra ambalal joshi vs. state of gujarat & anr. reported in (2014) 11 scc 759 by the apex court. the case relates to filing of a complaint under section 138 of the negotiable instruments act, 1881. however, for the purposes of calculation of the three months period, the apex court has laid down the following principle in line with the meaning of the expression ―calendar month‖ used in the general clauses act, 1897 and referred to the halsbury's laws of england which provide for calculation of a calendar month as under: ― 21. at this stage, we would also like to refer to halsbury's laws of england, vol. 37, 3rd edn., para 143 at p. 83 which provides for calculation of a calendar month: ―143. calendar month running from arbitrary date.--when the period prescribed is a calendar month running from any arbitrary date the period expires with the day in the succeeding month immediately preceding the day corresponding to the date upon which the period starts; save that, if the period starts at the end of a calendar month which contains more days than the next succeeding month, the period expires at the end of the latter month.‖ 44. learned counsel for the respondent has also relied upon the same meaning of the expression ―month‖ as ―calendar month‖ for the purposes of computation of the period of limitation under section 34(3) of the act though the period of thirty days thereafter has to be counted in number of days. on the other hand, learned counsel for the appellant has harped upon the plea that the period of 90 days + 30 days = 120 days is to be counted for the purposes of the period of limitation and condonation of delay in presenting the application under section 34(3) of the act by the respondent before the district commercial court, agartala on 24th november, 2022. it is the case of the appellant that such period has to be reckoned from the date of receipt of the award i.e. 25th july, 2022. for the purposes of illustration, the period of limitation prescribed under section 34(3) read with its proviso as 90+30 days has also been computed in the form of a tabular chart hereinbelow: date of award passed by the ld. arbitrator .25.07.2022 date of presentation of section 34 petition .24.11.2022 along with condonation petition/ filing date no. of days in relevant months monthwise calculation july7 days 25.07.2022 to 31.07.2022 august31 days 01.08.2022 to 31.08.2022 september30 days 01.09.2022 to 30.09.2022 october22 days 01.10.2022 to 22.10.2022 total-90 days october8 days 23.10.2022 to 30.10.2022 november22 days 01.11.2022 to 22.11.2022 extended 30 days 45. it is but obvious that the limitation period i.e. 3 months and 30 days expired on 23rd november, 2022 i.e. one day before the date of its presentation, i.e. 24.11.2022 whereas if the limitation period is treated as 90+30 days, it expired on 22nd november, 2022, i.e. two days before the date of presentation of the application on 24th november, 2022. 46. considered in either manner, the application under section 34(3) of the act was beyond the period of limitation which could not be condoned by the learned commercial court. the principle in this regard has been authoritatively laid down in union of india vs popular construction co. reported in (2001) 8 scc 470 and followed thereafter consistently. as such, the impugned order by which the delay of 30 days has been condoned and the application under section 34(3) had been treated to be within time is unsustainable in law. it is accordingly set aside. the application under section 34(3) of the act is held to be barred by limitation. 47. since the appeal succeeds on the first point itself, we do not deem it necessary to answer the other issues raised by the appellant herein. accordingly, both the appeals are allowed. consequently, the matters pending before the district commercial court, west tripura, agartala being cm (arb) 06/2022 and cm (arb) 07/2022 are held to be barred by delay. pending application(s), if any, also stand disposed of.
