JUSTICE N.V.ANJARIA            and            HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE A.S. SUPEHIA                       Date : 18/03/2021                          CAV JUDGMENT (PER : HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE N.V.ANJARIA) The petitioner-judgment debtor has filed the present petition to seek the following prayers. \n            (i)             to set aside order dated 07th             January,        2011 passed below  application Exh.54 by court of learned Principal Senior Civil Judge, Jamnagar, in Commercial Execution Petition No.161 of 2019;\n(ii) to direct the court below to decide petitioner's application Exh.65 dated 12th October, 2020 challenging the jurisdiction of the court before proceeding further;\n(iii) in the alternative, it is prayed to direct petitioner's application Exh.65 along with the pending applications.\n2. The grievance of the petitioner-judgment debtor is in respect of the order passed by the executing court under Order XXI, Rule 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, whereby the petitioner is required to show cause as to why petitioner should not be committed to civil prison. \n3. The respondent-Ultrabulk A/S, a company incorporated under the laws of Denmark, happens to be the decree holder, in whose favour stands judgment and decree dated 09th November, 2017 passed by the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, Commercial Court of England & Wales, U.K. in the matter of Ultrabulk A/S v. Arun Kumar Jagatramka, for a sum of USD 5,062,462 equivalent to more than Rs.32.00 crores, in addition to the interest. \n3.1 It was to execute the said foreign decree that the execution proceedings and application Exh.54 therein was filed under Order XXI Rule 37, CPC. The Ministry of Law, Government of India, by issuing Notification dated 01st March, 1953 designated the United Kingdom, it was stated, to be the reciprocating territory under Section 44A of CPC, whereas High Court in England to be the superior court of that territory. Issuance of notice pursuant to application Exh.54 motivated the petitioner to approach this Court by way of the present petition. \n3.2 The case of the respondent-decree holder in its application Exh.54 was inter alia that the petitioner, rated as one of the richest individuals in India, had given a personal guarantee-cum-on demand bond on 02nd July, 2013 on behalf of Gujarat NRE Coke Limited in favour of the respondent . Thereby it was committed by the petitioner that his liability to make payment to the respondent herein of USD 4,259,395 would arise upon failure of the said NRE Coke Limited to make payment of the said amount on or before 31st December, 2013. The said company remitted only USD 2.3 million out of the total. Thereupon in view of the personal guarantee as above, the liability of the petitioner to make payment of USD 4.25 million was crystalised. It was further mentioned that around 01st January, 2014, the petitioner acted with dishonest intention to avoid the liability of payment and sold off the assets in favour of the third parties. \n3.3 The respondent therefore instituted the suit before the English High Court on 22nd June, 2015 against the petitioner to recover the amount on the basis of said personal guarantee-cum-on demand bond. It was stated that at no point of time the petitioner herein raised any objection as to the jurisdiction before the English High Court. The petitioner also instituted Civil Suit No.77 of 2017 on 07th March, 2017 before the Kolkata High Court seeking permanent injunction against the respondent from prosecuting his case before the English Court. This suit was withdrawn as the English High Court passed the decree rendering the petitioner indebted to the respondent company. \n3.4 The execution petition which was under Section 44A, CPC was initially filed on 28th April, 2018 before the Commercial Court at Rajkot, before which court the petitioner filed an application objecting to the jurisdiction on the ground that the dispute was not a commercial dispute. Thereafter the execution petition came to be transferred to Commercial Court at Jamnagar. The application of the petitioner questioning the jurisdiction was rejected by order dated 10th April, 2019. \n3.5 The aforesaid order dated 10th April, 2019 was sought to be challenged by the petitioner by filing Special Civil Application No.8334 of 2019 before this Court which was dismissed by Division Bench of this Court on 26th August, 2019. The petitioner has quoted certain observations made by this Court while dismissing the said petition as under. \n\"13..... On the contrary, the record indicates that having filed objections under section 13 of the CPC before the Commercial Court at Rajkot, only with an aim and object to delay the execution proceedings, the petitioner filed the present application exhibit 19 and on its dismissal, the present writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \n14..... It would not be out of place to record that having participated in the proceedings before the English Commercial Court, having given a guarantee and the Judgment of English Court having become final, only with a view to throw spanner in the execution of such decree, the present petition is filed only with a view to create hurdle and delay the execution proceedings, which is nothing but an abuse of the process of the Court. We confirm the findings of the Court below and the Commercial Court having jurisdiction, has jurisdiction to entertain the execution petition filed by the respondent. The petition is devoid of any merits and the same is liable to be dismissed and is hereby rejected in limine with cost of Rs. 25,000/ to be deposited by the petitioner within a period of one week with Gujarat High Court Legal Services Committee.\"\n3.6 Against the aforementioned order of this Court, Special Leave Petition was filed by the judgment debtor which was disposed of as per following order dated 29th September, 2020. \n\"The Commercial Execution Petition was filed in the Commercial Court, Rajkot for execution of decree passed on 09.11.2017 by the High Court of Justice, (Queen's Bench Division) Commercial Court of England and Wales. The petitioner raised a ground of maintainability of the execution petition which was rejected by the Commercial Court and upheld by the High Court aggrieved by which the above Special Leave Petition has been filed. \nMr. Sandeep Bajaj, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the commercial court does not have the jurisdiction to entertain an Execution Petition under the Commercial Courts Act. Liberty is given to the petitioner to raise this contention before the Execution Court. \nWith the above observation, the Special Leave petition is disposed of.\"\n3.7 In application Exh.54, the respondent-decree holder set out certain supportive facts and aspects, summarised hereunder. \n(i) as per the report of \"Financial Express\" dated 21st June, 2019, Serious Fraud Investigation Office has been investigating into the financial affairs of the Kolkata based Gujarat NRE Coke, \n(ii) by order passed in Special Civil Application No.18238 of 2019, this Court allowed the petitioner to travel abroad as the lookout circular was not served upon the petitioner. The said order dated 24th October, 2019 was quashed by Division Bench,\n(iii) the executing court required the judgment debtor to file affidavit under Order XXI Rule 41(2),\n(iv) the Kolkata High Court refused permission to the judgment debtor to travel to Brazil by order dated 08th November, 2019,\n(v) in Wollongong Coal Limited v. Gujarat NRE Properties Private Limited, the Supreme Court of New South Walse pronounced that the judgment debtor and his wife in capacity of Directors of the said Coke company, committed breach of fiduciary duties,\n(vi) the judgment debtor had still been travelling in different luxury cars of the value in lakhs,\n(vii) the personal website of judgment debtor showed his profile, that he was the Chairman of Gujarat NRE Group, one of the largest independent producers of metallurgical coke and wealth creator of India, that he is an active member of Confederation of Indian Industries, the Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry, that he was a prominent person in the field and the international fora etc. 3.8 The decree holder gave details of remuneration received by judgment debtor from Gujarat NRE for acting as Chairman & Managing Director, annexing financial statements of Gujarat NRE from Year 2004 to 2017. It was contended that if the judgment debtor's Affidavit of Assets was to be believed, he was liable to be declared insolvent and shown not to be having the means to honour the foreign decree of USD 5,062,462 in addition to interest. The conduct of the judgment debtor was highlighted to further plead that the judgment debtor was siphoning off monies, properties and assets with his wife, daughters and son with an intention to defeat the claims of the creditors. Also the mention was made that F.I.R. No.306 of 2018 dated 03rd December, 2018 in respect of offences alleged under Sections 408, 467, 468, 471, IPC, 1860 has been registered against the judgment debtor that the judgment debtor caused wrongful losses to an Australian coal company. \n3.9 It is to be mentioned that respondent- judgment debtor filed an application Exh.11 under Section 13, CPC before the executing court and questioned the conclusiveness of decree of English Court contending that the amount was not liable to be recovered. Another application Exh.45 was filed seeking consequential dismissal of the execution proceedings. Both these applications came to be dismissed on 29th September, 2020 by the executing court. Subsequent to the aforementioned order of the Apex Court dated 29th September, 2020, it appears that the petitioner filed application Exh.65 challenging the jurisdiction of the executing court. As per the averment made in paragraph-49 of affidavit-in-reply dated 30th January, 2021 of the respondent, the said application Exh.65 has been reserved for judgment by the court.\n4. Heard learned advocate Mr.Sandeep Bajaj with learned advocate Mr.Vivek Gupta for the petitioner and learned senior advocate Mr.Mihir Joshi assisted by learned advocates Mr.Aditya Krishnamurthy and Mr.Harsh Parekh for the respondent, at length. \n4.1 One of the main contentions on behalf of the petitioner raised by his learned advocate was that the court below has recorded certain premature and prejudicial findings of fact and thereby virtually decided the show-cause notice. It was submitted that in paragraph-29 of the impugned order \"it is brought on record that the judgment debtor has financial capacity to satisfy the deemed decree passed by this court but has deliberately chosen and failed to do so.\". It was next submitted that similarly in paragraph-31 the court below recorded that, \"conduct of the judgment debtor indicates his unwillingness to pay inspite of his means to pay. The judgment debtor having means to pay the decreetal amount has neglected his obligation under the decree.\". Learned advocate submitted that the notice under Order XXI, Rule 37 shall have to follow the procedure under Rule 40, CPC, yet the court below has by making such observations, prejudged the issue. \n4.2 Learned advocate for the petitioner next submitted that the decree holder was required to demonstrate as per Section 51, CPC, that the petitioner had after institution of the suit before the English Court, dishonestly transferred the property and that though the petitioner has since date of the decree the means to pay the decreetal amount, yet he has neglected to pay the same. The submissions were raised that irrelevant aspects were considered and further that the petitioner was not given reasonable opportunity to defend his case before issuing notice under Order XXI, Rule 37, CPC. It was also the submission on behalf of learned advocate for the petitioner that application Exh.65 challenging jurisdiction of the court below was pending which was filed pursuant to liberty granted by the Apex Court as per order dated 29th September, 2020 in SLP (C) No.11689 of 2020, yet the court below proceeded to consider the application under Order XXI Rule 37, CPC. It was submitted that the court below ought to have decided the application Exh.65 before deciding the application Exh.54, and that in not deciding the application challenging the jurisdiction of the court beforehand, the court has made it infructuous. \n4.3 Learned senior counsel for the respondent put forth his contentions on the basis of the contents of affidavit-in-reply filed by the respondent in response to the petition. The facts and circumstances stated in application Exh.54 were highlighted to submit that under Section 44A(1), CPC, decree could be executed in India and that by legal fiction the foreign decree was merged into a deemed decree of trial court, as applications Exh.11 and Exh.45 were dismissed. Respondent submitted that the civil suit before the Kolkata High Court was an attempt to stall the proceedings before the London Court. Referring to order dated 26th August, 2019 passed by tis Court in Special Civil Application No.8334 of 2019, it was emphasised that this Court observed that the judgment debtor had been acting \"to throw spanner in the execution\".\n4.4 It was submitted that but for the restrictive orders passed by the Court, judgment debtor had been attempting to leave the country, and that the banks and financial institutions have large claim against the petitioner. It was contended that order dated 29th February, 2020 was challenged in SLP (C) No.11689 of 2020 but the Supreme Court did not stay the execution proceedings nor stayed the order dated 29th February, 2020. It was submitted that mere raising of objection regarding jurisdiction cannot automatically result into stay of proceedings. Learned senior advocate submitted that the court below had issued only notice and the further inquiry is yet to succeed, wherein judgment debtor could adduce evidence in rebuttal. \n5. At this stage, a brief reference to the applicable relevant provisions may be made. Section 51, CPC provides for powers of the court to enforce the execution. Amongst the modes prescribed, it is provided as one of the recourses that upon application of the decree holder, the court may order execution of decree by arrest and detention of judgment debtor in prison. The Proviso attached thereto says that where the decree is for payment of money, the execution by detention in prison is not to be ordered unless reasonable opportunity of showing cause to the judgment debtor is extended and the court is satisfied that the conditions stated in the provision were fulfilled or met with. \n5.1 Operating supplementary to what is contemplated in the Proviso referred to above, Order XXI Rule 37, CPC provides as under.\n37. Discretionary power to permit judgment-debtor to show cause against detention in prison--(1) Notwithstanding anything in these rules, where an application is for the execution of a decree for the payment of money by the arrest and detention in the civil prison of a judgment-debtor who is liable to be arrested in pursuance of the application, the Court shall, instead of issuing a warrant for his arrest, issue a notice calling upon him to appear before the Court on a day to be specified in the notice and show cause why he should not be committed to the civil prison:\nProvided that such notice shall not be necessary if the Court is satisfied, by affidavit, or otherwise that, with the object or effect of delaying the execution of the decree, the judgment-debtor is likely to abscond or leave the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court. \n(2) Where appearance is not made in obedience to the notice, the Court shall, if the decree- holder so requires, issue a warrant for the arrest of the judgment-debtor. \n5.1.1 Order XXI Rule 37(1) envisages that the executing court, instead of issuing warrant of arrest of judgment debtor, issue a notice calling upon him to appear before the court on the specified date to show cause as to why he should not be committed to civil prison. On the face of it, the provision is for issuing a show cause notice only. As per sub-rule (2), where appearance is not made in obedience to the notice, it will be permissible for the court to issue a warrant for arrest of judgment debtor. What becomes clear is that it is obligatory on part of the court to issue a notice instead of issuing a arrest warrant of the judgment debtor straightway. \n5.1.2 Once the presence of the judgment debtor is secured by the court by exercising jurisdiction under Rule 37(2) above, the further procedure to be followed by the court is contemplated for in Rule 40 of Order XXI. Order XXI Rule 40 is as under. \n40. Proceedings on appearance of judgment-debtor in obedience to notice or after arrest--(1) When a judgment-debtor appears before the Court in obedience to a notice issued under rule 37, or is brought before the Court after being arrested in execution of a decree for the payment of money, the Court shall proceed to hear the decree-holder and take all such evidence as may be produced by him in support of his application for execution and shall then give the judgment-debtor an opportunity of showing cause why he should not be committed to the civil prison.\n(2) Pending the conclusion of the inquiry under sub-rule (1) the Court may, in its discretion, order the judgment-debtor to be detained in the custody of an officer of the Court or release him on his furnishing security to the satisfaction of the Court for his appearance when required.\n(3) Upon the conclusion of the inquiry under sub- rule (1) the Court may, subject to the provisions of section 51 and to the other provisions of the Code, make an order for the detention of the judgment-debtor in the civil prison and shall in that event cause him to be arrested if he is not already under arrest:\nProvided that in order to give the judgment- debtor an opportunity of satisfying the decree, the Court may, before making the order of detention, leave the judgment-debtor in the custody of an officer of the Court for a specified period not exceeding fifteen days or release him on his furnishing security to the satisfaction of the Court for his appearance at the expiration of the specified period if the decree be not sooner satisfied. \n(4) A judgment-debtor released under this rule may be re-arrested. \n(5) When the Court does not make an order of detention under sub-rule (3), it shall disallow the application and, if the judgment-debtor is under arrest, direct his release.\n5.1.3 The provision of Order XXI, Rule 40 above necessitates in law that before the final order could be passed, the executing court has to follow the procedure prescribed in the said Rule. As per this Rule after judgment debtor appears in obedience to the notice under Rule 37, it is provided that the court shall proceed to hear the decree holder. The court may take such evidence which may have been produced by the decree holder in support of his request for execution. Thereafter the court is duty- bound to give the judgment debtor an opportunity. It is only after the conclusion of inquiry under sub- rule (1) of Rule 40 that the court can make order for detention of judgment debtor in civil prison. Rule 40 is to be viewed not only procedural but mandatory in nature. \n5.2 The High Court of Andhra Pradesh in S. Ismail v. Agraseni Chit Funds [AIR 2005 AP 33] observed that expression of inquiry employed in Rule 40 means the inquiry with regard to the defence taken by the judgment debtor, and also inquiring into the averments made by the decree holder. This inquiry has to be undergone by the court before it could finally order sending the judgment debtor to civil prison. \n5.3 The impugned order of the executing court issuing notice has to be viewed in light of and in the context of working of the above provisions. While exercising powers under Order XXI, Rule 37, CPC, the court considered various aspects including making of observations about the judgment debtor having financial capacity. Also was taken into consideration by the court that the decree was for payment of money, the conduct of the judgment debtor with attendant aspects, to observe that they were indicative of unwillingness to pay. The court took note of the investigation commenced by Serious Fraud Investigation Office in the financial affairs of Gujarat NRE, the issuance of lookout circular against the judgment debtor and his immediate family members and the order passed by the Kolkata High Court rejecting judgment debtor's application for travelling abroad. The order dated 10th April, 2019 dismissing judgment debtor's application raising objections to the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, was mentioned and the aspect of filing of F.I.R. against judgment debtor was also referred to. It is not possible to say that the aspects noted by the executing court were not relevant. \n5.3.1 Attended and supported by the aspects broadly stated above, the following observations and reasoning became crux of the impugned order. \n\"28. The Decree Holder apprehends that the Judgment Debtor is concealing his assets by having the same ostensibly registered in the name of his immediate family members with a malicious intention of insulting the same from the claims of the creditors of the Judgment Debtor who are likely to inherit the property of the Judgment Debtor and would be personally liable for the foreign decree upto the value of the property which they would be inheriting from the Judgment Debtor. The Decree Holder has sought for issuance of show cause notice under Order XXI Rule 37 to the Judgment Debtor calling upon him to appear before the court and show cause why he should not be committed to the civil prison as envisaged under S.55 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\" \n5.4 Recording reasons while issuing notice in exercise of discretionary powers under Order XXI, Rule 37, CPC can be said to be a permissible exercise, for, the act of issuance of notice cannot be entirely a mechanical process. A decree holder would not be entitled to contend that notice under the said provision may be readily issued even without applying the basic facts and admitting to consideration the relevant aspects. Application of mind by the executing court for exercise of powers under Order XXI Rule 37, CPC, while issuing notice can indeed not be said to be foreign to the exercise. It is trite principle that wherever discretionary power is conferred on the court, such discretion has to be exercised judicially, on the basis of proper reasons and upon relevant facts and germane considerations. \n5.5 The submission of the petitioner was that application Exh.65 questioning the jurisdiction of the court has not been decided; prayer is also made to direct to decide the said application Exh.65 with other applications. Disposing of the said contention, it goes without saying and is to be observed that the executing court shall not proceed further till it renders decision on application Exh.65 of the judgment debtor. As recorded hereinabove and given out by respondent-decree holder in its reply, the said application Exh.65 is kept reserved for the judgment. In the facts of the case, interest of justice would be sub-served if the executing court is directed to decide the said application Exh.65 time- bound so that a clear picture emerges about the further proceedings. \n5.6 The inquiry to be undergone under Order XXI, Rule 40 is mandatory in nature. As the Section prescribes, it confers on the decree holder right to hearing. It is the stage where the decree holder shall be heard for his case on merits and the court will take all such evidence as may be produced by him in support of his application for execution. Order XXI, Rule 37 and Rule 40 conjointly operates, in which notice under Rule 37 has no conclusive value unless the decree holder establishes his case in accordance with law, in which the judgment debtor has the right to be heard to put forward his case. As the notice under Order XXI, Rule 37 is not an end in itself, what is recorded in the order issuing notice under the said provision has also no finality attached to it. The issuance of notice under Order XXI, Rule 37, once succeeds the inquiry by the court under Rule 40, may or may not result into detaining the judgment debtor into civil prison. Therefore, all the contentions canvassed by the petitioner herein are not tenable in view of operation of the interacting provisions mentioned above. \n5.7 Secondly, orally canvassed and reiterated in written submissions was the grievance that the executing court recorded findings of fact under the guise of issuance of notice, for which the observations made in paragraph Nos.29 and 31 of the impugned order, which are mentioned in paragraph No.4.1 hereinabove, were referred to. As noted above, the stage of inquiry under Rule 40 is yet not exhausted, at which material juncture, the judgment debtor will have right to rebut and to controvert. Even otherwise, the findings recorded and observations made at various places in the impugned order, are in the nature of tentative and prima facie observations having not conclusive value. It could not be said that they amount to prejudging or that they would prejudice the judgment debtor who will have a full opportunity in the inquiry under Order XXI, Rule 40, as may be held by the executing court. \n5.8 In any view, in order to allay the apprehension of the petitioner, this Court is inclined to clarify that any of the observations in the impugned order shall not be final and shall be subject to the findings which may be recorded in the subsequent stages including in the inquiry under Rule 40 as may have to be undertaken. \n6. In view of the foregoing reasons and discussion, the present petition is not liable to be entertained, however following directions shall govern. \n(i) The executing court shall render its decision on the application Exh.65 of the judgment debtor within fifteen days from the date of receipt of this order. This Court has not expressed any opinion on the merits thereof. Neither the impugned order nor the present order shall influence the decision to be taken by the executing court on application Exh.65; \n(ii) Any of the observations including those specifically referred to by the petitioner from Paragraph Nos.29 and 31 of the impugned order shall not be treated as final, they shall not become prejudicial to the judgment debtor in the further inquiry under Order XXI, Rule 40, CPC, if required to be undertaken after order below application Exh.65;\n(iii) In such inquiry, the judgment debtor will have right to rebut and defend his case. \n7. The present petition is dismissed subject to the aforesaid observations and directions. Notice is discharged. \n(N.V.ANJARIA, J) (A. S. SUPEHIA, J) ANUP",

commercial court appeal no.13 of 2023 judgment: (per hon'ble sri justice p.naveen rao) the first appellant is a government of india enterprise engaged in executing civil, mechanical, infrastructure development etc. works. the 2nd appellant is its managing director. the 1st respondent is a company dealing in construction of civil works. 2. first appellant was awarded contract by m/s. singareni collieries company limited (sccl) to execute part-i (rg-i area) for construction of quarters with civil, electrical, plumbing and all other required accessories on back to back basis and also works pertaining to rg-ii area on back to back basis as per designs and drawings provided by sccl. appellant appointed 1st respondent as subcontractor to execute the rg-i area work. the work was awarded on 15.02.2005 with a completion period of 18 months. later it was also entrusted with rg-ii works. 3. while appellants allege that 1st respondent delayed completion of work, the 1st respondent alleges that 1st appellant was responsible for delay in executing the work. according to 1st respondent, the work was completed in may, 2007 and the defect liability period expired in may, 2008. first respondent alleges that he was subjected to several pnr,j & nbk,j impediments and delays due to lack of cooperation and coordination by the 1st appellant, illegally withheld amounts, due and payable to 1st respondent. 4. on refusal by the 1st appellant to release the payments, 1st respondent issued legal notice dated 12.09.2011 initiating dispute resolution process by invoking arbitration clause, clause-24 of the additional conditions of contract. the 1st respondent raised 17 claims. 5. the 2nd appellant appointed mr. s.rajiv, general manager of 1st appellant as sole arbitrator. the proceedings commenced on 10.02.2012 and prolonged. aggrieved by the conduct of the arbitrator, the 1st respondent lodged complaint before the 2nd appellant. at that stage, the arbitrator resigned. consequently, the 2nd appellant appointed 3rd respondent as an arbitrator on 05.11.2015. first respondent also had grievance against 3rd respondent. first respondent protested before the 2nd appellant against continuation of 3rd respondent as arbitrator. 6. as there was no response, 1st respondent filed arb.application no.75 of 2018 under section 14(1)(a) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (for short, 'act, 1996') before this court. after receiving notices, the 2nd appellant informed the 1st respondent that the 3rd respondent resigned as arbitrator. during the hearing of arb.application no.75 of 2018, issue of maintainability of the pnr,j & nbk,j application under section 14(1) of the act before the high court was raised. having regard to legal position, the 1st respondent withdrew the application with liberty to go before appropriate court. 7. accordingly, the 1st respondent filed instant arb.o.p., before the commercial court. it is the case of 1st respondent that given the consistent conduct of the nominee arbitrators appointed by the 2nd appellant, who were biased towards the 1st appellant, it has lost confidence in their impartiality. having regard to their conduct and amendments carried out to the act in the year 2015, it has prayed to declare the actions of arbitrators appointed by the 2nd appellant would constitute willful failure to act without undue delay; that appointment of 2nd respondent as arbitrator when arb.appln.no.75 of 2018 was pending in the high court is invalid and illegal; that appointment of sole arbitrator by the 2nd appellant is violative of section 12(5) of the act, 1996; and consequently to terminate the mandate of 2nd respondent and substitute with another respondent in terms of section 14 read with section 15 of the act, 1996. 8. on due consideration of respective submissions, scope of the various provisions of the act and the precedent decisions, the commercial court recorded its conclusions as under: \"(i) the appointment of the arbitrators by the respondent no.2 is not valid in view of the judgments of the hon'ble supreme court in trf limited vs. energy engineer projects ltd., [(2017) 8 scc 377] and ellora paper mills ltd., vs. state of m.p., [2022 (3) scc 1]. pnr,j & nbk,j (ii) the arbitrators appointed by the respondent no.2 including respondent no.3 were negligent and did not conduct the arbitral proceedings within the timelines as assumed by them and thus they became defacto unable to perform their functions, within the meaning of section 14(1)(a) of the aca. (iii) there is undue delay by each of the arbitrators appointed by the respondent no.2 and none of them could proceed with the arbitral proceedings and this 'undue delay' can be considered as the delay mentioned in section 14(1)(a) of the aca and it also can be considered as bias on the part of the arbitrators. (iv) the contention that the petitioner is responsible for delaying the arbitral proceedings does not commend acceptance as it is the petitioner who is interested in arbitral proceedings and outcome of adjudication. (v) the grievance of the petitioner is well founded and the petitioner deserves to be allowed for substitution of the arbitrator.\" 9. the commercial court held that the mandate of 2nd respondent be terminated and in his place, another arbitrator be appointed. accordingly, allowed the petition, terminated the mandate of 2nd respondent and in his place, appointed retired district judge sri y.govind reddy as sole arbitrator. aggrieved thereby, this appeal is preferred. 10. heard learned counsel sri k.srinivas rao for the appellants and the learned counsel sri svs chowdary for the respondent no.1. 11. learned counsel for appellants contended that the commercial court has no jurisdiction to appoint a substitute arbitrator. he would submit that under section 11 of the act only the high court can appoint an arbitrator. 11.1. he would submit that commercial court erred in terminating the mandate of the arbitrator at the stage of final submissions. pnr,j & nbk,j 11.2. he would submit that the commercial court erred in not appreciating that the 2nd respondent was appointed strictly in accord with the agreed terms and in strict compliance with section 12(5) of the act, 1996. as appointment of arbitrator by 2nd petitioner was in compliance of section 12(5) of the act, 1996, there is no cause to appoint another arbitrator. 11.3. he would further submit that the commercial court erred in not appreciating that if 1st respondent has objection on appointment of an arbitrator, such objection ought to have been raised within the time specified in section 13, whereas no such objection was raised at any time and participated in arbitral proceedings. 11.4. he would submit that the commercial court erred in not appreciating that the 2nd respondent is no way concerned with the 1st petitioner and the decision of hon'ble supreme court in perkins eastman architects vs. hscc (india) ltd.,1 has no application to this case. if 1st respondent had any apprehension on impartiality of the 2nd respondent he could have elicited information as prescribed in sixth schedule to the act. 11.5. he would contend that the commercial court has no jurisdiction to deal with the arbitration matter. 1 2019 scc online sc 1517 pnr,j & nbk,j 12. learned counsel for 1st respondent would contend that appellants being parties to the agreement, the managing director of the 1st appellant cannot act as an arbitrator nor can he appoint an arbitrator unilaterally. as 2nd respondent was appointed as arbitrator by 2nd appellant, his appointment is illegal. 12.1. he would submit that the issue pertains to the year 2011 and as the arbitrators were associated with 1st appellant, they were dragging on the matter compelling the first respondent to lodge complaints. on filing complaints they coolly withdraw from arbitral proceedings. thus, for no fault of first respondent, matter is dragged on causing grave prejudice and hardship to first respondent. 12.2. he would submit that having regard to facts of the case, the commercial court justified in setting aside appointment of second respondent as arbitrator and appointing a retired judicial officer as arbitrator. 12.3. on the issue of jurisdiction, learned counsel contends that the dispute is a commercial dispute and as per section 10(3) of the commercial courts act, 2015, the commercial court alone has jurisdiction to decide the dispute raised by the first respondent. 12.4. learned counsel relied on the following decisions: pnr,j & nbk,j i) jaycee housing private limited vs registrar (general) orissa high court, cuttack2; and ii) trf limited vs energo engineering projects limited3. 13. the following issues arise for consideration: 1) whether the commercial court has jurisdiction to entertain cop no.8 of 2021 ?; 2) whether appointment of an outsider as arbitrator by chairman and managing director is legal and valid ?; 3) whether the commercial court is competent to substitute another arbitrator? issue no.1: 14. the inter se dispute leading to taking recourse to arbitral proceedings is a commercial dispute. in a civil dispute, if a party to the dispute has grievance on appointment of arbitrator by opposite party, the said party can file application before a civil court. however, if the dispute is a commercial dispute, such applications have to be filed before the commercial court only as per section 10(3)4 of the 2 (2023) 1 scc 549 3 (2017) 8 scc 377 s.10. jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters. where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and-(1) & (2) xxxx (3) if such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of pnr,j & nbk,j commercial courts act, 2015. therefore, the special court in the cadre of district judge for trial and disposal of commercial disputes at hyderabad has jurisdiction to entertain c.o.p.no.8 of 2021. 15. at this stage, it is apposite to note the opinion expressed by hon'ble supreme court on jurisdiction of commercial court in jaycee housing pvt. ltd. (supra). hon'ble supreme court held: \"16. it is the case on behalf of the appellants, relying upon section 2(1)(e) of the 1996 act that in case of arbitration other than the international commercial arbitration, the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district only have the jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration, but does not include any civil court of a grade inferior to such principal civil court, or any court of small causes. therefore, it is the case on behalf of the appellants that therefore conferring the jurisdiction upon the court of learned civil judge (senior division) as commercial court to hear applications under sections 9, 14 and 34 of the 1996 act shall be directly in conflict with section 2(1)(e) of the 1996 act and therefore the notification of the state government conferring such powers upon the court of learned civil judge (senior division) which is subordinate to the rank of principal civil judge in a district shall be bad in law. . 28. if the submission on behalf of the appellants is accepted, in that case, though with respect to other commercial disputes, the applications or appeals shall lie before the commercial courts established and constituted under section 3 of the 2015 act, with respect to arbitration proceedings, the applications or appeals shall lie before the principal civil court of a district. there cannot be two fora with respect to different commercial disputes.\" issue no.2: 16. the relevant clause in the agreement provides that if there are any disputes or differences, they should be referred to the sole arbitrator, the chairman and managing director (cmd) of engineering original jurisdiction in a district (not being a high court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial court has been constituted. pnr,j & nbk,j projects (india) limited, the first appellant. it also provides that chairman and managing director can appoint any other person as an arbitrator. two times the chairman and managing director has appointed officers of the first appellant and on third occasion an outsider. 17. the relevant provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 are, sections 12 (5)5, 136, 147 and 158. 5 s.12 grounds for challenge: (1) to (4) xxxxx (5) :notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship, with the parties or counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute, falls under any of the categories specified in the seventh schedule shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator: provided that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub-section by an express agreement in writing. 6 s.13. challenge procedure. (1) subject to sub-section (4), the parties are free to agree on a procedure for challenging an arbitrator. (2) failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (1), a party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within fifteen days after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or after becoming aware of any circumstances referred to in sub-section(3) of section 12, send a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal. (3) unless the arbitrator challenged under sub-section (2) withdraws from his office or the other party agrees to the challenge, the arbitral tribunal shall decide on the challenge. (4) if a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the procedure under subsection (2) is not successful, the arbitral tribunal shall continue the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award. (5) where an arbitral award is made under sub-section (4), the party challenging the arbitrator may make an application for setting aside such an arbitral award in accordance with section 34. (6) where an arbitral award is set aside on an application made under sub-section (5), the court may decide as to whether the arbitrator who is challenged is entitled to any fees. 7 s.14. failure or impossibility to act.--(1) [the mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate and he shall be substituted by another arbitrator, if] -(a) he becomes de jure or de facto unable to perform his functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay; and (b) he withdraws from his office or the parties agree to the termination of his mandate. (2) if a controversy remains concerning any of the grounds referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1), a party may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, apply to the court to decide on the termination of the mandate. (3) if, under this section or sub-section (3) of section 13, an arbitrator withdraws from his office or a party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, it shall not imply acceptance of the validity of any ground referred to in this section or sub-section(3) of section 12. 8 s.15. termination of mandate and substitution of arbitrator.--(1) in addition to the circumstances referred to in section 13 or section 14,the mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate-(a) where he withdraws from office for any reason; or (b) by or pursuant to agreement of the parties. (2) where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed according to the rules that were applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator being replaced. (3) unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where an arbitrator is replaced under sub-section (2), any hearings previously held maybe repeated at the discretion of the arbitral tribunal. 1. ins. by act 3 of 2016, s. 8 (w.e.f. 23-10-2015). 2. subs. by s. 9, ibid., for \"the mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate if\" (w.e.f. 23-10-2015). 14 (4) unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an order or ruling of the arbitral tribunal made prior to the replacement of pnr,j & nbk,j 18. according to section 13 of the act, 1996, a party who intends to challenge an arbitrator should do so within 15 days after becoming aware of the constitution of arbitral tribunal by sending a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal. 19. the arbitral tribunal is competent to decide the challenge. if it rejects the challenge, it is competent to commence the arbitral proceedings. in the case on hand, no challenge was made before the arbitrator. c.o.p is filed under section 14 of the act, 1996 praying to grant comprehensive reliefs. 20. section 14 of the act, 1996 is on failure or impossibility of conducting arbitral proceedings. according to sub-section (1) the mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate and he should be substituted by another arbitrator if he becomes de-jure and de facto unable to perform his functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay. according to sub section (2) if the controversy concerning any of the grounds referred to in sub section (1) (a) remain, a party may apply to the court to decide on the termination of the mandate. 21. section 15 of the act, 1996 also envisages termination of mandate and substitution of arbitrator. circumstances mentioned therein are in addition to situations envisaged in sections 13 and 14 of the act, 1996. an arbitrator under this section shall not be invalid solely because there has been a change in the composition of the arbitral tribunal. pnr,j & nbk,j 22. it is not in dispute that the arbitration clause in the agreement requires chairman and managing director to conduct arbitral proceedings or by a person appointed by him. the three arbitrators, one after the other, are appointed by chairman and managing director. the first two are from the first appellant and third is an outsider. 23. learned counsel for appellant contended that the third arbitrator is a neutral person and he has complied mandate of section 12 (5) and therefore there is no impediment in conducting arbitration proceedings by the second respondent. this issue is no more res-integra. 24. in trf limited (supra) as per the terms of purchase order, the managing director appointed a retired judge of the supreme court as arbitrator. this was challenged in an application filed under section 11(5) read with section 11(6) of the act, 1996. the question that fell for consideration was whether once a person required to arbitrate upon the disputes arising under the terms and conditions of the contract becomes ineligible by operation of law, he would not be eligible to nominate a person as an arbitrator. the hon'ble supreme court held: \"50. first, we shall deal with clause (d). there is no quarrel that by virtue of section 12(5) of the act, if any person who falls under any of the categories specified in the seventh schedule shall be ineligible to be appointed as the arbitrator. there is no doubt and cannot be, for the language employed in the seventh schedule, the managing director of the corporation has become ineligible by operation of law. it is the stand of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that once the managing director becomes ineligible, he also becomes ineligible to nominate. refuting the said stand, it is canvassed by the learned senior counsel for the respondent that the ineligibility cannot extend to a nominee if he is not from the corporation and more so when there is apposite and requisite disclosure. we think it appropriate to make it clear that in the case at hand we are neither concerned with the disclosure nor objectivity pnr,j & nbk,j nor impartiality nor any such other circumstance. we are singularly concerned with the issue, whether the managing director, after becoming ineligible by operation of law, is he still eligible to nominate an arbitrator. at the cost of repetition, we may state that when there are two parties, one may nominate an arbitrator and the other may appoint another. that is altogether a different situation. if there is a clause requiring the parties to nominate their respective arbitrator, their authority to nominate cannot be questioned. what really in that circumstance can be called in question is the procedural compliance and the eligibility of their arbitrator depending upon the norms provided under the act and the schedules appended thereto. but, here is a case where the managing director is the \"named sole arbitrator\" and he has also been conferred with the power to nominate one who can be the arbitrator in his place. thus, there is subtle distinction. xxx 53. the aforesaid authorities have been commended to us to establish the proposition that if the nomination of an arbitrator by an ineligible arbitrator is allowed, it would tantamount to carrying on the proceeding of arbitration by himself. according to the learned counsel for the appellant, ineligibility strikes at the root of his power to arbitrate or get it arbitrated upon by a nominee. 54. in such a context, the fulcrum of the controversy would be, can an ineligible arbitrator, like the managing director, nominate an arbitrator, who may be otherwise eligible and a respectable person. as stated earlier, we are neither concerned with the objectivity nor the individual respectability. we are only concerned with the authority or the power of the managing director. by our analysis, we are obligated to arrive at the conclusion that once the arbitrator has become ineligible by operation of law, he cannot nominate another as an arbitrator. the arbitrator becomes ineligible as per prescription contained in section 12(5) of the act. it is inconceivable in law that person who is statutorily ineligible can nominate a person. needless to say, once the infrastructure collapses, the superstructure is bound to collapse. one cannot have a building without the plinth. or to put it differently, once the identity of the managing director as the sole arbitrator is lost, the power to nominate someone else as an arbitrator is obliterated. therefore, the view expressed by the high court is not sustainable and we say so.\" (emphasis supplied) 25. thus, the appointment of second respondent as arbitrator by the second appellant is ex-facie illegal. the second respondent becomes de-jure unable to perform his functions. therefore, the commercial court rightly terminated the appointment of 2nd respondent as arbitrator. the issue is answered accordingly. pnr,j & nbk,j issue no.3: 26. further question is, as a consequences to declaration given by the commercial court holding that appointment of second respondent as arbitrator is illegal whether the commercial court can substitute another arbitrator. 27. the arbitration clause envisaged the chairman and managing director or his nominee as the arbitrator. in view of section 12(5) of the act, 1996 and the judgment of hon'ble supreme court in trf limited (supra), the appointment of second respondent as arbitrator by chairman and managing director is wholly illegal and second respondent becomes de-jure unable to perform as an arbitrator. after termination of mandate of second respondent as arbitrator, power to appoint another arbitrator, which is nothing but substitution of earlier arbitrator, is traceable to section 14(1)(a) of the act, 1996. section 14(1)(a) clearly envisages substitution of arbitrator in place of earlier arbitrator where the earlier arbitrator became de-jure unable to function as arbitrator and his appointment is terminated. 28. in swadesh kumar agarwal vs. dinesh kumar agarwal9, hon'ble supreme court held as under: \"21. therefore, on a conjoint reading of sections 13, 14 and 15 of the act, if the challenge to the arbitrator is made on any of the grounds mentioned in section 12 of the act, the party aggrieved has to submit an appropriate application before the arbitral tribunal 9 (2022) 10 scc 235 pnr,j & nbk,j itself. however, in case of any of the eventualities mentioned in section 14(1)(a) of the 1996 act and the mandate of the arbitrator is sought to be terminated on the ground that the sole arbitrator has become de jure and/or de facto unable to perform his functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay, the aggrieved party has to approach the \"court\" concerned as defined under section 2(1)(e) of the 1996 act. the court concerned has to adjudicate on whether, in fact, the sole arbitrator/arbitrators has/have become de jure and de facto unable to perform his/their functions or for other reasons he fails to act without undue delay. the reason why such a dispute is to be raised before the court is that eventualities mentioned in section 14(1)(a) can be said to be a disqualification of the sole arbitrator and therefore, such a dispute/controversy will have to be adjudicated before the court concerned as provided under section 14(2) of the 1996 act. 22. so far as the termination of the mandate of the arbitrator and/or termination of the proceedings mentioned in other provisions like in section 15(1)(a) where he withdraws from office for any reason; or (b) by or pursuant to an agreement of the parties, the dispute need not be raised before the court concerned. for example, where the sole arbitrator himself withdraws from office for any reason or when both the parties agree to terminate the mandate of the arbitrator and for substitution of the arbitrator, thereafter, there is no further controversy as either the sole arbitrator himself has withdrawn from office and/or the parties themselves have agreed to terminate the mandate of the arbitrator and to substitute the arbitrator. thus, there is no question of raising such a dispute before the court. therefore, the legislation has deliberately provided that the dispute with respect to the termination of the mandate of the arbitrator under section 14(1)(a) alone will have to be raised before the \"court\". hence, whenever there is a dispute and/or controversy that the mandate of the arbitrator is to be terminated on the grounds mentioned in section 14(1)(a), such a controversy/dispute has to be raised before the \"court\" concerned only and after the decision by the \"court\" concerned as defined under section 2(1)(e) of the 1996 act and ultimately it is held that the mandate of the arbitrator is terminated, thereafter, the arbitrator is to be substituted accordingly, that too, according to the rules that were applicable to the initial appointment of the arbitrator. therefore, normally and generally, the same procedure is required to be followed which was followed at the time of appointment of the sole arbitrator whose mandate is terminated and/or who is replaced. xxxx 32.5. in a case where there is a dispute/controversy on the mandate of the arbitrator being terminated on the ground mentioned in section 14(1)(a), such a dispute has to be raised before the \"court\", defined under section 2(1)(e) of the 1996 act and such a dispute cannot be decided on an application filed under section 11(6) of the 1996 act.\" (emphasis supplied) pnr,j & nbk,j 29. the arbitration clause requires the cmd or his nominee to be an arbitrator which procedure is held to be illegal. the termination of arbitrator appointed by cmd is valid. therefore, the cmd cannot appoint an arbitrator. thus, only recourse is under section 14(1)(a) of the act, 1996 and the court should appoint a substituted arbitrator. further, there has been unreasonably long delay in resolving the dispute. in view of the same, we do not see any illegality in appointing another arbitrator in the place of 2nd respondent, which is nothing but substitution of earlier arbitrator whose mandate is terminated. thus, following the above dicta, the order of the commercial court is valid. the issue is answered accordingly. 30. in view of the above findings, the appeal fails. it is accordingly dismissed. no order as to costs. pending miscellaneous applications if any shall stand closed. __________________________ p.naveen rao, j ___________________________ nagesh bheemapaka,j
