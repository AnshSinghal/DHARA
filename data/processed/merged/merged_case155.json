Dharmadhikari, J.]\n1 This appeal by the original defendant Nos.1, 3 and 4 challenges an order passed by the learned single Judge in Notice of Motion No. 494 of 2014 in Suit No.516 of 2013 . 2 By this order, which is fairly detailed, the learned single Judge disposed of a preliminary issue of jurisdiction raised by these defendants under section 9-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. \n3 There are two suits filed and our order passed today in the present appeal will dispose of the applications insofar as the above, in both suits. \nManugraph India Limited. The appellants before us are the defendant Nos.1, 3 and 4 to this suit. \n5 There is another Suit No. 632 of 2014, which is the COMAP40.16.doc subject matter of Commercial Appeal No. 40 of 2016. 6 To our mind, the fate of Commercial Appeal Nos.40 and 49 both of 2016 shall decide Commercial Appeal No.41 of 2016 as well. \n7 The learned single Judge found that in Suit No.632 of 2014, a preliminary issue was framed on 31 st March, 2016. The defendants in these suits urged that the plaintiffs have their registered office in Mumbai and they have a branch office in Delhi, where the defendants have their place of business. According to these defendants, when the cause of action has arisen within the territorial limits of plaintiffs branch office at Delhi, then, this Court would have no jurisdiction to entertain and try the said suits. It is only the Courts in Delhi which would possess such jurisdiction. \n7A The appellants-original defendant Nos.1, 3 and 4 in Suit No.516 of 2013 take a substantially similar plea. There, the facts projected were that the plaintiff in this suit has its registered office in Mumbai. The defendants in that suit are based COMAP40.16.doc in Kolhapur. The defendants allege that the plaintiffs also have an office in Kolhapur and that the site of the suit, therefore, should be Kolhapur. \n7B It is such an objection which has been considered by the learned single Judge and thereafter he concluded that in the light of the discussion, the preliminary issue in both suits has to be answered in the negative. In other words, this Court would have jurisdiction to entertain and try both suits. On such a preliminary objection to the territorial jurisdiction of this Court, after hearing both sides, the learned Judge passed the following order :\n\"... ... ... ...\n38. In this view of the matter, the preliminary issues in both the matters are answered in the negative. This Court has jurisdiction to try and entertain both the Suits. \n39. The Plaintiff's Notice of Motion will accordingly be set down for hearing, since the pleading in both are complete. List both Notices of Motions in both the Suits but separately for hearing and final disposal in the week of 11th July 2016.\"\nCOMAP40.16.doc Thereafter, the learned Judge directed that the Notices of Motion for interim relief moved by the plaintiffs will have to be heard separately. \n9 It is such an order which is under challenge before us. 10 It is common ground that the appeal is preferred under the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (Act 4 of 2016). This Act shall now be referred to as Act 4 of 2016. 11 According to the parties, the appellate power is to be found in Chapter IV titled \"Appeals\", particularly in section 13. 12 Mr. R.M. Kadam, learned counsel appearing for the original plaintiff-respondent No.1 in Commercial Appeal No.40 of 2016 has raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of this appeal. \n13 He invited our attention to sub-section (1) of section COMAP40.16.doc 13 as also sub-section (2) thereof to contend that the order under appeal is not an appealable order. It is not a decision by which even if the appellant is aggrieved allegedly, he can, as of right, maintain an appeal. According to Mr. Kadam, the law does not enable filing of appeals by parties like the appellants-defendants unless and until the impugned judgment and order is, as contemplated by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, either a decree or an order. The proviso to sub-section (1) of section 13, according to Mr. Kadam, would denote that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by the Act 4 of 2016 and section 37 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. However, the sub-section (1) of section 13 cannot be given a wider meaning so as to enable this Court to entertain any and every appeal. \n14 He would submit that the words \"decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division of a High Court \"\nappearing in sub-section (1) of section 13 would, together with the further words \"from the date of judgment or order, as the COMAP40.16.doc case may be\", indicate that Act 4 of 2016 does not enlarge or widen either the power of appeal or the ambit and scope of the appellate power. That is circumscribed or restricted by sub- section (2) of section 13 and sub-section (2) would indicate that there is no right of appeal created outside the Act 4 of 2016. \nTherefore, other legislation or laws cannot be looked into so as to vest or create a right of appeal in a litigant like the appellants. \n15 Mr. Kadam would then summarize his arguments by contending that a decision not giving any question or issue a finality or adjudicating it as such and prejudicially affects any rights of parties like the appellants could, therefore, not be termed as an order or judgment / decision enabling filing of an appeal to challenge it. \n16 Mr. Kadam would submit that the Act 4 of 2016, together with its preamble and in the backdrop of its object and purpose, denotes that the commercial disputes which may be forming subject matter of a suit or proceedings in the nature of arbitration have to be disposed of expeditiously. \nCOMAP40.16.doc 17 If during the stage or course of such proceedings or suits some issues emerge and there is a ruling thereon, does not mean that such a ruling or decision can be challenged in appeal. That would mean at a interlocutory stage the proceedings or the suit would be interrupted and there will be no progress till the disposal of such appeals. In other words, the proceedings or the suit would not proceed and that would completely defeat the object and purpose of the Act. If commercial disputes involving a specified value have to be brought to an end and decided expeditiously, then, an interpretation consistent with that object and purpose be placed on section 13.\n18 On the other hand, Dr. Saraf and Mr. Kirpekar appearing on behalf of the appellants in both appeals would submit that there is no merit in the arguments of Mr. Kadam. Dr. Saraf would submit that the present objection is to the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain and try the suit. The objection may be to the territorial jurisdiction, but, nonetheless such an objection, if upheld, brings an end to the suit. It brings an end to the proceedings and the suits in this Court, completely and finally. If such an objection is overruled, then, the decision in COMAP40.16.doc that behalf is appealable. It is appealable because it is a decision by which the appellants are aggrieved. When the objection has not been upheld it would force them to face the trial in the suit or other proceedings. They would be forced to submit to the jurisdiction of this Court. It is precisely that which they are resisting. In the circumstances, this is not a case of any and every decision being challenged, but a decision of this Court which is a \"judgment\" impugned in these appeals. The finding on territorial jurisdiction of this Court has a vital bearing and it is not as if that will not prejudicially affect the rights of the appellants. Since the objection is negatived, the jurisdictional issues are concluded and finally. In the circumstances, both would contend that this is an appealable order. 19 Additionally, Mr. Kirpekar brings to our notice a Division Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Ferani Hotels Pvt. Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadia & Ors. in Appeal No.817 of 2010 along with Appeal No.806 of 2010 decided on 19th July, 2012. 20 He would contend that section 9-A has been inserted in the statute book, namely, the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, by COMAP40.16.doc a Maharashtra amendment. That enables the Court to rule upon an issue of jurisdiction, raised in a suit of the present nature, at a preliminary stage. The adjudication of that issue should not be postponed till the trial of the suit is the object and purpose in inserting section 9-A in the Code of Civil Procedure. Such a provision is salutary. That equally has a laudable object and purpose. The trial on the issue of jurisdiction need not be postponed and that issue should not necessarily be tried at the hearing of the suit. Order XIV of the Code of Civil Procedure and Rule 2 thereof and Section 9-A operate at different stages. Thus, a preliminary issue of jurisdiction, according to counsel, need not await trial till the suit in which it is raised is ready for hearing. The adjudication therein should be done at the earliest stage and when the Court is considering the plaintiffs application for grant of interim injunction / relief. If at that stage the issue can be considered, postponing the consideration of the interim relief application, then, such an objection or preliminary issue under section 9-A having been decided one way or the other would result in rendering of a judgment. That judgment finally adjudicates or concludes the issue of jurisdiction. It is not relevant as to what is the outcome thereof. So long as that issue COMAP40.16.doc is of jurisdiction, then, that has a vital bearing on the controversy in the suit. The adjudication thereof terminates the proceedings and the suit itself one way or the other. In the circumstances, he would submit that we should not take a restricted view of the right of appeal which is created by Act 4 of 2016 and vesting in the present set of litigants. \n21 Dr. Saraf, in all fairness, has brought to our notice two judgments of this Court on the point. \n22 The first is rendered by a Division Bench of Hon'ble Mr. Justice A.V. Mohta and Mr. Justice G.S. Kulkarni in the case of Hubtown Limited vs. IDBI Trusteeship Service Ltd . reported in 2017 4 BCR 310 and another rendered by a Division Bench presided over by His Lordship Hon'ble Mr. Justice V.M. Kanade (as His Lordship then was) and Her Ladyship Swapna S. Joshi in the case of Smt. Sushila Singhania & Ors. vs. Bharat Hari Singhania in Commercial Appeal No.41 of 2016 together with other appeals decided on 29th March, 2017. \n23 Dr. Saraf would submit that a careful perusal of these COMAP40.16.doc two judgments would denote that there is a clear departure from the view taken in Hubtown which is earlier in point of time. The latter Division Bench judgment in the case of Smt. Sushila Singhania rendered by V.M. Kanade, J. records in the opening paragraph and while noting down the arguments, the reliance on Hubtown, on the point of maintainability of the appeal. However, without adverting to the findings and conclusions in Hubtown, the Division Bench proceeds to rule on the issue of maintainability of the appeal in Smt. Sushila Singhania's case. The observations are directly contrary or divergent to that of the earlier Division Bench in Hubtown. Therefore, judicial discipline, according to Dr. Saraf, demands that either we go by the earlier ruling in the case of Hubtown and uphold the right of appeal or if we are of the view that the latter judgment refers to and attempts to distinguish or departs from the view taken in Hubtown, then, an authoritative pronouncement is required at the hands of a larger Bench. Resultantly, we must refer the issue of maintainability of this appeal to a larger Bench. 24 In that Dr. Saraf would place reliance on a Division Bench judgment to which one of us (S.C. Dharmadhikari, J.) was COMAP40.16.doc a party and rendered in the case of Shri Prakash Gobindram Ahuja vs. Ganesh Pandharinath Dhonde & Ors. in Appeal from Order No.256 of 2013 decided on 4th October, 2016. 25 Our attention has also been invited to two judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on this point, namely, (2016) 6 SCC 391 in the case of Commissioner of Central Excise, Indore vs. Grasim Industries Limited and (1998) 4 SCC 270 in the case of Gaurav Jain and Anr. vs. Union of India. These are essentially on the point of judicial discipline and a latter Division Bench being confronted with the earlier view directly adjudicating a identical point or issue before it, then, it should resort to either referring the matter to a larger Bench if it is not in a position to agree with the view taken in the earlier judgment or it must render a definitive finding that the judgment which is ordinarily binding on it is per incuriam and, therefore, has no binding effect. 26 It can only be ignored in such an eventuality is the submission. \n27 Before we proceed, we must notice as to how the issue COMAP40.16.doc of maintainability of appeals under Act 4 of 2016 has been dealt with in Hubtown and Smt. Sushila Singhania. 28 In Hubtown the preliminary objection to the maintainability of the appeal was not raised by the senior counsel appearing for the respondents. The respondents had consented to hearing the appeal on merits. However, the Division Bench thought it fit to hear the counsel appearing for parties on maintainability as it was of the opinion that the said issue goes to the root of the matter. According to the Division Bench, there is a confusion prevailing and particularly in the Registry of this Court as to the transfer of pending Summary Suits (Suits filed under Order XXXVII, Code of Civil Procedure, 1908) because of the Act 4 of 2016. \n29 A Summary Suit was filed by the respondent-plaintiff - IDBI in that appeal seeking a decree. During pendency of that Summary Suit, Act 4 of 2016 intervened. Thereafter, the Commercial Courts Act having been notified, the Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division were constituted in this Court on 4th January, 2016. The learned Judge who was COMAP40.16.doc hearing the Summary Suit continued to be nominated as a Commercial Division of this Court and he was assigned to hear all Summary Suits, including the subject Summary Suit. A Summons for Judgment in that Suit was argued by parties on merits before the Commercial Division and was reserved for orders on 14th January, 2016. On 13th May, 2016, pending the final order in the Summons for Judgment, the captioned Summary Suit was formally transferred to the Commercial Division of this Court alongwith several other suits and proceedings. The order impugned in that appeal had been passed granting conditional leave to defend the suit. On 12 th July, 2016, the appeal in Hubtown's case was filed as a commercial appeal. On 29th July, 2016, the appeal was heard finally, by consent, on merits at the admission stage and the matter was closed for orders. \n30 It was noted by the Division Bench that after the Act 4 of 2016 was brought into effect, it would have to address itself on the issue of maintainability of the appeal though it was not raised as a preliminary issue and though there was no objection in that regard. Thus the issue of maintainability was not directly arising COMAP40.16.doc for consideration as it was not raised specifically by the parties. However, the Court noted the factual background and that the Summons for Judgment were disposed of and the aggrieved defendant was in appeal. \n31 The Court, therefore, addressed the issue of jurisdiction by referring to in paragraph 5, the Act 4 of 2016 and the definitions therein. Thereafter, in the paras relied upon before us, it traced the history of the legislation, namely, Act 4 of 2016 and referred to the scheme of the Act and the arrangement of the Chapters therein. \n32 In paragraph 20, the Court noted that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Appellate Division as provided in Chapter II and specifically section 13 provides that the Commercial Appellate Division of a High Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from decisions, judgments or decrees passed by the Commercial Division of that High Court or by Commercial Courts within the local limits the jurisdiction of the High Court. In paragraphs 20 to 25 and part of 26 and paragraph 27, the Court held as under :\nCOMAP40.16.doc \"20. The jurisdiction of the Commercial Appellate Division as provided in Chapter II and specifically Section 13 provides that the Commercial Appellate Division of a High Court has jurisdiction to hear Appeals from decisions, judgments, orders or decrees passed by the Commercial Division of that High Court or by Commercial Courts within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the High Court. \n21. After giving due consideration to the provisions of Section 13(1) read with Section 13(2) it is apparent that it provides that Appeals will lie to the Commercial Appellate Division against the decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division. The words \"decision\", \"Judgment\", \"Order\" \"decree\" as such are not defined. It is defined and elaborated under the CPC. From Section 13(1) it follows that it includes \"judgment\" or \"order\" and read with Sections 8, 13(2) it includes \"decree\" of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division. However, it is specifically mentioned in proviso to Section 13(1) that such orders as enumerated in Order XLIII of CPC should be the order against which an Appeal against order is maintainable under Section 13. Further the proviso contemplates that an Appeal would lie against appealable order under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Section 13(2) has restricted the Appeals even for Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act by rider that \"no Appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial COMAP40.16.doc Division or Commercial Court other than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\". This is also with \"notwithstanding\" clause under Section 13(2) whereby, it is mandated that \"notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of High Court\".\n22 Therefore, taking into consideration the overall provisions and intent of Section 13(1) and (2) which provides the specific orders against which an Appeal can be filed in such commercial matters. \nThe Appeal under Section 13 is maintainable, once the Suits, Petitions Applications and Appeals are transferred and treated as commercial disputes having specified value, where the learned Commercial Division Judge has taken the decision and/or passed the \"judgment\" and/or \"order\" or \"decree\". It is relevant to note that under Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act, it is mandated and reinforced that the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act will prevail over the provisions of other Act. Therefore, an Appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act is maintainable against the decision/judgment/order or decree, if it falls within the ambit of the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. This includes that the subject matter must be commercial dispute having valuation of more than one crore and falls within the territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction of the respective Court and/or Division and/or subject to the specific provisions like COMAP40.16.doc the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, read with the special statutes and the provisions so required, referred under umbrella of \"commercial dispute\" so defined. \n23 Appeal against any final decision include the judgment so passed by the Commercial Court and/or Commercial Division the proviso to Section 13(1) will not be applicable to such decision/judgment, as the proviso refers to \"orders\". The reference to \"orders\" in the opening portion of Section 13(1) would relate to the application of the proviso to sub-section (1). However, the opening portion of sub-section (1) (words prior to the proviso) clearly use the words \"decision\", \"judgment\" and \"order\". Therefore, the ambit of this part of sub- section (1) is quite broader when it comes to appeals arising out of orders other than the category of orders falling under order XLIII of the CPC. Therefore, an Appeal under Section 13(1), even if there is an order, but which has a tinge or colour of judgment as laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji v. Jayaben D. Kania & anr and Midnapore Peoples' Co-op. Bank Ltd. (supra), the Appeal under Section 13 against such order being a \"judgment\" within the meaning of CPC, is maintainable. The provisions of CPC (amended and unamended) are applicable to the Commercial Courts Act's proceedings. The term \"Judgment\" was not even defined under the Letters Patent Act. In the summary COMAP40.16.doc suit, though it is an interlocutory order of granting Defendants conditional leave to defend such summary suit, as it directly affects and loses the valuable rights of the Defendant without giving full opportunity and as transferred and as heard by the learned Commercial Division Bench/Judge, the Commercial Appeal against such \"Judgment\" is maintainable. Therefore, we are of the view that there is no reason to hold that the Commercial Appeal as filed is not maintainable. \n\"Summary Suit\" and \"Summary Judgment\"-\n24 The conceptual position of \"summary suit\" as contemplated under Order XXXVII of CPC and its specific provisions are governed as per the original provisions of CPC. The amended CPC, in view of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act inserted the provision for a \"summary judgment\", through Order XIII-A which is made applicable to the classes of Suits (commercial suits) which required to be decided by the Commercial Division/Court. It prescribes the procedure and stages for application for summary judgment. This also includes and provides the powers of a Commercial Judge to pass conditional order including for evidence for hearing of summary judgment. We are concerned with Order XIII-A, Rule 1(3) of CPC, whereby it is specifically provided \"notwithstanding anything to the contrary, \"an application\" for summary judgment under this COMAP40.16.doc Order shall not be made in a Suit in respect of any commercial disputes that is originally filed as a summary suit under Order XXXVII.\". Therefore, once the summary suit as originally filed, prior to the commencement of the and as now transferred, being commercial dispute matter, the original procedure as provided under Order XXXVII shall be applicable to such summary suits. The parties are not entitled to prayer for summary judgment under XIII-A in view of the specific provision so referred above. This also means that the judgments and the issue so decided in summary suit shall for all purposes be governed by the CPC, even after such suits are as suits. The Commercial Division Judge is required to follow the original C.P.C. And is required to keep in mind the position in law revolving around all the facets of summary suits. The provisions of Section 13, therefore, is required to be interpreted and/or considered accordingly, when any decision is given by the Commercial Division/Court in such summary suit. The proviso to Section 13(1), will not affect the maintainability of such Appeal so filed against such order/judgment passed by the Commercial Division/Court in such summary suit. \nproviso has extinguished, expressly and/or by necessary intentment the Appeal against the order passed by the Commercial Judge in summary suit granting the Defendant conditional leave to defend a COMAP40.16.doc summary suit is unacceptable. Section 13 itself contemplates that an Appeal is maintainable against the decision/judgment or order which has effect of \"judgment\", though it falls outside the purview of Order XLIII as observed above. \n26. ... ... ... ... The Commercial Courts Act or special Statute, if empowers, the Appellate Division Court to deal with the Appeal against the Judgment/order passed by the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court, the bar so submitted of proviso to Section 13(1) is not applicable in each and every matter specifically when the subject matters are commercial disputes as defined under the Commercial Courts Act and are also governed by the Special Act/Statute other than the CPC. The specific provisions/ Statute/ Act will prevail as substantial rights, if are created over the provisions of Order XLIII CPC, as provided in proviso to Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. \nFiling of Appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, cannot be occluded- 27 Section 13 Scheme itself provides Appeal against decision which includes judgment/order passed by the Commercial Division/Court. There is no provision of revision against the interlocutory order in view of bar of Section 8. Section 8 further clarifies that only Appeal against such order is available COMAP40.16.doc subject to Section 13 proviso. Even the issue of jurisdiction or such challenge. Therefore, the aggrieved parties have no option but to file Appeal against the decision/order. The Appellate Court, however, may or may not entertain appeal against the order or interlocutory order, in view of proviso to Section 13(1). But filing of Appeal under Section 13, in our view, cannot be occluded. The Appeal against any decision of any Commercial Division/Court is maintainable. To entertain or not is the Appellate Court's power and the jurisdiction depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case.\" \n33 Dr. Saraf would submit that the Division Bench, on an analysis of the provisions of Act 4 of 2016, has ruled that firstly the provisions of section 13 are required to be interpreted and/or considered accordingly and particularly bearing in mind that the Commercial Division Judge is required to follow the original Code of Civil Procedure. He is required to keep in mind the position in law revolving around all the facets of summary suits for the judgment and the issue so decided in Summary Suits shall, for all purposes, be governed by the Code of Civil Procedure even after they are transferred as commercial suits. Therefore, Dr. Saraf would submit that the submission canvassed that section 13 COMAP40.16.doc proviso has extinguished expressly and/or by necessary intendment the appeal against the order passed by the Commercial Judge granting the defendant conditional leave to defend a Summary Suit is not acceptable. Section 13 itself contemplates that an appeal is maintainable against the judgment and order which has the effect of judgment though it falls outside the purview of order XLIII as observed by the Division Bench. Dr. Saraf has laid great emphasis on these conclusions and equally that the bar of the proviso to section 13(1) is not applicable in each and every matter specifically when the subject of the Act 4 of 2016 is commercial disputes as defined therein. They are also governed by the Special Act / Statute other than the Code of Civil Procedure. In such circumstances, he relied upon the above reproduced portion from paragraph 26 and the conclusion drawn in paragraph 27. Dr. Saraf would submit that this decision holds that an appeal against any decision of any Commercial Division / Court is maintainable and to entertain the appeal at all or not is the appellate court's power and jurisdiction. That depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. \nCOMAP40.16.doc 34 In the second judgment rendered in Smt. Sushila Singhania, the appeal arose from an order passed by a learned single Judge. What had transpired was that there was a partnership firm and during the course of business, differences arose between the partners. A deed of dissolution was executed and the firm was dissolved. A supplemental agreement was also executed. The parties agreed to partition and distribution of the immovable properties of the firm amongst themselves. 35 Since there was some dispute regarding distribution, an arbitration suit was filed by the respondent No.1 to 6 for appointment of an arbitrator under section 20 of the then Arbitration Act, 1940. The suit was initially dismissed on the ground of limitation. The matter travelled upto the Supreme Court and thereafter, the dispute was referred to a sole arbitrator for arbitration. The sole arbitrator made an award on 4 th August, 2008. He directed partition and distribution of the various immovable properties of the firm amongst the partners. The award of the learned arbitrator was challenged in a petition under section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and the petition challenging the said award was dismissed by this COMAP40.16.doc Court. An appeal therefrom under section 37 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, was dismissed on 8 th March, 2013. The Award became executable as a decree. \n36 Since the Award was not enforced, in the sense the distribution did not take place, an Execution Application No.2006 of 2015 under Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, was filed in this Court. The respondent No.16 to the appeal also filed an Execution Application No.1913 of 2015. A Notice No.1786 of 2015 was issued under Order XXI Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure to all parties in the execution application, calling upon them to show cause why the award was not executable and why warrant of possession should not be issued. All the parties filed detailed reply to the Notice. The appellant - Sushila and others opposed and resisted the execution of the award on the ground that the obligations of the groups in the award were joint, interlinked and interconnected and to be executed and complied with simultaneously. 37 From the record it appears that such an objection was turned down and an order was made to that effect. It was that COMAP40.16.doc order which came to be challenged in appeal before the Division Bench. \n38 A preliminary objection was raised to the maintainability of the appeal on the ground that orders which are passed in execution proceedings are not decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Division nor are they orders which are specifically enumerated in sub-section (1) of section 13. Therefore, the appeals are not maintainable. 39 On the other hand, the appellants argued that the right of appeal is not restricted either to decrees or orders which are specifically enumerated in the proviso, but would lie also against decisions of the Commercial Courts or Commercial Division which have the effect of attaining finality and even against such a decision, appeal would be maintainable. The argument further was that the order passed in execution proceedings is in the nature of a final order affecting substantive rights of the appellants and, therefore, these appeals are maintainable.\nCOMAP40.16.doc 40 In dealing with such objection and ruling upon it, the Division Bench made the following observations to which our attention was specifically invited by Dr. Saraf. Those observations are to be found in paragraphs 72 to 75 and paragraphs 81 to 84 and they read as under :\n\"72 However, when the final Act was passed, it is apparent that the exclusion of the provisions of the Letters Patent are to be found in sub-section (2). The said sub-section (2) also starts with a non-obstante clause - notwithstanding anything contained in any other law -meaning thereby either CPC, Arbitration Act or the Letters Patent or any other law, no appeal would lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act. \n73 Apart from reasons which we have given hereinabove, and in addition to that while deciding the question as to whether \"decision\" includes \"judgment\" and \"decree\", it will have to be considered whether the word \"decision\" has to be used in narrow sense or in a broad sense i.e. whether the word \"decision\" will have to be read only as a \"decree\" or wider meaning has to be given viz that of \"decree\", \"judgment\" and \"order\" which conclusively decides rights of the parties. Though the Letters Patent Act is COMAP40.16.doc not applicable as it has been expressly excluded under sub-section (2), it will be necessary to briefly see how the word \"judgment\" has been interpreted by the Apex Court. The word \"judgment\" is narrowly treated under Section 2 of the CPC. When the said question came up for consideration before the Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra), the Supreme Court in paras 112 and 113 of its judgment gave a wider meaning and held that those orders which conclusively decide right of parties could be held to be appealable under the Letters Patent Appeal, though the word \"judgment\" is narrowly construed in the CPC. The Apex Court in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra) did not give narrow meaning to the said word \"judgment\" and, therefore, held that the orders which conclusively decide right of parties, even if they are not appealable under Section 104 or Order XLIII, an appeal would lie under the Letters Patent. \n74 The vexed question is whether similar meaning should be given to the word 'decision' as is found in sub-section (1) of Section 13.\n75 The question which fell for consideration before the Apex Court in Tirumalachetti Rajaram vs. Tirumalachetti Radhakrishnayya Chetty and Others , was as under:\n\"If the appellate decree passed by the High Court makes a variation in the decision of the trial COMAP40.16.doc court under appeal in favour of a party who intends to prefer an appeal against the said appellate decree, can the said decree be said to affirm the decision of the trial court or not under Article 133(1) of the Constitution?\"\n............\n81 From the above decisions it can be seen that the words and phrases previously interpreted by the Courts have to be used in aid to interpretation of later statute. The word \"decision\" therefore in this context would mean a final decision in the entire suit and therefore a decree. \n82 Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants has relied upon the definition of the word \"decision\" given in Black's Law Dictionary (9th Edition) and has contended that \"decision\" would include an order which finally determines rights of the parties. \n83 It is well settled that definition given by a dictionary cannot override the interpretation made by the Court in the context of its meaning as used in the statute and therefore the said submission is unacceptable. It is a settled position in law that dictionary is a secondary and external aid to interpretation of statute and cannot be relied upon when a direct meaning/definition has been in use in law and/or defined specifically in a statute. It has to be noted here that the term \"decision\" was a part of COMAP40.16.doc the Code of Civil Procedure 1882 (Section 596) which was later incorporated in Section 110 of the CPC which is now deleted and is also used in Article 133 of the Constitution of India. \n84 From the judgments referred to hereinabove, it is clear that it has been consistently held that the term \"decision\" appearing in three provisions means decision of the suit. The definition of \"decision\" and \"judgment\" in Black's Law Dictionary is therefore contrary to the settled law in India.\" \n41 Dr. Saraf would also rely upon paragraph 93 to submit that the Division Bench in Smt. Sushila Singhania (supra) was of the view that heading of section 13 deals with Appeals from Decrees and the proviso carves out an exception in respect of the orders which are specifically enumerated in section 37 of the Arbitration Act against which an appeal can be filed. The word \"decision\" therefore, will have to be interpreted to mean a decree. 42 Dr. Saraf would submit that this view of the Division Bench in Smt. Sushila Singhania directly conflicts with that of the Division Bench in Hubtown. A preliminary issue of maintainability of appeal in Hubtown was decided and thus the COMAP40.16.doc challenges were similar. However, in Hubtown, the conclusion that is reached in paragraph 93 in Smt. Sushila Singhania has been specifically not reached and thus there is a divergence in the conclusion of the two Division Benches, particularly when the judgment in Smt. Sushila Singhania's case does not refer to Hubtown beyond noting the reliance thereon while setting down the submissions of the parties. Smt. Sushila Singhania being a latter judgment, we should either ignore it for it has not explained and examined the earlier view. If we are of the view that there is a conflict or divergence in views, the matter is required to be referred to a larger Bench in terms of judicial discipline. 43 In that, we are taken through the scheme of the law of precedents and particularly what is a binding precedent and what is the judicial discipline required when binding decisions or precedents are brought to the notice of the single Judge and Division Benches of this Court and if they wish to disagree therewith. Any disagreement or difference of opinion being noted and set down thereafter should result in judicial discipline being followed, according to Dr. Saraf. \nCOMAP40.16.doc 44 Looked at from this angle, according to him, this appeal should be held to be maintainable and taken up for consideration on merits. \n45 Before we give our opinion, it would be advisable to independently go through the scheme of Act 4 of 2016. Though it is noted extensively in both the judgments above, it is better that we refer it so as to appreciate the arguments of Dr. Saraf. 46 It is an Act to provide for the constitution of Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts for adjudicating commercial disputes of specified value and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Chapter I contains preliminary provisions and therein appears section 2. What we have is a Commercial Appellate Division being defined in section 2 clause (a) to mean the Commercial Appellate Division in a High Court constituted under sub-section (1) of section 5. \"Commercial Court\" means the Commercial Court constituted under sub-section (1) of section 3. Then comes the definition of the terms \"Commercial dispute\" and \"Commercial Division\" appearing in section 2 COMAP40.16.doc clauses (c) and (d) of these definitions and they read as under : \n\"2. Definitions.- In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,-\n                  (a)             .........\n\n\n                  (c)             \"commercial                dispute\"            means           a     dispute                   arising out of--                        ( i )        ordinary             transactions                of      merchants,\nbankers, financiers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents, including enforcement and interpretation of such documents; \n                       (ii )       export or import of merchandise or                        services; \n\n\n                       ( iii )      issues relating to admiralty and maritime                        law; \n\n\n                       (iv )       transactions relating to aircraft, aircraft engines, aircraft equipment and helicopters, including sales, leasing and financing of the same; \n                       ( v )        carriage of goods; \n\n\n                       ( vi )       construction and infrastructure contracts,\n                       including tenders; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                     COMAP40.16.doc                       (vii ) agreements                       relating            to        immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce;\n(viii) franchising agreements;\n(ix) distribution and licensing agreements;\n(x) management and consultancy agreements;\n(xi) joint venture agreements;\n(xii) shareholders agreements;\n(xiii) subscription and investment agreements pertaining to the services industry including outsourcing services and financial services;\n(xiv) mercantile agency and mercantile usage;\n(xv) partnership agreements;\n(xvi) technology development agreements;\n(xvii) intellectual property rights relating to registered and unregistered trademarks, copyright, patent, design, domain names, geographical indications and semiconductor integrated circuits;\nCOMAP40.16.doc (xviii) agreements for sale of goods or provision of services;\n(xix) exploitation of oil and gas reserves or other natural resources including electromagnetic spectrum;\n(xx) insurance and re-insurance;\n(xxi) contracts of agency relating to any of the above; and (xxii) such other commercial disputes as may be notified by the Central Government.\nExplanation. --A commercial dispute shall not cease to be a commercial dispute merely because--- (a) it also involves action for recovery of immovable property or for realisation of monies out of immovable property given as security or involves any other relief pertaining to immovable property;\n(b) one of the contracting parties is the State or any of its agencies or instrumentalities, or a private body carrying out public functions;\n(d) \"Commercial Division\" means the Commercial Division in a High Court constituted COMAP40.16.doc under sub-section (1) of section 4;\"\n47 Then we have the term \"specified value\" defined section 2 sub-section (1) clause (i). In relation to a commercial dispute it shall mean the value of the subject matter in respect of a suit as determined in accordance with section 12 which shall not be less than rupees one crore or such higher value as shall be notified by the Central Government. Sub-section (2) of section 2 clarifies that the words and expressions used and not defined in this Act, but defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, shall have the same meanings respectively assigned to them in that Code and the Act. Chapter II deals with Constitution of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions. Section 3 deals with Constitution of Commercial Courts and by sub-section (1) the State Government shall, after consultation with the concerned High Court, by notification, constitute such number of commercial courts at District level, as it may deem necessary for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on those courts under the Act 4 of 2016. The proviso to section 3 sub-section (1) states that no commercial court shall be COMAP40.16.doc constituted for the territory over which the High Court has ordinary original civil jurisdiction. \n48 Sub-section (2) of section 3 says that the State Government shall, after consultation with the concerned High Court, specify, by notification, the local limits of the area to which the jurisdiction of a commercial court shall extend and may, from time to time, increase, reduce or alter such limits. Sub-section (3) of section 3 states that the State Government shall with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court appoint one or more persons having experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be the Judge or Judges of a commercial court from amongst the cadre of higher judicial service in the State. Section 4 provides for Constitution of Commercial Division of High Court. It is apparent from sub-section (1) that in all High Courts having ordinary civil jurisdiction, the Chief Justice of the High Court may, by order, constitute Commercial Division having one or more Benches constituting of a single Judge for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under this Act. There again, the Chief Justice shall nominate such Judges of the High Court who have experience in dealing with commercial COMAP40.16.doc disputes to be Judges of the Commercial Division. 49 Section 5 provides for constitution of Commercial Appellate Division and following the Notification under sub- section (1) of section 3 or under sub-section (1) of section 4, the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court shall, by order, constitute Commercial Appellate Division having one or more Division Benches for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it by the Act. There again, the nomination of Judges experienced in dealing with commercial disputes is contemplated by sub-section (2) of section 5. Sections 6 and 7 read as under :\n\"6. Jurisdiction of Commercial Court. - The Commercial Court shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value arising out of the entire territory of the State over which it has been vested territorial jurisdiction. \nExplanation.-- For the purposes of this section, a commercial dispute shall be considered to arise out of the entire territory of the State over which a Commercial Court has been vested jurisdiction, if the suit or application relating to such commercial COMAP40.16.doc dispute has been instituted as per the provisions of sections 16 to 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) . \n7. Jurisdiction of Commercial Divisions of High Courts.- All suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a Specified Value filed in a High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of that High Court:\nProvided that all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes, stipulated by an Act to lie in a court not inferior to a District Court, and filed or pending on the original side of the High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court:\nProvided further that all suits and applications transferred to the High Court by virtue of sub-section (4) of section 22 of the Designs Act, 2000 or section 104 of the Patents Act, 1970 (39 of 1970) shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court in all the areas over which the High Court exercises ordinary original civil jurisdiction.\" \n50 A perusal of these provisions would indicate as to how the commercial court shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and COMAP40.16.doc applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value arising out of the territorial jurisdiction of the State over which it has been vested territorial jurisdiction. 51 We do not refer to the Explanation to section 6, but section 7 defines the jurisdiction of Commercial Division of High Courts and there, all suits and applications relating to commercial dispute of a specified value filed in a High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of that High Court. Broken into parts, it would mean all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value filed in High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of that Court. The proviso to this section 7 would indicate as to how all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes stipulated by the Act would lie in a court not inferior to a District Court and filed or pending on the original side of the High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court and further all suits and applications transferred to the High Court by virtue of certain provisions of the Act in the second proviso to COMAP40.16.doc section 7 shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court in all areas over which it has ordinary original civil jurisdiction. \n52 Section 8 enacts a bar against a Revision Application or Petition against an interlocutory order. That section is equally important for our purpose for it rules out the maintainability of a Revision Application or Petition against any interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the Commercial Court. \n53 The argument, therefore, is that this provision being subject to section 13, it is only a Revision Petition which will not lie and shall not be entertained against any interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including on the jurisdiction, but this provision being subject to section 13, that does not rule out the right of maintainability of an appeal. Even if this section is as above, no construction on section 13 should be placed with the aid and assistance of section 8 of the Act 4 of 2016 so as to COMAP40.16.doc whittle down or dilute the right of appeal. Further, the requirement is that this section will not throw light on the maintainability of the appeal from an order of the above nature and passed by a Judge exercising power and authority as Commercial Division of a High Court. At best, a Revision Petition or application is ruled out against any interlocutory order of a Commercial Court. \n54 Then follows section 9 which transfers a counter claim in a commercial dispute of specified value. There, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, in the event that a counter claim filed in a suit before a civil court relating to a commercial dispute is of specified value, such suit shall be transferred by the civil court to the Commercial Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be, having territorial jurisdiction over such suit. Sub-section (2) of section 9 enables the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the civil court in its discretion to withdraw the suit on the application of the parties in the event sub-section (1) of section 9 is not complied with.\nCOMAP40.16.doc 55 Then, section 10 sets out the jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters and sections 10 and 11, for our purpose, read as under :\n\"10. Jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters.- Where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a Specified Value and-- (1) If such arbitration is an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 that have been filed in a High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such Commercial Division has been constituted in such High Court. \n(2) If such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 that have been filed on the original side of the High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such Commercial Division has been constituted in such High Court. \n(3) If such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 that would ordinarily lie before any principal COMAP40.16.doc civil court of original jurisdiction in a district (not being a High Court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial Court has been constituted.\n11. Bar of jurisdiction of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions. -\nNotwithstanding anything contained in this Act, a Commercial Court or a Commercial Division shall not entertain or decide any suit, application or proceedings relating to any commercial dispute in respect of which the jurisdiction of the civil court is either expressly or impliedly barred under any other law for the time being in force.\"\n56 A reading thereof would denote that the Act also enacts provisions so as to deal with the jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters and then creates a bar, in the sense notwithstanding anything contained in the Act 4 of 2016, a Commercial Court or Commercial Division shall not entertain or decide any suit, application or proceedings relating to any commercial dispute in respect of which the jurisdiction of the civil court is either expressly or impliedly barred under any other law for the time being in force. Then Chapter III contains section 12 COMAP40.16.doc and section 12 sets down by sub-section (1), the specified value of the subject matter of the commercial dispute in the suit, appeal or application and that should be determined in the manner set out in sub-section (1) clauses (a) to (e). By sub-section (2), the aggregate value of the claim and counter claim, if any, as set out in the statement of claim and counter claim, if any, in an arbitration of a commercial dispute shall be the basis for determining whether such arbitration is subject to the jurisdiction of a Commercial Division, Commercial Appellate Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be. Then, sub- section (3) of section 12 is important and reads as under :\n\"12. Determination of Specified Value.-\n(1) .... .... ...\n(3) No appeal or civil revision application under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as the case may be, shall lie from an order of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court finding that it has jurisdiction to hear a commercial dispute under this Act\"\n57 Then come sections 13 and 14 appearing in Chapter IV and they read thus :\n\"13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions. - (1) Any COMAP40.16.doc person aggrieved by the decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order, as the case may be: Provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as amended by this Act and section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act. \n14. Expeditious disposal of appeals. - The Commercial Appellate Division shall endeavour to dispose of appeals filed before it within a period of six months from the date of filing of such appeal.\"\n58 Before we refer to them in detail, what we have are the provisions of Chapter-V dealing with transfer of pending cases, but the Chapter itself is titled as \"Transfer of Pending Suits\". Then, what we have by Chapter VI are Amendments to the Provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and the COMAP40.16.doc provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the schedule. By sub-section (2) of section 16, the Commercial Division and the Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure amended by this Act, namely, Act 4 of 2016 in the trial of a suit in respect of commercial dispute of a specified value and by sub-section (3) where any provision of any rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail. \n59 Chapter VII contains Miscellaneous provisions enabling collection and disclosure of data by Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions (section 17). Power of the High Court to issue directions is conferred by section 18 and infrastructural facilities by section 19. By section 20, training and continuous education is contemplated and by the State Government in consultation with COMAP40.16.doc the High Court establishing necessary facilities providing for training of Judges. Section 21 gives the Act an overriding effect and reads thus :\n\"21. Act to have overriding effect. - Save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than this Act.\"\n60 Section 22 gives power to remove difficulties and section 23 titled Repeal and savings repeals the Ordinance preceding the Act by sub-section (1) but says notwithstanding such repeal, anything done or any action taken under the said Ordinance shall be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provision of this Act. The Schedule need not be referred to for our purpose. \n61 Thus, there is a Commercial Court which has to be constituted at District level. Then, there is a constitution of Commercial Division of High Court and constitution of a Commercial Appellate Division following which the jurisdiction of COMAP40.16.doc the Commercial Court and Commercial Division of the High Court has been set out. These are, therefore, courts which are pre- existing and which have otherwise a power to try the suits and applications. After the Act 4 of 2016, they are to be constituted as Commercial Courts at District level and within the High Court having ordinary ordinary civil jurisdiction, the Act contemplates constitution of Commercial Division of High Court and Commercial Appellate Division. \n62 Section 13 and the preceding provisions together with those following the same would have to be read together and harmoniously to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the right of appeal and conferred by section 13 is as wide as contended by Dr. Saraf or restricted as alleged by Mr. Kadam. 63 Before that, we must dispose of one argument and which has been heavily pressed into service by the appellants as also the respondents. Mr. Kadam would submit that sub-section (2) of section 13 is opening with a non obstante clause. The sweep of this non obstante clause is so wide that it states that overrides any other law for the time being in force or Letters COMAP40.16.doc Patent of a High Court. Therefore, an appeal would lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court only within the four corners of the Act 4 of 2016 and the appellate power would not be available to impugn or challenge any and every decision even if it is styled as a judgment. Dr. Saraf would submit that despite such a non obstante clause and given its scope, the tests laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Shah Babulal Khimji vs Jayaben D. Kania & Anr., AIR 1981 SC 1786 still hold the field. So long as that which is challenged is a decision amounting to a judgment and on par with that contemplated by clause 15 of the Letters Patent to be an appealable one, this Act and section 13 should be construed as not taking away a right of appeal against the same is the argument of Dr. Saraf. \n64 Shah Babulal Khimji was a case which arose from this Court. In that, a Bench of three Judges of the Hon'ble Supreme Court was called upon to decide as to whether an order passed in appeal by a Division Bench of this Court and, to be precise, dismissing the appeal on the ground that it was not maintainable, which appeal arose from the order of a learned single Judge, was COMAP40.16.doc correct in law. In the sense the Division Bench held that the appeal is not maintainable because the impugned order was not a judgment within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent. 65 The Hon'ble Supreme Court ruled that the appeal before the Division Bench was maintainable and the Division Bench should have entertained and decided it on merits. 66 There, the plaintiff-appellant filed a suit on the original side of the Bombay High Court for specific performance of a contract and prayed for an interim relief by appointing a Receiver of the suit property and injuncting the defendant from disposing of the suit property during the pendency of the suit. This relief was sought by filing of a Notice of Motion. That Notice of Motion was dismissed by a learned single Judge. The plaintiff- appellant filed an appeal before the High Court which dismissed it as being not maintainable. \n67 The High Court found that the appeal was not maintainable because the order of the learned single Judge was not a judgment as contemplated by clause 15 of the Letters COMAP40.16.doc Patent. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in paragraph 5, enumerated the substantial questions of law and which were, inter alia, touching the scope, ambit and meaning of the word 'judgment' and particularly in the context of those High Courts which have ordinary original civil jurisdiction depending on valuation of the suit or the action.\n68 The Supreme Court then traced the interpretation of the word 'judgment' appearing in the Letters Patent of several High Courts and after a survey of these decisions, noting the rival contentions, inter alia, that the provisions of section 104 read with Order XLIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure do not impose any bar and thus by virtue of these provisions, the order impugned falls squarely under clauses (r) and (s) of Order XLIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and, therefore, is appealable to a Division Bench. Even if the Court holds that the Letters Patent was a special law overriding the Code of Civil Procedure the power of appeal thereunder against an order is in no way inconsistent with clause 15 of the Letters Patent. Section 104 merely provides an additional remedy and confers a new jurisdiction on the High Court without at all interfering with or COMAP40.16.doc overriding the existing provisions of the Letters Patent. Then, there are other contentions and which are noted against the submissions of the appellant. In paragraph 15, the Hon'ble Supreme Court dealt with the first point relating to applicability of section 104 read with Order XLIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908, and thereafter concluded as under :\n\"20 To begin with, it is not disputed that a Trial Judge has to follow the entire procedure laid down by the Code of 1908 starting from the presentation of the plaint right up to the delivery of the judgment. The only difference in the assumption of jurisdiction by the High Court is that a suit of a particular valuation has to be instituted in the High Court rather than in the District court. Secondly, it is indisputable that any final judgment that the Trial Judge passes deciding the suit one way or the other amounts to a decree and under the provisions of the Letters Patent an appeal lies to a larger Bench which normally is a Division Bench as provided for under the Rules made by various High Courts. Thirdly, the Letters Patent itself does not define the term 'judgment' and has advisedly not used the word 'decree' in respect of any judgment that may be given by the Trial Judge. Section 5 of the Code of 1908 may be extracted thus: \n\"5. Application of the Code to Revenue Courts: (1) Where any Revenue Courts are governed by COMAP40.16.doc the provisions of this Code in those matters of procedure upon which any special enactment applicable to them is silent the State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare that any portions of those pro visions which are not expressly made applicable by this Code shall not apply to those Courts, or shall only apply to them with such modifications as the State Government may prescribe.\n(2) \"Revenue Court\" in Sub-section (1) means a court having jurisdiction under any local law to entertain suits of other proceedings relating to the rent, revenue or profits of land used for agricultural purposes, but does not include a Civil Court having original jurisdiction under this Code to try such suits or proceedings as being suits or proceedings of a civil nature \"\n21 The importance of this section is that wherever the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure are sought to be excluded by any special enactment which may be silent on the point, the State Government can by notification apply the provisions of the Code to Revenue courts. A bare perusal of this section would clearly reveal that excepting Revenue courts all other Civil courts would normally be governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure in the matter of procedure. Section 4(1) of the Code of 1908 which is a saving provision clearly COMAP40.16.doc provides that in the absence of any specific provision to the contrary the provisions of the Code does not limit or affect any special or local law. Thus, the test contained in s. 4 is not applicable in the instant case because even if the Letters Patent of the High Court be deemed to be a special law as contemplated by s. 4, the provisions of s. 104 do not seek to limit or affect the provisions of the Letters Patent. \n22 This now takes us to s. 104 of the Code of 1908, the relevant portion of which may be extracted thus:-\n\"104.(1) An appeal shall lie from the following orders, and save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this Code or by any law for the time being in force, from no other orders:-\n(a) to (f) annulled;\n(ff) an order under section 35-A (g) an order under section 95;\n(h) an order under any of the provisions of this Code imposing a fine or directing the arrest or detention in the civil prison of any person except where such arrest or detention is in execution of a decree;\n(1) any order made under rules from which an COMAP40.16.doc appeal is expressly allowed by rules:\n(2) No appeal shall lie from any order passed in appeal under this section.\" \n23 Thus by the force of S.104 all appeals as indicated in the various clauses of order 43 Rule 1 viz. (a) to (w) would lie to the appellate court. Section 105 clearly provides that no appeal shall lie from any order of a Court made in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction except according to the procedure laid down by the Code. The relevant part of S. 105 (1) may be extracted thus:\n\"105. (1) Save as otherwise expressly provided no appeal shall lie from any order made by a Court in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction; but where a decree is appealed from, any error, defect or irregularity in any order, affecting the decision of the case, may be set forth as a ground of objection in the memorandum of appeal.\" \n24 Finally, order, 49 Rule 3 expressly exempts matters contained in clauses (1) to (6) of Rule 3 from the operation of the extraordinary original civil jurisdiction of the chartered High Courts, that is to say, the jurisdiction conferred on the High Court by the Letters Patent. The relevant portion of this provision may be extracted thus:\nCOMAP40.16.doc \"O. 49 ... ... ... ... ... \n3. The following rules shall not apply to any Chartered High Court in the exercise of its ordinary or extraordinary original civil jurisdiction, namely:- (1) Rule 10 and Rule 11, clauses (b) & (c), of order VII;\n(2) Rule 3 of order X;\n(3) Rule 2 of order XVI;\n(4) Rules 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 (so far as relates to the manner of taking evidence) of Order XVIII;\n(5) Rules 1 to 8 of order XX; and (6) Rule 7 of order XXXIII (so far as relates to the making of a memorandum); and rule 35 of order XLI shall not apply to any such High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction\" 25 It may be pertinent to note that although a number of rules have been exempted from the operation of the Code, order 43 Rule 1 and the clauses thereunder have not been mentioned in any of these clauses. \n26 Thus, a combined reading of the various provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure referred to above lead to the irresistible conclusion that S. 104 COMAP40.16.doc read with order 43 Rule 1 clearly applies to the proceedings before the Trial Judge of the High Court. Unfortunately, this fact does not appear to have been noticed by any of the decisions rendered by various High Courts.\" \n69 The Court, in paragraph 28 expressed its agreement with the appellants' senior counsel that in the instant case, section 104 read with Order XLIII Rule 1 does not, in any way, abridge, interfere with or curb the power conferred on the trial Judge by clause 15 of the Letters Patent. What they do is to give an additional remedy by way of an appeal from the orders of the trial Judge to a larger Bench. Indeed, if this is the position, then the contention of the respondent that section 104 will not apply to internal appeals in the High Court cannot be countenanced. In fact, the question of application of the Code of Civil Procedure to internal appeals in High Court does not arise at all because the Code of Civil Procedure merely provides for a forum and if Order XLIII Rule 1 applies to a trial Judge, then, the forum created by the Court would certainly include a forum within the High Court to which appeals against the judgment of a trial Judge would lie. Therefore, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that Order XLIII Rule 1 cannot apply to internal appeals of the High Court. \nCOMAP40.16.doc Then, the Hon'ble Supreme Court refers to some of the provisions of the old Code and the judgments, including the judgments of the Privy Council interpreting the same. Then, in paragraphs 32 and 33, the Court enumerates as to how section 104 provides for additional or supplementary remedy by way of an appeal. After referring to the Letters Patent of this Court, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in paragraph 43, concludes that the judgment of the three Judges of the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court furnishes a complete answer to the arguments of the respondent that Order XLIII Rule 1 will have no application to internal appeals in the High Court under the provisions of the Letters Patent. Then, what we find is the Supreme Court turning its attention to the second limb of the argument of the appellant that even assuming that Order XLIII Rule 1 does not apply to the High Court so far as the trial Judge of the said court is concerned, there can be no doubt that the orders indicated in various clauses of Order XLIII Rule 1 possess the attributes and incidents of a final order which conclusively decide a particular issue so far as the trial Court is concerned. After noting the arguments of the appellants' senior counsel on this point, in paragraph 55, the Supreme Court referred to the decision in the case of Radhey Shyam vs. Shyam Behari Singh COMAP40.16.doc (1970) 2 SCC 405, and in paragraph 57 concluded that on a parity of reasoning an order refusing to appoint a Receiver or grant injunction and similar orders mentioned in various clauses of Order XLIII Rule 1 fall within the tests laid down by this Court of being a judgment. \n70 The Hon'ble Supreme Court noticed the contrary view as to what could be termed as a judgment and within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent. After noticing all these views, the Hon'ble Supreme Court concludes as under :\n\"78 Thus after considering the arguments of counsel for the parties on the first two limbs of the questions, our conclusions are :-\n(1) That there is no inconsistency between Section 104 read with Order 43 Rule 1 and the appeals under the Letters Patent and there is nothing to show that the Letters Patent in any way excludes or overrides the application of Section 104 read with Order 43 Rule 1 or to show that these provisions would not apply to internal appeals within the High Court. \n(2) That even if it be assumed that order 43 Rule I does not apply to Letters Patent appeals, the principles governing these provisions would COMAP40.16.doc apply by process of analogy. \n(3) That having regard to the nature of the orders contemplated in the various clauses of Order 43 Rule 1, there can be no doubt that these orders purport to decide valuable rights of the parties in ancillary proceedings even though the suit is kept alive and that these orders do possess the attributes or character of finality so as to be judgments within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent and hence, appealable to a larger Bench. \n(4) The concept of the Letters Patent governing only the internal appeals in the High Courts and the Code of Civil Procedure having no application to such appeals is based on a serious misconception of the legal position.\"\n71 In paragraph 79, the Supreme Court considered an equally important question as to whether despite its finding that section 104 read with Order XLIII Rule 1 applies to Letters Patent and all orders passed by a trial Judge under clauses (a) to (w) would be appealable to the Division Bench, there would still be a large number of orders passed by a trial Judge which may not be covered by Order XLIII Rule 1. The question then was under what circumstances orders passed by a trial Judge not COMAP40.16.doc covered by Order XLIII Rule 1 would be appealable to the Division Bench. In such cases, the import, definition and the meaning of the word 'judgment' appearing in clause 15 assumes a real significance and a new complexion because the term 'judgment' appearing in the Letters Patent does not exclude orders not falling under the various clauses of Order XLIII Rule 1. The vexed controversial question was what is the real concept and purport of the word 'judgment' used in clause 15 of the Letters Patent. The paragraphs thereafter are devoted to the consideration and examination of this question and issue and thereafter the judgments on the point have been exclusively noted, rendered by several High Courts and equally by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The nature of the orders which have been termed as judgment are then considered and what is heavily relied upon before us are the conclusions in paragraph 113. That paragraph reads as under :\n\"113 Thus, under the Code of Civil Procedure, a judgment consists of the reasons and grounds for a decree passed by a court. As a judgment constitutes the reasons for the decree it follows as a matter of course that the judgment must be a formal COMAP40.16.doc adjudication which conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy. The concept of a judgment as defined by the Code of Civil Procedure seems to be rather narrow and the limitations engrafted by sub- section (2) of section 2 cannot be physically imported into the definition of the word 'judgment' as used in clause 15 of the Letters Patent because the Letters Patent has advisedly not used the terms 'order' or 'decree' anywhere. The intention, therefore, of the givers of the Letters Patent was that the word 'judgment' should receive a much wider and more liberal interpretation than the word 'judgment' used in the Code of Civil Procedure. At the same time, it cannot be said that any order passed by a Trial Judge would amount to a judgment; otherwise there will be no end to the number of orders which would be appealable under the Letters Patent. It seems to us that the word 'judgment' has undoubtedly a concept of finality in a broader and not a narrower sense. In other words, a judgment can be of three kinds :. \n(1) A final judgment - A judgment which decides all the questions or issues in controversy so far as the Trial Judge is concerned and leaves nothing else to be decided. This would mean that by virtue of the judgment, the suit or action brought by the plaintiff is dismissed or decreed in part or in full. Such an order passed by the Trial Judge indisputably and unquestionably is a judgment within the meaning of COMAP40.16.doc the Letters Patent and even amounts to a decree so that an appeal would lie from such a judgment to a Division Bench. \n(2) A preliminary judgment - This kind of a judgment may take two forms - (a) where the Trial Judge by an order dismisses the suit without going into the merits of the suit but only on a preliminary objection raised by the defendant or the party opposing on the ground that the suit is not maintainable. Here also, as the suit is finally decided one way or the other, the order passed by the Trial Judge would be a judgment finally deciding the cause so far as the Trial Judge is concerned and therefore appealable to the larger Bench. (b) Another shape which a preliminary judgment may take is that where the Trial Judge passes an order after hearing the preliminary objections raised by the defendant relating to maintainability of the suit, e.g., bar of jurisdiction, res judicata, a manifest defect in the suit, absence of notice under Section 80 and the like, and these objections are decided by the Trial Judge against the defendant, the suit is not terminated but continues and has to be tried on merits but the order of the Trial Judge rejecting the objections doubtless adversely affects a valuable right of the defendant who, if his objections are valid, is entitled to get the suit dismissed on preliminary grounds. Thus, such an order even though it keeps the suit alive, undoubtedly decides an important aspect of the trial which affects COMAP40.16.doc a vital right of the defendant and must, therefore, be construed to be a judgment so as to be appealable to larger Bench. \n(3) Intermediary or Interlocutory judgment-Most of the interlocutory orders which contain the quality of finality are clearly specified in clauses (a) to (w) of Order 43 Rule 1 and have already been held by us to be judgments within the meaning of the Letters Patent and, therefore, appealable. There may also be interlocutory orders which are not covered by Order 43 Rule 1 but which also possess the characteristics and trappings of finality in that, the orders may adversely affect a valuable right of the party or decide an important aspect of the trial in an ancillary proceeding. Before such an order can be a judgment the adverse effect on the party concerned must be direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote. \nFor instance, where the Trial Judge in a suit under Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure refuses the defendant leave to defend the suit, the order directly affects the defendant because he loses a valuable right to defend the suit and his remedy is confined only to contest the plaintiff's case on his own evidence without being given a chance to rebut that evidence. As such an order vitally affects a valuable right of the defendant it will undoubtedly be treated as a judgment within the meaning of the Letters Patent so as to be appealable to a larger Bench. Take the converse case in a similar suit where the trial Judge COMAP40.16.doc allows the defendant to defend the suit in which case although the plaintiff is adversely affected but the damage or prejudice caused to him is not direct or immediate but of a minimal nature and rather too remote because the plaintiff still possesses his full right to show that the defence is false and succeed in the suit. Thus, such an order passed by the Trial Judge would not amount to a judgment within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent but will be purely an interlocutory order. Similarly, suppose the Trial Judge passes an Order setting aside an exparte decree against the defendant, which is not appealable under any of the clauses of Order 43 Rule 1 though an order rejecting an application to set aside the decree passed exparte falls within Order 43 Rule l clause (d) and is appealable, the serious question that arises is whether or not the order first mentioned is a judgment within the meaning of Letters Patent. The fact, however, remains that the order setting aside the ex-parte decree puts the defendant to a great advantage and works serious injustice to the plaintiff because as a consequence of the order, the plaintiff has now to contest the suit and is deprived of the fruits of the decree passed in his favour. In these circumstances, therefore, the order passed by the Trial Judge setting aside the ex parte decree vitally affects the valuable rights of the plaintiff and hence amounts to an interlocutory judgment and is therefore, appealable to a larger Bench.\"\nCOMAP40.16.doc 72 Thus, the reliance by Dr. Saraf on these paragraphs overlooks the further pertinent observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, namely, that a trial Judge may pass a number of orders whereby some of the various steps to be taken by the parties in pursuance of the suit may be of routine nature. While other orders may cause inconvenience to one party or the other and for illustration, an order refusing an adjournment, an order refusing to summon an additional witness or document, an order refusing to condone delay in filing documents after the first date of hearing, an order of costs to one of the parties for its default or an order exercising discretion in respect of a procedural nature against one party or the other. Such orders are purely interlocutory and cannot constitute judgments because it will always be open to the aggrieved party to make a grievance of the orders passed against the party concerned in the appeal against the final judgment passed by the trial Judge. Thus, all the interlocutory orders cannot be regarded as judgments, but only those orders would be judgments which decide matters of moment or affect vital and valuable rights of the parties and which work serious injustice to the party concerned. Similarly, orders passed by the trial Judge deciding question of COMAP40.16.doc admissibility or relevancy of a document also cannot be treated as judgments because the grievance on this score can be corrected by the appellate court in appeal against the final judgment. \n73 In paragraph 116, the Hon'ble Supreme Court gave instances of an interlocutory order which amounts to exercise of discretion and which may yet amount to a judgment within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent. There, the illustration of an amendment being allowed or including a cause of action or relief as a result of which a vested right of limitation accrued to the defendant is taken away and rendered nugatory. Though the order is purely discretionary and interlocutory in nature, the order contains the attributes and characteristics of finality and must be treated as a judgment within the meaning of the Letters Patent. Then, in paragraph 117, the Supreme Court deals with a case of an amendment being allowed at the instance of the plaintiff to add a particular relief or take an additional ground inconsistent with the pleas taken by him, but is not barred by limitation and does not work serious injustice to the defendant who would have ample opportunity to disprove the amended plea COMAP40.16.doc taken by the plaintiff at the trial. This would be a simple interlocutory order without containing any quality of finality and would, therefore, not be a judgment within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent. \n74 Therefore, the instances cited as illustrations, were termed as not exhaustive tests. These are then multiplied by reference to several orders which could be passed and thereafter, the Hon'ble Supreme Court concludes that the term 'judgment' as interpreted and the tests laid down for its interpretation would bring an end to the controversy. \n75 Thus, the supporting or concurring judgments in this case may be elaborating or amplifying the essential conclusions further, but what we find is that in all these concurring views what has been enumerated is that an exhaustive or comprehensive definition of 'judgment' as contemplated in clause 15 of the Letters Patent cannot be properly given and it will be wise to remember that in the Letters Patent itself there is no definition of the word 'judgment'. \nCOMAP40.16.doc 76 Dr. Saraf has argued before us that this judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court would continue to bind us irrespective of the language of sub-section (2) of section 13 whereas, by sub- section (1) of section 13, according to Mr. Kadam, what could be appealable is exhaustively set out. Mr. Kadam would submit that any person aggrieved by the decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court from the date of the judgment or order, as the case may be, and the proviso says that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by Act 4 of 2016 and 37 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. If, according to Mr. Kadam, we apply and follow what is enumerated in Shah Babual Khimji and import the tests applied and evolved for interpreting the word 'judgment', that would mean we ignore sub-section (2) of section 13 completely and introduce a right of appeal as provided in the Letters Patent of a High Court but that cannot be taken into consideration at all for the purposes of deciding as to whether the present appeal is maintainable. According to Mr. Kadam, the non obstante clause COMAP40.16.doc in sub-section (2) would denote that no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act 4 of 2016. \n77 Since Mr. Kadam has referred to the Code of Civil Procedure, we would have to refer to some of its provisions. 78 Mr. Kadam would submit that the word 'decree' is defined therein and this definition cannot be ignored for this very word has been inserted in section 13. He would submit that the word 'decree' is defined to mean not only the formal expression of an adjudication, but which so far as regards the Courts expressing it conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters and controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include in the later part, the rejection of a plaint and the determination of any question within section 144, but shall not include any adjudication from which an appeal lies as appeal from an order or any order of dismissal for default. Hence, so long as a decision is not partaking the character of a \"decree\" or \"order\" as COMAP40.16.doc defined in section 2, clause (14) of Code of Civil Procedure not restricted only to the formal expression of any decision of a civil court, but that which is not a decree, then, these definitions have a great bearing, along with section 2(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure, which defines 'judgment' to mean the statement given by the Judge on the grounds of decree or order, on the issue before us. Dr. Saraf, however, would submit that the word decree as defined includes preliminary or final and as far as a preliminary decree is concerned, he would rely on section 97 and to submit that where any party aggrieved by a preliminary decree passed after the commencement of the Code of Civil Procedure does not appeal from such decree, he shall be precluded from disputing its correctness in any appeal which may be preferred from the final decree. \n79 Dr. Saraf has gone as far as contending that the impugned order is in the nature of a preliminary decree and on the point of jurisdiction. What this argument overlooks is whether it conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit. The argument further is that because this is a ruling on jurisdiction of COMAP40.16.doc the Court insofar as the defendants / appellants are concerned, that concludes the matter in controversy inasmuch as they would have to submit to the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. 80 Even after Shah Babulal Khimji and whether every order passed is a judgment or not, in a reported decision in the case of Employer in Relation to Management of Central Mine Panning and Design Institute Ltd. vs. Union of India & anr. , a two Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court had to deal with somewhat identical issue. That decision reported in AIR 2001 SC 883 notes clause 10 of the Letters Patent of the Patna High Court which is identically worded to clause 15 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court and some other High Courts and in paragraphs 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of this judgment the Hon'ble Court analyses the same as under : \n\"10 The above analysis of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent will equally apply to Clause 10 of the Letters Patent of Patna. It follows that an appeal shall lie to a larger Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Patna from a judgment of one judge of the said High Court or one judge of any Division Court pursuant to Article 225 of the Constitution of India. The following COMAP40.16.doc categories of judgment are excluded from the appealable judgments under the first limb of Clause 10 of the Letters Patent:\n(i) a judgment passed in exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a court subject to superintendence of the said High Court in other words no letters patent appeal lies to the High Court from a judgment of one judge of the High Court passed in second appeal;\n(ii) an order made by one judge of the High Court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction; and (iii) a sentence or order passed or made in exercise of power under the provisions of Section 107 of Government of India Act, 1915 (now Article 227 of the Constitution of India) or in exercise of criminal jurisdiction.\n11 From the above discussion, it is clear that from all judgments except those falling under the excluded categories, an appeal lies to the same High Court. \n12 The next question which needs to be considered is, what does the expression 'judgment' mean? That expression is not defined in Letters Patent. It is now well-settled that definition of COMAP40.16.doc 'judgment' in Section 2(9) of Code of Civil Procedure, has no application to Letters Patent. That expression was interpreted by different High Courts of India for purposes of Letters Patent. In Asrumati Debi Vs. Kumar Rupendra Deb Raikot, 1953 SCR 1159 : (AIR 1953 SC 198) a four-Judge Bench of this Court considered the pronouncements of the High Court of Calcutta in Justices of the Peace for Calcutta Vs. Oriental Gas Co. (1872) 8 Beng. LR. 433, the High Court of Rangoon in Dayabhai Vs. Murugappa Chettiar (1935) ILR. 13 Rang. 457 : (AIR 1935 Rangoon 267), the High Court of Madras in Tuljaram Vs. Alagappa (1912) ILR. 35 Mad. 1, the High Court at Bombay in Sonebai Vs. Ahmedbhai (1872) 9 Bom. HCR 398 (FB) as also the High Court at Nagpur, the High Court at Allahabad and Lahore High Court and observed as follows:\n\"In view of this wide divergence of judicial opinion, it may be necessary for this Court at some time or other to examine carefully the principles upon which the different views mentioned above purport to be based and attempt to determine with as much definiteness as possible the true meaning and scope of the word 'judgment' as it occurs in clause 15 of the Letters Patent of the Calcutta High Court and in the corresponding clauses of the Letters Patent of the other High Courts.\" \nCOMAP40.16.doc 13 Such an exercise was undertaken by a three- Judge Bench of this Court in Shah Babulal Khimji Vs. Jayaben D. Kania 1981 (4) SCC 8 : (AIR 1981 SC 1786), Fazal Ali, J. speaking for himself and Varadarajan, J. after analysing the views of different High Courts, referred to above, observed as follows:\n\"The intention, therefore, of the givers of the Letters Patent was that the word 'judgment' should receive a much wider and more liberal interpretation than the word 'judgment' used in the Code of Civil Procedure. At the same time, it cannot be said that any order passed by a Trial Judge would amount to a judgment; otherwise there will be no end to the number of orders which would be appealable under the Letters Patent. It seems to us that the word 'judgment' has undoubtedly a concept of finality in a broader and not a narrower sense.\" \nIt was pointed out that 'judgment' could be of three kinds:\n(1) A final judgment. - in this category falls a judgment by which suit or action brought by the plaintiff is dismissed or decreed in part or full;\n(2) A preliminary judgment.- this category is sub- divided into two classes:\nCOMAP40.16.doc (a) where the Trial Judge by an order dismisses the suit, without going into the merits of the suit, only on a preliminary objection raised by the defendant/respondent on the ground of maintainability; \n(b) where maintainability of the suit is objected on the ground of bar of jurisdiction, e.g., res judicata, a manifest defect in the suit, absence of notice under Section 80 and the like; and (3) Intermediary or interlocutory judgment.- in this category fall orders referred to in clauses (a) to (w) of Order 43 Rule 1 and also such other orders which possess the characteristic and trappings of finality and may adversely affect a valuable right of the party or decide an important aspect of the trial in an ancillary proceeding. \nElucidating the third category, it is observed:\n\"Every interlocutory order cannot be regarded as a judgment but only those orders would be judgments which decide matters of moment or affect vital and valuable rights of the parties and which work serious injustice to the party concerned.\"\n14 In the instant case, we are concerned with the last mentioned category. From the above COMAP40.16.doc discussion, it follows that to determine the question whether an interlocutory order passed by one judge of a High Court falls within the meaning of 'judgment' for purposes of Letters Patent the test is : whether the order is a final determination affecting vital and valuable rights and obligations of the parties concerned. This has to be ascertained on the facts of each case.\"\n81 Thus, the Hon'ble Supreme Court concludes that the word 'judgment' is not defined in the Letters Patent and the definition of 'judgment' in section 2(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure has no application to the Letters Patent. Thereafter, it refers to Shah Babulal Khimji and lays down the relevant test. Thus, to determine the question whether an interlocutory order passed by one Judge of High Court falls within the meaning of judgment for purposes of Letters Patent must be determined by the test whether that order is a final determination affecting vital and valuable rights and obligations of the parties and which causes serious injustice to the parties concerned. However, this has to been ascertained on the facts of each case. 82 Precisely this is what the Division Bench in Hubtown COMAP40.16.doc also held. It may have not referred to the very provisions, but eventually the reference to the same was in the context of consideration of issue of maintainability of the appeal. The issue arose from the order under appeal in that case. The order under appeal in that case was that of a conditional leave to defend a summary suit. In the very scheme of Order XXXVII such an order is contemplated. So long as there is a leave to defend, the summary suit cannot be defended and such leave can be conditional or unconditional. If that leave is granted conditionally so long as these conditions are not complied with, there is no right to defend. The suit then cannot be defended by the defendant. If these conditions were styled as onerous or excessive or the discretion in imposition of the same is labelled as arbitrary or capricious taking away a valuable right, then, the appeal is held to be maintainable. That is irrespective of whether section 13 and the decision contemplated as far as sub-section (1) is concerned together with its proviso circumscribes or restricts the right of appeal and by sub-section (2) exhausts it. Therefore, assuming that the non obstante clause is there, what the Division Bench holds is that the decision to be appealable or not must meet the test of being a judgment and the word 'judgment' must be COMAP40.16.doc construed in the light of the further test laid down in the Supreme Court judgment. Hence, if there is an adjudication conclusively determining the rights of the parties to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit, whether the order is deciding matters of moment which works serious injustice to the party concerned was left to be decided on a case to case basis. In Smt. Sushila Singhania, however, the Division Bench had to rule upon the maintainability of the appeal and which appeal challenged an order during the course of the execution proceedings. By their very nature, the proceedings were of execution and the award of the arbitrator could have been executed in terms of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, as if it were a decree of the court. The scheme of the Code of Civil Procedure and the adjudication of rights contemplated thereby was, therefore, extremely relevant for deciding the maintainability of the appeal. The right to appeal could not be claimed and that is how it was claimed even in matters of execution or enforcement of the award of the arbitrator as if it were a decree of a civil court. It is in the backdrop of all this that the Court ruled that the appeal would not be maintainable and held it to be incompetent. \nCOMAP40.16.doc 83 We do not think that we must answer the larger question posed for our consideration and particularly whether there is any conflict in the two views. Even if one were to assume that Dr. Saraf can rely upon the view taken in Hubtown's case and also some of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure like section 97, what we feel is that the impugned order does not conclude the issue of jurisdiction, in the sense it is not to the detriment of the defendants. If the court holds that it has territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit it may as well proceed to dismiss it on merits. If the suit is decreed, then, against such a final decree an appeal is always competent and maintainable within the meaning of sub-section (1) of section 13. In such an appeal, the ground of this Court's territorial jurisdiction can very well be raised. The salutary purpose and which is served by ensuring expeditious disposal of commercial suits can be harmonized, therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the present case by holding that the order under challenge is not of a conclusive nature going by the tests laid down above. What we have seen and for that purpose is even in the Code of Civil Procedure, a provision like section 105 has been enacted. That follows section 104 which enumerates the COMAP40.16.doc order from which the appeal lies and in section 105, which opens with the words \"Save as otherwise expressly provided, no appeal shall lie from any order made by a court in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction, but where a decree is appealed from, any error, defect or irregularity in any order, affecting the decision of the case, may be set forth as a ground of objection in the memorandum of appeal. Then, by sub-section (2) it says that where any party aggrieved by an order of remand from which an appeal lies does not appeal therefrom, he shall thereafter be precluded from disputing its correctness. Outlining the ambit and scope of his power, a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Shiv Shakti Cooperative Housing Society vs. Swaraj Developer reported in AIR 2003 SC 2434 notes that it relates to appealable as well as non appealable orders. The section contemplates two things (1) regular appeal from decree and (2) the provision relating to grant of objection relating to interim order. Thus, in an appeal in terms of section 96 having regard to section 105, it is also permissible for an appellant to raise a contention as regards correctness or otherwise of an interlocutory order passed in the suit subject to the conditions laid down therein. In paragraph 31 of this judgment, the Hon'ble COMAP40.16.doc Supreme Court held thus :\n\"31. In Section 2, the expressions 'decree' and 'order' have been defined in clauses (2) and (14) respectively. It is to be noted that it matters little that the judgment is styled as an \"order\". If, in fact, it fulfills the conditions of the definition under Section 2(2), it is a decree and becomes appealable. Orders that are not appealable are, generally speaking, those which are procussual i.e. interlocutory or incidental orders regulating proceedings but not deciding any of the matters of controversy in the suit. Order 43 deals with the \"appeals from orders\". These appeals lie under Section 104 of the Code. The said Section deals with appeals from orders and specifies the orders from which appeals can lie. Sub-sec. (2) of S. 104 says that no appeal shall lie from any order passed in appeal under the said Section. Section 104 and Order 43 Rule I contain a full list of appealable orders. An order which amounts to a decree within S. 2(2) does not fall within S. 104 and the only applicable section is section 96. Clauses (a) to (f) of S. 104 were omitted by Arbitration Act 1940. Section 105 relates to other orders. It, inter alia , relates to any order i.e. so appealable as well as non-appelable orders. It is in the nature of a prohibition stipulating that save as otherwise expressly provided, no appeal shall lie from any order made by a Court in exercise of original or appellate jurisdiction; but where a decree is appealed COMAP40.16.doc from, any error, defect or irregularity in any order, affecting the decision of the case, may be set forth as a ground of objection in the memorandum of appeal. Sub-sec. (2) deals with case of remand. This section, in fact, contemplates two things i.e. (1) regular appeal from decree; and (2) the provision relating to grant of objection relating to interim order. Order 43 Rule 1 is an integral part of S. 104.\" \n84 Even otherwise, in the larger interest of judicial discipline and certainty, we have carefully perused the two judgments, one in Hubtown and another in Smt. Sushila Singhania. \n85 As we have already held above, Hubtown was an appeal arising from an order passed by the learned single Judge granting conditional leave to defend a Summary Suit. The Hon'ble Division Bench deciding Hubtown also had before it a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Midnapore Peoples' Co-op. Bank Ltd. & Ors. vs. Chunilal Nanda & Ors. reported in AIR 2006 SC 2190. After referring to the Act 4 of 2016, and particularly Summary Suits and unamended Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the Court proceeded to consider the COMAP40.16.doc scheme of Commercial Courts Act in paragraphs 15, 16 and 17. Then, in paragraph 20, the Division Bench in Hubtown analysed section 13 and concluded that appeals will lie to Commercial Appellate Division against the decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division. With greatest respect, though the Division Bench referred to section 13(1) of the Act 4 of 2016, that provides for an appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court against the decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division of a High Court by any person aggrieved. That is how the Division Bench in Hubtown concluded that these words, namely, 'decision', 'judgment', 'order', 'decree' as such are not defined. Some of them are defined and elaborated in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The observations in paragraph 21 would indicate that the Division Bench held that the language of section 13(1) is such that it includes judgment or order and read with sections 8, 13(2), it includes decree of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division. Then, in the proviso below sub-section (1) of section 13, it is stated that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by the Act 4 of 2016 and COMAP40.16.doc section 37 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. Thus, it is apparent that the difference between the language in sub-section (1) and that of the proviso was very much present to the mind of both Division Benches deciding Hubtown and Smt. Sushila Singhania. Their understanding of section 13(2) was that other than the Act 4 of 2016, insofar as the matters covered by that enactment are concerned, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court, otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of Act 4 of 2016. The Division Bench in Hubtown, therefore, concluded that where the Commercial Division has taken a decision and/or passed the judgment and/or order or decree, an appeal will lie. That is how paragraph 22 in Hubtown reads. In paragraph 23, the Division Bench says that appeal against any final decision, including judgment by the Commercial Court and/or Commercial Division will not invite the proviso as the proviso refers to orders. The reference to orders in the opening portion of sub-section (1) of section 13 would relate to the application of the proviso to sub- section (1). However, the opening portion of sub-section (1) (words prior to the proviso) uses the words 'decision', 'judgment' and 'order'. This part of the provision is quite broad when it COMAP40.16.doc comes to appeal arising out of the orders other than the categories of orders falling under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Thus, so long as it is an order, but which has a tinge or colour of judgment, then, an appeal under section 13(1) would be maintainable. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (amended and unamended) are applicable to Commercial Courts Act proceedings. The term 'judgment' was not defined even in the Letters Patent. Therefore, even if it is an interlocutory order of granting defendants conditional leave to defend a Summary Suit as it directly affects and loses the valuable right of the defendant without giving full opportunity, that order is appealable. It is a judgment. \n86 In Smt. Sushila Singhania the Division Bench framed the questions for consideration in paragraph 23 and in questions 2, 3 and 4, the issue of maintainability of appeals under section 13 of the Act 4 of 2016 was summed up. The discussion in that regard starts from paragraph 30 and the Division Bench concludes that there is no separate provision of appeal against execution of an Award passed in Arbitration proceedings and, therefore, the word 'decision' will have to be dealt with COMAP40.16.doc accordingly. That is because in section 37 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, which sets out that orders against the appeals can be filed, it was noticed that no appeal has been provided against an order passed in execution proceedings. Then, the Division Bench proceeded to consider the doctrine of precedents and from paragraph 53, it discussed the ambit and scope of an appeal which can be filed under section 13(1) from the orders which are passed in proceedings for execution of an award. That is how section 13 was interpreted and it was held that the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 13 cannot be said to be an additional enactment providing for an appeal against the orders, but it restricts the orders against which appeals can be filed. The interpretation sought to be placed by the appellants on the provision was rejected because it was held that it would be contrary to section 37 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and to the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. That is how the provision came to be interpreted. The Court, therefore, rejected the argument that it is not possible to read something more in the word 'decision' to mean that it also includes orders which are not otherwise appealable. It is in that context the Hon'ble Division Bench in Smt. Sushila Singhania concluded that COMAP40.16.doc restricted meaning has to be assigned to the word 'judgment' appearing in section 13 (1) and it will not be possible to expand the meaning of this word as has been done in the Letters Patent by virtue of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra). However, all the observations made from paragraphs 56 onwards relate to the facts and when the arbitral proceedings had concluded, the Award was brought for execution, the orders passed in such proceedings were held not to be appealable in the light of the specific provisions of section 37 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, which is referred to in sub-section (1) of section 13 proviso. Hence, the aid and assistance of Letters Patent was not allowed to be taken. More so, when it is overridden by sub- section (1) of section 13. Our conclusion is supported by the observations in paragraph 70 of Smt. Sushila Singhania. We have also perused the further paragraphs, namely, paragraphs 72 and 73. The word 'decision' will have to be read only as a decree or wider meaning has to be given to that term or word was then considered and then, certain Supreme Court judgments are referred in paragraphs 73, 75, 76 and 77. The Hon'ble Division Bench then concluded that the word 'decision' in this context COMAP40.16.doc would mean a final decision in the entire suit and, therefore, a decree. The construction as proposed by the appellant in that case based on the dictionary meaning of this word was expressly rejected. Finally, in paragraph 93, it was concluded that the word 'decision', therefore, will have to be interpreted to mean a decree. 87 Then, the answers to each of the questions framed, in paragraph 102, have also been perused by us. 88 In whichever way one looks at this issue, we are not able to agree with Dr. Saraf that there is any divergence or difference in the opinion on what is appealable, irrespective of the nomenclature under section 13(1) of the Act 4 of 2016 for what both judgments hold, according to us, are that the term 'decision' cannot be interpreted to mean any and every order by styling it as a judgment. It is that decision, which satisfies the tests referred by us above and which tests can also be culled out from the definition of the term 'decree' as appearing in section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, which would be appealable. Thus, decree means the formal expression of an adjudication but sub- section (2) of section 2 does not stop here and says further that COMAP40.16.doc which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final , it shall be deemed to include what falls in the latter part of this definition and exclude what is excluded by clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (2) of section 2. Then, the definition ends with an explanation and says that a decree is preliminary when further proceedings have to be taken before the suit can be completely disposed of. It is final when such adjudication completely disposes of the suit and it may be partly preliminary and partly final. That which is not a decree is an order and it is apparent from the definition of this word appearing in section 2 sub-section (14) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Therefore, we do not think that there is a difference or divergence in the opinion of the two Division Benches on the right of appeal, its maintainability or the ambit and scope of that power as enumerated in section 13(1) of the Act 4 of 2016. Our conclusions are also reinforced by the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on the ambit and scope of the word \"appeal\" and the power in relation thereto. Suffice it to say that all these judgments have not been noticed by either the counsel COMAP40.16.doc appearing before us or the Hon'ble Division Benches deciding \"Hubtown\" and \"Sushila\"'.\n89 In the case of Mithailal Dalsangar Singh & Ors. vs. Annabai Devram Kini & Ors. (2003) 10 SCC 691 : AIR 2003 SC 4244, the Hon'ble Supreme Court though considering the expression 'judgment' appearing in clause 15 of the Letters Patent made some pertinent observations. Paragraphs 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of this judgment read as under :\n\"12 We are also of the opinion that the Letters Patent appeal against the order setting aside the abatement of the suit was not maintainable. What is a 'judgment' within the meaning of Letters Patent came up for the consideration of this court in Shah Babu Lal Khimji vs. Behan D. Kangro AIR 1981 SC 1786. It was held that a decision by a trial judge on a controversy which affects valuable rights of one of the parties is a 'judgment'. However, an interlocutory order cannot be regarded as a judgment but only those orders would be judgments which decide matters of moment or affect vital and valuable rights of the parties, and which work serious injustice to the party concerned. This court further held that there is no inconsistency between Section 104 read with Order 43 Rule 1 of the COMAP40.16.doc CPC and the appeals under the Letters Patent. The Letters Patent do not exclude or override the application of Section 104 read with Order 43 Rule 1 CPC to internal appeals within the High Court. Even if it is assumed that Order 43 Rule 1 does not apply to Letters Patent appeals yet the principles governing those provisions would apply by a process of analogy. A perusal of Section 104 read with Rule 1 of Order 43 of the CPC shows that while an appeal is provided against an order refusing to set aside the abatement or dismissal of a suit; there is no appeal provided against an order whereby the abatement or dismissal of a suit has been set aside. Whether the trial judge passed an order setting aside an abatement or allowed substitution of the legal representatives, no valuable right of parties was decided. The constitution of the suit was rendered good and the suit proceeded ahead for being tried on merits. Such an order does not amount to 'judgment' within the meaning of Letters Patent. [Underlining ours] 13 The learned counsel for the appellant has invited attention of the Court to the Full Bench decision of the Calcutta High Court in Nurul Hoda and Ors. vs. Amir Hasan and Anr. AIR 1972 Cal 449 and the Division Bench decisions of the Punjab High Court in Smt. Chando Devi vs. Municipal Committee, Delhi AIR 1961 Punjab 424 and of the Bombay High Court in Maria Flaviana Almeida and Ors. vs. Ramchandra Santuram Asavie and Ors., AIR 1938 Bombay 408.\nCOMAP40.16.doc 14 In Nurul Hoda & Ors. (supra), Sabyasachi Mukharji, J. (as His Lordship then was), speaking for the Full Bench, held that a decision setting aside an abatement does not in any way effect any right accrued to the defendant and, therefore, does not amount to a 'judgment'. No merits, in controversy between the parties, have been decided; the order merely reopens the controversy. \n15 A Division Bench of the Punjab High Court, consisting of D. Falshaw and G.L. Chopra, JJ., in Smt. Chando Devi's case (supra) has held that the order setting aside the abatement of a suit or appeal is not a decision which affects the merits of the question between the parties by determining some right or liability in the suit. Such an order cannot be regarded as a deciding a question materially in issue between the parties and directly affecting the subject matter of the suit and, therefore, it would not amount to a 'judgment'. \n16 In Maria Flaviana Almeida & Ors.'s case (supra), Chief Justice Beaumont speaking for the Division Bench observed that an order setting aside an abatement is really one in procedure. The party originally had a cause of action which through no fault of their own came to an end by the death of their opponent and the effect of setting aside the abatement is merely to excuse delay in restoring the suit to an COMAP40.16.doc actionable condition. The Division Bench held that the order setting aside an abatement does not effect the merits of the dispute between the parties though it certainly determines a right and, therefore, does not amount to a 'judgment'.\"\n90 This judgment has been cited and relied upon in several cases and matters later on by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The distinguishing part in the subsequent judgments or decisions is not on the meaning of the term 'judgment'. There is one judgment which must be referred in this context and that is Bhag Mal alias Ram Bux & Ors. vs. Munshi by LRs & Ors. (2007) 11 SCC 285. In this judgment, it is stated that decision on merits is not the only test to determine the finality of the same. In another judgment on the meaning of the term 'judgment', in the case of Midnapore Peoples' Co-op. Bank Ltd. & Ors. vs. Chunilal Nanda & Ors. (2006) 5 SCC 399 : AIR 2006 SC 2190 , the expression has been considered and given a meaning as ascribed by the Division Bench in Hubtown. \n91 Then, we have a judgment by a three Judge Bench in the case of Subal Paul vs Malina Paul AIR 2003 SC 1928 : (2003) COMAP40.16.doc 10 SCC 361, which has also been later on followed. It has been followed in the case of Liverpool & London S.P. & I Association Ltd. vs. M.V. Sea Success 1 & Anr. (2004) 9 SCC 512 . We have also a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court's five-Bench judgment in the case of P.S. Sathappan vs. Andhra Bank Limited & Ors. (2004) 11 SCC 672. In all these cases, the expression 'judgment' has been, not just in the context of clause 15 of the Letters Patent, but even otherwise understood to mean something which gives finality or which satisfies the tests laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as noted above. 92 Similarly, we must also note sub-section (1) of section 13 of the Act 4 of 2016, which provides for an appeal by a \"person aggrieved\". In the case of Banarasi & Ors. vs. Ram Phal AIR 2003 SC 1989, this expression was interpreted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the context of sections 96 and 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Section 96, as is evident, provides for an appeal from an original decree and section 100 provides for second appeal. In paragraph 8 of this judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:\n\"8 Sections 96 and 100 of the CPC make COMAP40.16.doc provision for an appeal being preferred from every original decree or from every decree passed in appeal respectively; none of the provisions enumerates the person who can file an appeal. However, it is settled by a long catena of decisions that to be entitled to file an appeal the person must be one aggrieved by the decree. Unless a person is prejudicially or adversely affected by the decree he is not entitled to file an appeal. See Phoolchand and another v. Gopal Lal 1967 (3) SCR 153; Smt. Jatan Kanwar Golcha v. M/s. Golcha Properties (P) Ltd., 1970 (3) SCC 573; Smt. Ganga Bai v. Vijay Kumar and others., (1974) 2 SCC 393. No appeal lies against a mere finding. It is significant to note that both Sections 96 and 100 of the CPC provide for an appeal against decree and not against judgment.\" \n93 Even this view has been relied upon in later judgments and we would refer to the judgment in the case of Hardevinder Singh vs. Paramjit Singh & Ors. (2013) 9 SCC 261 . Thus, even if the word 'decision' is taken to be a decree, the provisions enabling filing of an appeal and worded like sub- section (1) of section 13 do not enumerate the categories of persons who can file an appeal. The significant words and expressions appearing in section 13(1) and its proviso are \" Any person aggrieved by the decision may appeal ... ... ... from the date COMAP40.16.doc of judgment or order, as the case may be \" and \"An appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a ... ... ... that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the CPC as amended by this Act ... ... ...\". The intent of the legislature is obvious and in the first part of sub-section (1) it employs the words \" a person aggrieved by the decision may appeal from the date of judgment or order \" to convey that the remedy of appeal may be resorted to, but that will not be available as of right and whenever that remedy can be availed of as of right, the words and expressions used in the proviso convey the same clearly. Then by sub-section (2) it is stated that no right of appeal is provided otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Act 4 of 2016. The persons prejudiced or affected by a decision can maintain an appeal but whether that should be entertained or not depends upon the nature and effect of that which is appealed against. Whether a decision is appealable or not depends upon the facts and circumstances in each case. Once this vital distinction is borne in mind and so viewed, there is no scope for accepting the argument of Dr. Saraf in the case before us that though an objection to the territorial jurisdiction of this Court has been overruled, that order or the reasoning overruling this objection is COMAP40.16.doc of the nature enabling the appellant to file an appeal. Neither of the Division Bench judgments enable filing of an appeal against such an order. \n94 We are, therefore, of the firm view that in the facts and circumstances of this case, considering the nature of the order under appeal even if we go by the view taken in Hubtown's case as also the relevant paragraphs in the case of Smt. Sushila Singhania, the test would be whether the same concludes the rights of the parties. That has not concluded the rights, but it has merely overruled an objection to the territorial jurisdiction of this Court raised as a preliminary one by the defendants. The defendant, in the event aggrieved by the final decree, can always, in one of the grounds of appeal, raise the issue of correctness of this order as well. For that purpose, we need not entertain this appeal and prolong the trial. We have noted that the object and purpose of the Act 4 of 2016 was present to the minds of both Division Benches and to ensure expeditious disposal of the suits and applications involving a commercial dispute, the Parliament had enacted a scheme. We would be defeating and frustrating it wholly in the event we hold that an order of the present nature COMAP40.16.doc and impugned in this appeal is an appealable one under sub- section (1) of section 13. Therefore, upholding the preliminary objection of Mr. Kadam, we dismiss all these appeals. 95 At this stage Dr. Saraf and Mr. Kirpekar would submit that the appellants would like to challenge this order in a higher court and therefore, the Notice of Motion seeking interim relief should not be heard for a period of eight weeks. 96 Mr. Rohan Kadam appearing for the plaintiff- respondents opposes this request of Dr. Saraf by urging that now that this Court has dismissed the appeal, and, therefore, after a success, the plaintiff should be allowed to apply for interim relief. 97 The application for interim relief has been pending for more than three years. \n98 In the light of the fact that we have applied the tests laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and which tests have been extensively referred in the two Division Bench judgments, we do not think that we should accede to the request of Dr. Saraf COMAP40.16.doc for that would defeat the mandate of Act 4 of 2016 in ensuring expeditious disposal of the suits and applications in commercial disputes. Hence the request is refused. \nPRAKASH D. NAIK, J. S.C. DHARMADHIKARI, J.",

and to further restrain the 2nd respondent from honouring/encashing the schedule bank guarantees at the request of the 1st respondent. in the petition filed by them under section 9 of the 1996 act, the appellant had stated that they had entered into various contracts in respect of the design, engineering, procurement, supply, assembly, construction, erection, mechanical completion, pre-commissioning, commissioning and full performance testing of a pulverized coal fired power plant consisting of 2 x 660 mw supercritical boiler based plant with ncc power projects limited, and a consortium of china national technical i & e corporation and tianjin electric power construction company (ctc for short); the equity stake of the first respondent-ncc power projects limited was acquired by sembcorp utilities pte ltd, consequent to which its name was changed to sembcorp gayatri power limited; the 1st respondent was the owner of the project, the petitioner had to execute the work, and ctc had to supply the material to be used for execution of the project; seven independent contracts, in epc mode, were entered into between the petitioner and the 1st respondent to facilitate the aforementioned project along with their amendments; the scope of the co-ordination agreement, entered into between the parties, was to co-ordinate and administer all the other six contracts; the supply contract agreement (fob) was entered into between the parties thereto, as the 1st respondent wanted ctc to supply the material; the appellant was required to execute the work using the supplies made by ctc which was approved as the supplier by the 1st respondent; the appellant was not given the choice to change the supplier, even though there were delays in supplies; the 1st respondent and the appellant had entered into an on-shore service contract dated 10.04.2011 to provide certain construction works for the purpose of the projects; the scheduled completion date of unit-1 and unit-2 had to be achieved, ordinarily, within 42 months and 45 months, from the date of issuance of notice to proceed, respectively; under the coordination agreement, ordinarily, the provisional acceptance test, for unit-1 and unit-2, should have been achieved, and duly completed, by 10.11.2015 (inclusive of a 3 month grace period from 10.08.2015) and 10.02.2016 (inclusive of a 3 month grace period from 10.11.2015), respectively; all these time-lines were necessarily subject to the equipment being supplied on time by the approved supplier; provisional acceptance was achieved for unit-1 on 26.05.2016, and for unit-2 on 18.02.2017; the reason, behind the delay in achieving provisional acceptance, was attributable to the 1st respondent and ctc; some of the delays, in achieving provisional acceptance, were not only due to the delays in supply by ctc, but also because design coal was not provided by the 1st respondent itself; even till date, the 1st respondent has not been able to provide the specific type of coal required for conducting performance guarantee tests; the 1st respondents inability, to procure the required type of coal, was the only reason for noncompletion of the performance guarantee tests; the 1st respondent has been commercially operating unit-1 from 15.11.2016, and unit-2 from 18.02.2017, using coal (other than the design coal); they have been selling electricity commercially; and, on the other hand, the 1st respondent had implied, in the impugned letter, that the units would not be treated as having been completed. the appellant further stated that, according to the clauses of the on-shore service contract, they were entitled for extension of time to finish the project, since the reasons for the delay were not attributable to them, and were beyond their control; the reasons for the delay had been communicated to the 1st respondent regularly through various e-mails, correspondence, mprs, in the meetings, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; the appellant had repeatedly sought extension of time, as the delay was either attributable to the 1st respondent or to ctc which would entitle the appellant for extension of time as per the contract; however, the same had been arbitrarily denied by the 1st respondent, despite admitting that the delay was because of belated supplies from ctc; the delays, on the part of ctc, may also be due to the default of the 1st respondent itself, which had to open a letter of credit for supplies to be made; the agreed contract price, of the on shore service contract agreement, was rs.85,00,00,000/-; the appellant had furnished two bank guarantees of the state bank of india in favour of the 1st respondent as performance bank guarantees for rs.4,25,00,000/each on 27.09.2014; both these bank guarantees were extended upto 31.03.2017; the appellant had finished all its obligations under the contract without any delay from its side; the 1st respondent had also made payment to the appellant for the work done, in the period beyond the schedule completion date, without extending the time formally which the appellant was otherwise entitled to; all payments were not received, by the appellant from the 1st respondent, for the work done by them; the 1st respondent is, admittedly, due to the appellant a sum of rs.300 crores in all contracts (excluding its claim for price escalation); in continuation of their previous request, the appellant requested the 1st respondent on 02.01.2017 to grant interim extension of time beyond 10.11.2015 upto 27.11.2016 for unit-1, and beyond 10.02.2016 upto 31.03.2017 for unit-2, along with the additional costs incurred by the appellant as the delays had occurred due to the 1st respondent and ctc; when they started demanding payment of their dues, formal extension of time (caused due to delay not attributable to them), and price escalation, the first respondent, as a counter-blast and an after thought, arbitrarily sought liquidated damages from the appellant vide letter dated 23.02.2017 for an aggregate sum of rs.8.5 crores under the onshore service contract agreement for the alleged delay, of 471 days for unit-1 and 379 days for unit-2, in achieving provisional acceptance; the appellant and the 1st respondent had agreed, in the co-ordination agreement, that the appellant would not be held liable for delay or liquidated damages caused due to the failure of ctc to supply material in accordance with the terms and conditions of the supply fob agreement; the 1st respondent itself wrote a letter to ctc informing them that there was a delay of 555 days for completion of unit-1 and 495 days for unit-2, which had occurred because of them; a copy of the said letter was also marked to the appellant which showed that, according to the first respondent itself, the delay was due to ctc, and not the appellant; the 1st respondent had levied liquidated damages of usd 40,978.312 on ctc to be paid on or before 09.03.2017, failing which the same would be set off by the 1st respondent against payments required to be made to ctc; the 1st respondent was trying to unjustly enrich itself levying liquidated damages on the appellant, though the delay was on the part of the supplier; the first respondent was threatening to encash the bank guarantees furnished by the appellant; and this was clearly fraudulent, and contrary to the purpose for which the bank guarantees were submitted. in their petition, the appellant had stated that, in view of the categorical admission of the 1st respondent in their letter dated 23.02.2017, that the delay was due to ctc, levy of liquidated damages on the appellant, for the delay caused by the 1st respondent itself and ctc, was contrary to the provisions of the on shore service contract agreement and the co-ordination agreement; the onus on the appellant to prove delay on the part of ctc, had also been discharged by the categorical admission of the 1st respondent; the appellant had, time and again, informed the first respondent that the delay in completion of the project was attributable solely to the supplier and the 1st respondent; no party can be a judge in its own cause, and the 1st respondent was not permitted under law to unilaterally decide the issue of damages in its favour; if they had a claim for damages, they should approach the competent judicial authority for adjudication of the dispute; the 1st respondent is, admittedly, due around rs.300 crores to the appellant for the works done by them in all the contracts; they also have bank guarantees of around rs.300 crores which include the aforesaid bank guarantees of rs.149 crores; the 1st respondent has admitted having sent a notice to ctc levying liquidated damages for the delay caused by them; the 1st respondent is committing fraud, and is illegally levying liquidated damages of rs.8.5 crores under the on-shore services contract agreement on the appellant, and is threatening to set off the said amount against payments to be made to them; the 1st respondent is also fraudulently seeking to encash the bank guarantees given by the appellant; the court can grant an injunction restraining invocation of bank guarantee, if a prima-facie case of either (i) fraud, or (ii) irretrievable injustice, or (iii) such invocation not being in terms of the bank guarantee, or (iv) if special equities are made out; and as the petitioner has, prima-facie, showed that all these conditions exist, they are entitled to the relief sought for. on fraud, the appellant pleaded that the 1st respondent had, itself, written a letter to ctc informing them that there was a delay in supplies; yet they were seeking to extract money from the appellant; these factors clearly establish that the bank guarantees have been obtained by the 1st respondent by fraud in order to encash the same arbitrarily, illegally and to gain wrongfully at the cost of the appellant. with regards special equities, the appellant stated that they would suffer irretrievable injustice if injunction, against the coercive measures including encashing the bank guarantees, was not granted; special equities were also in favour of the appellant as the 1st respondent was owned and operated by a singapore based entity sembcorp utilities pte ltd, and the 1st respondent had no other assets in india; even if the appellant were to succeed in the main dispute by way of arbitration, they would not be able to recover the money illegally obtained on encashment of the bank guarantees; the project itself was given as security to the banks for the loans extended by them to the 1st respondent; a successful result in the arbitral proceedings would be futile, causing irreparable loss and damage to the appellant, its promoters, shareholders, stake holders and lenders; and it would also have an adverse effect on their employees and their family members. the appellant would further state that the on shore services contract agreement, and the co-ordination agreement, provide for adjudication of disputes by way of arbitration; since no amicable settlement had been reached between the parties, they intended to invoke the arbitration clause against the 1st respondent; the illegal coercive steps by the 1st respondent as threatened, including fraudulent encashment of the bank guarantees, was imminent; if stay of all coercive steps, including encashment of the bank guarantees, was not granted, the appellant would suffer irretrievable loss and injury; it would also frustrate all further legal remedies available to the appellant; if, on the other hand, injunction is granted, no irreparable loss would be caused to the 1st respondent as the appellants monies are, admittedly, lying with the 1st respondent, besides the bank guarantees of about rs.400 crores, which would adequately safeguard the interest of the 1st respondent if it succeeds in the arbitral proceedings; even on merits, the claim of the 1st respondent was baseless and concocted; and as special equities are in their favour, the appellants are entitled for an order of injunction. in the counter-affidavit, filed on behalf of the 1st respondent, it is stated that the bank guarantee is a complete and a separate contract; courts would not interfere with the enforcement of a bank guarantee where such enforcement is in terms of the bank guarantee itself which show that it is an on demand bank guarantee, and unconditional and irrevocable; the appellant has not even contended otherwise; except for a vague allegation of fraud, the appellant has not placed any material on record to substantiate its allegations; bald assertion of fraud, made solely with a view to obtain an order of injunction, would not suffice; and, in the absence of established fraud, the court would not grant an injunction restraining encashment of the bank guarantees. it is further stated that the petitioner had made false averments in order to obtain an order of injunction; in its e-mail dated 18.11.2016, the appellant has admitted that the slow pace of commissioning activities on unit-ii was likely to further delay the provisional acceptance test; admittedly, as on 18.11.2016, provisional acceptance of unit-ii had not been achieved; in their letter dated 02.01.2017, the appellant admitted that provisional acceptance test was likely to be achieved by 31.03.2017; tripartite discussions were held on 22.02.2017 between the appellant, ctc and the first respondent to decide on the action plan to proceed with regards the provisional acceptance test of unit-1; these documents show that provisional acceptance of units-i and ii has not been achieved till then, and the appellant has lied on oath; till provisional acceptance test of units-i and ii are successfully conducted by the appellant, there is nothing due for payment by the 1st respondent in lieu of which the bank guarantees are sought to be injuncted; under the epc contracts, the appellant was required to undertake the works in such a manner that the scheduled completion date of units-i and ii would be achieved within 42 months and 45 months, from the date of issuance of notice to proceed, respectively; under the co-ordination agreement, the provisional acceptance test for unit-i and unit-ii was required to have been achieved, and duly completed, by 10.11.2015 (inclusive of a three month grace period from 10.08.2015) and 10.02.2016 (inclusive of a three month grace period from 10.11.2015), respectively; it was agreed, among the parties, that time would be of essence for delivery of the equipment, and completion of works, under the epc contract; they had requested the appellant to perform its obligations including expediting works to meet the completion schedule; because of the delay, in achieving provisional acceptance and final acceptance for units-i and ii, the 1st respondent incurred significant losses including in relation to payment of interest during construction to its lenders, cost overruns, overruns above the project cost, payment of penalty to power grid corporation of india limited due to delay in evacuation of power, etc; and such losses were of a value exceeding the preestimated liquidated damages provided under the epc contract and other contracts. after referring to clauses 2.3 and 2.4 of the co-ordination agreement, it is stated, on behalf of the first respondent, that the contractual obligations of the appellant, under the co-ordination agreement, are much wider than merely facilitating co-ordination between the 1st respondent, ctc, and other sub-contractors or sub-suppliers; the first respondent issued notice dated 23.02.2017 seeking liquidated damages of rs.134 crores under the civil and construction works contract; rs.145.75 crores under the supply (ex-works) contract; 9.04 million usd under the supply (c&f) contract; and rs.8.5 crores under the on-shore services contract; as the appellant failed to comply with the request for payment, the 1st respondent became entitled to encash the bank guarantees in lieu of the liquidated damages for the delay; and, because of the delay caused by the appellant, the 1st respondent had already suffered irretrievable losses in terms of reputation and business. it is further stated that the liquidated damages claimed from the parties, i.e. the appellant and ctc, became due on account of the delay caused in performing different obligations under different agreements; both the claims were independent of each other, and could be invoked simultaneously without prejudice to one another; the appellant became liable to pay liquidated damages to the 1st respondent under the nccl-epc contracts, and the co-ordination agreement, for failure to complete the works under nccl-epc contracts, and for failure to achieve provisional acceptance for units-i and ii till date; the liquidated damages were claimed from ctc for the delay caused by them in delivering equipment under the supply fob contract; this would not curtail the 1st respondents right to claim liquidated damages from the appellant for its failure to achieve provisional acceptance for unit-i by 10.11.2015, and for unit-ii by 10.02.2016, under the nccl-epc contracts; the claims were separate and mutually exclusive; the 1st respondent had the right to claim liquidated damages against both the parties concurrently; in terms of clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of the coordination agreement, the appellant was barred from claiming exclusion from liability for any delay liquidated damages and/or for the delay, in completion of the provisional acceptance test for units-i and ii, attributable to them; and therefore the appellants contention that the liquidated damages could not be levied on them for the delay caused by the 1st respondent, and its supplier-ctc, did not merit acceptance. the 1st respondent denied that the reasons, behind the delay in achieving provisional acceptance, were due to the delay in supplies by ctc, and because the 1st respondent did not provide the designed coal. it is also denied that they were not able to provide the specified type of coal till date. it is stated that the appellant has neither furnished details of the design coal that was to be used by the 1st respondent in terms of any agreed technical specification, nor have they explained how the actual coal, being used by the 1st respondent, did not match the design coal; the appellant had also failed to explain how the alleged non-usage of design coal had adversely affected the achievement of provisional acceptance; the appellant had failed to achieve final acceptance in terms of article 6.4 of the 2nd amendment to the on-shore services contract agreement; the units could not, therefore, be treated as having been completed; the appellant had placed only one letter dated 02.01.2017 on record in support of their allegation that they had communicated the reasons for the delay regularly to the 1st respondent through e-mails; the appellant was barred from claiming exclusion from liability, for any delay or for delayed liquidated damages, because of the failure of ctc to supply material in accordance with the terms and conditions of the supply agreement, as the delay in completion of provisional acceptance test for units-i and ii was attributable to them; the claims against the appellant and ctc were independent of each other, and could be invoked simultaneously without causing prejudice to one another; and exercise of its right to claim damages from ctc, under the supply fob contract, could not curtail the first respondents right to claim liquidated damages from the appellant for its failure to achieve provisional acceptance for units-i and ii till date. the 1st respondent also denied that the appellant had discharged the onus to prove delay, on the part of ctc, from the admission of the 1st respondent itself; or they were due rs.300 crores to the appellant for the works done by them in all the contracts; and they had bank guarantees for rs.300 crores which included the bank guarantee of rs.149 crores. it is stated that the appellant has not filed any documents in support of their plea that they had informed the 1st respondent of the reasons for the delay attributable to the suppliers and the 1st respondent, and had sought extension of time; mere allegation of fraud, in the injunction application, did not justify grant of injunction relating to encashment of the bank guarantees; the appellant had failed to produce any material or documents to substantiate the allegation of fraud; non-performance or delay by ctc, caused under the supply (fob) contract, could not be used as an excuse for the appellants failure to perform its obligations under the ncclepc contracts; similarly, the 1st respondents right to claim liquidated damages from ctc, under the nccl-epc contracts, did not curtail their right to claim liquidated damages from the appellant for its failure to achieve provisional acceptance under the epc contracts; and exercise of such a right, under the epc contracts, cannot be termed a fraud. the 1st respondent denied that there were any special equities in the appellants favour, for grant of injunction, merely because the 1st respondent was owned and operated by a singapore based entity i.e., m/s. sembcorp utilities pte ltd; or that the appellant would not be able to recover the money from the 1st respondent on encashment of the bank guarantees even if they were to succeed in the arbitral proceedings. the 1st respondent states that it is a company incorporated in india under the companies act, 1956, and has significant assets in nellore district of andhra pradesh. in their reply, to the counter-affidavit filed by the first respondent, the appellant denied the allegation of abuse of process of court. they submitted that the validity of the bank guarantees had been extended; and all essential ingredients, to restrain invocation of bank guarantees, had been pleaded and established. reference is made by them to the report of the central electricity authority, bangalore dated 06.03.2017 to contend that unit 1 was synchronized on 26.05.2016 and started operating commercially on 17.11.2016, and unit 2 was synchronized on 02.02.2017, commissioned on 15.02.2017 and started operating commercially on 21.02.2017; the first respondent had publicly announced completion of construction of the thermal power project on these dates; both the units have been operating commercially; the first respondent was generating revenue out of the supply of such energy; provisional acceptance test had been achieved for the units, since the first respondent had been running both the units at its optimum capacity; in the e-mail dated 18.11.2016, the appellant was informed that a part of the delay, in the slow pace of work, was because the first respondent did not deploy suitable man power at the site, and lack of priority given by the first respondent to unit 2; it was also stated that there was inordinate delay in the delivery of the turbine by ctc which led to the slow pace of the work; notwithstanding the delay caused by the first respondent or ctc, the appellant was able to finish the work within minimum time, and had put both the units to commercial operations from 17.11.2016 and 21.02.2017 respectively; the understanding of the first respondent, on the scope of clause 2.3 and 2.4 of the co-ordination agreement to levy liquidated damages, was incorrect; under clause 3.1 and 3.2 of the co-ordination agreement, the appellant could not be made liable for the delay in due completion of the provisional acceptance test, if such delay was solely due to the consortium; clauses 3.1 and 3.2 opened with a non-obstante clause, and prevailed over any other contrary clauses; in any event, it was not the appellants case that they violated clauses 2.3 and 2.4; the appellant had performed its contractual obligations, and had put both the units in commercial operations, notwithstanding the delay caused to the project by the first respondent and the consortium; the appellant was entitled for extension of time, because of the delay caused by ctc; the appellants letter dated 02.12.2016, and the protocols dated 28.07.2016 and 02.08.2016, clearly established that it had fulfilled all its obligations under the contract; since the first respondent did not give provisional acceptance within ten days of the notice dated 02.12.2016, provisional acceptance must be deemed to have occurred; the appellant must be deemed to have achieved provisional acceptance for unit 2 on 18.02.2017, as the first respondent put the facility to commercial operations from that day onwards; as per the epc contracts and the co-ordination agreement, all the disputes are required to be resolved through mutual discussions and negotiation in an equitable manner; the appellant intended to go for arbitration for adjudication of the subject disputes; in reply to the first respondents letter dated 23.02.2017 they had, by their letter dated 08.03.2017, disputed levy of liquidated damages, and had denied all the allegations made therein; and the first respondent could not set off liquidated damages, or encash the securities, for damages which were arbitrarily levied or were disputed as not due. in his order in c.o.p. no.63 of 2017 and batch dated 18.04.2017, (against which these appeals are preferred), the learned judge, commercial court-cum-xxiv additional chief judge, city civil court, hyderabad observed that there was no dispute with regards existence of an arbitration clause in the onshore services contract agreement and the co-ordination agreement; the appellant had furnished the schedule bank guarantees in favour of the first respondent, and they were being extended from time to time; according to clause 10.6 of the coordination agreement, it was agreed between the parties that the contracts were independent and separate contracts; and the coordination agreement was solely for the purpose of co-ordination and completion of the combined work in accordance with the master project schedule in a seamless manner. the learned judge referred to clause 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2 and 4.1 of the co-ordination agreement, and then observed that the appellant had not filed any documentary evidence to show that they had taken measures to ensure that the delay of ctc was not caused on account of their failure or breaches; and the appellant had failed to establish that there was egregious fraud on the part of the first respondent by producing cogent and convincing documentary evidence. after referring to ansal engineering projects limited v. tehri hydro development corporation ltd , gujarat maritime board v. l&t infrastructure development projects ltd , and hindustan steel works construction ltd v. tarapore & co. , the learned judge held that, in the instant case, the appellant had contended that the first respondent was due around rs.300 crores to them in all the contracts; reliance placed by them on gangotri enterprises ltd. v. union of india was misplaced; reliance placed by them on union of india v. raman iron foundry was also misplaced; in the instant case the dispute, among the parties, was an arbitral dispute, and had to be adjudicated by the arbitral tribunal; the appellant had not established a strong prima facie case; the balance of convenience was also not in its favour; and the appellant had also failed to establish that irreparable loss and injury would be caused to them if the relief of injunction sought for was not granted in their favour. the learned judge dismissed all the petitions filed by the appellant under section 9 of the 1996 act. elaborate oral submissions were made by sri d.prakash reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant and sri c.v. mohan reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent. written arguments have been filed by sri avinash desai, learned counsel for the appellant, and sri thoom srinivas, learned counsel for the first respondent. i. object and purpose of furnishing bank guarantee: as the dispute, in the present batch of appeals, relates to the first respondents right to invoke the bank guarantees, furnished as security for guaranteeing performance of the contract by the appellant, it is necessary, at the outset, to examine the purpose for which a bank guarantee is furnished. when, in the course of commercial dealings, an unconditional bank guarantee is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. the bank giving such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. the very purpose of giving such a bank guarantee would, otherwise, be defeated. (u.p. state sugar corpn. v. sumac international ltd. ). between the bank and the beneficiary, the moment there is a written demand for invoking the bank guarantee, pursuant to a breach of the covenants, the bank is bound to make payment under the guarantee. (gujarat maritime board2). the commercial purpose, for which the system of confirmed irrevocable documentary credit has been developed in international trade, is to give to the seller an assured right to be paid before he parts with the control of the goods, and that does not permit of any dispute with the buyer, as to the performance of the contract being used as a ground for non-payment or reduction or deferment of payment. (u.p. cooperative federation ltd. v. singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd. ; ucm (investment) v. royal bank of india ). performance guarantees are virtually promissory notes payable on demand. so long as an honest demand is made, the banks are bound to pay. they will rarely, if ever, be in a position to know whether the demand is honest or not. at any rate they will not be able to prove it to be dishonest. so they will have to pay. (singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7; edward owen engineering ltd. v. barclay's bank international ltd., ; centax (india) ltd. v. vinmar impex inc ). a bank, issuing a guarantee, is not concerned with the underlying contract between the parties to the contract. the duty of the bank, under a guarantee, is created by the document itself. once the documents are in order, the bank giving the guarantee must honour the same and make payment. ordinarily, courts will not interfere, directly or indirectly, to withhold payment for, otherwise, trust in commerce, internal and international, would be irreparably damaged. (state of maharashtra v. national construction co. ; united commercial bank v. bank of india ; centax (india) ltd.10; icici bank ltd, hydeabad v. ivrcl ltd, hyderabad ; singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7). a bank, which gives a performance guarantee, is not concerned with the relations between the supplier and the customer: nor with the question whether the supplier has performed his contractual obligation or not; nor with the question whether the supplier is in default or not. the bank must pay according to its guarantees, on demand if so stipulated, without proof or conditions. if the documentary credits are irrevocable and independent, the banks must pay when demand is made. (singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7; edward owen engineering ltd.9; centax (india) ltd.,10). bearing the purposes, for which bank guarantees are issued, in mind let us now examine the rival submissions, urged by learned senior counsel on either side, under different heads. ii. contract of bank guarantee is an independent contract: sri c.v. mohan reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent, would submit that the contract of guarantee is a complete and separate contract by itself; and the court/tribunal would only interfere if the invocation is against the terms of the guarantee itself. on the other hand sri d.prakash reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that, in tarapore & co.3, the supreme court examined the disputes, with respect to the parent contract/underlying contract, to ascertain the existence of special equities. a bank guarantee constitutes a separate, distinct and independent contract. this contract is between the bank and the beneficiary. it is independent of the main contract between the person who has furnished the bank guarantee and the beneficiary. (hindustan construction co. ltd. v. state of bihar ; tarapore & co.3). a bank guarantee is the common mode of securing payment of money in commercial dealings as the beneficiary, under the guarantee, is entitled to realise the whole of the amount under that guarantee in terms thereof, irrespective of any pending dispute between the person on whose behalf the guarantee was given and the beneficiary. a bank guarantee constitutes an independent contract between the bank and the principal. (hindustan construction company ltd14; singh consultants & engineers (p) ltd.7; bolivinter oil sa v. chase manhattan bank ; svenska handelsbanken v. indian charge chrome ; larsen & toubro ltd. v. maharashtra seb ; hindustan steel workers construction ltd. v. g.s. atwal & co. (engineers) (p) ltd. .; national thermal power corpn. ltd. v. flowmore (p) ltd ; national construction co.11; tarapore & co.3; sumac international ltd6; icici bank ltd13). a bank guarantee is, ordinarily, a contract quite distinct and independent of the underlying contract, the performance of which it seeks to secure. to that extent it can be said to give rise to a cause of action separate from that of the underlying contract. (national construction co.,11; united commercial bank12; centax (india) ltd.10; icici bank ltd13; singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7). a bank guarantee is not qualified by the underlying transaction, or the validity of the primary contract between the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given and the beneficiary. (ansal engineering projects ltd.1). the bank guarantee must be honoured in accordance with its terms. the bank, which gives the guarantee, is not concerned with the relations between the supplier and the customer; nor with the question whether the supplier has performed his contractual obligation or not, nor with the question whether the supplier is in default or not. the bank must pay according to the tenor of its guarantee on demand without proof or condition. (sumac international ltd.,6; united commercial bank12; singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7). reliance placed on behalf of the appellant, on hindustan construction co. ltd.14, is misplaced. in the said case, the appellant was awarded a contract for construction of a dam to be completed within a period of 42 months, for which they were required to furnish a bank guarantee for 10% of the contract price as performance guarantee. on the bank guarantee being invoked by the respondent, the appellant filed a suit in the bombay high court, and an interim order was initially passed restraining invocation of the bank guarantee which was confirmed later. the order passed by the learned single judge was challenged before the division bench of the bombay high court which vacated the injunction with respect to mobilisation advance, but maintained the injunction in respect of the performance guarantee. the respondents preferred an appeal against that part of the order of the division bench wherein the injunction order, in respect of the performance guarantee, was upheld. the supreme court noted that, while the bank guarantee used the expression \"agree unconditionally and irrevocably\" to guarantee payment to the executive engineer on his first demand without any right of objection, it had thereafter qualified it by using the expression in the event that the obligations expressed in the said clause of the abovementioned contract had not been fulfilled by the contractor giving the right of claim to the employer for recovery of the whole or part of the advance mobilisation loan from the contractor under the contract\"; this condition clearly referred to the original contract between the appellant and the respondent, and postulated that, if the obligations expressed in the contract were not fulfilled by the appellant, it gave the respondent the right to claim recovery of the whole or part of the advance mobilisation loan, then the bank would pay the amount due under the guarantee; by referring specifically to clause 9, the bank had qualified its liability to pay the amount covered by the guarantee, relating to advance mobilisation loan to the executive engineer, only if the obligations under the contract were not fulfilled by the appellant, or the appellant had misappropriated any portion of the advance mobilisation loan; the bank guarantee thus could be invoked only in the circumstances referred to in clause 9 whereunder the amount would become payable only if the obligations were not fulfilled or there was misappropriation; that being so, the bank guarantee could not be said to be unconditional or unequivocal in terms; the defendant could not be said to have had an unfettered right to invoke that guarantee, and demand immediate payment thereof from the bank; the performance guarantee was furnished in terms of clause 5 of the agreement; the bank guarantee, in respect of performance guarantee, was furnished to the chief engineer; the said bank guarantee could be invoked by none other than the chief engineer; and invocation of the bank guarantee by the executive engineer was not in terms of the bank guarantee. on examining the contents of the subject bank guarantees, the supreme court was satisfied that the government of bihar could not encash the bank guarantees as they were neither unconditional nor unequivocal. it is necessary, therefore, for us to examine the relevant clauses in the agreements between the appellant and the first respondent which require bank guarantees to be furnished towards guaranteed performance of the contract by the appellant, and the relevant clause in the contract of bank guarantee between the concerned bank and the first respondent, to ascertain whether or not these bank guarantees are unconditional and unequivocal. the appellant and the first respondent entered into six agreements and, in addition, a bipartite agreement called the coordination agreement. the second amendment to the on-shore service contract dated 10.04.2011 provided, in article 2.7, for the addition of a new article 4.8 to be added to the on-shore service contract. clause 4.8 stipulated that, to secure the appellants performance of its obligations, the appellant acknowledged and agreed that the first respondent shall have the right to hold the contract performance guarantee, issued by a reputable commercial bank acceptable to the first respondent, as security for the performance of the appellants obligations under the agreement. the article further records the appellants acknowledgment that, in the event amounts are due under the agreement (including late completion liquidated damages, and ancillary power guarantee liquidated damages and any amount due and payable from the appellant to the first respondent or to be paid by the appellant on behalf of the first respondent, and such amounts are not paid when due), the first respondent shall have the unconditional and irrevocable right to demand and draw such amounts under the contract performance guarantee equal to the amount owing by the appellant without prejudice to the first respondents rights and/or which are the remedies accrued under the agreement. article 2 of the co-ordination agreement, entered into between the appellant and the first respondent, are the covenants of the appellant, and the rights of the first respondent. clause 2.1 stipulates that the co-ordination agreement and the contracts are complementary and (except to the extent provided in the coordination agreement) are to be treated as independent and separate contracts; the appellant assumed full responsibility for, and guaranteed on a turnkey basis for, the performance of obligations and responsibilities under the contracts; they agreed to coordinate the works, services, equipment and other items to be performed under each of the contracts in an integrated manner for seamless and uninterrupted interface among all activities and obligations; both the parties agreed that the actions or omissions that constituted a default by the appellant, under one or more of the contracts, shall constitute a default under all of the contracts and entitle the first respondent to all the remedies provided for in the contracts, and to draw on any performance security under any and/or all of the contracts. clause 2.10 of the co-ordination agreement required the appellant to provide performance bonds in the form of ondemand bank guarantees or standby letters of credit as set out thereunder. it is useful, in this context, to refer to contract performance bank guarantee no.1303914 dated 24.09.2014 issued by the state bank of india which records that, in consideration of the first respondent having awarded the appellant a contract (onshore service contract), and the appellant having agreed to provide a contract performance guarantee for faithful performance of the entire contract equivalent to rs.8.5 crores to the first respondent, the state bank of india guaranteed and undertook to pay the first respondent on demand any, and all the, monies payable by the appellant upto the sum mentioned in the bank guarantee. the relevant portion of the said bank guarantee reads thus: we state bank of india..do hereby guarantee and undertake to pay the owner, on demand any and all monies payable by the contractor to the extent of .. as aforesaid at any time upto . without any demur, reservation, contest, recourse or protest and/or without any reference to the contractor. any such demand made by the owner on the bank shall be conclusive and binding notwithstanding any difference between the owner and the contractor or any dispute pending before any court, tribunal, arbitrator or any other authority. the bank undertakes not to revoke this guarantee during its currency without previous consent of the owner and further agrees that the guarantee herein contained shall be enforceable till ninety (90) days after expiry of its validity. the bank guarantee also records that the first respondent shall have the fullest liberty, without affecting in any way the liability of the bank under the guarantee, from time to time, to extend the time for performance of the contract by the appellant; the first respondent shall have the fullest liberty, without affecting the guarantee, to postpone, from time to time, the exercise of any power vested in them or of any right which they might have against the appellant, and to exercise the same at any time in any manner; the bank would not be released of their obligations under the bank guarantee by any exercise by the first respondent of its liberty with reference to all the matters mentioned therein, or by reason of any other act or forbearance or other act of omission or commission on the part of the first respondent or any other indulgence shown by the first respondent or by any other matter or thing which under law would, but for the provision, have the effect of relieving the bank. while this bank guarantee has no doubt been issued on behalf of the appellant, it is independent of the underlying contract between the appellant and the first respondent. the said bank guarantee is an independent agreement between the bank and the first respondent in terms of which the bank agreed to pay, on demand by the first respondent, the monies payable by the appellant to the extent of the sum indicated in the bank guarantee. a bank guarantee is unconditional and unequivocal when the bank, unconditionally and irrevocably, promises to pay, on demand, the amount of liability undertaken in the guarantee without any demur or dispute in terms of the bank guarantee. (ansal engineering projects ltd.1). bank guarantees which are irrevocable in nature, in terms, provide that they are payable by the guarantor to the appellant on demand without demur. they further provide that the appellant shall be the sole judge of whether, and to what extent, the amount has become recoverable from the respondent or whether the respondent has committed any breach of the terms and conditions of the agreement. the guarantor shall immediately pay the guaranteed amount on demand. (sumac international ltd.6). in an unconditional bank guarantee, the beneficiary is entitled to invoke it and seek encashment of the amount specified therein. it does not depend upon the result of the decision in the dispute between the parties, in the case of breach. the underlying object is that an irrevocable commitment in the form of a bank guarantee, solemnly given by the bank, must be honoured, and respect for free flow of commerce and trade, and faith in the commercial banking transactions, is inculcated unhedged by pending disputes between the beneficiary and the contractor. (ansal engineering projects ltd.1). as is evident from the recitals hereinabove extracted, the bank guarantees, in the present case, are unconditional and, in terms thereof, the bank agreed to pay the first respondent, on demand, any or all monies payable by the appellant, to the extent referred to in the bank guarantees, without any demur, and even without reference to the appellant. the demand made by the first respondent on the bank, in terms of the contract of bank guarantees, was to be conclusive and binding notwithstanding any difference between the appellant and the first respondent or any dispute pending between them before any court, tribunal, arbitrator or any other authority. iii. exceptions, to the rule that an injunction should not be granted against invocation of bank guarantees, are not limited to fraud, and cannot be placed in a strait jacket: sri d. prakesh reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that, besides fraud, encashment of the bank guarantees can be injuncted in cases of irretrievable injury, extra-ordinary special equities, and invocation of bank guarantee not being in terms of the bank guarantee itself; a straight jacket formula cannot, universally, be applied to all cases; and every case has to be decided with reference to the facts involved therein. on the other hand sri c.v.mohan reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent, would submit that the only two exceptions,where invocation of the bank guarantee can be restrained, is if there is clear fraud of which the bank has notice, and the fraud is of the beneficiary who seeks to benefit; the second exception is when there are special equities in favour of injunction, such as when irreparable injury or irreparable injustice would occur. the two main exceptions, for grant of an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of a bank guarantee, are (1) the fraud committed is in the notice of the bank, and is such as to vitiate the very foundation of the guarantee; and (2) injustice of the kind which would make it impossible for the guarantor to reimburse himself. (techtrans construction india pvt ltd & ksheeraabad constructions pvt. ltd. v. reliance utility engineers ltd. ; himadri chemicals industries ltd. v. coal tar refining co., ; sunac international ltd6). as injunction against encashment of a bank guarantee is an exception and not the rule, cases of such exceptions must be evidenced by documents and pleadings on record, and should compulsorily fall within any of the following limited categories (i) if there is a fraud in connection with the bank guarantee which would vitiate the very foundation of such guarantee and the beneficiary seeks to take advantage of such fraud; (ii) the applicant, in the facts and circumstance of the case, clearly establishes a case of irretrievable injustice or irreparable damage; (iii) the applicant is able to establish exceptional or special equities of the kind which would prick the judicial conscience of the court; and (iv) when the bank guarantee is not invoked strictly in its terms, and by the person empowered to invoke it under the terms of the guarantee. in other words, the letter of invocation is in apparent violation of the specific terms of the bank guarantee. (punj lloyd insulations ltd. v. state bank of india ). while cases of irretrievable injury, fraud, extraordinary special equities and invocation of bank guarantee contrary to the terms of the bank guarantee itself, are exceptions to the rule, it is difficult to draw any straitjacket formula which would universally apply to all cases. (synthetic foams ltd. v. simplex concrete piles (india) pvt. ltd. and hindustan construction co. ltd. v. satluj jal nigam ltd. ; state trading corporation of india ltd. v. state bank of india ). let us now examine whether the appellant has conclusively established that, in the present batch of cases, the exceptions, to the rule against injuncting invocation of the bank gurantees, are attracted. before doing so, it is necessary to examine whether, and to what extent, the documents filed at a stage posterior to the filing of the o.ps, under section 9 of the 1996 act on 06.03.2017, can be looked into, and then consider the rival contentions on whether or not the first respondent has committed breach of the contract justifying grant of temporary injunction on a prima facie case being made out. iv. can documents, filed subsequent to the filing of the o.p, be relied upon? sri c.v. mohan reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent, would submit that the additional documents, that the appellant is now relying upon to establish special equities, were filed before the commercial court only as an afterthought, that too because the first respondent had, in its reply to the section 9 petition, contended that these allegations were unsupported by evidence; this court should first consider whether these documents were filed following the procedure prescribed under the amended order xi rule 4 and 5 cpc, mentioned in the schedule to the 2015 act; these provisions require the appellant to seek prior leave of the court for filing additional documents; the appellant has belatedly filed additional documents before this court, including the provisional balance sheet of the first respondent as at march 31, 2017, and the first respondents letter dated february 02, 2017 which were issued to the appellant as a regular exercise carried out as part of their audit; and the contents of the provisional balance sheet of the first respondent cannot be considered as they are still pending approval by the shareholders. on the other hand sri d. prakash reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that the appellant filed as many documents as they could at the time of filing the petition in support of their contention; they subsequently brought in various other relevant documents in answer to the defence set up by the first respondent in its counter; they are (a) design coal communications: (b) extension of time (c) more than rs.300 crores payable and (d) respondent is making losses; order xi rule 5 applies to suits, and not to o.p.s which are in the nature of interim applications; order xi rule 1 (1) (c) permits additional documents to be filed, even though they are in the possession of the petitioner at the time of filing of the petition, in answer to any case set up by the respondent subsequent to the filing of the petition; and this court is empowered to receive additional documents, as evidence at the appellate stage, under order 41 rule 27 cpc for any other substantial cause. section 10 of the 2015 act relates to the jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters and, under sub-section (3) thereof, where the subject matter of arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and, if such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the 1996 act, that would, ordinarily, lie for settlement in a district court, shall be filed in, and be heard and disposed of by, the commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial court has been constituted. since the application made by the appellant herein, under section 9 of the 1996 act, is more than the specified value, they had invoked the jurisdiction of the commercial court under section 10(3) of the 2015 act. section 9(1)(ii) of the 1996 act enables a party to apply to a court for interim measures with respect to the matters specified in clauses (a) to (e) thereunder, and confers the same power on the court for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it. consequently the commercial court, before which the application under section 9 of the 1996 act was made, would have the same power to make orders under section 9(1)(ii) of the 1996 act as it has in relation to any proceedings before it. section 2(e)(1) of the 1996 act defines court to mean, in case of an arbitration other than an international commercial arbitration, the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the high court in the exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration, if the same had been the subject matter of a suit. consequently an application, under section 9(1)(ii) of the 1996 act, can be filed by a party only before the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district. where a statute provides a remedy before an ordinary civil court, the rules of procedure that would apply are the ordinary rules of the civil procedure code. where the principal court of original jurisdiction is the district court, the procedural provisions of the cpc govern the proceedings before the said court (ashapura minechem ltd. v. pacific basin ihx (uk) ltd ). since the power exercised by the court, under section 9 of the 1996 act, is akin to the power which the district court exercises in proceedings before it, there is no reason why the provisions of the civil procedure code, which are applicable to proceedings before the district court, should be held not to apply to petitions filed under section 9 of the 1996 act. chapter vi of the 2015 act relates to the amendments of the provisions of the code of civil procedure. section 16(1) stipulates that the provisions of the cpc shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the schedule. section 16(2) stipulates that the commercial court shall follow the provisions of the cpc, as amended by 2015 act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value. the word suit in sections 16(1) & (3) of the 2015 act would bring, within its ambit, petitions filed under section 9 of the 1996 act because all applications under the 1996 act (which would include a petition under section 9 thereof) are, in view of section 10(3) of the 2015 act, required to be filed in, and to be heard and disposed of by, the commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration. section 16(3) of the 2015 act stipulates that, where any provision of any rule of the jurisdictional high court or any amendment to the cpc by the state government is in conflict with the provisions of the cpc as amended by the 2015 act, the provisions of the cpc, as amended by the 2015 act, shall prevail. the schedule to the 2015 act has substituted order xi of the code of civil procedure (which relates to disclosure, discovery and inspection of documents) in suits before the commercial court. order xi rule 1(a) requires the plaintiff to file a list of all documents and photocopies of all documents in its power, possession, control or custody, pertaining to the suit, along with the plaint, including (a) documents referred to and relied on by the plaintiff in the plaint; (b) relating to any matter in question in the proceedings, in the power, possession, control or custody of the plaintiff, as on the date of filing of the plaint, irrespective of whether the same is in support of or adverse to the plaintiffs case. clause (c) of order xi rule 1 stipulates that nothing in rule (1) shall apply to documents produced by the plaintiff, and relevant only (i) for examination of the defendants witness, or (ii) in answer to any case set-up by the defendant subsequent to the filing of the plaint, or (iii) handed over to a witness merely to refresh his memory. the submission, made on behalf of the appellant, that order xi rule 1 does not apply, since the appellants case falls within the ambit of clause (c)(ii) of order xi rule 1 is only to be noted to be rejected. the appellant was required to plead and prove fraud of an egregious nature or special equities or irretrievable injury in order to obtain an order of injunction restraining the first respondent from invoking the bank guarantees. it was obligatory for them, therefore, to plead and prove their case. the documents filed by them along with their reply to the counter filed before the commercial court by the first respondent, the documents filed by them at the time of arguments, and the documents filed along with their appeal before this court, to establish their claim of egregious fraud/special equities/irretrievable injury, is not in answer to the case set up by the first respondent subsequent to the filing of the petition, but are those which the appellant was obligated to file, along with their section 9 petition, before the commercial court on 06.03.2017 itself. order xi rule 3, as substituted by the 2015 act, requires the plaint to contain a declaration on oath from the plaintiff that all the documents in their power, possession, control or custody, pertaining to the facts and circumstances of the proceedings initiated by him have been disclosed, and copies thereof annexed with the plaint; and that the plaintiff does not have any other documents in its power, possession, control or custody. under the explanation thereto, a declaration on oath under rule (3) of order xi is required to be contained in the statement of truth as set out in the appendix. no such declaration was furnished along with the section 9 petition filed before the commercial court. order xi rule 4 enables a plaintiff, in the case of urgent filings, to seek leave to rely on additional documents, as part of the declaration on oath; and, subject to grant of such leave by the court, the plaintiff is required to file such additional documents in court, within thirty days of filing the suit, along with a declaration on oath that the plaintiff has produced all documents in its power, possession, control or custody, pertaining to the facts and circumstances of the proceedings initiated by the plaintiff; and that the plaintiff does not have any other documents in its power, possession, control or custody. order xi rule (5) stipulates that the plaintiff shall not be allowed to rely on documents, which were in the plaintiffs power, possession, control or custody, and not disclosed along with the plaint or within the extended period set out above, save and except by leave of the court and such leave shall be granted only upon the plaintiff establishing reasonable cause for non-disclosure along with the plaint. neither did the appellant, while filing the section 9 petition, seek leave of the court to file such additional documents within thirty days of filing the o.p nor was leave sought by them at any time thereafter. it is only if leave had been sought would the question of the court being satisfied, that the appellant had established reasonable cause for non-disclosure along with the plaint, arise for consideration. the appellant filed the o.p. before the commercial court on 06.03.2017. along with the o.p, they filed a copy of the certificate of incorporation; a copy of the coordination agreement between them and the first respondent dated 23.03.2014; a copy of the onshore service contract dated 10.04.2011; a copy of the supply (fob contract) between the appellant, the first respondent and ctc dated 20.01.2012; a copy of the letter addressed by the first respondent separately to them, and to the ctc, on 23.03.2017 claiming liquidated damages; a copy of the letter addressed by the appellant to the first respondent on 02.01.2017 seeking extension of the contract period; and a copy of the bank guarantee dated 27.09.2014. after the first respondent filed its counter-affidavit in the o.ps before the commercial court, the appellant filed its reply thereto on 28.03.2017, to which it enclosed (1) copy of the letter dated 27.03.2017 extending the bank guarantee; (ii) a copy of the letter dated 25.07.2014 addressed by the first respondent to ctc seeking early delivery of the btg equipment as it was delaying the overall project completion schedule; (iii) copy of a similar letter addressed by the appellant to the first respondent informing them that failure to declare provisional acceptance was because of factors beyond their control, and for release of the amount due on provisional acceptance test for unit i; (iv) a copy of the letter dated 02.12.2016, addressed by the appellant to the first respondent, requesting them to issue provisional acceptance test certificate for unit i, and to release the payments due; (v) a copy of the letter dated 06.12.2016 addressed by ctc to the first respondent regarding use of design coal; (vi) a copy of the letter dated 18.01.2017 addressed by the appellant to the first respondent wherein they stated that the boiler efficiency could not be measured as the coal used was different from the one stipulated in the specifications; (viii) a copy of the regional energy account of central electricity authority, bangalore dated 03.02.2017; (viii) a copy of the monthly progress report of the southern regional power committee of the central electricity authority dated 06.03.2017; (ix) a copy of the region-wise generation report dated 19.03.2017; and (x) copy of the e-mail dated 04.07.2016 regarding firing of indonesia coal. subsequently, at the stage of arguments in the o.p. on 06.04.2017, the appellant filed the following documents without seeking leave of the court to do so i.e (i) a copy of the letter dated 27.03.2017 addressed by the first respondent to the appellant that coal was heterogeneous in nature, it could not exactly match the design coal, the first respondent held sufficient quantity of design coal, and was willing to make available design coal for the purpose of conducting performance guarantee tests as and when the appellant was ready to conduct such tests; (ii) a copy of the letter dated 01.04.2017 stating that the use of non-design coal by the first respondent had made ctc suffer great losses for which ctc could claim extension of time and additional costs; (iii) a copy of the directors report of the first respondent wherein it is stated that, as at 31.07.2016, the first respondent had achieved overall epc progress of 97.67%. it is only at the stage of filing an appeal, against the order of the court below, i.e on 08.06.2017, have the appellants filed (i) a copy of the provisional balance sheet of the first respondent as at 31.03.2017; (ii) a copy of the balance confirmation letter of the first respondent as on 31.03.2017 forwarding a copy of the extract of the ledger balance of the appellant in the books of accounts of the first respondent as on 31.03.2017; (iii) a copy of the arbitration notice issued by the appellant to the first respondent dated 27.05.2017; (iv) a copy of the first respondents e-mail dated 02.06.2017 to discuss the possibility of an amicable settlement; and (v) a copy of the e-mail sent by the appellant to the first respondent on 05.06.2017. while some of the aforesaid documents relate to a period posterior to the filing of the o.p. on 06.03.2017, the fact remains that even with regards documents anterior to the filing of the o.p, neither did the appellant seek leave of the commercial court, to file the documents, which they had filed, along with their reply to the counter-affidavit of the first respondent, on 28.03.2017 nor was leave sought for filing the documents at the stage of arguments on 06.04.2017. as no leave was sought, the question of leave being granted by the commercial court does not arise. consequently, in terms of the aforesaid provisions, the appellant would not be entitled to place reliance on these documents, for which leave of the commercial court was neither sought nor granted. a party has to plead the case and produce/adduce sufficient evidence to substantiate his submissions made in the petition. (ritesh tewari v. state of u.p., ). when a point is ostensibly a point of law, which is required to be substantiated by facts, the party raising the point must plead and prove such facts by evidence which must appear from the petition. if the facts are not pleaded, or the evidence in support of such facts is not annexed, the court will not entertain the point. (ritesh tewari27; bharat singh v. state of haryana ). as documents, for which leave of the commercial court was not obtained, cannot be considered, it is only if the documents filed on 06.03.2016, along with the petition, substantiate the pleadings in the petition, can such pleas be examined. in any event most of the documents, on which reliance is placed on behalf of the appellants, were filed in support of their claim that it is the first respondents failure to abide by its obligations under the underlying agreements which resulted in their inability to perform their obligations of conducting a provisional acceptance test. we shall now briefly note the rival contentions, urged by learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant and the first respondent, on merits to buttress our conclusion that these rival claims necessitate detailed examination in the arbitral proceedings, before it can be conclusively determined as to which of the parties to the agreement had caused breach of its terms. v. when can a prima-facie case, for grant of injunction restraining the invocation of bank guarantee, be said to have been made out? while the appellant had sought a temporary injunction in the o.ps, to restrain the first respondent from encashing the bank guarantee pending its disposal, the o.ps themselves were dismissed by the commercial court. the discretion of the court is exercised to grant a temporary injunction only when the following requirements are made out by the plaintiff: (i) existence of a prima facie case as pleaded, necessitating protection of the plaintiffs rights by issue of a temporary injunction; (ii) when the need for protection of the plaintiffs rights is compared with or weighed against the need for protection of the defendants rights or likely infringement of the defendants rights, the balance of convenience tilting in favour of the plaintiff; and (iii) clear possibility of irreparable injury being caused to the plaintiff if the temporary injunction is not granted. in addition, temporary injunction being an equitable relief, the discretion to grant such relief will be exercised only when the petitioners conduct is free from blame and he approaches the court with clean hands. (seema arshad zaheer v. municipal corpn. of greater mumbai ). while the aforesaid factors must be borne in mind in examining an application seeking temporary injunction, an application to injunct encashment of a bank guarantee stands on a different footing. courts must not lose sight of the fact that the commitment of banks must be honoured free from interference (tarapore & co.3), and the court would, ordinarily, not interfere with enforcement of the bank guarantee except only in cases where fraud or special equity or irretrievable injustice is, prime facie, made out in the case as a triable issue by strong evidence so as to prevent irretrievable injustice to the parties. the trading operation should not be jettisoned, and faith of the people in the efficacy of banking transactions should not be eroded or brought to disbelief. (ansal engineering projects ltd.1). when, in the course of commercial dealings, an unconditional bank guarantee is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. the bank, giving such a guarantee, is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. the very purpose of giving such a bank guarantee would otherwise be defeated. courts should, therefore, be slow in granting an injunction to restrain realization of such a bank guarantee. (dwarikesh sugar industries ltd. v. prem heavy engineering works (p) ltd., ; svenska handelsbanken16; larsen & toubro ltd.17; g.s. atwal & co. (engineers) (p) ltd.18 and sumac international ltd.6). an unconditional bank guarantee can be invoked in terms thereof by the person in whose favour the bank guarantee is given, and courts would, ordinarily, be reluctant to grant an injunction against invocation of a bank guarantee. (tarapore & co.3; singh consultants & engineers (p) ltd.7; bolivinter oil sa15; svenska handelsbanken16; larsen & toubro ltd.17; g.s. atwal & co. (engineers) (p) ltd.18; flowmore (p) ltd.19; national construction co.11; tarapore & co.3; icici bank ltd13). while the sound banking system may require more caution in the issuance of irrevocable documentary credits, it would be for the banks to safeguard themselves by other means, and generally not for the court to come to their rescue with injunctions. (singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7). the courts usually refrain from granting injunction to restrain the performance of contractual obligations arising out of a letter of credit or a bank guarantee between one bank and another. if such temporary injunctions were to be granted in a transaction between a banker and a banker, restraining a bank from recalling the amount due when payment is made under reserve to another bank, or in terms of the letter of guarantee or credit executed by it, the whole banking system in the country would fail. in view of the banker's obligation under an irrevocable letter of credit to pay, his buyercustomer cannot instruct him not to pay. (singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7; united commercial bank12). the court should not lightly interfere with the operation of irrevocable documentary credit, except where there is a serious dispute to be tried, and there is a prima facie act of fraud. (edward owen engineering ltd.9; singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7). injunctions against the negotiating banks, for making payment to the beneficiary, must be given cautiously as constant judicial interference, in the normal practices of the market, can have disastrous consequences since it affects the trustworthiness of the indian banks and markets. (millenium wires (p) ltd. v. state trading corporation of india ltd ; icici bank ltd.13). only in exceptional cases would the courts interfere with the machinery of irrevocable obligations assumed by banks. in the case of a confirmed performance guarantee, just as in the case of a confirmed letter of credit, the bank is only concerned with ensuring that the terms of its mandate and confirmation has been complied with. it is in no way concerned with any contractual disputes which might have arisen between the buyer and the seller. (tarapore & co.3; r d,. harbottle (mercantile) ltd. v. national westminster bank ltd. ). the following principles should be noted, in the matter of injunction to restrain encashment of a bank guarantee, (i) while dealing with an application for injunction in the course of commercial dealings, and when an unconditional bank guarantee is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realise such a bank guarantee in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes relating to the terms of the contract; (ii) the bank giving such guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer; (iii) the courts should be slow in granting an order of injunction to restrain the realisation of a bank guarantee; (iv) since a bank guarantee is an independent and a separate contract, and is absolute in nature, existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of bank guarantees; (v) fraud should be of an egregious nature which would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee or letter of credit, and the beneficiary has sought to take advantage of the situation; and (vi) allowing encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned. (gujarat maritime board2; techtrans construction india pvt ltd & ksheeraabad constructions pvt. ltd.20). the court should look into the terms of the bank guarantee, and the letter of invocation, in deciding the fate of a prayed injunctive relief. (continental construction ltd. v. satluj jal vidyut nigam ltd ). as the appellant has sought an injunction to restrain the first respondent from invoking the bank guarantee in the section 9 petition, and in the appeal now filed before us, the scope and ambit of the contract of bank guarantee primarily necessitates examination, and not the underlying contract, for the rival claims, based on disputes arising from the underlying contract, are matters for examination and resolution in arbitral proceedings. nonetheless, the contentions urged by the learned senior counsel on either side are being noted to show that the appellant does not have a fool proof case of even the underlying contract being vitiated by fraud justifying an injunction being granted to restrain the first respondent from invoking the bank guarantees. (a) the first respondent has commenced commercial operations: sri d. prakash reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that the appellant has completed all erection works, and has fulfilled all its obligations ordained by the epc contracts, except conducting performance guarantee tests; the first respondent had stated that, as on 31.07.2016, the appellant had achieved overall epc progress of 97.67%; according to the monthly progress report, of the southern regional power committee for the month of january 2017, commercial operations started on 17.11.2016 for unit 1 and on 21.02.2017 for unit ii; the purpose of the performance guarantee tests, pre-commissioning tests etc. are to ensure that the plant is put to commercial use; and, as commercial operations have started, provisional acceptance is deemed to have been achieved. on the other hand sri c.v. mohan reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent, would submit that till date the appellant has not achieved provisional acceptance of units 1 and 2, in terms of the epc contracts; they have not even issued the 20 days prior written notice to the first respondent, as required under article 6.2 of the onshore services contract, conveying its intention to commence provisional acceptance testing; the appellant has not complied with the amended articles 6.3.1.1 and 6.3.1.2 of the onshore services contract which provide for the tests required to be conducted for successful completion of provisional acceptance; they have not complied with the terms of the amended article 6.3.2 of the onshore services contract which requires them to deliver, to the first respondent, a notice of provisional acceptance; for the appellants failure to achieve provisional acceptance, the first respondent is entitled to claim delay liquidated damages from the appellant, and to invoke the bank guarantees in lieu thereof; the performance guarantee test is a stage subsequent to the provisional acceptance test, which has not been undertaken till date; the issue of performance guarantee test is not relevant, for the purposes of the provisional acceptance test and its related milestone payment; the appellant has also failed to achieve final acceptance in terms of article 6.4 of the second amendment to the on-shore services contract agreement; commencement of commercial operation of the power plant does not establish that provisional acceptance has been achieved, till the prescribed conditions are fulfilled, and a provisional acceptance test certificate is issued by the first respondent; and the tripartite discussion held on february 22, 2017, and the letter dated january 02, 2017 show that the progress could not have been 97.67% complete as on july 31, 2016. in the directors report, presented to the shareholders as part of the 8th annual report together with audited financial statements for the year ending 31.03.2016, the directors of the first respondent stated that, as on july 31st 2016, the first respondent had achieved over all epc progress of 97.67%; all btg and bop material supply had been completed, and supply of balance mandatory spares were on going. the fact, however, remains that, subsequently, the appellant, in its letter dated 2.01.2017, informed the first respondent that over a year had elapsed since they had lodged their first request for extension in the contract period without any constructive response from the first respondent, despite which they had continued to render services under the contract; and a number of delay events had occurred in the project which were beyond their control, and for reasons not attributable to them, but they had claimed only a few of them as justification for extension of time. this letter dated 02.01.2017 acknowledges that the appellant was likely to achieve provisional acceptance test for unit -2 by 31.03.2017 by implementing various expediting measures at a considerably higher cost. the tripartite discussions held on 22.02.2017 between the appellant, the first respondent and the ctc records the action plan to achieve provisional acceptance test, and the target completion dates for various items to be completed by the appellant and the ctc by the end of february, 2017 for all most all the items such as reliability test run; minimum performance guarantee test on auxiliary power not more than 105%; minimum performance guarantee on test heat rate not more than 1.3%; emission limits; finalization of the btg manual; and bottom ash conveying not possible through hcsd. while all the aforesaid defects were to be completed by the appellant by 26.02.2017, the commissioning of the fire alarm detection system was to be completed by the appellant by 15.03.2017. it does appear, from the letter dated 02.01.2017 addressed by the appellant to the first respondent and the tripartite discussions held on 22.02.2017, that the first respondents claim, in the directors report, of having achieved a progress of 97.67% by 31.07.2016, was highly exaggerated. the on-shore services contract dated 10.04.2011 defines performance guarantee to have the meaning set forth in article 8.1; performance guarantee liquidated damages to have the meaning set forth in article 8.1, and to be payable as liquidated damages and not as a penalty; performance guarantee test to mean the performance guarantee test conducted in accordance with the provisions of article 6.4.1 for the purpose of determining the facilitys achievement of the performance guarantee; provisional acceptance to mean, with respect to the facility, the achievement of substantial performance in accordance with the provisions of article 6.4; provisional acceptance certificate to have the meaning set forth in article 6.4; and provisional acceptance test to mean the provisional acceptance test conducted in accordance with the provisions of article 6.3.1. article 6.3.1.1 stipulates that the provisional acceptance tests for the units shall consist of the tests and achievements of the performance levels mentioned thereunder, which are (a) the operation of the unit as a whole for fifteen continuous days and during each such fifteen-day test period, the unit shall be operated for not less than 72 hours continuously at 100% stg mcr; (b) the unit demonstrates an electrical output equal to or greater than 97.5% of the electrical output guarantee, and a gross heat rate equal to or lower than 103% of the heat rate guarantee and, for the purpose of demonstrating the achievement of the gross heat rate and electrical output levels required for provisional acceptance for the facility, the provisional acceptance test shall consist of the operation of the units as a whole for not less than four hours at a load condition of 100% stg mcr and 80% stg mcr; (c) the units meets the ramp rates, reactive power capability, full load rejection capability; maximum capacity at value wide open conditions as per technical specifications; and (d) the units meet the guaranteed emission limits. it further stipulates that, once the unit has successfully completed commissioning and start-up, and is capable of safe operation in accordance with applicable laws, applicable permits, prudent utility practices, the technical limitations and requirements of the operating manual, the appellant shall be entitled to perform a provisional acceptance test for the unit control tuning, and the operation used during the provisional acceptance test shall be identical to the control tuning and operation that would be used during normal operation. article 6.3.1.2 provides that the provisional acceptance of the units shall be achieved upon the successful completion of the factors mentioned in clauses (a) to (f) thereunder. clause 6.3.2 required the appellant, if it believed that it had achieved provisional acceptance for the facility, to deliver to the first respondent a notice of provisional acceptance which is required to contain a report, in the form previously agreed by the appellant and the first respondent, of the results of the acceptance test, and the works completed, with sufficient detail to enable the first respondent to determine whether provisional acceptance for the facility had been achieved. article 6.4 relates to the performance guarantee test and article 6.4.1 stipulates that final acceptance of the units shall be achieved if the conditions mentioned thereunder are met. subclause (a) required the appellant to have concluded a single test for the units in accordance with the testing protocol and standards as set out in the technical specifications (the performance guarantee test) in which the facility demonstrates a level of achievement of (i) 100% (or higher) of the electrical power electrical output guarantee and (ii) 100% (or lower) of the heat rate guarantee, for the facility, and the facility demonstrates 100% (or lower) of the auxiliary power guarantee as set forth in appendix v. final acceptance also requires the conditions, in clauses (b) to (f) mentioned thereunder, to be met. article 6.4.2 required the appellant to deliver to the first respondent a notice of provisional acceptance. it is evident, therefore, that the performance guarantee test, which is among the tests to determine whether the unit has achieved final acceptance, is to be undertaken subsequent to the provisional acceptance test to be conducted by the appellant in terms of article 6.3.1.2. the aforesaid clauses disclose that the provisional acceptance test for units i and ii consist of several tests, achievements and performance levels. the first respondent claimed liquidated damages by their notice dated 23.02.2017, a day after 22.02.2017 when the tripartite discussions were held between the appellant, the first respondent and ctc. from the minutes of the tripartite discussions held on 22.02.2017 it does appear that several items of works had not been completed by the appellant by then. whether or not these works, which the appellant was required to complete, and had agreed to do so, by the last week of february and by mid march, 2017, are significant are again matters for consideration in the arbitral proceedings, and not in a section 9 petition wherein the relief, of injunction against encashment of bank guarantee, was sought. while the first respondent does appear to have commenced commercial operations, it does also seem that the appellant did not conduct the provisional acceptance test for units 1 and 2 till the filing of the o.p on 06.03.2017, or at any time thereafter. whether inability of the appellant to conduct the provisional acceptance test is due to the failure of the first respondent to fulfill their obligations under the contract, is for the arbitral tribunal to consider, and are not matters for examination either in section 9 petition, or in an appeal arising from an order passed therein. (b) effect of the delay attributable to the chinese consortium, and failure to claim damages in the monthly bills during execution of the works: sri d. prakash reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that liquidated damages can be levied only if the delay attributable to ctc was lesser than that attributed to the appellant; the first respondent has, itself, claimed that the delay was on the part of the ctc to supply the btg equipment material, which covers the whole period of delay of 555 days for unit 1 and 495 days for unit 2; the delay, attributed to the appellant in achieving provisional acceptance, is allegedly 471 days for unit 1 and 379 days for unit 2, which is lesser than the period of delay alleged against the ctc; this amounts to claiming damages for the same delay twice i.e. both from the ctc and the appellant; there cannot be any delay on the part of the appellant in erection when, admittedly, supply of the btg equipment was delayed; the appellant cannot be held responsible for the alleged delays in the supply of btg equipment by the ctc; from the letter of the ctc dated 01.04.2017, it is evident that the btg equipment could not be supplied on time only because the first respondent did not open a letter of credit within the agreed time schedule; the first respondent is making these false claims only to avoid making payment of the admitted amounts due; in view of section 58 of the indian evidence act, 1872, the appellant need not prove an admitted fact, established by the documents of the first respondent itself; and the delay notified by the appellant, vide its letter dated 02.01.2017, was uptil 24.05.2016 only, whereas the delay calculated for 471 days was till 23.02.2017. on the other hand sri c.v. mohan reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent, would submit that the epc contracts confer a right on the first respondent to claim delay liquidated damages from the appellant, in case provisional acceptance test is not completed for unit 1 by november 10, 2015, and for unit 2 by february 10, 2016; article 7.2 of the second amendment, to the onshore services contract, extends the right to claim late completion liquidated damages in case the appellant fails to achieve provisional acceptance of units 1 and 2 within time; invocation of the bank guarantees, in lieu of delay liquidated damages, is a right which has been granted to the first respondent under the epc contracts, and the co-ordination agreement; the liquidated damages, claimed from the parties i.e. the petitioner and ctc, have become due on account of the delay caused in performing different obligations under different agreements; the two claims are independent of each other, and can be invoked simultaneously without prejudice to one another; the appellant became liable to pay liquidated damages to the first respondent for failure to complete the works under the epc contracts, and for failure to achieve provisional acceptance; clause 10.6 of the co-ordination agreement stipulates that the epc contracts are independent and separate contracts; irrespective of the belated supply of the btg equipment by ctc, the appellant was bound to complete other works under the epc contracts which were not dependant on the supply of btg equipment; the said works were not completed by the appellant on time; they caused delay in supply and erection of foundations, delay in construction of civil and steel structures, and delay in delivery of equipment; they failed to augment all necessary resources including skilled manpower, plant and tools, as a result of which the project got delayed, and the first respondent had to incur significant losses; as time was of essence, the first respondent had requested the appellant-petitioner to perform its obligations including the obligation to expedite the works to meet the completion schedule; due to various delays, inactions, omissions and breach of contractual obligations by the appellant, the first respondent has suffered substantial losses and damages, including in respect of works to be completed by the appellant on behalf of the first respondent, settlement of land and labour related issues, significant increases in financing costs, and various penalties to third parties; because of the failure of the appellant to execute the works within time, the first respondent had to carry out certain works, and procure certain material and equipment, the cost of which is recoverable from the appellant; the first respondent is also entitled to recover costs incurred towards de-scoping of works, labour cess, pending roads/drains/painting works and purchase of spare parts etc; and such costs/losses, added up together, far exceeds the pre-estimated liquidated damages provided under the epc contracts or the amount of rs. 304.5 crores which the appellant claims is allegedly payable by the first respondent to them. by their letter dated 23.02.2017, the first respondent informed the ctc that they were under an obligation to ensure delivery of btg equipment within 27 months and 29 months for units-1 and 2 respectively; it was agreed, among the parties, that time would be of essence for delivery of the btg equipment; there had been a delay in completion of delivery of the equipment by 555 days for unit-1, and 495 days for unit-2, as against the firm and committed delivery schedule; and, as a result, there had been a delay in provisional taking over and final taking over for units 1 and 2, which had caused additional direct losses to the appellant over and above the pre-estimated liquidated damages provided under the supply (fob) contract. for reason of the ctcs failure to meet the delivery schedule, the first respondent demanded that ctc pay liquidated damages for the amounts specified in the letter. they also stated that they had the right to offset the liquidated damages against payments to the ctc, in case the liquidated damages were not paid on or before 09.03.2017. it is relevant to note that this letter was addressed by the first respondent to the ctc on 23.02.2017, a day after the tripartite meeting held between the appellant, the first respondent and the ctc on 22.02.2017 wherein the appellant and the ctc had acknowledged that several requirements were yet to be completed; and they would be completed on the dates, mentioned in the minutes, which are from 23.02.2017 till 15.03.2017. by their letter dated 23.02.2017, the first respondent informed the appellant that they had, time and again, requested the latter to expedite completion of the works under the epc contracts, but they had not, till date, claimed liquidated damages from the appellant because of cash flow issues of the appellant, and in the interest of achieving project completion at the earliest; the appellant was yet to complete the works under the epc contracts, and there had been inordinate delay in achieving provisional acceptance, as set forth in detail in annexure-i; and the first respondent was invoking its right to claim the following liquidated damages in accordance with the terms of each contract i.e., (a) rs.134 crores under the civil and construction works contract; (b) rs.145.75 crores under the supply (ex-works) contract; (c) rs.9.04 million us dollars under the supply (c&f) contract; and (d) rs.8.5 crores under the on-shore services contract. the appellant was requested to pay the aforesaid amounts under the relevant epc contracts on or before 10.03.2017 against each of the epc contracts and were informed that, in the event they failed to make payments on or before the said date, the appellant would have the right to set off the liquidated damages against any payment due to the appellant, and this letter was being issued without prejudice to the rights, approved rights or other rights of the first respondent under the epc contracts. the letter of the appellant dated 02.01.2017 shows that they themselves have attributed the delay in completion of the project to several factors, and have not confined it merely to the delay on the part of the ctc to supply the btg equipment. the first respondent claims that the appellant had caused delay in supply and erection of foundations, delay in construction of civil and steel structures, and delay in delivery of equipment; they failed to augment all necessary resources, skilled manpower, plant and tools; because of the failure of the appellant to execute works within time, the first respondent had to carry out certain works, and procure certain material and equipment, the cost of which was recoverable from the appellant; and they were also entitled to recover the costs incurred, towards de-scoping of works, labour cess, pending roads/drains/painting works and purchase of spare parts etc, from the appellant. these rival claims, by the appellant and the first respondent, that the other was responsible for the delay in completion of provisional acceptance test are also required to be considered by the arbitral tribunal, and are not matters for elaborate examination in an appeal arising out of an order passed in a section 9 petition. (c) clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of co-ordination agreement and clause 7 of the onshore agreement: sri d. prakash reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of the co-ordination agreement, which starts with a non-obstante clause, prohibit the appellant contractor being made liable for delay liquidated damages, if the delay is attributable to ctc; in terms of clause 7.2.2 of the on-shore services agreement, only the undisputed amount can be set off for late completion liquidated damages; neither the impugned notice dated 23.02.2017, nor any of its previous communications, contain any allegation that the appellant is not entitled for the benefits of the exclusionary clause; the appellant is, therefore, not legally required to plead that they do not fall under any one of the said exceptions; and, at any rate, the appellant has pleaded that, according to the co-ordination agreement, it is entitled for exclusion of the delay caused by the ctc in supply of the btg equipment. on the other hand sri c.v. mohan reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent, would submit that clauses 2.3 and 2.4 of the co-ordination agreement make it clear that the contractual obligations of the appellant, under the co-ordination agreement, were much wider than mere facilitating co-ordination between the first respondent and the ctc; in terms of the proviso to clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of the co-ordination agreement, the appellant is barred from claiming exclusion from liability for any delay liquidated damages and/or for delay in completion of provisional acceptance test for units 1 and 2, if such delay is attributable to them; in the present case the appellant has delayed completion of works; the appellant is, therefore, not entitled to claim exemption from liability simply by placing reliance on the introductory part of clauses 3.1 and 3.2; the appellant has not pleaded, in the section 9 petition, that it is not liable to pay delay liquidated damages because clause 3.1 (a) to (d) is not applicable; and the first respondent neither had the opportunity to rebut such a claim of the appellant nor could it have been expected to disclose its entire defense in its letter dated february 23, 2017, and to have stated that, despite the delay on the part of ctc, the appellant is liable to pay liquidated damages on account of application of clauses 3.1 (a) to (d) and 3.3 of the co-ordination agreement. clause 3 of the co-ordination agreement relates to breach or failure of the ctc and, under clause 3.1, notwithstanding anything contrary in the co-ordination agreement, the first respondent agreed that the appellant shall not be liable for delay, or for any delay liquidated damages, due to failure of the ctc to achieve the boiler, turbine and generator (btg) delivery dates on fob basis of 27 months from 5th march, 2012 for unit-i and 29 months from 5th march, 2012 for unit-ii (btg fob delivery), provided always that this exclusion would not apply if and where: (a) delay was attributable to the appellants lack of proper and timely coordination on shipping or transit or transportation of material from fob port of loading to unloading at the project site; or (b) delay was due to interfacing or lack of interfacing between the ctc and the appellant; or (c) the delay was attributable to the appellants breach or default of any of the contracts; or (d) the appellant did not make every reasonable effort to mitigate such delay. clause 3.2 provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the co-ordination agreement, the first respondent agreed that the appellant shall not be liable for delay in achieving and due completion of provisional acceptance tests for unit-1 by 10th november, 2015 and for unit-2 by 10th february, 2016, and if such delay and such non-achievement were solely due to the ctc, provided always that this exclusion would not apply if and where:(a) the appellant did not properly handle and/or store and/or install the btg equipment, material or components supplied by the ctc; or (b) delay was due to interfacing or lack of interfacing between the ctc and the appellant; or (c) the delay or such non-achievement of provisional acceptance tests for unit -1 by 10th november, 2015 and unit 2 by 10th february, 2016 was attributable to the appellants breach or default of any of the contracts; or (d) the appellant did not make every reasonable effort to mitigate the effect of such delay or non-achievement. clause 3.3 stipulated that, where any delay by the ctc in meeting the btg fob delivery dates set out in clause 3.1 did not fall under any of the exclusions set out in sub-clauses 3.1(a), (b), (c) and (d), or where any delay by the ctc, in meeting the performance test dates set out in clause 3.2, did not fall under any of the exclusions set out in clause 3.2(a), (b), (c) or (d), the appellant should be granted a day-for-day extension on the overall completion schedule without any entitlement to any damages for prolongation costs in respect of any part of the work under the contracts in respect of such extension of time. clause 3.3 places the onus of proving, that the delay was solely on account of ctc, on the appellant at all times. clause 4.1 stipulated that, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the contracts, the appellant agreed that any trigger for late completion liquidated damages, in any of the contracts, would automatically trigger all late completion liquidated damages payments under all the contracts unless such delays were attributable to the ctc under clauses 3.1 or 3.2; the amount of late completion liquidated damages per day of delay shall not exceed rs.1.56 crores for unit 1 and rs.1.04 crores for unit 2, and the total late completion liquidated damages under the contracts shall not exceed 10% of the aggregate of the contract prices. in terms of clause 4.1 the appellant agreed that it shall not be entitled for any extension of time beyond 10.11.2015 for unit -1 and 10.02.2016 for unit -2 or for any additional costs under the contracts or under the co-ordination agreement by reason of any failure or delay in deliveries based on sequential delivery schedule arrangements between the ctc and the first respondent; clause 4.4 of the co-ordination agreement permits the first respondent to draw on any performance security under any of the epc contracts, in case of any outstanding liability or claim of the first respondent against the appellant. article 7, of the on-shore service contract dated 10.04.2011, relates to late completion liquidated damages and extension of time. article 7.1, thereunder, stipulates that time is the essence of the contract with respect to each unit, the project and the contract; each unit shall achieve provisional taking over and final taking over by a date certain in accordance with clauses (a) to (d) thereunder. article 7.2 stipulates that, if the provisional acceptance does not occur by the scheduled completion date for each unit, the appellant shall pay to the first respondent, subject to the limitation set forth in article 9.1 as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, the amount of 0.5% of the contract price of each unit per week after the 30th calendar day by which the provisional acceptance for each unit is later than the scheduled completion date. this is subject to the timely sequential deliveries guaranteed under the owners supply (c & f) contract having been met and the delay in provisional acceptance not attributable to short supplies or failure during erection and commissioning of supplies under the owners supply (c & f) contract. article 7.2.2 stipulates that the appellant shall pay the late completion liquidated damages, required to be paid under article 7.2, monthly in arrears, against the first respondents debit note, by wire transfer on the tenth day of each month, with the last such payment to occur on provisional acceptance with respect to the facility; if the appellant is obligated to pay any late completion liquidated damages to the first respondent under article 7.2, and such undisputed amount is not paid within the time period referred to above, the first respondent shall have the right to offset any such amount against any amounts then or thereafter due from the first respondent to the appellant, or to exercise its rights against any security provided by the appellant, in such order as the first respondent may elect in its reasonable discretion. the construction of the aforesaid clauses, to determine whether or not the appellant is liable for liquidated damages, for the delay in achieving provisional acceptance test by the prescribed dates, is again a matter for the arbitral tribunal to consider. suffice it to note that clause 4.1 of the co-ordination agreement confers, on the first respondent, the right to claim late completion liquidated damages for each days delay subject to the limit of 10% of the aggregate of the contract price; and article 7.2.2 of the onshore service contract confers power on the first respondent to offset any amount due from them to the appellant, or to exercise their right against any security provided by the appellant, on failure of the appellant to pay late completion liquidated damages. (d) is non-supply of design coal, the reason for the appellants failure to achieve provisional acceptance test? sri d. prakash reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that article 5.7 of the onshore services contract stipulates that it is the duty of the first respondent to arrange for the specified fuel to be delivered to the site to enable the contractor to perform the start-up and testing of the facility; the fuel to be supplied by the first respondent was termed as design coal, which contains various technical specifications as mentioned in appendixx of the on-shore services contract; various parameters, stipulated under the epc contracts, entered into between the first respondent and the appellant for the performance guarantee tests, could not be achieved by the use of non-design coal; the performance guarantee tests could not be conducted since the respondent did not supply design coal, which is an essential ingredient for conducting the tests; the first respondent did not have the design coal, and only had supplies of indonesian coal; the first respondent itself sought a clarification, with respect to the suitability of indonesian coal from the ctc which supplied the btg equipment, vide its email dated 10.08.2015; the ctc, vide its email dated 24.08.2015, conveyed the opinion of the manufacturer of the boiler equipment i.e. harbin boiler company ltd. (hbc), and made it clear that it would lead to disastrous effects if they used anything other than design coal as specified in the contract; however, the first respondent continued to fire the non-design coal after synchronizing unit-1 on 26.05.2016; ctc sent an email dated 23.06.2016 to the first respondent, marking a copy to the appellant, stating that performance of the boiler would be affected because of the actions of the first respondent in firing non-design coal; the first respondent has used non-design coal in gross violation of the agreed terms and conditions, because of which the boiler equipment has already been damaged, and is not fit for performance guarantee tests; it is the responsibility of the supplier to test the performance of the boiler and related equipment, and the appellant is required to act merely as a facilitator for the conduct of the tests; in their letter dated 27.03.2017 the first respondent stated that coal was heterogeneous in nature, it could not exactly match the design coal, they had obtained, and were now holding sufficient quantity of the design coal and were willing to make available such design coal for the purposes of conducting the performance guarantee tests; and this was said after running the units commercially using non-design coal. on the other hand sri c.v. mohan reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent, would submit that the appellant has neither pleaded in the section 9 petition, nor have they proved on the basis of any supporting document, that the contractual conditions have been complied with by them till date; the appellant has not even issued a notice of provisional acceptance, supported with a preliminary report, to claim completion of provisional acceptance; at the stage of arguments it was contended, for the first time (without any pleading to that effect), that the preliminary report (which is to accompany the notice of provisional acceptance) could not be prepared because of non-supply of design coal by the first respondent to conduct the tests necessary to prepare the said report; such an argument has been made by the appellant without pointing out any document or material on record to establish that the appellant had requested the first respondent to supply design coal to enable them to conduct the tests necessary to prepare the preliminary report; they have neither mentioned in the petition details of the design coal that was to be used by the first respondent in terms of any agreed technical specification, nor have they explained how the actual coal, being used by the first respondent, did not match the design coal; the appellant has also failed to explain how alleged non-usage of design coal has adversely affected achievement of provisional acceptance; the allegation, regarding design coal, was made in the section 9 petition without filing any documents in its support; and some e-mail exchanges, regarding design coal, were belatedly filed by the appellant with their rejoinder only as an afterthought, and without prior permission of the court. clause 6.1 of the coordination agreement stipulates that any dispute, controversy, claim or difference or any kind between the appellant and the first respondent, whether found in contract, tort or otherwise, arising out of or relating to any of the, or all the, contracts and/or the coordination agreement, shall be referred to, at the written request of a party, to be resolved at a meeting of the chief executives of each party through mutual consultation and negotiation, such meeting to take place within fourteen days of the date of such notice being served on the other party. clause 6.2 stipulates that, if the parties fail to resolve such dispute, controversy, claim or difference by such mutual consultation and negotiation within the next thirty days, then any party may submit the dispute, controversy, claim or difference for resolution by arbitration at the request of either the appellant or the first respondent upon written notice to that effect to the other. clause 6.3 stipulates that such arbitration shall be finally and exclusively settled in accordance with the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996; and the place of arbitration shall be in hyderabad in india. clause 6.4 stipulates that the arbitration panel shall consist of three arbitrators; one to be appointed by the appellant and the other by the first respondent; and the two arbitrators, appointed by the parties, shall in turn jointly appoint the third arbitrator. the disputes, claims/differences arising out of any of the contracts or the coordination agreement are required, on failure of such dispute being resolved by mutual consultation and negotiation, to be resolved by an arbitral tribunal consisting of three arbitrators. disputes, such as whether the appellant is liable to pay liquidated damages; whether they are deemed to have achieved provisional acceptance consequent upon the first respondent having commenced commercial operations; whether the appellants delay in completing the project, and in achieving provisional acceptance, is because of the failure of the first respondent to supply design coal; whether the delay in supply of btg equipment by the ctc would absolve the appellant of payment of liquidated damages etc., all arise out of the contracts/coordination agreement, and are required to be resolved by way of arbitration before the arbitral tribunal. as both the appellant and the first respondent have already appointed an arbitrator each, the arbitral tribunal will, on appointment of the third arbitrator by both the arbitrators, proceed to resolve the disputes, arising under these contracts, between the appellant and the first respondent. it would be wholly inappropriate for us, therefore, to examine the rival claims of the appellant on the one hand, and the first respondent on the other, firstly because these are all matters for the arbitral tribunal to resolve; and, secondly, because the present appeal arises out of an order passed by the commercial court exercising jurisdiction under section 9 of the 1996 act. the jurisdiction of the commercial court was invoked by the appellant herein seeking interim measures under clause (ii) of section 9(1) of the 1996 act which enables the party, before or during arbitral proceedings, to request the court to grant an interim measure of protection which, in the present case, is to restrain the first respondent from invoking the bank guarantees furnished by the bank at the behest of the appellant. we must, therefore, confine our enquiry only to the question whether or not the bank guarantee, furnished by the bank to the first respondent at the behest of the appellant, is vitiated by fraud or special equities; and not to undertake an elaborate examination of whether or not there was a breach of the contracts by the appellant or the first respondent or even the ctc, and whether they had failed to perform their respective obligations under these contracts. vi. can the first respondent be a judge in its own cause and unilaterally hold the appellant responsible for the delay, and encash the bank guarantee towards their claim for delay liquidated damages? sri d. prakash reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that the amounts, claimed by the first respondent as liquidated damages, have been disputed by the appellant vide its letter dated 08.03.2017; the first respondent cannot be allowed to be a judge in its own cause, it cannot unilaterally invoke the performance guarantees, and set off the monies payable to the appellant, towards its false and disputed claim of liquidated damages; a claim for liquidated damages by a party is only a claim, and does not entitle the party to unilaterally adjust what it claims as liquidated damages from the amounts payable to the contractor; and in gangotri enterprises limited4 the supreme court, following raman iron foundry5, has held that, in the event the sum claimed by the beneficiary from the guarantor is in the nature of damages, which is not yet adjudicated upon in arbitration proceedings and which is not the sum admitted by the guarantor, injunction may be granted against encashment of the bank guarantee, subject to a prima-facie case being made out on merits that the guarantor has a strong ground to succeed in the arbitration or any competent forum of law. on the other hand sri c.v. mohan reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent, would submit that, under the epc contracts and the co-ordination agreement, the appellant is required to pay liquidated damages to the first respondent for delay in the agreed delivery schedule, and/or if the project does not achieve provisional acceptance by the specified dates; as the appellant failed to comply with their request for payment of liquidated damages, the first respondent has contractually and lawfully become entitled to encash the bank guarantees in lieu of liquidated damages for the delay; the argument that, as the amount of late completion liquidated damages has not been determined and is disputed, it needs to be adjudicated by the court, is erroneous and misplaced; in gangotri enterprises ltd.4, the respondent had sought to invoke the performance bank guarantees given by the appellant under a contract (which had been completed) for sums claimed in relation to another contract entered into with the appellant for which no performance guarantee was given; the respondent therein was restrained from encashing the performance bank guarantees given in an unrelated contract; and as, that is not the case herein, the present appeal should be decided on the basis of the guiding principles laid down by the supreme court in gujarat maritime board2 which was rendered subsequent to gangotri enterprises ltd.4. in raman iron foundry5, the scope of clause 18 of the general conditions of the contract, entered into by the central purchase organization of india for purchase of stores from third parties, arose for consideration. the tender for supply of certain quantity of foam compound was accepted by the appellant, and clause 18 of the agreement, which provided for recovery of sums due, read thus: 18. recovery of sums due: whenever any claim for the payment of a sum of money arises out of or under the contrat against the contractor, the purchaser shall be entitled to recover such sum by appropriating in whole or in part, the security, if any, deposited by the contractor, and for the purpose aforesaid, shall be entitled to sell and/or realise securities forming the whole or part of any such security deposit. in the event of the security being insufficient, the balance and if no security has been taken from the contractor, the entire sum recoverable shall be recovered by appropriating any sum then due or which at any time thereafter may become due to the contractor under the contract or any other contract with the purchaser or the government or any person contracting through the secretary, if such sum even be not sufficient to cover the full amount recoverable, the contractor shall on demand pay to the purchaser the balance remaining due. while the respondent contended that the appellant had committed the breach, the appellant contended that it was the respondent which had committed breach of contract, and was liable to pay damages to the appellant. on being called upon to make payment, the respondent failed to do so. the respondent filed an application under the arbitration act before the delhi high court. they also sought an injunction restraining the appellant from recovering the amount, claimed by them as damages, from the pending bills of the respondent. the claim of the respondent against the appellant, and the counter-claim of the appellant against the respondent, was the subject matter of reference to arbitration. during the pendency of the arbitration some amounts became payable by the appellant in respect of the contracts entered into between the parties. apprehending that the appellant would appropriate these amounts claimed by it, even though their claim for damages was disputed by the respondent, an application was made by the respondent requesting the delhi high court to restrain the appellant from recovering its claim for damages from the amounts due and payable to the respondent in respect of the pending bills. the delhi high court took the view that clause 18 did not authorise the appellant to appropriate the amounts of any pending bills of the respondent towards satisfaction of its claim for damages against the respondent, unless such claim for damages was either admitted by the respondent or adjudicated upon in an arbitration or in a suit before the civil court. aggrieved thereby, the appellant carried the matter in appeal to the supreme court which held that the claim for liquidated damages did not give rise to a debt until the liability was adjudicated, and the damages were assessed by a decree or order of a court or other adjudicatory authority; when there was a breach of contract, the party which committed the breach did not, eo instanti, incur any pecuniary obligation, nor did the party complaining of the breach become entitled to a debt due from the other party; the only right which the party aggrieved by the breach of the contract had, was the right to sue for damages; this was not an actionable claim; and the appellant was not entitled to recover the amount, of its claim for damages, by appropriating other sums due to the contractor under clause 18. encashment of a bank guarantee, which is a contract independent of the underlying agreement between the parties, was not in issue in raman iron foundry5. in gangotri enterprises ltd4, the respondent issued a letter of acceptance to the appellant and the contract agreement, which was signed pursuant thereto, required the work to be completed within the specified time. subsequently the appellant was entrusted a second work by the respondent-north central railway for construction of a new station building for which the appellant submitted a bank/performance guarantee from its bankers. since the work relating to the earlier contract was not completed, the respondent terminated the contract, invited fresh tenders, and allotted the remaining part of the work to another company. with respect to the second work, the appellant was given a completion certificate on completion of the works. the appellant requested the respondent-north central railway to return its bank guarantee, pursuant to which the respondent issued a circular directing all its departments to withhold payment to the appellant under the subsequent contract stating that the earlier contract was cancelled, and such cancellation had resulted in a loss of more than five and half crores. the respondent also sought encashment of the bank guarantee. the appellant invoked the arbitration clause, and then moved an application under section 9 of the 1996 act seeking injunction against encashment of the bank guarantee, contending that the respondent had no right to encash the bank guarantee furnished by the appellant in relation to a dispute arising out of another contract. the respondent, however, contended that clause 62(1) of the general conditions of contract enabled it to recover any dues from the appellant even if such claim was not for the sum due and sum payable; and it was a claim for damages, though disputed by the appellant, and remained to be adjudicated in a court. the supreme court relied on its earlier judgment in raman iron foundry5, and held that clause 62 of the contract in issue was identical to clause 18 of the contract in raman iron foundry5 which stipulated that the amounts to be forfeited or recovered may be deducted from any moneys then due or which, at any time thereafter, may become due to the contractor by the railways under this work or any other contract or otherwise; the arbitration proceedings, in relation to the earlier contract, was still pending; the sum claimed by the respondent from the appellant did not relate to the contract for which the bank guarantee had been furnished, but it related to another contract for which no bank guarantee had been furnished; the sum claimed by the respondent was in the nature of damages which was not yet adjudicated in the arbitration proceedings; the sum claimed was neither a sum due in the present, nor a sum payable by the respondent; it was not an admitted sum; and as the bank guarantee was in the nature of a performance guarantee furnished for executing the work under the subsequent contract, and the work having been completed to its satisfaction, the respondent had no right to encash the bank guarantee. the supreme court further held that the case on hand was similar to the facts in raman iron foundry5, and hence the law laid down in that case was applicable to the case before it; and both the learned counsel did not bring to their notice the law laid down in raman iron foundry5. in tarapore & co.3, the appellant awarded a contract to the respondent for construction of civil works in the visakhapatnam steel plant. the contract was to be completed within a specified duration. the respondent-contractor sought extension of time, but could not complete the work even during the extended period. disputes arose between them. the respondent appointed an arbitrator and the disputes were pending before the arbitrator. thereafter, by mutual agreement, the contract work was reduced, but this reduced work was also not completed within the extended time. at the request of the respondent, the contract period was extended further, despite which the work was not completed, resulting in the appellant rescinding the contract. on the very same day, on which the contract was rescinded, the appellant sought to invoke the bank guarantee and called upon the bank to pay the amounts thereunder. the petition for injunction, filed by the respondent under the arbitration act, was dismissed. thereafter, the respondent filed two revisions before this high court (a.p. high court). relying on the decision of the supreme court in raman iron foundry5, this high court held that any term in the agreement, that one of the parties shall be the sole judge to quantify the same, had to be held as invalid; the liability to pay damages would arise only after it was established that there was a breach of the contract; it was for the court or the arbitrator to decide as to who had committed the breach; and till the liability was ascertained, it could not be said that there was a debt due or debt owing. on these grounds, this high court rejected the contention, urged on behalf of the appellant, that it was the sole judge to decide as to whether the contractor had committed a breach of the contract, and what was the extent of damage caused to it. this high court further held that, in the absence of any determination by the court or the arbitrator, no amount could be said to be payable by the respondent to the appellant by way of damages; it was, therefore, just and proper to restrain the appellant from enforcing the bank guarantees; no irretrievable injustice would be caused to the appellant as it could recover damages, from the bank and the contractor, in case it succeeded in the case; and the interest of the appellant could be safeguarded by directing the contractor to keep on extending the bank guarantees till the matter was settled by the arbitrator. the appellant was restrained from enforcing the bank guarantee. aggrieved thereby, the appellant carried the matter in appeal and the supreme court, in tarapore & co3, observed: ..the high court also committed a grave error in restraining the appellant from invoking bank guarantees on the ground that in india only reasonable amount can be awarded by way of damages even when the parties to the contract have provided for liquidated damages and that a term in a bank guarantees making the beneficiary the sole judge on the question of breach of contract and the extent of loss or damages would be invalid and that no amount can be said to be due till and adjudication in that behalf is made either by a court on an arbitrator, as the case may be. in taking that view the high court has overlooked the correct position that a bank guarantees is a independent and distinct contract between the bank and the beneficiary and is not qualified by the underlying transaction and the primary contract between the person at whose instance the bank guarantee is given and the beneficiary. what the high court has observed would applicable only to the parties to the underlying transaction or the primary contract but can have no relevance to the bank guarantee given by the bank, as the transaction between the bank and the beneficiary is independent and of a different nature. in case of an unconditional bank guarantee the nature of obligation of the bank is absolute and not dependent upon any dispute or proceeding between the party at whose instance the bank guarantee is given and the beneficiary. the high court thus failed to appreciate the real object and nature of a bank guarantee. the distinction which the high court has drawn between a guarantee for due performance of a works contract and guarantee given towards security deposit for that contract is also unwarranted. the said distinction appears to be the result of the same fallacy committed by the high court of not appreciating the distinction between the primary contract between contract between the parties and a bank guarantee and also the real object of a bank guarantee and the nature of bank's obligation thereunder. whether the bank guarantee is towards security deposit or mobilisation advance or working funds or for due performance of the contract if the same is unconditional and if there is a stipulation in the bank guarantee that the bank should pay on demand without demur and that the beneficiary shall be the sole judge not only on the question of breach of contract but also with respect to the amount of loss or damages, the obligation of the bank would remain the same and that obligation has to be discharged in the manner provided in the bank gurantee. in general electric technical services company inc. vs. punj sons (p) ltd. (1991 (4) scc 230) while dealing with a case of bank guarantee given for securing mobilisation advance it has been held that the right of a contractor to recover certain amounts under running bills would have no relevance to the liability of the bank under the guarantee given by it. in that case also the stipulations in the bank guarantee were that the bank had to pay on demand without demur, and the beneficiary was to be the sole judge as regards the loss or damage caused to it. this court held that notwithstanding the dispute between the contractor and the party giving the contract, the bank was under an obligation to discharge its liability as per the terms of the bank guarantee. larsen and toubro limited vs. maharashtra state electricity board (6) scc 68 and hindustan steel workers construction ltd. vs. g.s. atwal & co (engineers) pvt. ltd. 1995 (6) scc 76 were also cases of work contracts wherein bank guarantees were given either towards advances or release of security deposits or for due, performance of the contract. in both those cases this court held that the bank guarantees being irrevocable and unconditional and as the beneficiary was made the sole judge on the question of breach of performance of the contract and the extent of loss or damages an injunction restraining the beneficiary from invoking the bank guarantees could not have been granted. the above referred three subsequent decisions of this court also go to show that the view taken by the high court is clearly wrong.. (emphasis supplied). in g.s. atwal & co. (engineers) pvt. ltd.18, the appellant and the respondent had entered into several contracts whereby the respondent was required to construct 11 schools in libya for which they had furnished two bank guarantees to the appellant. disputes arose between the appellant and the respondent regarding performance of the contract, resulting in a reference to arbitration. while the reference was pending, the respondent requested the court to grant injunction restraining the appellant from encashing the bank guarantees. an order of injunction was granted by the learned single judge of the calcutta high court taking the view that the second bank guarantee was a performance guarantee and, before invoking the same, the appellant was required to assess the quantum of loss and damages, and should mention the ascertained figure in the letter of invocation; and, if this was not so done, the guarantee could not be invoked. aggrieved thereby, the matter was carried in appeal. it is in this context that the supreme court observed that in the dispute, pending adjudication in arbitration between the appellant and the respondent, the bank was not a party; in case of confirmed bank guarantees/irrevocable letters of credit, the court would not interfere with the same unless there was fraud or irretrievable injury was involved; the bank guarantees required the bank to pay the amount without demur, and without requiring the appellant to invoke any legal remedy; it was further specifically provided that the appellant would be the sole judge of, and as to, whether the respondent, a party to the contract, had committed any breach; the decision of the appellant, as to the outstanding amount due, was final and binding; the bank guarantees, furnished by the bank to the appellant, were unconditional; the appellant was the sole judge regarding the question as to whether any breach of contract had occurred and, if so, the amount of loss to be recovered by the appellant from the respondent; the entire dispute was pending before the arbitrator; whether and if so what was the amount due to the appellant was to be adjudicated in the arbitration proceeding; and the reasoning of the learned single judge of the calcutta high court that, before invoking the performance guarantee, the appellant should assess the quantum of loss and damages, and mention the ascertained figure, was not a ground to restrain invocation of the bank guarantee. in ansal engineering projects limited1, the appellant sought an injunction, under the arbitration act, 1940 to restrain the respondent from invoking the bank guarantee. the contract was for construction of residential quarters. while a period was stipulated for its completion, the construction was not completed by then. the contract was terminated by the first respondent. as the respondent sought to encash the bank guarantee, after termination of the contract, the petitioner approached the delhi high court contending that the amount due and payable by the petitioner was required to be determined in the suit; and till then, the bank guarantee could not be invoked and payment could not be made. the delhi high court rejected the contentions and dismissed the petition. aggrieved thereby, the petitioner carried the matter in appeal to the supreme court. it is in this context that a three judge bench of the supreme court observed: it is settled law that bank guarantee is an independent and distinct contract between the bank and the beneficiary and is not qualified by the underlying transaction and the validity of the primary contract between the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given and the beneficiary. unless fraud or special equity exists, is pleaded and prime facie established by strong evidence as a triable issue, the beneficiary cannot be restrained from encashing the bank guarantee even if dispute between the beneficiary and the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given by the bank, had arisen in performance of the contract or execution of the works undertaken in furtherance thereof. the bank unconditionally and irrevocably promised to pay, on demand, the amount of liability undertaken in the guarantee without any demur or dispute in terms of the bank guarantee. the object behind is to inculcate respect for free flow of commerce and trade and faith in the commercial banking transactions unhedged by pending disputes between the beneficiary and the contractor. it is equally settled law that in terms of the bank guarantee the beneficiary is entitled to invoke the bank guarantee, and seek encashment of the amount specified in the bank guarantee. it does not depend upon the result of the decision in the dispute between the parties, in case of the breach. the underlying object is that an irrevocable commitment either in the form of bank guarantee or letters of credit solemnly given by the bank must be honoured ..it is next contended by shri g. nageshwara rao, learned counsel for the petitioner that unless the amount due and payable is determined by a competent court or tribunal by mere invocation of bank guarantee or letter of credit pleading that the amount is due and payable by the petitioner, which was disputed, cannot be held to be due and payable ina case. the court has yet to go into the question and until a finding after trial, or decision is given by a court or tribunal that amount is due and payable by the petitioner, it cannot be held to be due and payable. therefore, the high court committed manifest error of law in refusing to grant injunction as the petitioner has made out a prima facie strong case. we find no force in the contention. all the clauses of the contract of the bank guarantee are to be read together. bank guarantee/letters of credit is an independent contract between the bank and the beneficiary. it does not depend on the result of the dispute between the person on whose behalf the bank guarantee was given by the bank and the beneficiary. though the question was not elaborately discussed, it was in sum answered by this court in hindustan steel workers construction ltd. v. g.s. atwal & co. (engineers) pvt. ltd.. [1995] 6 scc 76 at 79. this court had held in part 6 that the entire dispute was pending before the arbitrator. whether, and if so, what is the amount due to the appellant was to be adjudicated in the arbitration proceedings. the order of the learned single judge proceeds on the basis that the amounts claimed were not and cannot be said to be due and the bank has violated the understanding between the respondent and the bank in giving unconditional guarantee to the appellant ..similarly, the reasoning of the learned single judge that, before invoking the performance guarantee, the appellant should assess the quantum of loss and damages and mention the ascertained figure cannot be put forward to restrain the appellant from invoking the unconditional guarantee. this reasoning would clearly indicate that the final adjudication is not a pre-condition to invoke the bank guarantee and that is not a ground to issue injunction restraining the beneficiary to enforce the bank guarantee.. (emphasis supplied) in sumac international ltd.,6, the appellant had entered into an agreement with the respondent to design and prepare an engineering layout, and to manufacture, procure and supply to the appellant the machinery and equipment for a complete sugar plant. the respondent was required to set-up the plant, and make it ready for commercial production, by the stipulated date. the agreement stipulated that time was the essence of the contract. in terms of the agreement, the respondent furnished bank guarantees to the appellant all of which were payable on demand. the respondent did not complete the project even within the extended period. the appellant cancelled the agreement, and claimed refund of the advance paid by it. it, thereafter, invoked the bank guarantees in respect of advance payment and the delivery guarantee. the respondent filed a petition under the arbitration act for appointment of an arbitrator, and two applications for interim relief seeking stay of encashment of the bank guarantees. on the application being dismissed by the civil court, they approached the allahabad high court, and an injunction was granted restraining the appellant from enforcing the bank guarantee. aggrieved thereby the appellant carried the matter in appeal and the supreme court followed its earlier judgment in singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7, wherein it was held that the bank which gives the guarantee is not concerned with the relations between the supplier and the customer, nor with the question whether the supplier had performed his contractual obligation or not, nor with the question whether the supplier is in default or not; and the bank must pay according to the tenor of its guarantee on demand without proof or condition. thereafter the supreme court, in sumac international ltd6, observed: . our attention was invited to a number of decisions on this issue -among them, to larsen & turbro ltd. v. maharashtra state electricity board & ors. (1995 [6] scc 58), hindustan steel workers construction ltd. v. g.s. atwal & co. (engineers) pvt. ltd. (1995 [6] scc 76) and to national thermal power corporation ltd. v. flowmore pvt. ltd. & anr. (1995 [4] scc 515). the latest decision is in the case of state of maharashtra & anr. v. m/s national construction company, bombay & anr. (jt 1996 [1] sc 156) where this court has summed up the position by stating, \"the rule is well established that a bank issuing a guarantee is not concerned with the underlying contract between the parties to the contract. the duty of the bank under a performance guarantee is created by the document itself. once the documents are in order the bank giving the guarantee must honour the same and make payment ordinarily unless their is an allegation of fraud or the like. the courts will not interfere directly or indirectly to withhold payment, otherwise trust in commerce internal and international would be irreparably damaged. but that does not mean that the parties to the underlying contract cannot settle the disputes with respect to allegations of breach by resorting to litigation or arbitration as stipulated in the contract. the remedy arising ex-contract is not barred and the cause of action for the same is independent of enforcement of the guarantee.\" the other recent decision is in hindustan steelworks construction ltd. v. tarapore & co. & anr. (jt 1996 [6] sc 295). clearly, therefore, the existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an injunction to restrain the enforcement of bank guarantees. there must be a fraud in connection with the bank guarantee. in the present case we fail to see any such fraud. the high court seems to have come to the conclusion that the termination of the contract by the appellant and his claim that the time was of the essence of the contract, are not based on the terms of the contract and, therefore, there is a fraud in the invocation of the bank guarantee. this is an erroneous view. the disputes between the parties relating to the termination of the contract cannot make invocation of the bank guarantees fraudulent.. (emphasis supplied). in gujarat maritime board2, the appellant invited bids for the development of a port and, pursuant thereto, a letter of intent was issued to the first respondent. the conditions of the loi required, among others, for lead promoters to submit a detailed project report and to obtain several clearances. towards performance guarantee, a bank guarantee of rs.5 crores (rupees five crores only) was required to be submitted to ensure submission of the detailed project report within twelve months, and obtaining environment and other clearances within 18 months, failing which the appellant was entitled to cancel the letter of intent, and the bank guarantees was to stand forfeited. when the appellant sought to invoke the bank guarantee, the first respondent invoked the jurisdiction of the gujarat high court which allowed the writ petition holding that, as there was a shift in the initial project envisaged in the letter of intent, the contention that forfeiture must follow notwithstanding any difficulty in execution of the contract could not be accepted; and the parameters, for avoiding payment of bank guarantee by the bank, could not be applied as, if the decision of the appellant to cancel the contract and to award the penalty of forfeiture was found to be erroneous and was set aside, the question of allowing the appellant to encash the bank guarantee would not arise. aggrieved thereby the appellant carried the matter in appeal, and it is in this context that the supreme court observed that the bank guarantee is an independent contract between the guarantor-bank and the guarantee-appellant; the guarantee was unconditional; no doubt, the performance guarantee was against the breach by the lead promoter viz. the first respondent, but between the bank and the appellant, the specific condition incorporated in the bank guarantee was that the decision of the appellant, as to the breach, was binding on the bank; and the justifiability of the decision was a different matter between the appellant and the first respondent. after referring briefly to its earlier judgment, in himadri chemicals industries ltd.21, the supreme court observed:..the guarantee given by the bank to the appellant contains only the condition that in case of breach by the lead promoter viz. the first respondent of the conditions of loi, the appellant is free to invoke the bank guarantee and the bank should honour it without any demur, merely on a demand from gmb (appellant) stating that the said lead promoter failed to perform the covenants. it has also been undertaken by the bank that such written demand from the appellant on the bank shall be conclusive, absolute and unequivocal as regards the amount due and payable by the bank under this guarantee. between the appellant and the first respondent, in the event of failure to perform the obligations under the loi dated 6-2-2008, the appellant was entitled to cancel the loi and invoke the bank guarantee. on being satisfied that the first respondent has failed to perform its obligations as covenanted, the appellant cancelled the loi and resultantly invoked the bank guarantee. whether the cancellation is legal and proper, and whether on such cancellation, the bank guarantee could have been invoked on the extreme situation of the first respondent justifying its inability to perform its obligations under the loi, etc. are not within the purview of an inquiry under article 226 of the constitution of india. between the bank and the appellant, the moment there is a written demand for invoking the bank guarantee pursuant to breach of the covenants between the appellant and the first respondent, as satisfied by the appellant, the bank is bound to honour the payment under the guarantee. .. (emphasis supplied) as noted hereinabove, in tarapore & co.3, the a.p. high court had, relying on the judgment of the supreme court in raman iron foundry5, observed that any term in the agreement, that one of the parties should be the sole judge to quantify damages, was invalid; and the liability to pay damages would arise only if there was a breach of the contract which was for the arbitrator to decide. this judgment of the a.p. high court, wherein reliance was placed on raman iron foundry5, was later set aside by the supreme court, in tarapore & co.3, holding that the bank guarantee was an independent and distinct contract, and was not qualified by the underlying transaction or the validity of the primary contract between the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given and the beneficiary; what the high court had observed would apply only to the parties to the underlying transaction or to the primary contract, but could have no relevance to the bank guarantee given by the bank, as the transactions between the bank and the beneficiary were independent, and of a different nature; and in the case of an unconditional bank guarantee, the nature of obligation of the bank was absolute, and was not dependent upon any dispute or proceeding between the party, at whose instance the bank guarantee was given, and the beneficiary. a similar view has been taken in the subsequent judgment of the supreme court in g.s. atwal & co. (engineers) pvt. ltd.18; ansal engineering projects ltd.1; sumac international ltd.,6; and gujarat maritime board2. reliance placed, on behalf of the appellant, on raman iron foundry5 and gangotri enterprises ltd.4, to contend that, till the claim of the first respondent for delay liquidated damages is adjudicated by the arbitral tribunal, there was no debt due justifying invocation of bank guarantee is only to be noted to be rejected. even otherwise in gangotri enterprises ltd.4 the bank guarantee furnished by the appellant was with respect to a contract which had been completed, but was sought to be encashed for failure of the same contractor to perform their obligations under another contract for which no bank guarantee was furnished. unlike in gangotri enterprises ltd.4, in the present case the bank guarantee sought to be encashed by the first respondent is on the basis of their claim that the appellant had failed to perform its obligation under the agreement for the performance of which these bank guarantees were furnished. further the law laid down by the two judge bench of the supreme court in gangotri enterprises ltd.4 runs contrary to the law declared by a three judge bench of the supreme court in ansal engineering projects ltd1. when conflicting judgments of the supreme court are brought to its notice, the high court is bound to follow the three judge bench judgment of the supreme court as against the judgment delivered by a two judge bench. as has been noted in the judgment in gangotri enterprises ltd.4 itself, the law laid down in raman iron foundry5 was not brought to the notice of the court by the learned counsel appearing for the parties. it is also evident that the fact that, in tarapore & co3, the supreme court had over-ruled the judgment of this high court (which had followed the judgment of the supreme court in raman iron foundry5), and had held that the contract of bank guarantee was independent of the underlying contract; and the beneficiary, while invoking the bank guarantee, could be the sole judge of the question of breach of contract was not brought to the notice of the supreme court in gangotri enterprises ltd.4. reliance placed on behalf of the appellant, on gangotri enterprises ltd.4, is therefore misplaced. the contentions that, a term in a bank guarantee making the beneficiary the sole judge on the question of breach of contract and the extent of loss or damages would be invalid, and no amount can be said to be due till an adjudication in that behalf is made either by a court or a arbitrator, would be applicable only to the parties to the underlying transaction or the primary contract, but can have no relevance to the bank guarantee given by the bank, as the transaction between the bank and the beneficiary is independent and of a different nature. in the case of an unconditional bank guarantee, the nature of obligation of the bank is absolute and not dependent upon any dispute or proceeding between the party at whose instance the bank guarantee is given and the beneficiary. (tarapore & co.3; g.s. atwal & co. (engineers) pvt. ltd.18; ansal engineering projects ltd.1). where the bank gurantee is irrevocable and unconditional, and the beneficiary is made the sole judge on the question of breach of performance of the contract and the extent of loss or damages, an injunction restraining the beneficiary from invoking the bank guarantees cannot be granted. (tarapore & co.3; larsen and toubro limited17; g.s. atwal & co (engineers) pvt. ltd.18). notwithstanding the dispute between the contractor and the party giving the contract, the bank is under an obligation to discharge its liability as per the terms of the bank guarantee. (tarapore & co.3; general electric technical services company inc. v. punj sons (p) ltd. ). whether the bank guarantee is unconditional or if there is a stipulation in the bank guarantee that the bank should pay on demand without demur or that the beneficiary shall be the sole judge not only on the question of breach of contract but also with respect to the amount of loss or damages, the obligation of the bank would remain the same. this obligation must be discharged in the manner provided in the bank gurantee. (tarapore & co.3). the bank guarantee/letter of credit does not depend on the result of the dispute between the person on whose behalf the bank guarantee was given by the bank and the beneficiary. the final adjudication is not a pre-condition to invoke the bank guarantee, and that is not a ground to issue injunction. (tarapore & co.3; g.s. atwal & co. (engineers) pvt. ltd.18; ansal engineering projects ltd.1). the duty of the bank, under the guarantee, is created by the document itself. once the documents are in order, the bank giving the guarantee must ordinarily honour the same and make payment. courts will not interfere directly or indirectly to withhold payment, otherwise trust in commerce (internal and international) would be irreparably damaged. but that does not mean that the parties to the underlying contract cannot settle the disputes with respect to allegations of breach by resorting to litigation or arbitration as stipulated in the contract. the remedy arising ex contractu is not barred, and the cause of action for the same is independent of enforcement of the guarantee. (sumac international ltd.6; national construction co.11; tarapore & co.3; united commercial bank12; centax (india) ltd.10; icici bank ltd13; singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7). vii. fraud: sri d. prakash reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that, if their claim was genuine, the first respondent would have imposed liquidated damages in the monthly bills of the appellant as required under the contracts; two days after commencement of commercial operations of unit-ii, the first respondent made a false claim for liquidated damages for the alleged delay in execution of the works by the appellant; this conduct is fraudulent, and a false claim is made only to avoid making payment of the amounts legitimately due to the appellant, and to encash the performance guarantees illegally; and the first respondent has simultaneously claimed liquidated damages from the appellant and ctc, though the entire delay is attributable to ctc alone. on the other hand sri c.v. mohan reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent, would submit that the delay liquidated damages are claimed under two contracts which are neither inter-linked/connected nor dependent on each other; the quantum of damages has been calculated on the basis of different contract prices, and different number of days of delay in completing separate works; and the appellant has not established fraud, much less a fraud in relation to the contract of bank guarantee which is independent of the underlying contract; it is not even the case of the appellant that the first respondent had obtained bank guarantees from the banks on the basis of fraudulent representations, and the banks had knowledge of such fraud when it issued the bank guarantees; simultaneous letters claiming liquidated damages from ctc and the appellant does not constitute fraud; and it may, possibly, be considered a disputed question regarding liability for liquidated damages which can only be the subject matter of arbitration. the fraud must be in connection with the bank guarantee itself. (sumac international ltd6). if the bank detects, with a minimal investigation, the fraudulent action of the beneficiary, payment can be refused. (edward owen engineering ltd.9; singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7). as a bank guarantee constitutes an agreement between the banker and the principal, albeit, at the instance of the promisor, it is primarily for the bank to plead a case of fraud when a contract of guarantee is sought to be invoked, and not for a promisor to set up a case of breach of contract. (techtrans construction india pvt ltd & ksheeraabad constructions pvt. ltd.20; reliance salt ltd. v. cosmos enterprises ; sumac international limited6; icici bank ltd13). in dwarikesh sugar industries ltd.30, the supreme court held:coming to the allegation of fraud, it is an admitted fact that in the plaint itself, there was no such allegation. it was initially only in the first application for the grant of injunction that in a paragraph it has been mentioned that the appellant herein had invoked the bank guarantee arbitrarily. this application contains no facts or particulars in support of the allegation of fraud. a similar bald averment alleging fraud is also contained in the second application for injunction relating to bank guarantee no. 40/47. this is not a case where defendant 1 had at any time alleged fraud prior to the filing of injunction application. the main contract, pursuant to which the bank guarantees were issued, was not sought to be avoided by alleging fraud, nor was it at any point of time alleged that the bank guarantee was issued because any fraud had been played by the appellant. we have no manner of doubt that the bald assertion of fraud had been made solely with a view to obtain an order of injunction. in the absence of established fraud and not a mere allegation of fraud and that also having been made only in the injunction application, the court could not, in the present case, have granted an injunction relating to the encashment of the bank guarantees.. (emphasis supplied) pleadings are only allegations or averment of facts. mere pleading do not make a strong case of prima facie fraud. the material and evidence has to show it. (svenska handelsbanken16). a mere allegation in the pleadings that the contractee, fraudulently, invoked the bank guarantee would not amount to establishing clear fraud or fraud of an egregious nature. (techtrans construction india pvt ltd & ksheeraabad constructions pvt. ltd.20; himadri chemicals industries limited21). fraud, like any other charge of a criminal offence whether made in civil or criminal proceedings, must be established beyond reasonable doubt. a finding as to fraud cannot be based on suspicion and conjecture. (svenska handelsbanken16; a.l.n. narayanan chettyar v. official assignee, high court rangoon ). unless fraud is pleaded and, prime facie, established by strong evidence as a triable issue, the beneficiary cannot be restrained from encashing the bank guarantee even if the dispute between the beneficiary and the person, at whose instance the bank guarantee was given by the bank, had arisen in the performance of the contract or execution of the works undertaken in furtherance thereof. (ansal engineering projects ltd.1). the established exception to the contractual obligations of the confirming bank to the seller, is that where the seller, for the purpose of drawing on the credit, fradulently presents, to the confirming bank, documents that contain (expressly or by implication) material representations of fact that to his knowledge are untrue. this exception of fraud on the part of the beneficiary, seeking to avail himself of the credit, is a clear application of the maxim ex trupi cause non oritur actio or 'fraud unravels all', the courts will not allow their process to be used by a dishonest person to carry out a fraud. (singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7; ucm (investment)8). the disputes between the parties, relating to the termination of the contract, cannot make invocation of the bank guarantees fraudulent, nor is it a ground for issuing an injunction to restrain the enforcement of the bank guarantees. (sumac international ltd.6). clear fraud, of which the bank has notice, is an exception to the rule that the bank guarantee must be honoured in accordance with its terms. (sumac international ltd.6; singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7). a fraud, in connection with a bank guarantee, should be such as to vitiate its very foundation. if there is such a fraud, of which the beneficiary seeks to take advantage, he can be restrained from doing so. (dwarikesh sugar industries ltd.30; svenska handelsbanken16; larsen & toubro ltd.17; g.s. atwal & co. (engineers) (p) ltd.18 and sumac international ltd.6). the bank's obligations do not extend to protect the person responsible for the fraud. but, the banker must be sure of his ground before declining to pay. the nature of the fraud that the courts talk about is fraud of an \"egregious nature as to vitiate the entire underlying transaction\". (edward owen engineering ltd.9; singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7). the fraud perpetrated would be of an egregious nature when it is of a gross nature which shakes the conscience of the court, and the said fraud is known to the parties, including the party representing as well as the bank. (bhandari engineers and builders pvt. ltd. v. vijaya bank ). the court would be slow in granting an order of injunction, restraining realisation of a bank guarantee, except when it is clearly shown that a fraud of a grievous nature has been committed and to the notice of the bank. (millenium wires (p) ltd.31; icici bank ltd13). commission of fraud must be confined to acts committed by a party to a contract with the intention to deceive another party or to induce him to enter into a contract. fraud, which vitiates the contract, must have a nexus with the acts of the parties prior to entering into the contract. subsequent breach of contract on the part of a party would not vitiate the contract itself. (reliance salt ltd.35; icici bank ltd13). fraud, which vitiates the contract, must have a nexus to the acts of the parties prior to entering into the contract. no such allegation is made by the appellant in the petition filed by them under section 9 of the 1996 act. they have not even stated that the bank-guarantees were obtained by fraud. fraud alleged against the contractee is under the contract between the contractor and the contractee. (icici bank ltd13). an injunction may be granted where it is proved that the bank knew that any demand for payment already made, or which may thereafter be made, will clearly be fraudulent. the evidence must be clear, both as to the fact of fraud and as to the banks knowledge. it would, normally, not be sufficient that this rests on the uncorroborated statement of the customer, for irreparable damage can be done to a banks credit in the relatively brief time which must elapse between the granting of such an injunction, and an application by the bank to have it discharged. (dwarikesh sugar industries ltd.30; bolivinter oil sa15; singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd7; millenium wires (p) ltd.31; icici bank ltd13; techtrans construction india pvt ltd & ksheeraabad constructions pvt. ltd.20; sumac international ltd.6). it is not the bank which is pleading fraud, but the appellant at whose behest the bank had furnished the bank-guarantees to the first respondent. the appellant has not even stated, in the petition filed by them before the commercial court, that the fraud, allegedly committed by the first respondent, was to the knowledge of the banks. vague allegations of fraud cannot form the basis for grant of an injunction restraining invocation of the bankguarantee. the duty cast on the banks is created by the bank guarantee itself, and they are not concerned with the underlying contract between the appellant and the first respondent. (icici bank ltd13). as noted hereinabove, fraud must not only be pleaded but must also be established. the fraud must be in connection with the bank guarantee itself. it must also be established that the bank knew that any demand for payment already made, or which may thereafter be made, will be clearly fraudulent. the duty cast on the bank to make payment on demand is in terms of the bank guarantee itself, and is not related to the underlying contract between the person at whose behest the bank guarantee was furnished and the beneficiary. further the fraud must be of an egregious nature which shocks the conscience of the court. such fraud must be known to the parties and to the bank. the appellant does not allege fraud on the part of the first respondent in obtaining the bank guarantee. their entire case is founded on the allegation that the first respondent made a false claim for liquidated damages in execution of the works by the appellants two days after the commencement of commercial operations of unit ii, and such a false claim was made only to avoid making payment of the amounts due to the appellant, and to illegally encash the bank guarantee. the appellant alleges fraud because the first respondents claim for liquidated damages is contrary to the terms of the underlying contract. the amounts which the appellant claims as due to them is also based on their claim of having performed their obligations under the primary contracts. it is not even pleaded by the appellant, much less proved, that the first respondent had fraudulently obtained the bank guarantee. it is evident, therefore, that the first exception to rule against grant of injunction for invocation of bank guarantee, i.e., the bank guarantee has been obtained by fraud, is not attracted. viii. special equities: sri d. prakash reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that the expression extraordinary special equities, or irretrievable injustice / injury, have such meaning as may be justified with reference to the facts and circumstances of each case; the expression special equities extends to cases which would prick the judicial conscience of the court; issues and disputes, arising out of the parent/underlying contract, can be looked into in order to ascertain whether or not special equities exist in favour of the party seeking injunction; the total amount which would be wrongfully gained by the first respondent, by its wrongful exercise of unilaterally adjusting monies towards liquidated damages, would be around rs.700.00 crores; this would cause severe and irreparable loss to the appellant, its liquidity and its entire business as such a huge amount would be wiped out from its available cash flows; this could also result in the account of the appellant becoming a nonperforming asset, besides crippling their business; on the other hand, if stay on unilateral adjustment of such amounts and invocation of performance guarantees is granted, the first respondent would be well protected as the bank guarantees would be kept alive; the appellant also undertakes to keep the bank guarantees alive throughout the period of arbitration, and is also willing to furnish a bank guarantee for the interest amount calculated at the rate offered by banks, ordinarily, on savings; the appellant has already invoked the arbitration clause; it has issued arbitration notice on 27.05.2017, and has appointed justice cyriac joseph (former judge of the supreme court) as its nominee arbitrator; the first respondent has also replied to the arbitration notice, and has appointed justice t.s. thakur (former chief justice of india) as their nominee arbitrator vide their letter dated 25.06.2017; the interests of the parties would be well protected, and the ends of justice met, if encashment of the bank guarantee is injuncted pending the decision of the arbitral tribunal; and the appellant would not be able to recover damages from the first respondent as all the assets of the first respondent have been mortgaged to its secured creditors, it has been suffering abnormally escalating losses, etc. learned senior counsel would also submit that the appellant would not be able to recover the said monies from the first respondent even if they succeed before the arbitral tribunal; the directors report, of the first respondent for the year 20152016, establishes that the first respondent made a loss of rs.15.48 crores for the year ending 31.03.2015, and by the year ending 31.03.2016 the losses jumped to more than rs.42.76 crores; the audited balance sheet of the first respondent for the year 20162017, as e-mailed by the officer of the first respondent upon the request of their shareholder, establishes that the first respondent has suffered losses of around rs. 328.46 crores during the financial year 2016-17; the accumulated losses of the first respondent, for the three years 2014-15 to 2016-17, exceed rs.386.49 crores; it is clear that they have been supplying electricity incurring huge losses, and the losses would continue to mount year on year; the details of the mortgaged assets in the directors report, and the audited balance sheet, establish that all its movable and immovable assets have been mortgaged to banks/secured creditors against loans exceeding rs.6000 crores; even the performance bank guarantees, furnished by the appellant, have been assigned by the first respondent to the banks; they do not have any other independent assets, the main promoter of the first respondent i.e., sembcorp pte ltd is a singapore based company, and holds 88% shares in it; the first respondent is distinct and independent of its parent company; and the secured debt of banks would take priority over any other debt, including the amounts that would be payable to the appellant by the first respondent, in the event of their succeeding in the arbitration proceedings. learned senior counsel would further submit that the balance sheet of the first respondent for the year 2016-17 reflects retention moneys of rs.304 crores, and rs.27 crores towards unpaid bills payable by the first respondent to the appellant; the letters dated 02.02.2017 and 31.03.2017 sent by the first respondent itself shows that the amount payable to the appellant, including the retention money and running account bills, are rs.367.47 crores; the maximum liquidated damages that can be claimed is already retained by the first respondent from the amounts payable to the appellant; if the first respondent is allowed to encash the bank guarantees illegally, they would be in possession of more than rs.700 crores (rs. 367.47 crores + rs. 343.1 crores) belonging to the appellant; the future of thermal electricity generating companies is bleak as supply is far in excess of demand; in view of the drastic fall in the price of power being sold by generating companies, particularly renewable energy, most of the thermal power companies are not able to recover even the cost of fuel, let alone the interest cost payable to the lenders, and the employee costs; rating agencies, including crisil, estimate that around 46,000 mw of power generation projects (36,000 mw coal-based and 10,000 mw gas based) are in distress, and loans to these projects, of around rs.2.1 lakh crores, is at complete risk; none of the cases, cited by the first respondent, have dealt in detail with the aspect of special equities/irretrievable injury or damages in close reference to the facts of the present case; and the appellant herein is substantially relying on the exceptions relating to special equities and irretrievable damage that would be caused to the appellant in the event illegal encashment of the bank guarantees are permitted. on the other hand sri c.v. mohan reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent, would submit that no case of irretrievable/irreparable injury was pleaded, or established. by the appellant to seek an injunction against encashment of the bank guarantees; the nature of irretrievable injury, required to be established in the case of bank guarantees, must be of the nature referred to in itek corporation v. first national bank of boston ; in the present case, admittedly, the facility is into commercial operation and is generating revenue; the appellant has an adequate remedy available in law, in the form of arbitration, to recover its dues, if any, from the first respondent; the first respondents parent company i.e sembcorp utilities pvte. limited has extended its corporate guarantee (to the tune of rs. 7604 crores) as part of the overall security package to the lenders, which covers the term loan and the working capital facilities enjoyed by the first respondent; in addition, sembcorp utilities pvte. limited has infused rs. 4,240 crores into the first respondent to repay part of the term loan facilities, and to support the cash flows; this demonstrates the parent companys commitment towards the projects, and forms the back-bone of the first respondents financial resources; due to the delay caused by the appellant, the first respondent has already suffered irretrievable losses in terms of reputation and business, monetary losses, including payment of interest during construction to its lenders, cost overruns over and above the project cost, increase in preoperative expenses, payment of penalty to power grid corporation of india limited, the telangana discom due to delay in evacuation of power, and krishnapatnam port company limited under a port services agreement; due to various delays, inactions, omissions and breach of its contractual obligations by the appellant, the first respondent has incurred losses which are recoverable from the appellant, including costs incurred towards de-scoping of works from the contract price, labour cess, pending roads/drains/painting works and purchase of spare parts etc; such costs/losses are of a value which exceeds the pre-estimated liquidated damages; in the event injunction is granted by this court, it is the first respondent which would suffer further irretrievable injury, and not the appellant; most of the averments/submissions made by the appellant, claiming special equities in its favour, are also disputed questions of fact, and ought to be dealt with in the arbitration; the appellant has not filed any supporting document, along with the section 9 petition, to establish special equities; it was only when the first respondent pointed this out in its counter to the section 9 petition that, as an afterthought, the appellant has filed additional documents along with its reply thereto; the first respondent has always been, and continues to be committed to, making regular payments to the appellant, subject to their achieving the respective payment milestones; all dues have been paid till date; in terms of the payment terms, agreed under appendix b of the epc contracts, nothing is due till successful achievement of the provisional acceptance of units 1 and 2, as evidenced by the issuance of the provisional acceptance certificate by the first respondent; the appellant has deliberately not mentioned that payment, under the epc contracts, were progressive in nature and dependant on completion of the respective milestones; payment, which was to become due upon successful completion of the milestone of provisional acceptance, has not become due as on date since provisional acceptance has not been achieved by the appellant; since the conditions stipulated in article 6.3 has not been satisfied, and provisional acceptance has not been achieved as on date, the said amount is not payable to the appellant; the amounts, mentioned in the first respondents letter dated february 02, 2017, are not retention amounts, but milestone payments which are to be paid only upon successful completion of the milestone of provisional acceptance test, and not otherwise; and the same ought not to be treated as an admission of outstanding liability by the first respondent to the appellant. in gammon-ojsc mosmetrostroy jv v. chennai metro rail limited , the madras high court held:.it is claimed that 60% of the work was already completed by joint venture and therefore, the remaining work to be completed is only 37%. even to complete the said work, the lead party namely gammon sought permission from cmrl to exercise the step in right as contemplated under clause 19.11. the said request was not considered by cmrl for various reasons. admittedly, the cmrl has extended the time for completion of the contract and the extended time has not admittedly expired on the date of issuing the termination order. the gammon has not simply sought for permission to bring in a third party by exercising the step in right without making any bonafide attempt. on the other hand, it is a matter of fact that gammon sought to bring in an italian company for completing the remaining work. this was also not considered by cmrl. such attempt of gammon certainly, show the bonafide on their part in completing the project. it is also claimed that the cmrl has not settled some bills in respect of the works already completed to the tune of rs. 100 crores. however, this claim is denied by cmrl by stating that the applicant cannot expect cmrl to pump in a sum of rs. 100 crores when the jv has admittedly failed and its jv partner had abandoned the project. needless to say that this claim by the applicant and denial by the respondent is a matter to be gone into by the arbitral tribunal. these are all the facts prima facie indicate that termination of the contract followed by the attempt to invoke the bank guarantee would certainly cause irretrievable injury to the applicant. inspite of all those facts, if injunction is refused, in my considered view, it would cause to the applicant not only an irretrievable injury but also irretrievable injustice. in fact, the very termination of contract, not stayed by this court, has already caused irretrievable injury. whether termination is valid or not is to be decided by the arbitral tribunal. however, as the termination, not stayed by this court has caused irretrievable injury to the applicant, pending disposal of the arbitral proceedings, further injury can be averted by granting the injunction against invoking bank guarantees. it should also be noted that not granting of stay of termination by this court in this proceedings is not based on merits of the rival contentions of the parties, but on the reason that termination has already come into force and staying the same would revive the party to their original position. further, it is a matter of fact that already the cmrl has invoked two bank guarantees which are the subject matter in other two applications in application nos. 730 & 733 of 2015. as the bank guarantees have been invoked in those matters, those applications were dismissed by this court on 07.08.2015. .admittedly, the bank guarantees given by the applicant are alive and the cmrl can at any time, invoke the same. therefore, the interest of the cmrl is well protected by the bank guarantees furnished by the applicant. if those bank guarantees are continued to be alive during the arbitral proceedings and even thereafter, during the pendency of the proceedings under section 34 of the said act, the interest of the cmrl is in no way be affected or prejudiced. on the other hand, if the bank guarantees are invoked in the mean time, certainly, the applicant would be put to great financial strain as the concerned banks which had given bank guarantee would ultimately, bounce upon the applicant to pay the money. in my considered view, this would certainly make the applicant to suffer even before the arbitral tribunal decides the main dispute between the parties (emphasis supplied) in p.d. alkaram pvt. ltd. v. canara bank , the delhi high court held:the plaintiff has also placed on record sufficient material, in the form of various invoices issued by m/s. hindalco industries ltd.; bill-wise details of aluminium procured, corresponding to drawings filed per annexure p-1 (colly.), which, prima facie, shows that it had procured fabrication material worth more than rs.20 lacs, advanced by the defendant. in the light of this material, over-emphasis of learned counsel for the defendant on the above extracted last part of the plaintiff's letter dated 29 may 1996, to the effect that it would start mobilising itself for the job only when the site is ready, renders it of no substance. it may not be out of place to mention that during the course of hearing it was suggested to learned counsel for the defendant that the purchased material stated to be lying at the premises of the plaintiff may be got inspected by the defendant and if deemed fit it could be released to the defendant for being used in the building under construction. it seems that the inspection was carried out because it was stated at the bar by learned counsel for the defendant that the material was not complete and it was on that plea that the defendant did not show any interest in the material. in this view of the matter, plaintiff's pleas of defendant's failures and fraudulent misrepresentation apart, to be dealt with on merits later in due course, when the plaintiff prima facie, seems to have utilised the entire mobilization advance for procuring the material for use on the defendant's building, as per the approved specifications, i feel that the plaintiff has successfully brought out special circumstances which are sufficient to make the present case an exceptional one justifying interference by restraining defendant no.2 from enforcing the bank guarantee in question. as a matter of fact having gained knowledge that the plaintiff has procured substantial material, even invocation of the bank guarantee after oral termination of the contract appears to be fraudulent. bearing in mind all these factors, i find that special equities are in favor of the plaintiff and if the defendant is allowed to encash the bank guarantee in question, it would amount to irretrievable injustice to the plaintiff. i am, therefore, satisfied that it is a fit case where defendant no.1 needs being interdicted from encashing the bank guarantee in question (emphasis supplied). in hindustan construction co. ltd.14, the supreme court held:..we have scrutinised the facts pleaded by the parties in respect of both the bank guarantees as also the documents filed before us and we are, prima facie, of the opinion that the lapse was on the part of the defendants who were not possessed of sufficient funds for completion of the work. the allegation of the defendants that hccl itself had abandoned the work does not, prima facie, appear to be correct and it is for this reason that we are of the positive view that the special equities are wholly in favour of hccl (emphasis supplied) in universal publishers pvt. ltd. v. australian executor trustees limited , the supreme court of new southwales held:.according to aets audited accounts for the year ended 30 june 2013, it had net assets of $33,029. aet however is a trustee. it is said that it holds the land at macquarie park as custodian for hyperion properties syndicates limited which in turn is a responsible entity of a managed investment scheme. prima facie, aet would be entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the trust, that is the managed investment scheme, in respect of liabilities it properly incurred in discharge of its functions as trustee. there is nothing to suggest that it would not be entitled to such an indemnity if it were liable to pay damages or to make restitution to universal if it received payment under the bank guarantee but it was ultimately found that universal had not been in breach of the lease. if that were the conclusion at the final hearing, it does not appear that aets right of indemnity out of the trust assets to meet its liability to pay damages or to make restitution would be sufficient to provide it with the funds to pay damages or makes restitution. if the bank guarantee were called on and aet spent the money as it evidently proposes to do on site remediation, but it was held at a final hearing that universal was not in breach of the lease, then it appears likely that aet would not be able to meet an award of damages for restitution. i conclude that damages are unlikely to be an adequate remedy if it were ultimately held that aet was not entitled to call on the bank guarantee. this is the governing consideration also when deciding where the balance of convenience lies.. (emphasis supplied). in gammon39, the madras high court was of the view that completion of 60% of the work by gammon, termination of the contract by the respondent before expiry of the extended time for completion of the contract, and the bonafide attempt of gammon to bring in an italian company to complete the remaining work, were all factors which, prima facie, indicated that the termination of the contract, followed by the attempt to invoke the bank guarantee, would cause irretrievable injury to gammon. in p.d. alkaram pvt. ltd40, the delhi high court opined that the documents placed on record, prima facie, showed that the plaintiff had procured fabrication material from the amounts advanced by the defendant; the plaintiff had, prima facie, utilized the entire mobilization advance for procuring material for being used on the defendants building as per the approved specification; and these factors constituted special equities in favour of the plaintiff. in hindustan construction company ltd14, the supreme court was, prima facie, of the opinion that the defendants did not possess sufficient funds for completion of the work; their allegation that the appellant had abandoned the work did not, prima facie, appear to be correct; and they were of the view that special equities were wholly in favour of the appellant. as noted hereinabove, the supreme court, in hindustan construction company ltd14, was satisfied that the subject bank guarantees were neither unconditional nor unequivocal. as the supreme court was satisfied that invocation of bank guarantee was subject to fulfillment of certain conditions in the underlying contract, it took note of the dispute between the parties, under the said contract, to examine whether there were special equities in favour of the appellant. in universal publishers pvt. ltd41, the supreme court of new south wales observed that the respondent would not be able to meet an award of damages for restitution; and damages were unlikely to be an adequate remedy if it were ultimately held that the respondent was not entitled to call on the bank guarantee. as shall be detailed hereinafter, the supreme court, in sumac international ltd6, has held that irretrievable injury must be of the kind which was the subject matter of the decision in itek corporation38. before doing so, it would be useful to understand what constitutes special equities and irretrievable injustice/injury, as it is only if they are in favour of the appellant, would this court be justified in restraining the first respondent from invoking the bank guarantees. the expression 'extraordinary special equities', or 'irretrievable injustice/injury', are not defined expressions. a case of special equities, in all circumstances, may not be a case of irretrievable injustice/injury. (continental construction ltd.33). however, special circumstances, such as there is a serious dispute on the question as to who has committed breach of the contract, or the contractor has a counter claim against the contractee, or the dispute between the parties has been referred to the arbitrators, or that no amount can be said to be due and payable by the contractor to the contractee till the arbitrator declares their award, are not sufficient to make the case exceptional justifying interference by restraining the contractee from enforcing the bank guarantees. (tarapore & co.3). an irrevocable commitment, either in the form of confirmed bank guarantee or irrevocable letter of credit, cannot be interfered with expect when a case of apprehension of irretrievable injustice has been made out. (tarapore & co.3; singh consultants & engineers (pvt.) ltd7). cases of grant of injunction, restraining enforcement of the bank guarantee, arise when allowing encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties. since, in most cases, payment of money under such a bank guarantee would adversely affect the bank, and its customer at whose instance the guarantee is given, the harm or injustice contemplated under this head must be of such an exceptional and irretrievable nature as would override the terms of the guarantee, and the adverse effect of such an injunction on commercial dealings in the country. (dwarikesh sugar industries ltd.30; svenska handelsbanken16; larsen & toubro ltd.17; g.s. atwal & co. (engineers) (p) ltd.18 and sumac international ltd.6). a mere apprehension, that the other party will not be able to pay, is not enough. (sumac international ltd.6; singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7). for irretrievable injury to result, the circumstance must be such which would make it impossible for the guarantor to reimburse himself, if he ultimately succeeds, or when irretrievable harm or injustice, to one of the parties concerned, has resulted. this should be decisively established, and it must be proved to the satisfaction of the court that there would be no possibility, whatsoever, of recovery of the amount from the beneficiary, by way of restitution. (dwarikesh sugar industries ltd.30; millenium wires (p) ltd.31; icici bank ltd13). the question, which necessitates examination, is whether the appellant has made out a case of irreparable injury, by proof of special equities for the court to grant injunction to restrain the first respondent from encashing the bank guarantee. as noted hereinabove, mere apprehension that the first respondent would not able to repay the amounts, which it would receive on encashment of the bank guarantees, is not enough to restrain them from invoking the bank guarantees. the appellant claims that they would also suffer huge loss if the first respondent were to unilaterally adjust the amount claimed as liquidated damages, with the amounts they would receive on encashment of the bank guarantees. this would, also, not constitute special equities justifying grant of an order of injunction restraining the first respondent from encashing the bank guarantees. the allegation that the first respondent has suffered a loss of rs.328.46 crores, during the financial year 2016-17, is based on the figures reflected in their provisional balance sheet, which had not been approved by their shareholders. while this accumulated loss of the first respondent, for the three years 2014-15 to 2016-17, is highlighted as exceeding rs.386.49 crores, and emphasis is placed by the appellant on the fact that the movable and immovable assets of the first respondent have been mortgaged to the banks/secured creditors against loans exceeding rs.6,000 crores, it is contended, on behalf of the first respondent, that its parent company-sembcorp utilities pte ltd has extended a corporate guarantee of rs.7,604 crores as part of the overall security package to the lenders, which covers the term loan and the working capital facilities enjoyed by the first respondent; and, in addition, they had infused rs.4,240 crores into the first respondent to repay a part of the term loan facilities, and to support the cash flows of the first respondent. as noted hereinabove, irretrievable injury must be of the kind which was the subject-matter of the decision in itek corporation38. in that case an exporter in the usa entered into an agreement with the imperial government of iran, and sought an order terminating its liability on stand by letters of credit issued by an american bank in favour of an iranian bank as part of the contract. the relief was sought on account of the situation created after the iranian revolution when the american government cancelled the export licences in relation to iran, and the iranian government had forcibly taken 52 american citizens as hostages. the us government had blocked all iranian assets under the jurisdiction of the united states, and had cancelled the export contract. the court upheld the contention of the exporter that any claim for damages against the purchaser, if decreed by the american courts, would not be executable in iran under these circumstances; and realisation of the bank guarantee/letters of credit would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiff. (sumac international ltd.6; singh consultants and engineers (p) ltd.7). the exceptional circumstances which make it impossible for the guarantor to reimburse himself, if he ultimately succeeds, should be decisively established, and a mere apprehension, that the other party will not be able to pay, is not enough. in itek, there was certainty on this issue and there was good reason in that case for the court to be, prima facie, satisfied that the guarantors i.e. the bank and its customer would be found entitled to receive the amount paid under the guarantee. in the cases on hand the petitions, filed under section 9 of the 1996 act, do not conclusively establish that the appellant is likely to suffer irretrievable injury, or that it is impossible for them to reimburse themselves, from the first respondent, even if they were to succeed later before the arbitral tribunal. in sumac international ltd6, it was contended, on behalf of the respondent, that irretrievable injustice would be caused to them if the bank guarantees were allowed to be realised, because the appellant was a sick industrial company in respect of which a reference was pending before the bifr under the sick industrial companies (special provisions) act, 1985 (sica for short); and even if it succeeded before the arbitrator, it would not be able to realise its claim from the appellant. the supreme court held that the mere fact that a reference under sica was pending before the bifr was not sufficient to bring the case within the ambit of the \"irretrievable injustice\" exception; under section 16(4) of sica, where the bifr deems it fit to make an inquiry or to cause and inquiry to be made in this connection, it may appoint one or more persons to be special directors for safeguarding the financial and other interests of the company or in the public interest; under section 17 after making an inquiry, if the bifr is satisfied that a company has become a sick industrial company, it may then decide, by an order in writing, whether it is practicable for the company to make its net worth exceed the accumulated losses within a reasonable time; if this is practicable, then the bifr shall give such company the opportunity to make its net worth exceed the accumulated losses; under sub-section (3) of section 17, if the bifr decided that this was not practicable within a reasonable time, it may adopt measures specified in section 18, and provide for a scheme for appropriate measures in relation to that company; there can, therefore, be no presumption that the company will, in no circumstance, be able to discharge its obligations; there was no material to show that the appellant could not make its net worth positive; this was not a situation of the kind envisaged in the case of itek corporation38 where there was no possibility whatsoever of recovery of any amount from the purchaser; and, in the present case, there was a good possibility of such recovery. even if we were to proceed on the premise that the first respondent has, in fact, suffered losses in excess of rs.326.5 crores, and its assets are mortgaged to the bank as security for the loans extended to them in excess of rs.6,000 crores, we cannot also ignore the first respondents claim that their holding company (which owns more than 88% shares of the first respondent) has furnished corporate guarantees for a sum in excess of rs.7,500 crores and has, in addition, infused rs.4,340 crores into the first respondent, among others, to support its cash flows. as in the case of sumac international6, no material has been placed by the appellant to show that the first respondent would not, under any circumstances, be in a position to repay the amount, received by them on encashment of the bank guarantees, in case the appellant were to succeed in the arbitration proceedings later. unlike in itek corporation38, where there was no possibility whatsoever of recovering any amounts from the other party, the extent of support extended to the first respondent by its parent company shows that the appellants apprehension, to the contrary, is unfounded. the appellants far fetched and outlandish prophecy of a complete collapse, of the indian thermal energy industry, would also not constitute special equities justifying an order of injunction being granted restraining the first respondent from invoking the bank guarantees. while claiming that the amounts due to it from the appellant is far higher than the amounts which they have sought to recover towards liquidated damages together with the retention money, the first respondent also contends that the amounts, which the appellant claims to be retention money and as payable to them in excess of rs.300 crores, constitute amounts representing milestone payment, which would fall due only on the appellant achieving provisional acceptance; and, till they do so, they are not entitled for the said sum. these are again matters which are required to be examined by the arbitral tribunal, and not by this court in an appeal preferred against an order passed by the commercial court in a petition filed under section 9 of the 1996 act. suffice it to hold that the appellant has not made out a case of special equities justifying an order of injunction being granted to restrain the first respondent from invoking the bank guarantees. ix. false plea in the section 9 petition filed by the appellant : its consequence: the appellant has alleged, in paragraph 8 of their section 9 petition, that provisional acceptance has been achieved for unit 1 on may 25, 2016 and unit 2 on february 02, 2017; on provisional acceptance being achieved, rs.300 crores was due from the first respondent for the works done by them; and, in the event the bank guarantee is allowed to be encashed, they would have no means of recovering the amounts due, as the first respondent has no assets in india. sri c.v. mohan reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent, would submit that such averments are false to the appellants own knowledge; as the appellant has come before this court with unclean hands, and has lied on oath in the petition, they are not entitled to injunctive relief; the section 9 petition has been filed on the basis of a false affidavit; and litigants must observe total clarity and candour in their pleadings. he would rely on seema arshad zaheer29; and amar singh v. union of india ). in its e-mail dated november 18, 2016, the appellant has admitted that the slow pace of commissioning activities on unit-2 is likely to further delay the pat (provisional acceptance test). as on november 18, 2016, provisional acceptance of unit ii was, admittedly, not achieved. in their letter dated january 02, 2017, the appellant admits that they are likely to achieve pat by 31st march, 2017. a tripartite discussion was held on february 22, 2017 between the appellant, the first respondent and the ctc to decide on the action plan to achieve provisional acceptance of uniti. it does appear, from these documents, that provisional acceptance of units 1 and 2 were not achieved till the jurisdiction of the commercial court was invoked by the appellant on 06.03.2017. it does appear that their plea, in the petition filed by them under section 9 of the 1996 act, that provisional acceptance was achieved for unit i on 25.05.2016, and for unit ii on 02.02.2017, are false. it is the duty of a party seeking injunction to bring to the notice of the court all facts material to the determination of his right to that injunction; and it is no excuse for him to say that he was not aware of the importance of any facts which he has omitted to bring forward. (amar singh42; dalglish v. jarvie ). litigants, who come to court with unclean hands, are not entitled to be heard on the merits of their case. (amar singh42). a litigant, who attempts to pollute the stream of justice, or who touches the pure fountain of justice with tainted hands, is not entitled to any relief, interim or final. (amar singh42; dalip singh v. state of u.p. ). litigants must observe total clarity and candour in their pleadings, especially when it contains a prayer for injunction. a prayer for injunction, which is an equitable remedy, must be governed by the principles of uberrima fides. (amar singh42; hari narain v. badri das ; welcome hotel v. state of a.p. ; g. narayanaswamy reddy v. govt. of karnataka ; s.p. chengalvaraya naidu v. jagannath ; a.v. papayya sastry v. govt. of a.p. ; prestige lights ltd. v. sbi ; sunil poddar v. union bank of india ; k.d. sharma v. sail ; g. jayashree v. bhagwandas s. patel and dalip singh44). a plaintiff, applying ex-parte, comes under a contract with the court that he will state the whole case fully and fairly to the court. if he fails to do that and the court finds, when the other party applies to dissolve the injunction, that any material fact has been suppressed or not properly brought forward, the plaintiff is told that the court will not decide on the merits; and, as he has broken faith with the court, the injunction must go. (amar singh42; castelli v. cookf ). if there is an important misstatement, courts should never hesitate to discharge the order at once, so as to impress upon all suitors, the importance of dealing in good faith with the court when ex-parte applications are made. (amar singh42; republic of peru v. dreyfus bros. & co. ). it is the rule of the court, and one which is of the greatest importance to maintain, that when an applicant comes to the court, to obtain relief on an ex-parte statement, he should make a full and fair disclosure of all material factsfacts, not law. he must not misstate the law if he can help itthe court is supposed to know the law. but it knows nothing about the facts, and the applicant must state fully and fairly the facts, and the penalty by which the court enforces that obligation is that, if it finds out that the facts have not been fully and fairly stated to it, the court will set aside any action which it has taken on the faith of the imperfect statement. (amar singh42; r. v. kensington income tax commr., ex p princess de polignac ). suppression of facts by the party against the beneficiary, and prima facie evidence to show that there is truth in these allegations, would not entitle the party to seek injunction restraining invocation of the bank guarantee. (synthetic foams ltd.23 and satluj jal nigam ltd.24; state trading corporation of india ltd.25). while the ex facie false plea, of having already achieved provisional acceptance, in the section 9 petition filed by the appellant, would have, by itself, necessitated denying them any relief, and in non-suiting them on this short ground, we have examined their claim on merits, including that the invocation of the bank guarantee is fraudulent and special equities are in their favour, as the increase in the number of cases seeking injunction, restraining invocation of bank guarantees, under the 2015 act, made us feel the need to reiterate the law declared by the supreme court on these aspects. x. conclusion: viewed from any angle, we see no reason to restrain the first respondent from invoking the bank guarantees furnished by the appellant, as these bank guarantees are unconditional and unequivocal, and the appellant has neither made out a case of fraud vitiating the contract of bank guarantee nor of special equities justifying an order of injunction being granted restraining invocation of the bank guarantees. all the civil miscellaneous appeals fail and are, accordingly, dismissed. miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall also stand dismissed. there shall be no order as to costs. _________________________________ (ramesh ranganathan, acj) ______________ (t.rajani, j) date: 24-10-2017."
