Nalawade, J.\n                                          Dated : April 17, 2017.\n\n\n Judgment : \n1) Both the appeals are admitted. Notice after admission is made returnable forthwith. By consent, heard both the sides for final disposal. \n2) Arbitration Appeal No. 5/2016 is filed by the Contractor,  at whose instance Arbitrator was appointed by this Court under section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act' for short). The other appeal is filed by the Employer, which is State Government, Corporation. Arbitrator had allowed all the claims of the Contractor and this decision was challenged by filing Misc. Application (RJE) No. 77/2011 by the Employer in the Court of Principal District Judge, (hereinafter referred to as 'P.D.J.' for Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 short) Parbhani under the Act. By the decision dated 31.12.2015, the proceeding filed under section 34 of the Act by the Employer is partly allowed and the award given in respect of few claims is set aside. In view of these circumstances, both the sides have challenged the decision given by the District Court, Parbhani. \n3) For deciding the challenges raised by both the sides in the appeals, the nature of work and also the history of previous arbitration proceedings in respect of the same work needs to be mentioned.\n4) The work of Majalgaon Right Bank Canal was a part of Jaikwaid Project. This project was in respect of construction of dam on river Godavari at Paithan, District Aurangabad and at various places, the canals were to be constructed. Tender notice of the work of Majalgaon Right Bank Canal from k.m. 72 to 87 and k.m. 88 to 99, which included earthwork (excluding earthwork at k.m. 78 to 87) lining structure, tunnel at k.m. 90 and enroute reservoir at k.m. 91 was published by the Corporation. The work was allotted to the appellant from Arbitration Appeal No. 5/2016. \n                                                   Arb. Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16  5)               The cost of the work as per the tender was Rs.700.84 lakh. The work order was issued on 20.1.1990 and the period of work was fixed as 36 months from the date of work order. From time to time, the Contractor applied for extension of the period and extensions were granted by the Employer. The total extension of 47 months was granted, which expired in December 1996. Prior to that the Contractor abandoned the remaining work. Initially pre-final bill was prepared and it was finalised on 14.3.1998. The amount mentioned in the final bill was accepted by the Contractor without raising any protest. \n6) During the execution of the work, the Contractor had raised disputes as provided by General Conditions of Contract (hereinafter referred to as 'G.C.C.' for short) and particularly, as per the Clause No. 56. These disputes were raised in the year 1995. On most of the disputes, the incharge Engineer gave the decision and it was communicated to the Contractor on 15.7.1995. \n7) The Contractor was not satisfied with the decision Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 given by the incharge Chief Engineer and he referred the dispute to Board of Arbitrators which was constituted as per Clause No. 57 of the G.C.C. As per the agreement, the Board was expected to deliver reasoned award. The Contractor made claims under eleven heads before Board of Arbitrators and all the claims were contested by the Employer. In all 13 claims were made by the Contractor before the department, but he prosecuted 11 claims before the Board of Arbitrators. It is the case of Contractor that the decision on claim Nos. 12 and 13 was likely to be taken departmentally as per the terms and conditions of the contract and so, he had preferred not to take decision on these claims from Board of Arbitrators. The Board of Arbitrators gave award in respect of 11 claims on 27.5.1998. \n8) The reference was made to Board of Arbitrators as per the procedure given in the agreement between the parties and the provisions of Indian Arbitration Act, 1940 were applicable. The award was filed as per the old provisions in the Court and rule was made by the Court on the award. The award and the decision of the Court have become final. The award of amount of Rs.2,61,14,396/- was given in favour of the Contractor and the cost of Rs. 1,21,721/- was also awarded in Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 favour of the Contractor. This amount was deposited in the Court when the Employer failed in appeal which was filed in this Court to challenge the award. The appeal was dismissed on 8.7.1999. \n9) No decision was given by the Chief Executive Engineer on the aforesaid two claims which were made with the Department and which were not prosecuted before the Board of Arbitrators by the Contractor. By the letter dated 6.2.2002, first time the Contractor informed to the Department that he wanted to refer the dispute to Arbitrator. Prior to that, the incharge Executive Engineer and Superintending Engineer had rejected these claims also. \n10) The Contractor then gave the name of his nominee for constitution of Board of Arbitrators by letter dated 21.3.2002. The Employer did not give the name of it's nominee who was to work as the second Arbitrator. In the letter dated 21.3.2002 itself, the Contractor had informed to the Employer that if the Employer does not appoint Arbitrator, the Arbitrator appointed by the Contractor will work as the sole Arbitrator. As per the procedure given in Clause 57 of the agreement, G.C.C., the Contractor had already requested the Chairman of the Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 Central Water Commission (C.W.C.) to see that the Board of Arbitrators is constituted. However, by the letter dated 25.3.2002, the Contractor informed to the Chairman that his letter dated 8.2.2002 made in aforesaid regard be ignored and action should not be taken by the Chairman for constitution of the Board of Arbitrators. Then the Contractor filed a proceeding in the High Court bearing No. 5/2002 for appointment of Arbitrator under the provision of section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Due to the aforesaid correspondence made by the Contractor, the Chairman of C.W.C. did not take further action. \n11) The Chairman of C.W.C. was not made party in the proceeding filed under section 11 of the Act in the High Court. This application was opposed by the Employer by contending that the High Court had no power and the Board of Arbitrators needs to be constituted as per the agreement. This Court appointed retired Justice Shri. A.S. Bhate as the sole Arbitrator by the order dated 10.7.2003. The Employer filed review application by contending that it was necessary to create the Board of Arbitrators as per the provisions of agreement and the sole Arbitrator appointed by the High Court cannot get Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 jurisdiction to decide the dispute. In the review application, the High Court again asked the parties to supply three names by each of them. In the meantime, retried Justice Shri. Bhate informed to the High Court that he was not willing to work as sole Arbitrator. This Court then made appointment of one retired District Judge Shri. R.G. Karmarkar as the sole Arbitrator. The Employer had objection to appointment of Arbitrator under section 11 of the Act, but he did not raise objection to the name of Shri. Karmarkar. It is the case of Employer that it had not given consent for appointment of sole Arbitrator and only objection was not taken to the name suggested by the High Court. After making of the appointment of Shri. Karmarkar, as there was mention of consent of the Employer in the order, application was moved by the Employer for making correction and to remove that mention. The High Court did not accept that contention. The application filed for correction was rejected by the High Court on 4.3.2004. The order of appointment of Shri. Karmarkar dated 9.10.2003 and the order dated 4.3.2004 were challenged by the Employer in the Apex Court by filing Special Leave to Appeal. \n12) The Hon'ble Apex Court granted stay to the orders of Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 Hon'ble High Court on 14.3.2005. Before that date, Shri. Karmarkar had started the proceeding. The claim statement was filed and the written statement was also filed by the Employer. The Employer took the defence that the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction and he was not competent as his appointment was not as per the agreement. Other objection was taken that the claims were barred by the principle of res-judicata and they were time barred. On merits also, the claims raised before the sole Arbitrator were opposed. \n13) Due to stay granted by the Apex Court, the proceeding before Shri. Karmarkar remained stayed from 14.3.2005 to 28.11.2007. On 28.11.2007, the Apex Court disposed of the Special Leave to Appeal with observations that the point of jurisdiction can be decided by the Arbitrator himself in view of the position of law prevailing at that time. Shri. Karmarkar then expressed his enability to act as an Arbitrator. Prior to that, in the year 2004, he had passed order on objection of jurisdiction taken by the Employer. The names of retired Justice Shri. S.C. Malte and retired Justice Shri. S.G. Mutalik were suggested by High Court this time. The Employer contended that such persons cannot be appointed as Arbitrator Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 in view of the agreement made by the parties. This Court then appointed Shri. Mutalik as the sole Arbitrator. Before Shri. Mutalik also, the Employer took aforesaid defences and objections. The request was made to decide the point of jurisdiction first, but Shri. Mutalik, Arbitrator expressed that this point will be decided along with the dispute. Shri. Mutalik fixed his fees as Rs.1,00,000/- for reading the papers and Rs.70,000/- per meeting. The order with regard to aforesaid charges and fees was also challenged by the Employer, but the Employer did not succeed. \n14) The learned Arbitrator has allowed all the claims of the Contractor (7 +1 Claims). It is held by the learned Arbitrator that there is no bar of principle of res-judicata to the claims. Though issue was framed on the point of limitation and it was clubbed with the issue of res-judicata, the award delivered by the learned Arbitrator does not show that he had touched this point. The learned Arbitrator has held that in view of the order made by this Court under section 11 of the Act, he has jurisdiction. The learned Arbitrator has held that the Contractor is entitled to recover the amount of Rs. 11,24,60,651/- with interest at the rate of 16% p.a. and has held that the interest Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 will be payable up to the period ending on 30.9.2003 and then the interest will be payable from 4.2.2004 the date of filing of the claims on the awarded amount then till the date of realisation. The cost of Rs.10,00,000/- was imposed by the learned Arbitrator on the Employer. This award was delivered on 3.4.2011. \n15) In the decision given by the learned P.D.J., Parbhani in Application (RJE) No. 77/2011, the learned P.D.J. has set aside the award of Arbitrator in respect of claim Nos. 2 [2A and 2B], 3, 4 and 5. The award in respect of claim Nos. 1 and 6 is confirmed by the P.D.J. The claim No. 7 was in respect of interest and so, it can be said that interest is allowed in respect of the claim Nos. 1 and 6. The learned P.D.J. has held that the claim Nos. 2A, 2B, 4 and 5 cannot be allowed as they are hit by the principle of res-judicata. The learned P.D.J. held that claim No. 4 was time barred. The claim No. 3 is set aside by holding that there is virtually no evidence and there is no justification in awarding this claim when the award was required to be reasoned award. \n16) In the present matter, in view of the contentions Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 made and the arguments advanced, following points need to be decided. \n(i) Whether the present matters need to be decided by Commercial Appellate Division constituted under the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Court Act, 2015 ? \n(ii) Whether the learned Arbitrator Shri. Mutalik, Retired Judge of this Court was competent in view of the agreement ? \n(iii) Whether claim Nos. 1, 2, 3 & 6 could have been considered by the Arbitral Tribunal in view of the terms and conditions of the contract ? \n(iv) Whether the aforesaid claims [2A, 2B, 4 and 5] are hit by the principle of res-judicata ?\n(v) Whether claim Nos. 1, 4 & 6 are time barred?\n(vi) Whether claim No. 3 was substantiated ? \n(vii) Whether the award delivered by the learned Arbitrator and the decision given by the learned P.D.J. need to be interfered with in the appeals ? \nPoint No. 1 :-\nEffect of the provisions of the Commercial Courts, Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Court Act, 2015 on the jurisdiction of this Court :\n17) The learned counsel for Contractor submitted that for Aurangabad Bench of this Court, Commercial Appellate Division of High Court is created under the aforesaid enactment and so, the present matters need to be placed before the said Court. For ascertaining as to whether this Court has jurisdiction, this Court has seen the scheme of the aforesaid Special Enactment carefully. It is true that the dispute of the present matters falls under the definition of 'commercial dispute' given under section 2(c) and the value of the dispute is more than Rs.\n28 Crore. \n18) Aurangabad Bench of Bombay High Court has no ordinary original civil jurisdiction and so, there is no Commercial Division of the High Court at Aurangabad Bench. Commercial Appellate Division for Aurangabad Bench came to be constituted under the aforesaid Act with effect from 30.6.2016. The present proceeding was filed on 31.3.2016. The proceeding under section 34 of the Act was decided by the learned P.D.J., Parbhani on 31.12.2016 as \"Court\" under the Act. This is because first Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 time by Government notification dated 30.6.2016, the Government constituted commercial Court at district levels including for district Parbhani and High Court under letter dated 14.7.2016 appointed the Judges of District Court as Commercial Courts. From the record, it can be said that for Parbhani district and other districts, the Commercial Court actually started functioning for district places on 16.7.2016. The aforesaid Special Enactment was published by notification in official gazette on 31.12.2015, but the Courts were constituted subsequently and the proceeding under section 34 was decided by the learned P.D.J. as the \"Court\" under section 34 of the Act on 31.12.2015. \n19) The matters which are required to be decided by Commercial Appellate Division are mentioned in section 13 of the aforesaid Special Enactment and the provision runs as under :-\n\"13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions.- (1) Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 order, as the case may be:\nProvided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1906 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996).\n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\"\n20) Section 3 of this Special Enactment shows that the State Government is expected to constitute the Commercial Courts by notification. It is required to be published in official gazette and that was done on 30.6.2016. On the date of decision of the matter filed under section 34 of the Act, Commercial Court was not in existence and similarly, Commercial Appellate Division was also not in existence when the present appeals were filed in this Court. The provision of section 15 takes care of the pending matters and this provision shows that only the matters which are filed or were filed under section 34 of the Act and which were still pending can be Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 transferred under the provision of section 15 and they are required to be transferred either to Commercial Court or Commercial Division. Neither in section 15 nor in any other provision of the Special Enactment, there is provision for transferring the appeals, which are filed against the decisions given by the Courts as mentioned in section 34 of the Act to Commercial Appellate Division of this Court. In view of this position of law, it needs to be held that present appeals need to be decided by this Court as appeals filed under section 37 of the Act and not by Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court. So, the point is answered accordingly. \n21) On the aforesaid point, the learned counsel for Contractor placed reliance on the observations made by Commercial Appellate Division of this Court at Principal Seat in Judgment of Commercial Appeal No. 7 of 2016 [Hubtown Limited Vs. IDBI Trusteeship Service Limited] decided on 24.10.2016. This Court has carefully gone through the facts of this case and observations made by the Commercial Appellate Division. The facts were totally different and the order made by the Commercial Division in Summons for Judgment was taken in appeal before the Commercial Appellate Division. It was held Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 that appeal filed under section 13 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 was tenable and the order of learned Single Judge of Commercial Division in Summons for Judgment was set aside. The maintainability of Commercial Appeal was in question, but as the order of Commercial Division was taken in appeal such decision was given. Thus, the observations made in this case are of no use to the Contractor in the present matter. \nPoint No. 2 - Compentency of the Arbitrator :-\n22) To ascertain, whether the retired Judge of the High Court Shri. Mutalik could have been appointed as Arbitrator under section 11 of the Act, the provision of section 11 (relevant portion) needs to be considered first. The relevant portions are section 11(1) to 11(6), 11(8) of the Act and they run as under :-\n\"11. APPOINTMENT OF ARBITRATORS. -(1) A person of any nationality may be an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. \n(2) Subject to sub-section (6), the parties are free to agree on a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators. \n(3) Failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (2), in an arbitration with three Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 arbitrators, each party shall appoint one arbitrator, and the two appointed arbitrators shall appoint the third arbitrator who shall act as the presiding arbitrator. \n                        (4)    If the appointment procedure in sub-                section (3) applies and-                         (a) a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days from the receipt of a request to do so from the other party; of (b) the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty days from the date of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the Chief Justice or any person or institution designated by him. \n(5) Failing any agreement referred to in sub-section(2), in an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties fail to agree on the arbitrator within thirty days from receipt of a request by one party from the other party to so agree the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the Chief Justice or any person or institution designated by him. \n                        (6)    Where,      under       an       appointment                procedure agreed upon by the parties, - \n                        (a)    a party fails to act as required under                that procedure; or                         (b)    the   parties,   or   the    two     appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an agreement expected of them under that procedure; or Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 (c) a person, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to him or it under that procedure, a party may request the Chief Justice or any person or institution designated by him to take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment. \n                        (7)    ........\n                        ( 8)    The Chief Justice or the person or institution designated by him, in appointing an arbitrator, shall have due regard to- (a) any qualifications required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties; and (b) other considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator.\"\n23) In the present matters, the application under section 11 of the Act was filed in the year 2002 and the appointment of retired Judge of this Court was made first time in the proceeding on 10.7.2003. The subsequent appointments of sole Arbitrator mentioned above were made only to replace the first sole Arbitrator appointed by this Court. This decision was taken up to Supreme Court by filing Special Leave Petition by the Employer. The Apex Court referred the case of M/s. S.B.P & Co. Vs. M/s. Patel Engineering Ltd. and Anr. [AIR 2006 SUPREME Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 COURT 450] and held that it will be open to raise the challenge to jurisdiction of Arbitrator appointed by High Court before the Arbitrator himself as provided in the Act. In the case of S.B.P. & Co. cited supra also, the Apex Court had made it clear that if the applications filed under section 11 of the Act were already decided, it is to be presumed that in those cases, the appointments were made as per the ratio of previous case of Apex Court reported as M/s. Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. and Anr. Vs. M/s. Rani Construction P. Ltd. [AIR 2002 SUPREME COURT 778]. As the contrary view was taken in the case of S.B.P. & Co., cited supra, the Apex Court made it clear in the case of S.B.P. & Co. itself that in the matters in which Arbitrators were already appointed as per the case of Konkan Railway Corporation cited supra, in those cases all objections with regard to jurisdiction of the Arbitrator need to be decided under section 16 of the Act. This position of law needs to be kept in mind while applying the provisions of section 11(1) to 11(6) of the Act to the present matters. Thus, the point of competency of the Arbitrator is open in the present matter. In view of the provision of section 16 (6) of the Act read with provision of section 34 (2) (v) of the Act, this point could have been considered by the Arbitrator and also the District Court. In Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 the appeal, this point can be again considered. \n24) If the provisions of section 11(2) and 11(6) of the Act are read together, they show that if there is agreement over the procedure for appointment of arbitration and the procedure provides other means for securing the appointment, the power under section 11(6) of the Act cannot be used. \n25) The provision of section 11(2) of the Act shows that this provision is subject to the provision of section 11(6) of the Act and so, if there is already agreement on procedure, there cannot be new agreement on procedure by the parties to appoint the Arbitrator. Similarly, if there is agreement on procedure available, the provisions of sections 11 (3), 11 (4), 11 (5) cannot be used as those provisions are to take care of the situation where there is no agreement on the procedure to appoint Arbitrator. It needs to be kept in mind that in section 11(6) of the Act, there are two parts. The first part relates to the lacuna in the procedure agreed. Due to such lacuna, if even after following the procedure the Arbitrator cannot be appointed, then the Court can take necessary measures as mentioned in those provisions of law to see that Arbitrator is appointed. \nArb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 However, the second part relates to the situation where there is the procedure, and due to the failure on the part of the one or more parties or due to other situation mentioned in clauses (b)\n(c) of section 11(6) of the Act, the Arbitrator is not appointed, but there is the procedure to take care of such situation and by following that procedure the Arbitrator can be appointed. In the present matters, procedure mentioned in second part of section 11(6) of the Act was available. \n26) Clause No. 57 of the G.C.C. between the parties reads as under :-\n\"57. ARBITRATION : \n(1) All disputes or differences in respect of which the decision, if any, of the Engineer or Employer has not become final and binding as aforesaid, shall on the initiative of either party in dispute be referred to the adjudication of three arbitrators. One arbitrator is to be nominated by the Employer, one by the Contractor and the third by the President of the International Chamber of Commerce, in the case of foreign contractors and Chairman, Central Water Commission in the case of local contractors. If either of the parties fail to appoint its arbitrator within sixty days after receipt of notice for the appointment of an arbitrator then the President of the International Chamber of Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 Commerce or the Chairman, Central Water Commission as the case may be, shall appoint an Arbitrator. A certified copy of the appointment made by the 'President'/'Chairman' shall be furnished to both parties. \n(2) The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, Paris in the case of foreign contractors and provisions of Indian Arbitration Act 1940 or any statutory modifications thereof in the case of local contractors and shall be held in either case at such place and time in India as the Arbitrators may determine. The decision of the majority of the Arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties and the expenses of the Arbitrators shall be paid as may be determined by the Arbitrators. \n(3) The said arbitrator/s shall have full power to open up, revise and review any decision, opinion, direction, certificate or valuation by the Engineer, Neither party shall be limited in the proceedings before such arbitrator/s to the evidence or arguments put before the Engineer for the purpose of obtaining his said decision. No decision given by the Engineer in accordance with the foregoing provisions shall disqualify him from being called as a witness and giving evidence before the arbitrator/s on any matter whatsoever relevant to the dispute or difference referred to the arbitrator/s as aforesaid. The reference to Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 arbitration may proceed notwithstanding that the works shall not then be or be alleged to be complete provided always that the obligations of the Employer, the Engineer and the Contractor shall not be altered by reason of the arbitration being conducted during the progress of the works. \n(4) Performance under the contract shall, if reasonably possible, continue during the arbitration proceedings and payments due to the Contractor by the Employer shall bot be withheld, unless they are the subject matter of the arbitration proceedings. \n(5) All awards shall be in writing and in case of claims equivalent to Rupees one hundred thousand or more, such awards shall state reason for the amounts awarded. \n(6) Neither Party is entitled to bring a claim to arbitration if its Arbitrator has not been appointed by thirty days after the expiration of the Maintenance period. \n(7) The Term 'Indian Contractor' shall include Indian firm or group of Indian firms and Joint Venture consortia eligible for price preference as domestic tenderer.\" \nClause No. 57 (1) shows that the authority mentioned in the Clause viz. the Chairman of C.W.C. was having power to appoint the sole arbitrator if both or either party had failed to nominate Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 the Arbitrator as provided in first part of this clause. In the first arbitral proceeding, both the sides had appointed their nominees and the third Arbitrator was appointed by Chairman of C.W.C. Thus, in the present matter also, it was possible to use this procedure. Infact reference was already made to the Chairman of C.W.C. and the matter was pending before the Chairman for consideration. It is the Contractor, who had written to the Chairman of C.W.C. to inform that he was not interested in getting the Arbitrator appointed as per this clause as he wanted to move High Court under section 11 of the Act. This fact of the present matter and the position of law already quoted are sufficient to hold that retired Justice Shri. Mutalik could not have been appointed as Arbitrator under section 11 by this Court. Both the learned Arbitrator and the Court under section 34 of the Act have committed error in holding that retired Justice Shri. Mutalik was appointed as per the provisions made in law. This single ground is sufficient to set aside the entire award delivered by the learned Arbitrator. So, the point No. 2 is answered accordingly. \n27) On the aforesaid point, the learned counsel for Employer placed reliance on the observations made by the Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 Supreme Court in the case reported as 2016 (4) Mh.L.J. 101 [Huawei Technologies Company Ltd. Vs. Sterlite Technologies Ltd.]. In this case, the Apex Court has considered the provisions of section 11 and 15 (2) of the Act and has laid down that the term 'Rules' mentioned in section 15 (2) relates to the provisions made in the agreement for appointment of Arbitrator. It is laid down that on every occasion including for occasion of filling vacancy of Arbitrator, the Rules in that regard need to be followed. There cannot be dispute over this proposition and this Court has quoted the relevant portion of the agreement mentioned in the procedure for appointment of Arbitrator. \n28) The learned counsel for respondent/Contractor placed reliance on the observations made by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 6275/2014 [North Eastern Railway & Ors. Vs. Tripple Engineering Works] decided on 13.8.2014. In this case and also in the case reported as 2013 (2) Arb.L.R. 105 (SC) [M/s. Deep Trading Company Vs. M/s. Indian Oil Corporation and Ors.], the Apex Court has discussed the provision of section 11 and has laid down that when one party forfeited right to appoint his nominee for Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 constitution of Arbitral Tribunal, it is not open to the said party to say that the Arbitrator cannot be appointed under section 11 of the Act. The facts of the two reported cases show that due to failure of one party to nominate his Arbitrator, it was not possible to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal. In view of that circumstance, the Apex Court laid down that the provision of section 11 can be used. The facts of the present matter are totally different and this Court has already observed that even after failure of one or both the parties, the Arbitrator could have been appointed by the agency mentioned in the agreement. In the present matter, the Contractor avoided to get constituted the Tribunal from the said agency, the Chairman of C.W.C. The relevant portion of section 11 of the Act is also discussed in this regard and so, the observations made by the Apex Court in these two cases are of no use to the Contractor. Point No. 3 :-\n29) Under this point, this Court is discussing all the remaining points like point of limitation, point of res-judicata, point of excepted matters and to some extent the merits of the claim. \nArb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 30) The relevant facts of the dispute between the parties are already quoted and they show that while before December 1996, the Contractor had abandoned the work, though the period for execution of work was expected by the department till December 1996. In the year 1995, only 13 claims were raised by the Contractor before the Employer as per the procedure given in Clause 56 of G.C.C. Out of the said 13 claims, the Contractor preferred to get decision from Board of Arbitrators on 11 claims. As per the record, pre-final bill was prepared on 30.6.1996 and then the final bill was prepared and singed on 14.3.1998. In view of the aforesaid facts, it can be said that no more work was expected when pre-final bill and final bill were signed by the parties. These bills were accepted by the Contractor without raising any protest. These circumstances need to be kept in mind while deciding the point of limitation, and the point of res-judicata. In spite of these circumstances, the Contractor raised new claims which were five in numbers before the second Arbitrator. It can be said that there is no record with the Contractor in respect of these new five claims to show that they were made under the procedure given under the agreement and particularly, Clause No. 56 of the agreement. The award prepared by the learned Arbitrator in the present Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 matter shows that the learned Arbitrator considered one way correspondence allegedly made by the Contractor with the department for presuming that these new claims were raised and they were pending with the department. It is already observed that only 13 claims were raised as per the procedure and the Contractor had preferred to take final decision on two claims departmentally and he had filed claims statement in respect of remaining 11 claims before the Board of Arbitrators (first arbitration). The award delivered by the learned Arbitrator in the present matter shows that there was virtually non application of mind and the learned Arbitrator virtually accepted all the contentions made by the Contractor as they were without considering the effect of the principle of res-judicata, limitation and also the presence or absence of the material with regard to actual work done. There are many points, on the basis of which it can be said that the Arbitrator had not considered the basic concepts like res-judicata and for instance issue No. 6A can be quoted in that regard. \n\"6A] Does the claimant prove that he is entitled to for payment of interest @ 16% p.a. from 13- 02-1993 to 15-7-1995 on all sums awarded under the Award dated 27-05-1998 ?\" \nFortunately, in the reasoning other point is considered and decided. \nArb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 31) The provision with regard to the procedure to raise the claims and to make reference to arbitration can be found in Clause Nos. 56 and 57 of G.C.C. Clause No. 57 is already quoted. Clause No. 56 runs as under :-\n\"56. SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES :-\nIf any dispute or difference of any kind whatsoever shall arise between the Engineer or Employer and the Contractor in connection with, or arising out of the Contract, or the execution of the works, whether during the progress of the works or after their completion and whether or after the termination, abandonment or breach of the Contract, it shall, in the first place, be referred to and settled by the Engineer-in-charge who shall, within a period of thirty days after being requested by the contractor to do so give written notice of his decision to the Contractor. Upon receipt of the written notice on decision of the Engineer the Contractor shall promptly proceed without delay to comply with such notice for decision. \nIf the Engineer-in-charge fails to give notice of his decision in writing within a period of thirty days after being requested, or if the Contractor is dissatisfied with the notice of decision of the Engineer-in-charge the Contractor may within thirty days after receiving notice of decision Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 appeal to the Superintending Engineer, who shall afford an opportunity to the Contractor to be heard and to offer evidence in support of his appeal. The Superintending Engineer shall give notice of his decision within a period of thirty days after the Contractor has given the said evidence in support of his appeal. Subject to arbitration, as hereinafter provided, such decision of the Superintending Engineer in respect of every matter so referred shall be final and binding upon the Contractor and shall forthwith be given effect to by the Contractor, who shall proceed with the execution of the works with all due diligence whether he requires arbitration, as hereinafter provided, or not. If the Superintending Engineer has given written notice of his decision to the Contractor and no claim to arbitration has been communicated to him by the Contractor within a period of thirty days from receipt of such notice, the said decision shall remain final and binding upon the Contractor. If the Superintending Engineer shall fail to give notice of his decision as aforesaid within a period of thirty days after being requested as aforesaid, or if the Contractor be dissatisfied with any such decision, then and in any such case the Contractor within thirty-days after receiving notice of such decision, or within thirty days after the expiration of the first-named period of thirty days, as the case may be, appeal to Chief Engineer who shall afford an opportunity Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 to the Contractor to be heard and to offer evidence in support of his appeal. The Chief Engineer shall give decision within a period of thirty days after the Contractor has given evidence in support of his appeal. If the Contractor is dissatisfied with this decision, the contractor within a period of thirty days from receipt of decision shall indicate his intention to refer the dispute to Arbitration, failing which the said decision shall be final and conclusive.\" \nIn view of the wording of Clause No. 56, it was necessary for the Contractor to presume that his two claims, out of aforesaid 13 claims, were not accepted by the department. This presumption is necessary as for every stage, the period is fixed in Clause No.\n56. If he had taken the matter up to Chief Engineer and the decisions were given against him by the incharge Engineer and Superintending Engineer, then after expiry of period of 30 days from raising the grievance before the Chief Engineer, it was necessary for the Contractor to presume that the department was not accepting the remaining two claims. It can be said that the Contractor took the risk by presuming that he will be getting the remaining two claims settled departmentally and the Contractor did not stake claims under the two heads before the Board of Arbitrators.\nArb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 32) It is already observed that so far as the remaining five claims are concerned from the present matter, they were not prosecuted as per the procedure given in Clause No. 56 and so, it can be said that these claims were never raised during the execution of the work. Even if it is presumed that in the year 1995, the Contractor had made correspondence with regard to new claims, in that case also the Contractor ought to have prosecuted the matter under Clause No. 56 of G.C.C. Thus, it needs to be inferred that the cause of action had already arisen at the end of year 1995 in respect of the new claims also. \n33) Clause 57 (6) of G.C.C. shows that matter needs to be referred to arbitration within 30 days after expiration of the maintenance period. Clause 5 of G.C.C. provides for maintenance and defect liability period. This period was 180 days from the certified date of completion. It is already observed that Contractor had abandoned the work and there was no question of issuing certificate of completion. The record shows that the Contractor never attempted to obtain completion certificate to get absolved himself from the liability mentioned in Clause 5 of G.C.C. If the work was not completed, then it can be Arb. Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 said that the period mentioned in Clause 5 can be counted from the date of final bill. As final bill was signed by the Contractor without protest on 14.3.1998, the period of limitation started to run after expiry of 180 days from 14.3.1998. \n34) The amendment to section 28 of the Contract Act, which made agreement void if the agreement was limiting the limitation period provided by General Law came in to force with effect from 8.1.1997. In view of Clause No. 5 of G.C.C. if it is presumed that benefit of amended provision of the Contract Act needs to be given to the Contractor, in that case also, the period of limitation started to run after completion of 180 days from 14.3.1998. If this amendment is not made applicable, then the period had started to run as provided in Clause 56 of G.C.C. Thus, even if the best possible case for the Contractor is accepted, he ought to have raised the dispute within three years from 14.9.1998 (14.3.1998 + 180 days). \n35) For all the claims decided in the present matter, it can be said that the Contractor took steps first time in the year 2002 by filing proceeding under section 11 of the Act. He filed the claim before Arbitrator appointed by this Court in the year Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 2003. Due to these circumstances, this Court has no hesitation to hold that all the claims decided by the learned Arbitrator in the present matter were time barred. \n36) So far as the point of res-judicata is concerned, following points need to be kept in mind. Not only the principle of res-judicata, but the principle of constructive res-judicata also needs to be used in such matters. The contention of waiver was made at all the stages for the Employer. \n(i) The Board of Arbitrators came to be constituted on 17.1.1996 and it had given direction to both the sides to file statement of claims. \n(ii) The first meeting of Board of Arbitrators was held on 4.11.1996 and on that date, the decision was taken as to which claims will be decided. Thus, it was open to the Contractor to file the claims decided in the present matter before the Board of Arbitrators also. In spite of these circumstances, the Contractor preferred not to file the claims before the Board of Arbitrators in the first arbitration. \n37) The Board of Arbitrators had given award on Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 following claims :-\n(i) Revised rates for work executed after the original scheduled period viz. for the work executed after 20.1.1993. The new rate was fixed by the Board of Arbitrators as per the contract formula accepted in the agreement by the parties viz. as per the price indices as on 20.1.1993. This additional amount was given as compensation for delay caused for execution of the work. \n(ii) Revised rates for extra items exceeding 30% of the work over the tender quantities. The revised rates were given in respect of this work done also even prior to 20.1.1993. Similarly, under this head the revised rate was given in respect of work done after 20.1.1993. \n(iii) Damages on account of recovery of amount as security deposit from running bills and interest at the rate of 16% p.a. is given on such amount. Thus, the claim of compensation in respect of retension of money by the department during the work period was placed before the Board of Arbitrators for consideration. The Board of Arbitrators could have considered the present Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 claim of getting interest on amount of bank guarantee for the period starting from 20.1.1993. But, this point was not raised. \n(iv) The payment of Rs.1.5 per bag cement was awarded as the difference of rate as there was contract to supply cement in jute bags to the Contractor by the Employer and the cement was supplied in polythene bags. \n(v) Interest on all the amount due and demanded in claims at the rate of 16% p.a. from the date of occurrence till the date of realisation. The Board of Arbitrators has awarded interest on the amount which was due to the Contractor prior to 10.7.1995 and also on the amount which became payable on 15.7.1995. These dates are with regard to the demands made by the Contractor under Clause 56 of G.C.C. Similarly past and pendente-lite interest with reference to the date 4.11.1996, the date of first hearing of the Board of Arbitrators is granted at the rate of 16% p.a. Further, the order was made by Board of Arbitrators that if the amount was not paid within two months from the date of the award delivered by the Board of Arbitrators, the Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 department was liable to pay the interest at the rate of 18% p.a. This item again shows that it was open to the Contractor to claim interest in respect of all the amounts which were due to him, according to him, before the Board of Arbitrators. \n38) The Board of Arbitrators had rejected the following claims made by the Contractor :-\n(i) Loss of over heads and profits due to delay. This was done as revised rate was given for entire work done after 20.1.1993 by the Board of Arbitrators. \n(ii) The compensation for extra lead charges for cut spoils disposed of at the distant location. This claim was rejected with reference to clauses of G.C.C. and special terms and conditions of the contract. \n(iii) The extra rate for hard rock excavation in canal section. This claim was rejected as the Contractor failed to prove that there was any such agreement. \nUnder this item, the present claim of control blasting could have been considered and it can be said that it needs to be presumed that such claim was considered. \n(iv) Compensation for idle machinery and idle labour Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 charges due to stoppage of work for the same period. This claim was rejected as the Contractor failed to prove that at any time, his labour and machinery remained idle and so, on merit it was rejected. \n(v) Payment of rehandling charges for casing material of k.m. 90 spoils used for embankment of entire reservoir. This claim was rejected on the basis of the material available and terms and conditions of the contract. \n(vi) Extra item of every overcuts of hard rock at k.m. 89 and 90 beyond normal pay line and also back filling of the same. This is also rejected on merits and it can be said that present item and control blasting could have been raised under this claim also by the Contractor.\n39) Aforesaid circumstances show that all the so called extra items except the two claims which were specifically withdrawn by the Contractor were placed before the Board of Arbitrators, first arbitration. The following were the two items which were specifically withdrawn by the Contractor. \n(i) Hard rock excavation involving controlled Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 blasting. It was the case of Contractor that radius was changed due to geography and existence of the structures in the vicinity. On this point also, it needs to be observed that as per the terms and conditions of contract, it was necessary for the Contractor to visit the site and make assessment, estimate before quoting rate. These things ought to have been inspected by the Contractor. The learned Arbitrator in the present matter has not considered this aspect of the matter. The Board of Arbitrators had considered this aspect. \n(ii) Extra quarrying and transport charges for stone and metals for concrete work and also for work of filling. It is the case of Contractor that useful stones were not available along with canal line and he was required to bring that material from the other place, k.m. 91. The work was to be done from k.m. 72 to 87 and 88 to 99. Here only it needs to be observed that the learned Arbitrator has not touched the record of sites already informed by the Employer. The learned Arbitrator has decided this point only on the basis of quantities used in the work and it is presumed that these quantities were brought from distant place when Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 no material whatsoever was produced by the Contractor to show that this material was in fact brought from distant place. \n40) The discussion already made and the material show that the work of controlled blasting was executed in the year 1994-95. It is already observed that it was necessary for the Contractor to presume that the department was not accepting this claim as extra item and so, it was necessary for the Contractor to refer this claim to arbitration. This opportunity was there to the Contractor when the Board of Arbitrators was constituted, but he preferred to virtually withdrawn the claim. Same can be said in respect of the other claim, extra item of stone and metals. \n41) Before the learned Arbitrator from the present matter, the Contractor had made in all 7 claims which included the aforesaid two claims. The department took the defence that already revised rate was given to the Contractor by the Board of Arbitrators in the past and the new claims were not raised before the Arbitrator. It was submitted for the Employer that the agreement did not provide for separate or additional charges Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 even in respect of the controlled blasting. The defence was taken that there was no prior approval of incharge Engineer with regard to controlled blasting. As already observed, like point of res-judicata, the point of limitation was also there. \n42) So far as the item of controlled blasting is concerned, the attention of the learned Arbitrator was drawn to the Clause 2.16 of second volume of agreement. This clause provides for execution of hard rock chiseling/control blasting. It is the case of Employer that the tender rates were fixed after preparing estimates on the basis of survey done by the department and the contractor had accepted the rate and so, it was not open to him to claim additional rate or as extra item. The attention of the learned Arbitrator was drawn to clause No. 2.16.2 of the second volume showing that when the control blasting was not permissible in the zone of 100 meters directly below transmission line, the Contractor ought to have resorted to pneumatic rock breakers or chiseling. In view of this clause, it was necessary for the Contractor to first take permission of the Employer if he wanted to do the control blasting under transmission lines. It is not the case of Contractor that such permission was granted by the Employer to him. For this reason Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 also, nothing could have been given by the learned Arbitrator under this head to the Contractor. It can be said that it was not agreed item. Even when Arbitral Tribunal has held that permission was not granted by the Employer, the claim is allowed by the Arbitrator. \n43) So far as the claim No. 2 which was withdrawn by the Contractor in the past when the Board of Arbitrators was constituted is concerned viz. the claim of extra quarrying and transport of stones/metals, the attention of the learned Arbitrator was drawn to Clause No. 20 of G.C.C. and Clause No. 5.6 of the special terms and conditions of the contract. The sites where quarries could have been taken were already informed and it was made clear that if the material available at those quarries was not sufficient, the Contractor was to make his own arrangement at own cost of such material. The clauses show that the Contractor was expected to spend for construction of road also for transport of such material. Even if the case of Contractor that he was required to Collect the material at k.m. 91 could have been considered by ignoring the aforesaid clauses of agreement, then also it was necessary for the Contractor to substantiate that claim. The award delivered by the Arbitrator Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 shows that he did not refer to the drawings and maps annexed with the tender record showing the quarries. The learned Arbitrator did not ask the Contractor to produce the record which is ordinarily created like payment of royalty in respect of such material to the revenue department. Surprisingly, the learned Arbitrator has granted the claim by presuming that the quantities actually used was required for work and so, the Contractor must have transported this quantity from the place which he has contended. The Contractor himself has admitted that some material was available at the other quarries which were not that away from the site of work, but the Contractor has not given the exact quantity of the material recovered from those sites by producing record of royalty and other record. These circumstances show that most casual approach was shown by the learned Arbitrator and even when there was no material to substantiate the claim, the learned Arbitrator has granted the claim and so award on such claim cannot sustain in law. The Arbitral Tribunal has not referred Clause No. 5.7 of the special terms and conditions. Thus, there was no material with the Contractor to substantiate the claim under this head and the Contractor had virtually failed to substantiate this claim and the Court has rightly set aside the claim under this head. \nArb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 44) The decision of the learned Arbitrator of granting claims under issue No. 3A, 3B, 4A and 4B viz. revised rates for entire quantities of work executed after 20.1.1993 and for quantities which were less than 70% of the tender quantity show that there was virtually non application of mind. It is already mentioned that the Board of Arbitrators had given revised rates to the Contractor by presuming that delay was caused to the employer, but the learned Arbitrator has again given compensation under this head. Even if, the Board of Arbitrators had not given such compensation, in that case also, the decision of the Board of Arbitrators had become final on that point as this point was raised before the Board of Arbitrators and so, there was bar of principle of res-judicata for granting these claims. From this angle, the learned Arbitrator has not considered these claims. Thus, the award on such claims cannot sustain in law. \n45) The claim in respect of excess price allegedly paid by the Contractor for sand mentioned in issue Nos. 5A and 5B is similar to the claim in respect of other material like rubble, Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 metal etc. It was the responsibility of the Contractor as per the Clause 20 of G.C.C. and Clause 5.6 of special terms and conditions of the contract to procure the sand. This aspect of the agreement is not at all considered by the learned Arbitrator and compensation is granted under this head. Such award cannot sustain in law. \n46) The claim in respect of interest under issue No. 6A viz. interest on bank guarantee could not have been awarded by the Arbitrator. Clause No. 10.3 of the special terms and conditions of the contract shows that it was necessary for the Contractor to keep such bank guarantee with the employer during the period of execution of work. As per this clause, bank guarantee was to remain with the Employer and it was to be released only after completion of the work and settlement of the account. Thus, the learned Arbitrator has committed grave error in awarding interest on the bank guarantee in the present matter. If issue Nos. 6A, 6B and 7 are read, which were framed by the learned Arbitrator, it can be said that the learned Arbitrator had not applied mind even for framing the issues. For these reasons, the award on claims under this head needs to be set aside. \nArb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 47) Issue No. 12 framed by the learned Arbitrator was about entitlement of the Contractor to get compensation, revision of rates and specific relief at the same time. As already observed, claims were considered by the Board of Arbitrators and decision was given by the Board of Arbitrators on this point. This point appears to be separately considered by the learned Arbitrator and it can be said that it was not necessary for the learned Arbitrator to decide this issue in view of the decision given by the Board of Arbitrators. This issue could not have been considered separately as it had connection with other claims. \n48) The decision given under section 34 of the Act by the learned P.D.J., Parbhani shows that the award in respect of claim Nos. 2 to 5 is set aside and for the reasons given by the 'Court' and by this Court, it is not possible to interfere in the said decision of the P.D.J. The P.D.J. has however confirmed the award given on claim Nos. 1 and 6. But the award given in respect of those claims also cannot sustain in law in view of the discussion already made. \n49) The learned counsel for Employer placed reliance on Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 the observations made by the Apex Court in the case reported as 2016 (8) SCALE 779 [Union of India and Anr. Vs. Indusind Bank Ltd. and Anr.]. This case is on the interpretation of provision of section 28 of the Contract Act as amended in the year 1997. The Apex Court has laid down that the provision has prospective effect. This Court has quoted the relevant terms and conditions of the agreement and the best possible case for Contractor is considered. In spite of such consideration, this Court has come to the conclusion that it is not possible to hold that the Contractor took action for enforcement of his so called right within prescribed period of three years from the date of cause of action. Thus, even if the observations made in this case are ignored in view of the terms and conditions of the Contract, the Contractor cannot succeed in the matter. However, there cannot be dispute over the proposition made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in this matter. \n50) On the point of interest claimed on the bank guarantee amount, the learned counsel for Employer placed reliance on the observations made by the Apex Court in the case reported as 2016 (3) Mh.L.J. 1 [Union of India Vs. Bright Power Projects (India) Pvt. Ltd. In the case decided by three Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 Hon'ble Judges of the Apex Court, it is made clear that when there is agreement that no interest would be awarded to the Contractor, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot award interest. The Apex Court has referred the provision of section 31 (7)(a) of the Act, which runs as under :-\n\"31(7)(a) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and in so far as an arbitral award is for the payment of money, the Arbitral Tribunal may include in the sum for which the award is made interest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, on the whole or any part of the money, for the whole or any part of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made.\"\n51) The facts of the reported case show that there was the claim in respect of interest on security deposit, earnest money and also on other amount, but in view of the agreement that no interest would be payable, the Apex Court held that Arbitral Tribunal could not have awarded interest. On the other hand, the learned counsel for respondent placed reliance on the observations made by the Apex Court in the case reported as AIR 1985 SC 607 [Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Vs. M. Krishnaswami Mudaliar]. In this case decided by two Hon'ble Judges of the Apex Court, the work was abandoned and Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 in view of the claim made by the Contractor under the Interest Act, in that case, the Apex Court held that granting of interest was possible. The facts were different and further, there is the case cited supra viz. 2016 (3) Mh.L.J. 1 [Union of India Vs. Bright Power Projects (India) Pvt. Ltd. decided by the three Judges of the Honble Apex Court showing that Arbitrator is not expected to give award which will be against the terms and conditions of the agreement. In the present matter, relevant facts are considered by this Court and relevant portion of the agreement is already quoted and so, the finding is given that the Contractor is not entitled to get interest on the bank guarantee. \n52) The learned counsel for respondent placed reliance on the observations made by the Apex Court in the cases reported as 2014 (4) Arb.LR 307 (SC) [Associate Builders Vs. Delhi Development Authority] and 2014 (4) Arb.LR 1 (SC) [Swan Gold Mining Ltd. Vs. Hindustan Copper Ltd.]. The Apex Court has laid down that ordinarily when view expressed by the Arbitrator on facts is possible view, the decision of the Arbitrator given on factual aspect cannot be disturbed by the Court. However, the observations show that such award needs to be based on evidence given to substantiate Arb.Appeal Nos.6 & 5/16 the claim and it should be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contract and it should not be against the law. There cannot be dispute over the proposition.

(1981) 4 scc 8, to contend that an order granting leave to defend, conditional or unconditional, is an interlocutory order. reliance is placed on the judgement of the gujarat high court in state of gujarat vs union of india, being r/special civil application no. 737 of 2018, decided on 07.05.2018, to substantiate the argument that there is a bar under section 8 of the act against entertaining a civil revision petition against interlocutory orders passed by the trial court albeit the court has held that writ petition under article 227 of the constitution of india would be maintainable under the supervisory jurisdiction of the high court against the interlocutory orders of the subordinate courts. 3. responding to the objection of maintainability raised by the respondent, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the present petition is maintainable. it is urged that the order impugned in the present petition is an order by which an unconditional leave to defend has been granted to the defendant and therefore once the rights of the parties have been finally decided, the order cannot be termed as an interlocutory order. it is further argued that various courts including this high court have held that a revision petition under section 115 cpc is maintainable against an order granting leave to defend to a defendant in a summary suit under order xxxvii cpc. 4. learned counsel relies on the judgement of a coordinate bench of this court in spicejet ltd. vs. arun kumar (2017) scc online del 12712, wherein the court has observed that an order granting leave to defend is to be assailed in a revision petition under section 115 cpc. reliance is also placed on the judgement of the high court of jammu & kashmir in bal krishan vs jugal kishore being cr no. 10/2015, decided on 27.03.2019, where a revision petition was filed under section 115 cpc before the high court against the order of the trial court granting leave to defend in a suit under order xxxvii rule 3(5) of cpc. a question was raised by the respondent therein on the maintainability of the revision petition on the ground that the order granting leave to defend was an interlocutory order, against which no revision lies under section 115 cpc. court held that the petition was maintainable as the order impugned was not an interlocutory order on the ground that had the order been passed in favour of the petitioner, the result would have been passing of a decree in favour of the petitioner. learned counsel for the petitioner also relies on two judgements of the coordinate benches of this court in netrapal singh vs ravinder kumar kalyani 2019 scc online del 9622 and versatile commotrade pvt. ltd. vs maniram sh. munni ram through lrs & ors. 2019 scc online del 9003 and contends that in both the cases, revision petitions were entertained by the court against respective orders of the trial courts, by which leave to defend was granted to the defendants, in suits under order xxxvii cpc. 5. since the foremost issue before the court is the maintainability of the present petition, the facts necessary to that extent are that the petitioner filed a suit under order xxxvii cpc seeking recovery of a liquidated sum of rs. 1,11,86,611/-, which included the principal amount of rs. 82,86,379/and interest amounting to rs. 29,00,232.65p/calculated @ 14% per annum. 6. it is averred in the plaint that the plaintiff is a company incorporated under the companies act and engaged in the business of healthcare and supporting technologies and is an exclusive distributor of „haemonetics‟ in india for supply of medical items. defendant is a proprietor of a firm m/s. mega care international and engaged in the business of supplying medical equipments, disposables and related services. in 2009, defendant approached the plaintiff for supply of „haemonetics‟ and an mou was signed between the parties in 2009-2010, whereby defendant was granted distributorship for 27 months, subject to extension on mutually agreed terms. the mou expired in 2012, but parties carried on the business on a mutual understanding, till disputes arose in 2016, when the defendant started making defaults in payments despite receiving the goods. various emails were exchanged between the parties, wherein the defendant acknowledged that money was due and payable and also assured that payments would be made, yet payments were not paid, despite drawing up a schedule of payment. subsequently, defendant acknowledged that a sum of rs. 1.06 crores was payable but requested for settling at rs. 50 lacs only, to which plaintiff agreed, however, defendant did not honour his commitment. left with no option, plaintiff filed a suit for recovery, from which the present petition arises. 7. summons in the suit was served upon the defendant, who entered appearance within limitation and plaintiff thereafter applied for summons for judgement. on being served, defendant made an application for unconditional leave to defend, raising various issues therein. reply to the application was filed by the plaintiff and rejoinder was filed by the defendant. 8. the trial court, after hearing arguments, was of the view that the defendant had successfully raised triable issues and concluded that the suit for recovery was for balance amount due from the defendant and not purely on the value of the invoices relied upon in the suit and thus granted unconditional leave to defend. it is this order which is assailed by the petitioner before this court. 9. i have heard the learned counsels for the parties and examined their rival submissions. 10. the issue that arises for consideration before this court is the maintainability of the present revision petition filed under section 115 cpc in view of the provisions of section 8 of the act. in order to determine this issue, it is first necessary to examine the provisions of the said section, which is extracted hereunder for ready reference: \"8. bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order.--notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the commercial court.\" 11. i may note before proceeding further that the suit was filed in 2019 under the act and there is no dispute between the parties on this aspect. the act was enacted pursuant to the 253rd recommendations of the law commission. relevant would it be to note some of the key recommendations which would indicate the intent of the legislature behind the enactment, which was expeditious and fair disposal of the cases at a reasonable cost to the litigant as well as reduction in the backlog of pending cases in the courts. relevant passages from the report are as follows: \"4.1 while the need for commercial courts is obvious in india, the institution of such courts should be seen as a stepping-stone to reforming the civil justice system in india. at the same time, the reforms should be tailored to keep in mind the existing institutions and should focus on improving them within the existing legal framework. 4.2 the commercial courts, the commercial divisions and the commercial appellate divisions of high courts that have been recommended are intended to serve as a pilot project in the larger goal of reforming the civil justice system in india. the goal is to ensure that cases are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant. not only does this benefit the litigant, other potential litigants (especially those engaged in trade and commerce) are also advantaged by the reduction in backlog caused by the quick resolution of commercial disputes. in turn, this will further economic growth, increase foreign investment, and make india an attractive place to do business. further, it also benefits the economy as a whole given that a robust dispute resolution mechanism is a sine qua non for the allround development of an economy.\" 12. i may also allude to the recommendations which led to enactment of section 8 in the act, with which this case concerns and are as follows : \"4.3 in view of the above, a summary of the key recommendations of the law commission are reiterated below: xxx xxx xxx (f) the constitution of a commercial division or a commercial court should take place simultaneously with the constitution of a commercial appellate division. the commercial appellate division will hear the appeals against the orders and decrees passed by the commercial divisions or commercial courts. the commercial appellate division to not entertain any civil revision applications or petitions against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction (which can be agitated only in an appeal against a decree). appeals would lie only against the orders enumerated in order xliii of the cpc and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 and against no other orders. xxx xxx xxx (k) the bill shall have a streamlined procedure to be adopted for the conduct of cases in the commercial division and in the commercial court by amending the code of civil procedure, 1908 so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. the amended cpc as applicable to the commercial divisions and commercial courts will prevail over the existing high court rules and other provisions of the cpc to the contrary. some of the important changes proposed to the cpc are listed below: xxx xxx xxx (xviii) no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of the commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction.\" 13. from a reading of the relevant part of the report of the law commission and the provisions of section 8 of the act, two things clearly emerge, being relevant to the present case, firstly, that the said legislation is a step towards providing an expeditious and fast track mechanism for disposal of suits, pertaining to commercial disputes and secondly, there is a bar to a civil revision application/petition against an interlocutory order of a commercial court. second part of section 8 which provides that any such challenge shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the commercial court, subject, however, to the provisions of section 13 of the act, fortifies the background and the goal of the enactment. underlying spirit and intent of the provision of section 8 is to ensure that the time frame stipulated for case management to achieve the goal of speedy disposal does not become redundant by frequent filing of revision petitions/applications against interlocutory orders. thus, there can hardly be a debate that interlocutory orders passed by commercial courts cannot be assailed in revision petitions under section 115 cpc. 14. to this extent, i may rely on the observations of the gujarat high court in state of gujarat (supra) which are to the following effect: \"13. in view of the above and for reasons stated above and considering the decisions of hon'ble supreme court referred to hereinabove, our conclusions in nutshell are as under:(1) the bar contained under section 8 of the commercial courts act against entertainability of \"civil revision application or petition\" against the interlocutory orders passed by the subordinate/commercial courts, shall not be applicable to the writ petitions under article 227 of the constitution of india.\" 15. the question that now arises is whether the order granting unconditional leave to defend in a summary suit can be termed as an interlocutory order so as to bar the jurisdiction of this court in entertaining the present petition by virtue of the provisions of section 8 of the act. 16. the expression „interlocutory order‟ was considered by the supreme court in the landmark judgement in shah babulal khimji (supra). i may note here that in the said case the challenge before the supreme court was to an order of the bombay high court by which the appeal filed against an order of the trial court was dismissed as not maintainable on the ground that the impugned order was not a judgement within the meaning of clause 15 of letters patent of the high court. the substantial question of law before the supreme court was the scope, ambit and meaning of the word „judgement‟ in the aforesaid clause. in that context, the supreme court held that a judgement can be of three kinds; (a) a final judgement which decides all questions or issues in controversy, leaving nothing else to be decided which would mean that the action brought by the plaintiff is either dismissed or decreed in part or in full; (b) a preliminary judgement which in turn may take two forms, where the suit is dismissed on preliminary objections without going into merits or where there is an objection to the maintainability such as bar of jurisdiction etc. and the objections are decided against the defendant and the suit continues and (c) intermediary or interlocutory judgements which contain the quality of finality and are specified under order xliii rule 1 cpc or not covered by the said provision but have trappings of finality. supreme court held that judgement falling under category (a) and the first form in category (b) as well as those having characters and trappings of finality though being interlocutory orders would be appealable before the larger bench. relevant para of the judgement is as follows: \"118. in other words, a judgment can be of three kinds: (1) a final judgment-a judgment which decides all the questions or issues in controversy so far as the trial judge is concerned and leaves nothing else to be decided. this would mean that by virtue of the judgment, the suit or action brought by the plaintiff is dismissed or decreed in part or in full. such an order passed by the trial judge indisputably and unquestionably is a judgment within the meaning of the letters patent and even amounts to a decree so that an appeal would lie from such a judgment to a division bench. (2) a preliminary judgmentthis kind of a judgment may take two forms-(a) where the trial judge by an order dismisses the suit without going into the merits of the suit but only on a preliminary objection raised by the defendant or the party opposing on the ground that the suit is not maintainable. here also, as the suit is finally decided one way or the other, the order passed by the trial judge would be a judgment finally deciding the cause so far as the trial judge is concerned and therefore appealable to the larger bench. (b) another shape which a preliminary judgment may take is that where the trial judge passes an order after hearing the preliminary objections raised by the defendant relating to maintainability of the suit, e.g., bar of jurisdiction, res judicata, a manifest defect in the suit, absence of notice under section 80 and the like, and these objections are decided by the trial judge against the defendant, the suit is not terminated but continues and has to be tried on merits but the order of the trial judge rejecting the objections doubtless adversely affects a valuable right of the defendant who, if his objections are valid, is entitled to get the suit dismissed on preliminary grounds. thus, such an order even though it keeps the suit alive, undoubtedly decides an important aspect of the trial which affects a vital right of the defendant and must, therefore, be construed to be a judgment so as to be appealable to larger bench. (3) intermediary or interlocutory judgment-most of the interlocutory orders which contain the quality of finality are clearly specified in clauses (a) to (w) of order 43 rule 1 and have already been held by us to be judgments within the meaning of the letters patent and, therefore, appealable. there may also be interlocutory orders which are not covered by order 43 rule 1 but which also possess the characteristics and trappings of finality in that, the orders may adversely affect a valuable right of the party or decide an important aspect of the trial in an ancillary proceeding. before such an order can be a judgment the adverse effect on the party concerned must be direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote. for instance, where the trial judge in a suit under order 37 of the code of civil procedure refuses the defendant leave to defend the suit, the order directly affects the defendant because he loses a valuable right to defend the suit and his remedy is confined only to contest the plaintiff's case on his own evidence without being given a chance to rebut that evidence. as such an order vitally affects a valuable right of the defendant it will undoubtedly be treated as a judgment within the meaning of the letters patent so as to be appealable to a larger bench. take the converse case in a similar suit where the trial judge allows the defendant to defend the suit in which case although the plaintiff is adversely affected but the damage or prejudice caused to him is not direct or immediate but of a minimal nature and rather too remote because the plaintiff still possesses his full right to show that the defence is false and succeed in the suit. thus, such an order passed by the trial judge would not amount to a judgment within the meaning of clause 15 of the letters patent but will be purely an interlocutory order.\" 17. insofar as the present case is concerned, para 3 above of the judgement is extremely relevant. supreme court has held that even interlocutory orders can be appealable if they possess characteristics and trappings of finality and the test is to determine the adverse effect on the party concerned and to see if the effect is direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote. while so holding the apex court categorically referred to orders passed under order xxxvii of the code of civil procedure refusing or granting leave to defend, as an illustration. the observations are significant for the present controversy inasmuch as it was held that where the trial court refuses to grant leave to defend to the defendant, it directly affects the defendant because he loses a valuable right to defend the suit and the remedy is confined only to contest the plaintiff‟s case on his own evidence without a chance to rebut that evidence. as the order vitally affects a valuable right, it is a judgement appealable before a larger bench. however, in a converse case in a similar suit, where the court allows the defendant to defend the suit, although the plaintiff is adversely affected but the damage or prejudice caused to him is of a minimal nature and too remote because the plaintiff still possesses full right to show that the defence is false and succeed in the suit. having so observed, the supreme court categorically held that such an order would not amount to a judgement within the meaning of clause 15 of letters patent and is purely an interlocutory order. neither of the parties have referred to or relied upon any judgement of the supreme court subsequent to the judgement in shah babulal khimji (supra) wherein a different interpretation has been given to the expression „interlocutory order/judgement‟. 18. in fact, the salutary principles laid down in the said judgement have been followed by several high courts, very recently, including the high court of uttarakhand in kanupriya vs ashutosh agrawal being appeal from order no. 99 of 2017, decided on 05.07.2017, where the interpretation of the said expression came up for consideration in the context of section 19 of the family courts act. 19. the high court relied on the observations in shah babulal khimji (supra), more particularly para 118, and the relevant para of the judgement of the uttarakhand high court is as follows: \"6 . we may also notice the judgment of the bench of this court in rahul samrat tandon vs. smt. neeru tandon, reported in 2010 (2) ud 4. therein, the appeal was filed under section 19 of the act against an order passed on an application under section 24 of the hindu marriage act, 1955. the court referred to the decisions in the cases of sunil hansraj gupta vs. payal sunil gupta, reported in air 1991 bombay 423; radheshyam gupta vs. smt. laxmi bai, reported in air 1977 madhya pradesh 271; and gurbaksh singh vs. smt. taran jit, reported in air 1977 himachal pradesh 66. the court took the following view: \"11. a bare perusal of section 19(1) of 1984 act shows that an appeal is only maintainable in two cases. firstly, it is maintainable against a judgment. secondly, it is also maintainable against an order, if that order is not an interlocutory order. now even assuming for the sake of argument that the order presently impugned is an order of an interlocutory nature, then what has to be seen is as to whether the order stands in the category of a \"judgment\", as stated under section 19 of the 1984 act. the word \"judgment\" has not been defined in the family court act. it is defined under section 2 (9) of the code of civil procedure as follows: \"2. definitions.(9) \"judgment\" means the statement given by the judge of the grounds of a decree or order;\" this definition, referred above, is of no use to us as it does not define either the wide or narrow parameters within which the word \"judgment\" has to be construed nor does it state as to what are the characteristics of a 'judgment'. however, there are a catena of decisions defining the parameters of what would constitute a \"judgment\". leading case on this issue is that of shah babulal khimji vs. jayaben d. kania and another air 1981 sc 1786. the supreme court in this seminal judgment had laid down the parameters within which the court must examine as to when an order or even an interlocutory order has the trappings of a judgment. though the issue was as to what would constitute a \"judgment\" which would be appealable in a letter patent appeal, all the same, the broad principles laid down in the above case would equally apply to the present case as well. as per the ratio laid down by the apex court in the above judgment, an order or an interlocutory order would be called a judgment, if it has the quality of \"finality\" to it. the apex court laid down that there can be three kinds of judgments. relevant portion of the said judgment to that effect is as follows: \" xxx xxx xxx 3) intermediary or interlocutory judgment: most of the interlocutory orders which contain the quality of finality are clearly specified in clauses (a) to (w) of order 43, rule 1 and have already been held by us to be judgments within the meaning of the letters patent and, therefore, appealable. there may also be interlocutory orders which are not covered by order 43, rule 1 but which also possess the characteristics and trappings of finality in that, the orders may adversely affect a valuable right of the party or decide an important aspect of the trial in an ancillary proceeding. before such an order can be a judgment the adverse affect on the party concerned must be direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote.\" the court referred to the judgment of the apex court in shah babulal khimji vs. jayaben d. kania and another, reported in air 1981 sc 1786. therein, the apex court had categorized the decisions as final judgments, preliminary judgments and intermediary or interlocutory judgments. under the category of \"intermediary or interlocutory judgment\", the apex court observed as already referred to above. the court also referred to the judgment of the full bench of the allahabad high court in smt. kiran bala srivastava vs. jai prakash srivastava, reported in 2005 (23) lcd 1. the court further appreciated the importance of an order passed under section 24 in the light of the aforesaid judgment noting that the provision is important from the point of view of the wife, as her survival during the pendency of the proceedings under the act and right to prosecute or defend the proceedings depends on the outcome of the proceedings under section 24. agreeing with the allahabad high court judgment, the court held that the appeal is maintainable as the impugned order therein was in the nature of a judgment and is appealable under section 19 of the act.\" 20. i may usefully refer to another passage from the same judgment as follows :\"9. in the judgment of the high court of kerala in the case of thankappan nair vs. prasannakumari & others in m.f.a. no. 1760/1994-b, decided on 30.06.1995, a bench considered the question whether an order attaching the salary for failure to pay maintenance as ordered by the court was interlocutory. the court concluded that the order was interlocutory. the court, inter alia, held as follows and dismissed the appeal finally: \"6. in webster's \"new world dictionary\" the word \"interlocutory order\" has been defined as an order other than final decision. this expression \"interlocutory order\" has appeared differently in different statutes and received different construction by the courts depending upon the contexts and setting in which the expression has been used. under section 397(2) of the code of criminal procedure, revisional jurisdiction is excluded in relation to an interlocutory order. however, the expression \"interlocutory order\" appearing in the said section has received wider meaning in a number of decisions (vide amar nath v. state of hariyana 1977 (4) scc 137, madhu limaye v. state of maharashtra (1977) 4 scc 551 and hariyana land reclamation and development corporation ltd. v. state of hariyana (1990) 3 scc 588. 8. with the help of legal principles discussed in the above decisions we can gauge the amplitude of the expression \"interlocutory order\" in section 19 of the act. we bear in mind that what is banned under the said chapter is not only appeals against interlocutory orders but even the revisional jurisdiction is also foreclosed in the sweep. of course, it is unusual that in a statute wherein appellate jurisdiction is closed then revisional jurisdiction is also closed in respect of the same category of orders. what would have been the legislative intent in providing such a ban. the parties in family courts very often include destitute and orphaned wives and or children and perhaps poor widows also. if appeal or revision is provided against interlocutory orders the proceedings in the family court could successfully be scuttled by rich and contumacious opposite parties by taking the matter to the high court against any order passed during interlocutory stages. legislature would have intended to prevent it. in that perspective it can be construed that the interlocutory order envisaged in chapter v of the act is an order other than final orders. hence the meaning of interlocutory order in section 19 shall be understood as an order which is not a final order.\"\" 21. a judgment of the supreme court in v.c. shukla vs state air 1980 sc 962 is also relevant in the context of interpretation of the expression „interlocutory order‟ and the observations are as under :\"ordinarily speaking, the expression interlocutory in legal parlance is understood in contra distinction to what is styled as final. in the course of a judicial proceeding before a court, for judicially determining the main dispute brought to the court for its resolution, a number of situations arise, when that court goes on disposing of ancillary disputes raised by parties to the proceeding by making orders and unless the order finally disposes of a proceeding in a court all such orders during the course of a trial would be broadly designated \"interlocutory\" orders. such interlocutory orders are steps, taken towards the final adjudication and for assisting the parties in the prosecution of their case in the pending proceedings.\" 22. from a reading of the aforesaid judgements, the inevitable conclusion is that an order of the trial court passed in a summary suit under order xxxvii cpc, granting leave to defend to defendant, conditional or unconditional, is an „interlocutory order‟. the commercial court act has no provision which separately defines the said expression. in my view, despite the enactment of the said act, this court has to fall back on the interpretation of the expression given by the supreme court in shah babulal khimji (supra) which holds the field till date and is a binding dicta. 23. i may also mention that the expression „interlocutory order‟ has been a subject-matter of interpretation given in the context of special statutes with an underlined legislative intent. in v.c. shukla (supra) while dealing with connotation of the word „interlocutory order‟ in section 11 of the special courts act, where a revision was filed against an order directing framing of charge against the appellant, court held as under: \"the dominant purpose of the act is to achieve not only speedy determination but a determination with the utmost dispatch. therefore, the provisions of the act must be interpreted so as to eliminate all possible avenues of delay or means of adopting dilatory tactics by plugging every possible loophole in the act through which the disposal of the case may be delayed. it was for this purpose that a non obstante clause was put in s. 11 of the act so as to bar appeals against any interlocutory order whether it is of an intermediate nature or is quasi final. as the non obstante clause expressly excludes the provisions of the code of criminal procedure, courts cannot call into aid the provisions of s. 397(2) of the code which would amount to frustrating the very object which s. 11 seeks to advance. the absence of revision is more than compensated by giving the accused a right of an appeal against any judgment or order of the special judge as of right and open on facts and law. the trial is held by a sitting high court judge who also would have the power of revision if he was sitting in a high court. therefore, it would not be in keeping with the dignity, decorum and status of the special judge to provide for an appeal even against such an order which he is supposed to pass with full application of mind and due deliberation. in order to construe the term 'interlocutory', it has to be construed in contradistinction to or in contrast with a final order. in other words, the words 'not a final order' must necessarily mean an interlocutory order or an intermediate order. thus, the expression 'interlocutory order' is to be understood and taken to mean converse of the term 'final order'. an interlocutory order merely decides some point or matter essential to the progress of the suit or collateral to the issues sought but not a final decision or judgment on the matter in issue. an intermediate order is one which is made between the commencement of an action and the entry of the judgment. an order framing of the charge being an intermediate order falls squarely within the ordinary and natural meaning of the term 'interlocutory order' as used in s. 11(1) of the act.\" 24. as recent as in 2019, a division bench of high court of madras in magic frames and ors. vs radiance media p. ltd. 2019(4)ctc497, while deciding the issue of maintainability of an appeal against an order dismissing an application filed by the defendants under order 13-a cpc to pass a summary judgment albeit in the context of appeal under section 13(2) of the act had the occasion of considering expression \"interlocutory order\". in that context, the court relied on the judgment of the supreme court in lic vs. sanjeev builders (p) ltd., 2018 (11) scc 722, and shah babulal khimji (supra) as under :\"6. the learned counsel for the appellants/defendants further contended that after amendment, the word \"decision\" is replaced by \"judgment or order\". section 13 of the commercial courts act-sub-section (1) was substituted by subsection (1) along with sub-section (1-a) with proviso. the sub-section (1) after amendment, deals with the appeals from the subordinate courts dealing with commercial transactions. the said sub-section (1-a) deals with the appeals from the district court as well as commercial division of the high court to the commercial appellate division of the high court. the proviso is common to subsection (1) and sub-section (1-a). while sub-section (1-a) says that any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court at the level of district judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, commercial division of a high court, may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court, proviso to sub-section (1a) deals with lying of appeal from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order 43 of cpc as amended by the said act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. further, the learned counsel for the appellants also submitted that section 13(2) of the commercial courts act provides that, \"notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\" thus, the term \"judgment or order\" inserted in sub-section (1-a) by the amendment, was consciously introduced by the legislature and the term \"judgment or order\" is not touched by the proviso or sub-section (2). thus, the learned counsel for the appellants drew the attention of this court to the scheme of section 13, wherein, after amendment, it clearly says that when an appeal is filed against an interlocutory order, if such order is covered by order 43 cpc, then the appeal automatically lies. this is the effect of the proviso. the proviso does not go further and it does not prohibit appeals against other orders. the learned counsel for the appellants therefore submitted that whether an order is a judgment or not, will be determined by the appellate court before admitting the appeal. in this regard, the learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the guidelines for such determination are well settled and recently noticed in the decision of the supreme court reported in manu/sc/1361/2017 : 2018 (11) scc 722 (lic vs. sanjeev builders (p) ltd), in which, while elaborating upon the nature of \"interlocutory order\" or \"judgment\", it was observed by the apex court as follows: \"9. elaborating upon nature of \"interlocutory order\" or \"judgment\" and observing that the letters patent appeal would lie from the judgment which would affect the vital and valuable rights of the parties and which work serious injustice to the parties concerned, in shah babulal khimji vs. jayaben d. kania and another manu/sc/0036/1981 : (1981) 4 scc 8, it was held as under (scc pp. 53 & 5758, paras 106 & 114-17:\"106. thus, the only point which emerges from this decision is that whenever a trial judge decides a controversy which affects valuable rights of one of the parties, it must be treated to be a judgment within the meaning of the letters patent. 114. in the course of the trial, the trial judge may pass a number of orders whereby some of the various steps to be taken by the parties in prosecution of the suit may be of a routine nature while other orders may cause some inconvenience to one party or the other, e.g., an order refusing an adjournment, an order refusing to summon an additional witness or documents, an order refusing to condone delay in filing documents, after the first date of hearing an order of costs to one of the parties for its default or an order exercising discretion in respect of a procedural matter against one party or the other. such orders are purely interlocutory and cannot constitute judgments because it will always be open to the aggrieved party to make a grievance of the order passed against the party concerned in the appeal against the final judgment passed by the trial judge. 115. thus, in other words every interlocutory order cannot be regarded as a judgment but only those orders would be judgments which decide matters of moment or affect vital and valuable rights of the parties and which work serious injustice to the party concerned. similarly, orders passed by the trial judge deciding question of admissibility or relevancy of a document also cannot be treated as judgments because the grievance on this score can be corrected by the appellate court in appeal against the final judgment. 116. we might give another instance of an interlocutory order which amounts to an exercise of discretion and which may yet amount to a judgment within the meaning of the letters patent. suppose the trial judge allows the plaintiff to amend his plaint or include a cause of action or a relief as a result of which a vested right of limitation accrued to the defendant is taken away and rendered nugatory. it is manifest that in such cases, although the order passed by the trial judge is purely discretionary and interlocutory, it causes gross injustice to the defendant who is deprived of a valuable right of defence to the suit. such an order, therefore, though interlocutory in nature contains the attributes and characteristics of finality and must be treated as a judgment within the meaning of the letters patent. this is what was held by this court in shanti kumar case (shanthi kumar r. canji vs. home insurance co. of new york, (1974) 2 scc 387, as discussed above. 117. let us take another instance of a similar order which may not amount to a judgment. suppose, the trial judge allows the plaintiff to amend the plaint by adding a particular relief or taking an additional ground which may be inconsistent with the pleas taken by him but is not barred by limitation and does not work serious injustice to the defendant who would have ample opportunity to disprove the amended plea taken by plaintiff at the trial. in such cases, the order of the trial judge would only be a simple interlocutory order without containing any quality of finality and would therefore not be a judgment within the meaning of clause 15 of the letters patent.\" (emphasis supplied)\" 10. applying the above principle to the case in hand, we find that the order allowing the application impleading respondent no. 3 as assignee (order xxii rule 10 cpc) after 27 years of filing of the suit vitally affects the valuable rights of the appellant. the order allowing amendment of plaint by impleading respondent no. 3 as \"plaintiff no. 3\" on the basis of alleged assignment of agreement dated 24.08.1987 decides a vital question which concerns the rights of the parties and hence is a \"judgment\" to maintain the letters patent appeal. in our view, allowing of such application after 27 years of filing suit for specific performance would cause serious prejudice to the appellant-defendant depriving valuable right of defence available to the appellant and hence the order of single judge allowing the chamber summons is a \"judgment' within the meaning of clause 15 of the letters patent.\" xxx xxx xxx 8. the learned counsel for the appellants also relied on a judgment of the supreme court reported in manu/sc/0036/1981 : 1981 (4) scc 8 (shah babulal khimji vs. jayaben d. kania), wherein the apex court held as follows: \"106. thus, the only point which emerges from this decision is that whenever a trial judge decides a controversy which affects valuable rights of one of the parties, it must be treated to be a judgment within the meaning of the letters patent.\" \"115. thus, in other words every interlocutory order cannot be regarded as a judgment but only those orders would be judgments which decide matters of moment or affect vital and valuable right of the parties and which work serious injustice to the party concerned. similarly, orders passed by the trial judge deciding question of admissibility or relevancy of a document also cannot be treated as judgments because the grievance on this score can be corrected by the appellate court in appeal against the final judgment.\" \"120. thus, these are some of the principles which might guide a division bench in deciding whether an order passed by the trial judge amounts to a judgment within the meaning of the letters patent. we might, however, at the risk of repetition give illustrations of interlocutory orders which may be treated as judgments: (1) an order granting leave to amend the plaint by introducing a new cause of action which completely alters the nature of the suit and takes away a vested right of limitation or any other valuable right accrued to the defendant. (2) an order rejecting the plaint. (3) an order refusing leave to defend the suit in an action under order 37, code of civil procedure. (4) an order rescinding leave of the trial judge granted by him under clause 12 of the letters patent. (5) an order deciding a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the suit on the ground of limitation, absence of notice under section 80, bar against competency of the suit against the defendant even though the suit is kept alive. (6) an order rejecting an application for a judgment on admission under order 12 rule 6. (7) an order refusing to add necessary parties in a suit under section 92 of the code of civil procedure. (8) an order varying or amending a decree. (9) an order refusing leave to sue in forma pauperis. (10) an order granting review. (11) an order allowing withdrawal of the suit with liberty to file a fresh one. (12) an order holding that the defendants are not agriculturists within the meaning of the special law. (13) an order staying or refusing to stay a suit under section 10 of the code of civil procedure. (14) an order granting or refusing to stay execution of the decree. (15). an order deciding payment of court-fees against the plaintiff.\" 25. madras high court finally held as under :\"29. it is also submitted by the learned counsel for the appellants that whenever a trial judge decides a controversy which affects the valuable rights of one of the parties, it must be treated to be a 'judgment' within the meaning of the \"letters patent\". but we see in the instant case that the dismissal of the application by the learned single judge has not affected the valuable rights of the parties to contest the suit, which is very much available to the respective parties on the merits of the matter. therefore, the decision relied on by the learned counsel for the appellants, reported in 1981 (4) scc 8 (shah babulal khimji vs. jayaben d. kania), is distinguishable and different on the facts and circumstances of the case and it is not applicable to the present case on hand. 30. furthermore, we are of the opinion that the nature of the order passed by the court will not finally determine the rights of the parties and the respondent/plaintiff or the appellants/defendants have an opportunity to prove their respective case by proceeding with the trial. therefore, it cannot be construed that the nature of the order passed by the learned single judge is \"judgment\". on that ground, we are of the opinion that the present appeal is not maintainable. moreover, the object of the commercial courts act is to provide for speedy disposal of triable valuable commercial dispute. when that being so, the object of the commercial courts act cannot be defeated by filing plethora of appeals to stall the original proceedings. hence, we are of the opinion that the present appeal is not maintainable.\" 26. learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on the judgements of the coordinate benches of this court in spicejet ltd. (supra), netrapal singh(supra) and versatile commotrade pvt. ltd.(supra) to argue that the revision petition is maintainable. in my view, none of the three judgements inure to the advantage of the petitioner to support the proposition argued. in spicejet ltd. (supra), the petition was filed under article 227 of the constitution of india and the original suit was not a commercial suit. in that context the court had observed that an order of the trial court granting leave to defend is assailable in a revision petition. since the suit was not under the commercial courts act, bar of section 8 of the act did not come into play and thus the court had no reason or occasion to deal with the provisions of the section. likewise in the other two judgments, the suits were not under the commercial courts act and thus, provisions of section 8 of the act were not an issue for consideration. since section 8 of the act did not come into play, the revision petitions were maintainable and entertained by the court. in so far as the judgment in bal krishan (supra) is concerned, suffice would it be to state that the finding of the court is against the dicta of the supreme court in shah babulal khimji (supra) where, the supreme court clearly held that an order granting leave to defend is an interlocutory order and the said judgment clearly binds this court. 27. in view of the aforesaid judgements and the legislative intent underlying section 8 of the act, i hold that the impugned order herein is an interlocutory order and the present petition is not maintainable, on account of the bar under section 8 of the act. 28. revision petition is accordingly dismissed, giving liberty to the petitioner to resort to appropriate remedies available, in accordance with law. it is made clear that this court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case, including the alternate argument of the petitioner that even if the trial court was inclined to grant leave to defend, it ought to have granted conditional leave. jyoti singh, j april 16, 2021 rd"
