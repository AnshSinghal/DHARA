The appellant has filed the present appeal impugning an interim order dated 16.08.2023 passed by the learned Commercial Court (hereafter 'the impugned order') whereby the applicatio n filed by the appellant under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereafter 'the CPC') was rejected. The appellant had filed the application in CS (COMM) 388/2020 captioned M/s. Agarwalla Timbers Private Limited v. Amrose Singapore Pte Ltd. & Ors..\n2. The appellant had filed the aforementioned suit for permanent and mandatory injunction. The appellant, inter alia, seeks a decree of declaration that a transaction entered into between the appellant and respondent no.1 (Amrose Singapore Pte. Ltd. - hereafter 'ASPL') is vitiated by fraud and the appellant is not liable to make payment against a Commercial Invoice dated 09.03.2020 for an amount of USD 121,922.84/- (hereafter 'the Commercial Invoice') and/or under the Letter of Credit bearing no. 49790NI00005320 dated 06.03.2020 for an amount of USD 176,235/- (hereafter 'the LC').\n3. The appellant also seeks a decree of permanent and mandatory injunction restraining respondent no. 3 bank (hereafter 'he Union Bank of India') from making payment to ASPL or respondent no. 2 bank (hereafter 'the Indian Bank') and against ASPL and the Indian Bank restraining them from raising any demand to the Union Bank of India for payment under the Commercial Invoice and/or the LC. \n4. By the impugned order the learned Commercial Court had rejected the relief sought by the appellant for an interim injunction restraining the Union Bank of India from making any payment to the Indian Bank against the LC. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND 5. It is the appellant's case that it had entered into a transaction for purchasing New Zealand Radiata Pine logs (Timber) from ASPL. The said goods were to be supplied against an irrevocable Letter of Credit. Accordingly, the appellant had approached the Union Bank of India with a request to open the Letter of Credit for an amount of USD 176,235/- favouring ASPL. The appellant claims that the payment was required to be released against supply of the goods in question (New Zealand Radiata Pine Logs). At the appellant's insistence, the Union Bank of India issued the LC. \n6. The appellant states that, on 09.03.2020, the Indian Bank forwarded the following shipment documents (hereafter collectively referred 'shipment documents') to the Union Bank of India:\na. Commercial Invoice dated 09.03.2020 for an amount of USD 121,922.84/-\nb. Bill of Lading dated 09.03.2020 bearing no. AP/NZ/IND-13 c. Packing List dated 09.03.2020 d. Insurance dated 09.03.2020 e. Certificate of Origin dated 09.03.2020 f. Beneficiary's Certificate dated 09.03.2020 7. The Bill of Lading dated 09.03.2020 indicated the Port of Loading - Tauranga and Marsden Point, New Zealand. The goods had been loaded on a vessel named Vessel - MV Asia Pearl 1 V5. The freight was pre- paid. The place and date of issue of lading was Singapore and it was issued by ASPL as agents for and on behalf of Asia Pearl 1 V5 Captain Lirong. \n8. The shipment documents were accepted by the Union Bank of India on 17.03.2020 and this acceptance was communicated by a SWIFT message to the Indian Bank. \n9. On 11.03.2020 the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a Pandemic by the World Health Organisation. Thereafter on 24.03.2020 a Nationwide Lockdown was invoked in India under the provisions of the National Disaster Management Act, 2005. The appellant states that by E-mail dated 01.04.2020, Mr. Praveen Bejoy (Representative of ASPL) informed the appellant that due to the uncertainty created by the lockdown in India, the vessel carrying the timber was diverted to China. It was informed to the appellant by the said E-mail that the vessel owner was not sure if he would be able to berth the vessel at Kandla Port, India. He further requested the appellant to not accept any documents that reached or may reach the appellant's banks. He clarified that the shipping documents would be replaced with new shipment documents. \n10. The appellant states that by an E-mail dated 17.04.2020 ASPL once again informed the appellant that the vessel carrying the shipment was diverted and requested the appellant to return the LC as the contract between the parties stood cancelled. \n11. The Union Bank of India sent a SWIFT message to the Indian Bank on 22.04.2020 and requested them to treat the acceptance of the shipment documents on 17.03.2020 as null and void. \n12. The Indian Bank replied to the SWIFT message sent by the Union Bank of India by a SWIFT message dated 04.05.2020 and refused to treat the acceptance of the shipment documents accepted on 17.03.2020 as null and void.\n13. It is averred by the appellant that it replied to the E-mail dated 01.04.2020 by an E-mail dated 03.04.2020 and informed Mr. Praveen Bejoy that the shipment documents had been accepted by the Union Bank of India. It further requested Mr. Praveen Bejoy to ask the Indian Bank to send an E-mail to the Union Bank of India for the return of the accepted shipment documents. It is stated that a reminder of the E-mail dated 03.04.2020 was sent on 08.04.2020.\n14. The appellant claims that it sent an E-mail to TPT Forests (ASPL is an agent of TPT Forests) dated 07.05.2020 addressing its concerns. It further requested them to clarify as to why the vessel in question (Asia Pearl 1 V5) was diverted from Kandla Port, India. \n15. The appellant states that on 07.05.2020 it addressed an E-Mail to M/s Wilson Surveyors and Adjusters Pvt. Ltd. (which are the claim agents of Vero Marine, insurance company) informing them as to the diversion of the vessel in question. The appellant requested them to investigate the matter and trace the cargo. The appellant also stated that in case they fail to trace the cargo, they must process the insurance claim of the appellant. \n16. The appellant claims that TPT Forests responded on 11.05.2020 and stated that the vessel (Asia Pearl 1 V5) had completed loading on 22.03.2020 and started the journey on the same day. On 12.05.2020, Mr. Praveen Bejoy addressed an E-mail to the appellant assuring that ASPL has communicated to the Indian Bank that the shipment documents are to be recalled. The appellant states that once again it addressed an E-mail to TPT Forests on 13.05.2020 asking them for an explanation regarding the diverting of the vessel in question. The appellant on 09.06.2020 addressed an E-mail to TPT Forests stating that ASPL had still not asked the Indian Bank to communicate with the Union Bank of India for the recall of documents. The E-mail also stated that the Indian Bank is insisting for payments despite the Union Bank of India asking them to treat the acceptance of the shipping documents as null and void. The appellant states that it received an E-Mail dated 29.07.2020 from TPT Forests clarifying that the decision to divert the vessel was due to issues arising out of force majeure. It clarified that TPT Forests had no knowledge of the Bill of Lading issued on 09.03.2020 and they had not issued or authorised the same. TPT Forests stated in the E-mail that the Bill of Lading was not valid. \n17. On 19.05.2020, M/s Wilson Surveyors and Adjusters Pvt. Ltd. responded to the E-mail dated 07.05.2020 of the appellant and stated that in case the vessel does not reach the final destination, their liability, ceases. \n18. The appellant alleges that fraud was played by ASPL on sixteen similarly placed buyers of timber, including the appellant. The appellant claims that it approached other buyers and received information that documents issued by ASPL were forged. The appellant claims that on 21.05.2020 another buyer M/s. Chaudhary Timbers Private Limited approached the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), a specialised division of the International Chambers of Commerce with a request to inquire if the Bill of Lading provided by ASPL for M/s. Chaudhary Timbers Private Limited, were original. The IMB informed M/s. Chaudhary Timbers Private Limited that the Bill of Lading issued by ASPL is null and void. M/ s. Chaudhary Timbers Private Limited was also informed by the insurance company, Vero Marine, that the insurance documents issued by ASPL, did not appear to be genuine. The Auckland Business Chamber also informed the buyer that the certificates of origin were not issued by the New Zealand Chambers of Commerce, which is accredited for the issuance of certificates of origin. \n19. The appellant claims that another buyer M/s. Utkal Lumbers Private Limited was informed by Vero Marine, that the insurance documents provided to them by ASPL are fraudulent and therefore, their claim is not valid. \n20. Agents on behalf of the owner of the vessel (Asia Maritime Pacific Limited) also responded to the legal notice sent by one of the buyers (M/s. Jyoti Timbers - appellant in FAO (COMM) 179/2023) and clarified that the Bill of Lading issued to it by ASPL was fraudulent and that the loading of the cargo did not begin on the said date. On 18.07.2020, Arnav Shipping Private Limited (an agent of the vessel owner - Asia Maritime Pacific Limited) responded to the legal notices addressed to them by various buyers and clarified that the Bills of Lading issued to them by ASPL were null and void. \n21. The appellant filed the aforementioned suit alleging that fraud was played upon it and seeks permanent and mandatory injunction restraining payment being made to ASPL or to the Indian Bank on its behalf. The appellant's application seeking interim injunction to restrain ASPL and the Indian Bank from receiving the amount under the Commercial Invoice and/or the LC was rejected by the learned Commercial Court by the impugned order. \n22. It is stated by the appellant that an application was filed by the Indian Bank under Order VII Rule 11 and the same was rejected by the learned Commercial Court by an order dated 12.10.2021. The appellant states that a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India impugning the said order has been filed by the Indian Bank and the same is pending adjudication. \nTHE IMPUGNED ORDER 23. The learned Commercial Court noted that the shipping documents submitted by ASPL to the Union Bank of India through the Indian Bank were accepted by the Union Bank of India and a SWIFT message communicating such acceptance was sent to the Indian Bank.\n24. The learned Commercial Court referred to Article 14 and Article 15 of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits of the International Chamber of Commerce that came into force on 01.07.2007 (hereafter 'UCP-600') and noted that the alleged fraud was not communicated to the Indian Bank within five days of the presentation of the shipping documents. \n25. The learned Commercial Court observed that the LC was an independent contract and was not concerned with the underlying contract for sale and purchase of the goods. Since, the Union Bank of India had not raised any objections regarding the LC on presentation, it was bound to honour the same. \n26. The learned Commercial Court took note of the submission of the appellant regarding the alleged fraud by ASPL and observed that the Indian Bank had no knowledge or notice of the alleged fraud at the time of negotiation of the LC or within five banking days from the day of presentation (of the shipping documents). It was observed that although the acceptance was communicated in March 2020, the alleged fraud was discovered in May or June 2020. \n27. The learned Commercial Court held that the obligation of the issuing bank (The Union Bank of India) to pay under the LC did not depend on the underlying contract between the buyer (appellant) and the seller (ASPL). The Court further held that, prima facie, the appellant had failed to establish that the Indian Bank had knowledge of the alleged fraud at the time of acceptance of the documents or within five days of the presentation of the shipping documents. \nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 28. Mr. Dholakia, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant submits that the Indian Bank in the present case is merely a nominated bank and not a negotiated bank. He contends that no negotiation of the LC had taken place and no documents had been placed on record with regard to any such negotiation. He contends that the learned Commercial Court had failed to note the difference between a nominee bank and negotiating bank under UCP-600.\n29. He contended that the negotiation of LC is analogical to the concept of 'Holder in due course' in terms of Section 9 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881. It is submitted that in both cases it is the obligation of the holder to prove that he became the possessor of the instrument for consideration upon payment. \n30. He has submitted that the beneficiary, ASPL does not wish to receive the payment under the LC and moreover, the LC was already returned by the Union Bank of India to the Indian Bank. \nREASONS AND CONCLUSION 31. It is apparent from the averments made by the appellant (plaintiff in the plaint) as well as the averments made in the present appeal, that the appellant seeks to set up a case of an egregious fraud and forgery for avoiding any liability under the LC issued at its instance by the Union Bank of India. \n32. The appellant seeks to rely on certain emails sent on behalf of ASPL to substantiate its claim that the contract for sale and purchase of goods in question was cancelled. Accordingly, the appellant was instructed not to accept the documents, which were presented. The appellant claims that the vessel carrying the goods in question had been diverted to China without the appellant's knowledge and consent. \n33. Since the documents presented by the Indian Bank had already been accepted by the Union Bank, the appellant by an email dated 03.04.2020 called upon ASPL to request the Indian Bank to communicate with the Union Bank of India and recall the documents. The appellant also sent a reminder dated 08.04.2020. The appellant claims that certain other buyers who had purchased similar goods, which were stated to be on board of the said vessel (Asia Pearl 1 V5), were similarly aggrieved and had accordingly initiated correspondence with the counter parties. The appellant claims that it had also addressed letters to the insurance claim agent of Vero Marine, M/s Wilson Surveyors and Adjusters Pvt. Ltd. informing them that there was diversion of the vessel in question and to investigate the matter and trace out the cargo. \n34. The appellant claims that one of the buyers (Utkal Lumbers Pvt. Ltd.), which was placed in a similar position as the appellant was informed by the insurance company (Vero Marine) that the insurance documents provided were fraudulent and accordingly, their claim was rejected. Similarly, the insurance claims by another similarly placed buyer (M/s Chaudhary Timbers Pvt. Ltd.) were also rejected on the ground that the documents were fraudulent. The appellant also relies on other communications sent by agents of the vessel owner (Asia Maritime Pacific Limited), as well as, the insurance company in support of its contention that the Bill of Lading was fraudulent as the loading on the cargo had not begun on the date of Bill of Lading. The appellant, on the basis of communications issued by agents of the said vessel owner, claims that the Bill of Lading in question was not authorized and the same was null and void. It is also contended that the said Bills of Lading and other documents appear to be forged. \n35. It is important to note that ASPL had not appeared before the learned Commercial Court and has not contested the present appeal either. However, the same was resisted stoutly on behalf of the Indian Bank. It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the LC in question was not negotiated and the Indian bank is merely acting on behalf of ASPL. The same is contested by the Indian Bank. \n36. The Indian Bank has averred in paragraph 5 of the written statement that it had already negotiated the LC and the payments had been released to ASPL. Accordingly, the Indian Bank claims that notwithstanding the allegation raised by the appellant, it is entitled to receive the payment from the Union Bank of India against the LC in question.\n37. UCP 600 governs the operations of Letters of Credit. Article 4 of UCP 600, expressly provides that a credit by its very nature is a separate transaction from the sale or other contracts on which it is based. The banks are neither concerned nor bound by such contract, even if a reference to such contracts is included in the credit. Article 4 of UCP 600 is relevant and is set out below:\n\"Credits v. Contracts a. A credit by its nature is a separate transaction from the sale or other contract on which it may be based. Banks are in no way concerned with or bound by such contract, even if any reference whatsoever to it is included in the credit. Consequently, the undertaking of a bank to honour, to negotiate or to fulfil any other obligation under the credit is not subject to claims or defences by the applicant resulting from its relationships with the issuing bank or the beneficiary. A beneficiary can in no case avail itself of the contractual relationships existing between banks or between the applicant and the issuing bank. \nb. An issuing bank should discourage any attempt by the applicant to include, as an integral part of the credit, copies of the underlying contract, proforma invoice and the like.\" \n38. In terms of Article 14 of UPC, the issuing bank has five days following the day of presentation to determine if the presentation is compliant. In the present case, it is not disputed that the Union Bank of India had confirmed its acceptance on the Indian Bank presenting the LC.\n39. In view of the above, prima facie, we find it difficult to accept that the Union Bank of India can be interdicted in complying with its obligations under the LC as an issuing bank. We find merit in the contention that an LC is an independent contract and must not be conflated with the underlying contract of sale and purchase of goods. The grounds on which performance of the obligations under a Letter of Credit can be interdicted are limited. Indisputably, payment against a Letter of Credit may be avoided if it is established that there is an egregious fraud to which the presenting bank or negotiating bank is either a party or was aware of the same, at the material time. In the present case, there is no material to even remotely establish that the Indian Bank is a party to the fraud as alleged or was aware of the same. \n40. In UBS AG v. State Bank of Patiala: (2006) 5 SCC 416, the Supreme Court had observed that in cases where fraud was detected after the Letters of Credit were negotiated, it could not be set up as a plausible defence in a suit filed by the bank. Thus, the payment against a Letter of Credit may, in a given case of established fraud, be interdicted if the negotiating bank was duly informed of the fraud prior to negotiation of the Letter of Credit or was otherwise involved in the fraud. Absent the said conditions, the payment against Letter of Credit cannot be interdicted. The relevant extract of the decision of the Supreme Court in UBS AG v. State Bank of Patiala (supra) is set out below:\n\"22. The main contention raised on behalf of the appellant Bank is that since it had no knowledge of any fraud perpetrated by the constituent of the respondent Bank before making payment under the letter of credit in question, the respondent Bank could not refuse to reimburse the appellant Bank of payments already made to the beneficiary under the letter of credit before such intimation was received. It was also the case of the appellant Bank that since it had no knowledge of the fraud said to have been committed with regard to the bills of lading and the letter of credit itself, it negotiated documents presented before it by the beneficiary and made payment accordingly as per the instructions of the respondent Bank. \nxxx xxx xxx 35. The facts of these three appeals are clear and simple. The letters of credit were issued by the issuing bank to the confirming bank with a request to inform the beneficiary that an irrevocable letter of credit had been established for the sum indicated therein to be paid by the appellant Bank on negotiation of documents to be presented by the beneficiary. Such documents having been presented by the beneficiary to the appellant Bank, it made payment under the letter of credit to the beneficiary and was entitled to receive reimbursement for the same from the respondent Bank. If the fraud had been detected earlier and the appellant Bank had been informed of such fraud and put on caution prior to making payment, the respondent Bank may have had a triable issue to go to trial. That is not so in these three cases. In these cases, the fraud was detected after the letters of credit had been negotiated and hence such fraud alleged to have been committed by the constituent of the respondent Bank cannot be set up even as a plausible defence in the suit filed by the appellant Bank.\"\n(Emphasis Supplied)\n41. In Allahabad Bank v. Malayan Banking Limited: 2019 SCC OnLine Del 11447, a Coordinate Bench of this Court followed the decision in UBS AG v. State Bank of Patiala (supra) and rejected an appeal challenging the decree where a similar plea had been raised. The relevant extract of the said judgment is set out below: \n\"25. Having held the UCP-600 to be applicable to the transaction between the appellant and the respondent, two clauses of the Rules are of significance to the present case. Clause (d) of Article 16 of the Rules, obligates the appellant to intimate any discrepancy in the documents no later than the close of the fifth banking day following the day of communication of documents. The consequence of failing to do so is categorically provided under Clause (f) as being \"precluded from claiming that the documents do not constitute a complying presentation.\" Further, Article 7 clearly stipulates that the obligation of the issuing bank for reimbursing the nominated bank is independent of the issuing bank's undertaking to the beneficiary. \n26. Learned senior counsel for the appellant had also strongly urged before us that the goods under the LCs were never shipped and the compliance documents such as the bills of lading and invoices were forged, thus, making the appellant not liable to make the payment under the LCs. In our view, the substratum of such a contention is that the respondent had knowledge of the fraud either by being informed of it or being a party thereto. The same is clear from the decision of the Supreme Court in UBS AG v. State Bank of Patiala, (2006) 5 SCC 416 wherein it was held that if knowledge of fraud had been communicated to the respondent bank before the negotiation, only then the defence of fraud can be taken up as a triable issue. The relevant portions read as under:\nxxx xxx xxx 27. At this stage, it is appropriate to mention that there were four LCs in question, three dated 07.12.2011 and last one dated 02.01.2012. Referring the LCs by their last three digits, the LCs were LC-150, LC-151, LC-154 and LC- 159. As required, the documents presented were forwarded by respondent to the appellant. As regards LC-150, the documents were first accepted by the appellant and thereafter, after expiry of five days rejected the same. The documents pertaining to LC-151 and LC-154 were never rejected within 5 days and were only rejected after a long delay. The documents of final LC-159 were first accepted and then rejected, both being after 5 days. Thus, it is clear that as far as the appellant is concerned, it had not communicated any discrepancy within 5 days for any of the LCs.\"\n42. In Millenium Wires Private Limited v. State Trading Corporation of India Limited & Ors.: (2015) 14 SCC 375, the Supreme Court had stated the law on injunctions in respect of honouring of a Letter of Credit in the following words:\n\"11. We would uphold and restate the law on injunction against honouring letter of credit by a bank as summed up by the learned Single Judge as follows:\n11.1. The court must be slow in granting an order of injunction restraining the realisation of a bank guarantee or letter of credit. \n11.2. There are two exceptions to the above rule. The first is that it must be clearly shown that a fraud of a grievous nature has been committed and to the notice of the Bank. The second is that injustice of the kind which would make it impossible for the guarantor to reimburse himself, or would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned, should have resulted.\n11.3. It is not enough to allege fraud but there must be clear evidence both as to the fact of fraud as well as to the bank's knowledge of such fraud.\n12. It would suffice to say here that injunctions against the negotiating banks for making payments to the beneficiary must be given cautiously as constant judicial interference in the normal practices of market can have disastrous consequences as it affects the trustworthiness of the Indian banks and markets.\" \n43. It was possible for the Union Bank of India to have conveyed its objections for honoring the LC within a period of five days from its presentation. However, the Union Bank of India had not done so. Thus, the Indian Bank was fully entitled to rely on the Union Bank of India's underlying commitments to honour the LC. Prima facie, we are unable to accept that performance of this obligation is required to be interdicted on the basis of the appellant's allegations in regard to its contract with ASPL.\n44. The question whether the Indian Bank had negotiated the LC is a question of fact, this is required to be determined at an appropriate stage. At this stage, we find no reason to doubt the Indian Bank's assertion that it has in fact negotiated LC. \n45. Prima facie, if the issuing bank does not point out any discrepancies or rejects the presentation as non-compliant within the stipulated period of five days following the presentation, it would be bound to honour the same. \n46. In view of the above, we find no ground to interfere with the impugned order. The present appeal is, accordingly, dismissed. \nVIBHU BAKHRU, J AMIT MAHAJAN, J DECEMBER 22, 2023 RK",

(ii) the respondents are owners of land admeasuring 1343.3 square yards, situated at plot a-9 and 10, south extension, part-1, ring road, new delhi-110017 (hereinafter the \"demised property\"). (iii) a lease deed dated 27th may, 1966 was executed between burmah-shell oil storage and distribution co. of india (predecessor of the appellant) and the predecessor-in-interest of the respondents in relation to the demised property. after the expiry of the said lease deed, there was litigation between the parties which culminated into a settlement. (iv) pursuant to the settlement, the present lease deed dated 12th may, 2003 was executed between the parties herein. the period of the lease deed was 20 years commencing on 1st april, 2002 to 31st march, 2022. the lease deed also stipulated a 25% increase in the rent after every 5 years. (v) the respondent, via notice dated 1st april, 2022 under section 106 of the transfer of property act, 1882, called upon the appellant to vacate the demised property and hand over the possession within 15 days of the notice. in the said notice, it was made clear that the respondents did not intend to extend the lease deed. (vi) the appellant, vide communication dated 8th april, 2022 sought renewal of the lease deed on mutually agreeable terms and conditions. however, the respondents, via their reply dated 11th april rejected the offer for renewal and asked the appellant to vacate the demised property. (vii) upon failure of the appellant to vacate the property, the respondents issued a letter dated 18th april, 2022 to the appellant for pre-institution mediation as per the mandate of section 12-a of the commercial courts act, 2015. however, mediation proceedings failed. 4. accordingly, the respondents filed a suit for possession along with other ancillary reliefs. in the said suit, a counter claim was filed by the appellant seeking a decree of specific performance thereby directing renewal of the lease deed. subsequently, an application under order xii rule 6 read with order vii rule 11 of the cpc was filed on behalf of the respondent in which the following prayers were made:\"in view of the admitted facts, it is humbly prayed that this hon'ble court, may kindly be pleased to: i. pass an order under order vii rule 11 of cpc dismissing/rejecting the counter-claim bearing cs(comm) no. 58 of 2023; ii. pass a judgment under order xii rule 6 of cpc in favour of the respondents; iii. award costs in the respondents; and iv. pass any such other and further orders as this hon'ble court may deem fit in the interest of justice.\" 5. by the impugned judgment, the commercial court allowed the application under order xii rule 6 of the cpc resulting in a summary judgment in favor of the respondents. 6. assailing the impugned judgment passed by the commercial court, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, makes the following submissions:(i) the lease deed contains a renewal clause, being clause ii (7). a perusal of the renewal clause would demonstrate that it contemplates an arrangement where renewal of the lease deed shall be on the same terms and conditions contained in the present lease deed. therefore, the term of the renewed lease shall be for the same period i.e. 20 years with the rent increasing at the same rate i.e. 25% every 5 years. (ii) if the intention of the parties was not to renew the lease deed after the expiry of 20 years, there would have been no need to have a clause for renewal. the intention of the parties can also be gathered from the fact that clause 4 of the lease deed gives the appellant the first option to buy the property in question. (iii) the present lease deed between the parties was executed after a post-litigation settlement. hence the renewal clause was added after careful deliberation, recording the intention of parties to renew the lease on expiration. (iv) furthermore, a dispensing pump and selling license (dpsl) agreement executed between the appellant and the respondents no. 1 and 3 was renewed on 18th august, 2020 for a period of 5 years, till 24th august, 2025 i.e. 3 years after the expiry of the lease deed. this proves that the parties had a common intention to renew the lease deed of the demised property as well. (v) prior to the expiry of the lease deed, the appellant had invoked the renewal clause, being clause ii (7), by way of its letters dated 12th april, 2021 and 10th december, 2021 which were sent to the respondents through speed post and by hand, through a tank lorry driver. (vi) the commercial court failed to apply the principles of interpretation of a document whereby a document has to be read as a whole. where the plain reading of a document results in an obscure interpretation, a purposeful reading of the document is required. for proper interpretation of the renewal clause, the commercial court ought to have recorded oral evidence of persons involved in the drafting of the lease deed. hence, there was no admission made by the appellant warranting the passing of summary judgment under order xii rule 6 of the cpc in favor of the respondent. 7. per contra learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, has made the following submissions: (i) a perusal of the expression \"nil years\" in clause ii (7) of the lease deed would prove that no renewal beyond the term of 20 years was envisaged by either of the parties. if the appellant's interpretation of the renewal clause is accepted, it would result in a lease continuing in perpetuity. (ii) the appellant in its letter dated 8th april, 2022 has itself sought renewal of the lease deed on mutually agreeable terms. therefore, there cannot be a unilateral renewal of the lease deed at the option of the appellant. (iii) in view of the bar contained in sections 91, 92 and 94 of the indian evidence act, 1872, no oral evidence could have been led in respect of the written terms of the lease deed. therefore, the commercial court has correctly exercised jurisdiction under order xii rule 6 of the cpc. (iv) the reliance placed by the appellant on the dpsl agreement dated 18th august, 2020 to contend that it was the intention of the parties to renew the lease deed as well, is misplaced. the dpsl agreement and the lease deed are two separate instruments, executed for completely different purposes. hence, the intention of one instrument cannot be interpreted from the other. (v) the two alleged letters dated 12th april, 2021 and 10th december, 2021, relied upon by the appellant to prove its intention of renewing the lease deed is nothing but an afterthought defense as the appellants have not been able to substantiate the service of these letters on the respondent. moreover, the appellants had admitted that \"the postal service and proof of service of letters dated 12.04.2021 and 10.12.2021 are missing\" from the file maintained by the appellant in respect of the said property. (vi) section 14(1)(c) of the specific relief act, 1963 mandates that a contract which in its nature is determinable cannot be specifically enforced. hence, the commercial court has rightly rejected the appellant's suit for specific performance. reliance in this regard has been placed on the judgment of the supreme court in indian oil corporation v. amritsar gas services and ors., (1991) 1 scc 533 and judgment of the high court of delhi in rajasthan breweries ltd. v. the stroh. brewery company, 2000 scc online del 481. 8. we have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the material on record. 9. the heart of the controversy between the parties herein lies in the scope and importance of this renewal clause, being clause ii (7) obtaining in the lease deed. for the sake of convenience, the said clause is extracted hereinunder: \"7. that if the lessee shall be desirous of renewing this lease on the expiration of its term and shall have given notice to the lessor in writing prior to the expiration of the term hereby granted and shall have paid the rent and taxes and duly observed and performed all the terms, covenants, conditions and stipulations herein the lessor shall grant to them a renewed lease of the demised land for a further period of . (nil) years commencing from the date of expiry hereof on the same terms and conditions in all respects as are reserved and contained herein including this covenants for renewal.\" [emphasis is ours] 10. a careful perusal of the aforesaid clause would show that for the lease to be renewed, the following ingredients had to be fulfilled: i. lessee's desire to renew the lease, ii. lessee to give notice to renew the lease prior to the expiration of the lease and, iii. lessee should have paid rent and taxes and not breached terms, covenants, conditions, and stipulations contained in the lease. if all the aforesaid boxes are ticked, metaphorically speaking, only then the lessee could trigger the renewal of the lease. 11. it is the appellant's contention that the renewal clause stipulates an automatic renewal for a period of 20 years upon service of the notice to renew from the lessee to the lessor. 12. to evaluate the tenability of this argument advanced on behalf of the appellant, one would have to put the renewal clause through a stress test. to put it differently, would any dissonance creep in the renewal clause if one were to fill the blank and provide renewal for say 2 years, 5 years, or 15 years. clearly, there would be no inconsistency. the renewal clause would survive. 13. thus, if there is no breakdown of the clause whatever be the period of renewal, it would demonstrate that it was the intention of the parties, when they entered into the lease agreement, that renewal would take place only if there was consensus qua the period. therefore, what had to be agreed upon, plainly, was the period for which the lease would be renewed. once that was agreed, other stipulations and conditions of the lease terms would apply mutatis mutandis. the parties could have mutually agreed for a period of renewal during the currency of the lease. however, this never happened. 14. this position is reinforced if a reference is made to the letter dated 8th april, 2022 sent by the appellant to the respondent seeking renewal of the lease deed. the said letter is extracted hereunder:\"please take reference of our previous letters of even reference dated 12.04.2021 and 10.12.2021, wherein we had requested you to renew the lease of the subject retail outlet. we hereby reiterate that the subject piece of land, which was taken on lease by us, is very much required by our corporation for the sale of our petroleum products to our esteemed customers. in this regard, a meeting was also conducted today i.e., 08.04.2022 to discuss the subject issues wherein sh. vikramajeet singh attended on your behalf and sh. vipul srivastava, territory coordinator (retail) delhi and sh. harsh joshi, sr. manager sales (retail) attended on bpcl's behalf, wherein you expressed your intention to renew the lease on mutually agreed to terms and conditions, which can be negotiated at future dates. without prejudice to our right to occupy the land under the statue, we are also desirous to renew the lease at mutually agreed to rental terms & conditions. please let us know the convenient date, time and venue for carrying out negotiations for renewal of lease. we look forward to receiving your positive response and expect that you'll be doing the needful for renewal of lease deed at the earliest.\" [emphasis is ours] 15. from the perusal of the above, it is evident that the appellant itself believed that renewal could only be upon \"mutually agreeable terms and conditions\" and not on a unilateral basis. 16. counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant wrote two letters dated 12th april, 2021 and 10th december, 2021 expressing their intention to renew the lease deed. however, the respondent denies the receipt of the aforesaid communications and submits that the said letters are in the nature of an afterthought defence. 17. the appellant has candidly admitted in its written statement that it does not have any proof of service of the aforesaid communications. relevant extracts of its written statement have been set out below:\".the defendant in terms of the said lease deed had notified the plaintiff, inter-alia vide its' letters dated 12.04.2021 and 10.12.2021 of its' intention to renew the lease. the said letters were sent by speed post and by hand to the plaintiff through tank lorry driver. the postal receipt and proof of service of letters dated 12.04.2021 & 10.12.2021 are missing from the file maintained by the defendant in respect of the suit property and the same shall be filed as soon as they are traced..\" [emphasis is ours] 18. it is also a matter of record that no electronic communication in the form of e-mail was sent by the appellant to the respondents to express its intention to renew the lease during the currency of the lease. 19. in light of the discussion above, in our view, the appellant's stand that renewal had to be for 20 years would be in the teeth of plain text of the renewal clause. 20. one of the contentions advanced on behalf of the appellant was since the present lease deed was executed pursuant to a post litigation settlement between the parties, the renewal clause was added after careful deliberation, reflecting the intention of the parties to renew the lease deed on the same terms and conditions, including the period of renewal. 21. we do not find merit in the aforesaid contention. merely because a renewal clause was added after a post litigation settlement between the parties, it cannot be assumed that the intention of the parties was to provide for a renewal for the same period. the fact that the lease deed was executed after due deliberations and negotiations between the parties would imply that the lease deed reflects the clear intention of the parties i.e. the renewal period would be decided by mutual consent of the parties. 22. next, the appellant places reliance on the dpsl agreement between the same parties which was renewed for a period of 5 years with effect from 18th august, 2020. the aforesaid submission is completely untenable. it has to be borne in mind that the lease deed and the dpsl agreement are two independent contracts and a renewal clause in one of them cannot be read into the other contract. 23. the appellant places reliance on principles of interpretation of a contract in support of its contention that a purposeful interpretation should be given to clause ii (7). in our view, the intention of the parties has to be gathered from what is expressed in the written contract. once there is no ambiguity in the written terms of the contract, parties cannot resort to principles of interpretation of contract to give a meaning which is contrary to the express terms of the contract. this would amount to re-writing the contract. 24. it is submitted on behalf of the appellant that in the present case, a decree under order xii rule 6 of the cpc should not have been passed and the commercial court should have allowed the parties to lead oral evidence so as to ascertain the intention of the parties with regard to the renewal clause. 25. the aforesaid submission overlooks the fact that oral evidence of this nature cannot be permitted to be led in view of the bar contained in sections 91, 92 and 94 of the indian evidence act, 1872. the supreme court in v. anantha raju and anr. v. t.m narasimhan and ors., (2021) 17 scc 165 has observed that when the parties have recorded their agreement in a written document, the terms thereof cannot be understood based on the interpretation of parties and the averments made in their pleadings, to be proved by evidence of the persons who were involved in the drafting of the written document. relevant observations of the aforesaid judgment are set out hereunder:\"34. this court has further held in roop kumar case that sections 91 and 92 of the evidence act would apply only when the document on the face of it contains or appears to contain all the terms of the contract. it has been held that after the document has been produced to prove its terms under section 91, the provisions of section 92 come into operation for the purpose of excluding evidence of any oral agreement or statement for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding or subtracting from its terms. it has been held that it would be inconvenient that matters in writing made by advice and on consideration, and which finally import the certain truth of the agreement of parties should be controlled by averment of the parties to be proved by the uncertain testimony of slippery memory. it has been held that when parties deliberately put their agreement into writing, it is conclusively presumed, between themselves and their privies, that they intended the writing to form a full and final statement of their intentions, and one which should be placed beyond the reach of future controversy, bad faith and treacherous memory.\" [emphasis is ours] 26. it is a settled position of law that for the purposes of order xii rule 6 of the cpc, the admission can be in the pleadings or in the documents filed on behalf of the parties. in the present case, the lease deed, which is an admitted document, contains the specific admission. therefore, the commercial court has correctly invoked provisions of order xii rule 6 of the cpc in the facts and circumstances of the present case. 27. in so far as the counter claim filed by the appellant seeking specific performance of the renewal of the lease deed is concerned, reliance has correctly been placed on behalf of the respondents on section 14(1)(c) of the specific relief act, 1963 to submit that a contract, which is determinable in nature, cannot be specifically enforced. (see indian oil corporation v. amritsar gas services and ors., (1991) 1 scc 533 and rajasthan breweries ltd. v. the stroh. brewery company, 2000 scc online del 481). in our considered view, it cannot be denied that in the present case, the lease deed was determinable in nature. 28. in view of the above, we do not find any infirmity in the impugned judgment which requires interference by this court. both the appeals, along with pending applications, are dismissed. amit bansal (judge) rajiv shakdher (judge) april 10, 2024 rt/at"
