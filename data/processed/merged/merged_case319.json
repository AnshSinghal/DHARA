Saraf, J.\n1. This is a writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India wherein the petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated March 15, 2022 passed by the Commercial Court, Gautam Buddh Nagar by which the Commercial Court held that it lacks the territorial jurisdiction to adjudicate the application filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\") by the petitioner. The Commercial Court, Gautam Buddh Nagar accordingly, returned the said application with liberty granted to the petitioner to file the said application before the appropriate territorial court. \n2. The facts of the instant case are delineated below:\n(a) The parties herein entered into an agreement which contained an arbitration clause.\n(b) As disputes and differences arose between the parties, the respondent filed an application under Section 9 of the Act before the Commercial Court, Gautam Buddh Nagar on March 20, 2007.\n(c) Subsequently, the petitioners filed an application under Section 11 of the Act before the High Court of Delhi. The High Court of Delhi passed an order on September 11, 2007 appointing the sole arbitrator to decide the dispute between the parties. Subsequently, the arbitrator passed an award on July 3, 2017. \n(d) Challenging the said award, the petitioners filed an application under Section 34 of the Act before the Commercial Court, Gautam Buddh Nagar which was dismissed for want of territorial jurisdiction vide order dated March 15, 2022. Hence, the instant petition has been filed challenging the said order. \nContentions Of The Petitioners\n3. Counsel appearing for the petitioners has made the following submissions:\n(i) Since the application under Section 9 of the Act was filed before the Commercial Court, Gautam Buddh Nagar, the exclusive jurisdiction for hearing the Section 34 application would also lie with the Commercial Court, Gautam Buddh Nagar. Reliance in this regard is placed upon the judgments rendered in State of West Bengal v. Associated Contractor reported in (2015) 1 Scc 32; M/s Ravi Ranjan Developers Pvt. Ltd. v. Aditya Kumar Chatterjee reported in Slp(C)17397 of 2021 (Sc); Manjusha Premi and Others v. Prakash Gupta and Others reported in (2016) 6 All Lj 695; Dalim Kumar Chakraborty v. Smt. Gouri Biswar and Another reported in 2018 Scc Online Cal 282; Magma Fincorp Limited v. Maa Vaishno Sales Pvt. Ltd. and Others reported in 2015 Scc Online Cal 6267 and M/s Gammon Engineers & Contractors Pvt. Ltd. v. The State of West Bengal reported in Air 2023 Cal. 338.\n(ii) Furthermore, the filing of the application under Section 11 of the Act before the Delhi High Court, as the venue was fixed in Delhi would not make it the seat of arbitration. Reliance is placed upon the judgments rendered in Sbp & Co. v. Patel Engineer Ltd. reported in (2005) 8 Scc 618; State of Jharkhand v. Hindustan Constructions reported in (2018) 2 Scc 602; State of West Bengal v. Associated Contractor reported in (2015) 1 Scc 32; Manjusha Premi and Others v. Prakash Gupta and Others reported in (2016) 6 All Lj 695 and Lafarge India Private Limited v. Kishore Kumar Sahoo reported in Air 2017 Cal 116.\n(iii) Since the application under Section 9 of the Act was made before the Commercial Court, Gautam Budh Nagar, all the subsequent applications under Part-I of the Act will have to be made before the same Court.\n(iv) Bar placed by Section 42 of the Act does not apply to an application under Section 11 of the Act and, therefore, despite the fact that the Section 11 application was filed before the Delhi High Court, the same would not confer jurisdiction upon the Delhi High Court to hear other applications under the Part-I of the Act. \n(v) Relying upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in M/s Ravi Ranjan Developers Pvt. Ltd. case (supra), it is submitted that the doctrine of estoppel would apply upon the respondent as they have themselves filed the application under Section 9 of the Act before the Commercial Court, Gautam Buddh Nagar. They cannot now contend that the jurisdiction for filing th e application under Section 34 of the Act would lie before the High Court of Delhi. \n(vi) Unless the agreement specifically provides for it, venue cannot be treated as the seat of arbitration unless there is contrary indicia present. In the instant case, filing of the application under Section 9 of the Act before the Commercial Court, Gautam Buddh Nagar, acts as contrary indicia preventing the venue to be elevated to the status of seat. \nCONTENTIONS OF THE RESPONDENT 4. Counsel appearing for the respondent has made the following submissions:\n(i) In the agreement dated 19.05.2006 between the parties, clause being clause No.53 clearly stipulates that if any disputes or differences arises between the parties in any manner whatsoever, they shall be referred to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the \"venue\" of arbitration proceedings shall be at Delhi.\n(ii) As clause 53 of the agreement, expressly designates a \"venue\" and does not designate of any alternative place as the \"seat\" the inexorable conclusion is that the venue is to be treated as the juridical seat of the arbitral proceedings.\n(iii) Since proceedings were finally held at New Delhi without any objection and award was signed in New Delhi as both the parties have chosen New Delhi to be the, the same confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the Courts at New Delhi. \n(iv) An application was filed by the Respondent before the High Court of Delhi for appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11 of the Act. The petitioner herein did not file any objection to the same. \n(v) The order dated March 15, 2022 passed by the Commercial Court, Gautam Buddh Nagar is perfectly legal, fully justified and as such no interference by this Court is warranted against the same.\n(vi) The Supreme Court in the case of BGS SGS Soma v. NHPC Ltd. reported in (2020) 4 SCC 234 and in Hindustan Construction Company Ltd. v. NHPC Ltd. and Another reported in 2020 4 SCC 310 has held that whenever there is a designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the venue of the arbitration proceeding the expression \"arbitration proceedings\" would make it clear that the venue is actually the \"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings. \n(vii) The High Court of Calcutta after due deliberations has held in A.P. No. 358 of 2020 decided on 08.06.2023 (Homevista Decor and Furnishing Pvt. Ltd. and another v. Connect Residuary Private Limited) that the courts of the place selected as having exclusive jurisdiction over disputes should be considered as \"Seat\" thereby having exclusive jurisdiction to entertain applications under the Act. \nANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION 5. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and perused the materials on record. \n6. Since the crux of the instant dispute revolves around the bar placed by Section 42 of the Act, I have extracted the same herein for ease of reference:\n\"42. Jurisdiction.--Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Part or in any other law for the time being in force, where with respect to an arbitration agreement any application under this Part has been made in a Court, that Court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that Court and in no other Court.\"\n7. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in BGS SGS SOMA JV -v- NHPC Limited reported in (2020) 4 SCC 234 espoused the intent and purpose behind Section 42 of the Act as follows:\n\"59. Equally incorrect is the finding in Antrix Corpn. Ltd. [Antrix Corpn. Ltd. v. Devas Multimedia (P) Ltd., 2018 SCC OnLine Del 9338] that Section 42 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 would be rendered ineffective and useless. Section 42 is meant to avoid conflicts in jurisdiction of courts by placing the supervisory jurisdiction over all arbitral proceedings in connection with the arbitration in one court exclusively. This is why the section begins with a non obstante clause, and then goes on to state \"...where with respect to an arbitration agreement any application under this part has been made in a court...\" It is obvious that the application made under this part to a court must be a court which has jurisdiction to decide such application. The subsequent holdings of this court, that where a seat is designated in an agreement, the courts of the seat alone have jurisdiction, would require that all applications under Part I be made only in the court where the seat is located, and that court alone then has jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of the arbitral agreement. So read, Section 42 is not rendered ineffective or useless. Also, where it is found on the facts of a particular case that either no \"seat\" is designated by agreement, or the so-called \"seat\" is only a convenient \"venue\", then there may be several courts where a part of the cause of action arises that may have jurisdiction. Again, an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 may be preferred before a court in which part of the cause of action arises in a case where parties have not agreed on the \"seat\" of arbitration, and before such \"seat\" may have been determined, on the facts of a particular case, by the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 20(2) of the Arbitration Act, 1996. In both these situations, the earliest application having been made to a court in which a part of the cause of action arises would then be the exclusive court under Section 42, which would have control over the arbitral proceedings. For all these reasons, the law stated by the Bombay and Delhi High Courts in this regard is incorrect and is overruled.\" \n(Emphasis Added) \n8. Section 42 of the Act encapsulates the principle of jurisdictional exclusivity. It stipulates that once an application under Part 1 of the Act is made in a court with respect to an arbitration agreement, all subsequent applications under Part 1 of the Act will have to made before that court only. By vesting exclusive jurisdiction in a single court, Section 42 of the Act obviates the possibility of conflicting judgements and ensures uniformity in the adjudication of arbitral matters. When two entities embroiled in a commercial disagreement, opt for arbitration as their chosen mode of resolution, they may often find themselves at the crossroads of jurisdictional ambiguity. It is here that Section 42 of the Act assumes pivotal importance. By centralizing jurisdiction in a designate court, Section 42 of the Act mitigates the risk of parallel proceedings, thus expediting the resolution of disputes and reducing legal costs. \n9. The only exceptions to the bar placed by Section 42 of the Act are applications made under Section 8 of the Act or Section 11 of the Act. Reference in this regard can be made to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of West Bengal -v- Associated Contractors (supra) wherein it was held as follows:\n\"25. Our conclusions therefore on Section 2(1)(e) and Section 42 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 are as follows:\n(a) Section 2(1)(e) contains an exhaustive definition marking out only the Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction in a district or a High Court having original civil jurisdiction in the State, and no other court as \"court\" for the purpose of Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996.\n( b) The expression \"with respect to an arbitration agreement\" makes it clear that Section 42 will apply to all applications made whether before or during arbitral proceedings or after an award is pronounced under Part I of the 1996 Act. \n(c) However, Section 42 only applies to applications made under Part I if they are made to a court as defined. Since applications made under Section 8 are made to judicial authorities and since applications under Section 11 are made to the Chief Justice or his designate, the judicial authority and the Chief Justice or his designate not being court as defined, such applications would be outside Section 42. \n(d) Section 9 applications being applications made to a court and Section 34 applications to set aside arbitral awards are applications which are within Section 42. \n(e) In no circumstances can the Supreme Court be \"court\" for the purposes of Section 2(1)(e), and whether the Supreme Court does or does not retain seisin after appointing an arbitrator, applications will follow the first application made before either a High Court having original jurisdiction in the State or a Principal Civil Court having original jurisdiction in the district, as the case may be. \n(f) Section 42 will apply to applications made after the arbitral proceedings have come to an end provided they are made under Part I.\n(g) If a first application is made to a court which is neither a Principal Court of Original Jurisdiction in a district or a High Court exercising original jurisdiction in a State, such application not being to a court as defined would be outside Section 42. Also, an application made to a court without subject-matter jurisdiction would be outside Section 42. \nThe reference is answered accordingly.\" \n(Emphasis Added) \n10. As such, the argument presented by the Respondents that since the application under Section 11 of the Act was made before the High Court of Delhi, all subsequent applications will have to be made before the High Court of Delhi, is devoid of any merit and is rejected. The rationale underlying this exception lies in the recognition of the distinctive nature of applications under Section 8 and Section 11 of the Act, which necessitate specialized adjudication and prompt intervention. Furthermore, since the arbitral clause between the parties, provides for only a venue and not a seat, it is not open for the respondent to argue that the venue in the instant case should be exalted to the status of seat. This is due to the bar placed by Section 42 of the Act, since an application under Section 9 had already been filed before the District Court at Gautam Buddh Nagar. \n11. Whether initiated before, during, or after the conclusion of arbitration, applications under Part 1 of the Act are subject to the jurisdictional constraints imposed by Section 42 of the Act. By availing itself of the jurisdiction of the District Court at Gautam Buddh Nagar, the respondent implicitly recognized the authority of that court to adjudicate matters arising out of the arbitration agreement between the parties. This recognition, coupled with the principles of estoppel, precludes the respondent from subsequently disavowing the jurisdiction of the court at Gautam Buddh Nagar to entertain subsequent applications under Part 1 of the Act. \n12. The principle of estoppel operates to prevent a party from resiling its prior representations or conduct to the detriment of another party. Here, the respondent's prior invocation of the jurisdiction of the court at Gautam Buddh Nagar under Section 9 of the Act constitutes a deliberate and unequivocal submission to the authority of that court. Having voluntarily invoked the jurisdiction of the said court, the respondent is estopped from adopting a position contrary to its prior conduct to the detriment of the petitioner. Additionally, the doctrine of forum non conveniens, which empowers a court to decline jurisdiction in favour of a more appropriate forum, is not applicable in the present case. The respondent's attempt to evade the jurisdiction of the court at Gautam Buddh Nagar is nothing but an effort to the circumvent the jurisdictional constraints imposed by Section 42 of the Act. \n13. In M/s Ravi Ranjan Developers Pvt. Ltd. case (supra), the Supreme Court propounded that once the parties have invoked the jurisdiction of a court, they are estopped from invoking the jurisdiction of another court. Relevant paragraph is extracted herein: \n\"48. In this case, the parties, as observed above did not agree to refer their disputes to the jurisdiction of the Courts in Kolkata. It was not the intention of the parties that Kolkata should be the seat of arbitration. Kolkata was only intended to be the venue for arbitration sittings. Accordingly, the Respondent himself approached the District Court at Muzaffarpur, and not a Court in Kolkata for interim protection under Section 9 of the A&C Act. The Respondent having himself invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court at Muzaffarpur, is estopped from contending that the parties had agreed to confer exclusive jurisdiction to the Calcutta High Court to the exclusion of other Courts. Neither of the parties to the agreement construed the arbitration clause to designate Kolkata as the seat of arbitration. We are constrained to hold that Calcutta High Court inherently lacks jurisdiction to entertain the application of the Respondent under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act. The High Court should have decided the objection raised by the Appellant, to the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court, to entertain the application under Section 11(6) of A&C Act, before appointing an Arbitrator.\" \n(Emphasis Added) \n14. In Gammon Engineers and Contracts Pvt. Ltd. -v- State of West Bengal (supra) while dealing with a similar issue, I had concluded that since an application has already been made under Section 9 of the Act at Jalpaiguri, all subsequent applications will lie at Jalpaiguri in light of the bar placed by Section 42 of the Act. Relevant paragraph is extracted herein:\n\"21. The ratio of the judgment in Swadesh Kumar Agarwal (supra) must be kept in mind, wherein the court has categorically held in paragraph 32 that once an appointment is made under Section 11, the arbitration agreement cannot be invoked for the second time under Section 11. The procedure prescribed in the Act for termination of an arbitral tribunal's mandate is as per Sections 14 and 15 of the Act. The argument raised by the petitioner that a petition can be filed under Section 14 read with Section 15 and Section 11(6) is an argument in sophistry and is superfluous. This is quite evident from the ratio of the judgment in Swadesh Kumar Agarwal (supra), which has been specifically delineated in paragraph 32 of the said judgment and pointed out by me in the preceding paragraphs. In the present case, a Section 9 application was already made to the District Judge at Jalpaiguri, which is, for all purposes, the 'court' under Section 2(1)(e) of the Act. Therefore, the bar under Section 42 would lie and all applications to be made to a 'court' must be made to the District Judge at Jalpaiguri. An application under Section 14(1)(a) for termination of an arbitrator's mandate, being required to be made before a 'court' as under Section 2(1)(e) and 42 of the Act, has to presented before the District Judge at Jalpaiguri. In light of the above, A.P. 785 of 2022 is disposed of for not being maintainable before the High Court at this stage. I make it clear that the findings with regard to merits of the case in the preceding paragraphs are tentative in nature and the appropriate court shall decide the Section 14 application in accordance with law.\" \n15. In Manjusha Premi and Others -v- Prakash Gupta and Others (supra), this Court held that the bar placed by Section 42 of the Act will apply to applications made under Section 9 of the Act. Relevant paragraphs are extracted herein: \n\"40. He had further submitted that since first application under section 9 of the Act was filed before the District Judge, Varanasi on 28.10.2006, the Varanasi Court in the light of section 42 of the Act would alone have the jurisdiction. The aforesaid case has also discussed in detailed in previous paragraphs. \n41. Referring to the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Swastik Gases Private Limited (supra) he submitted that unless the jurisdiction of the Court is excluded in expression as such \"exclusive\" \"alone\" \"only\" the jurisdiction of a Court would not be excluded. For this purpose, a reference would not be excluded. On the strength of the aforesaid, he submitted that since there was no specific clause providing jurisdiction to a Court, thus the jurisdiction of a Civil Court is to be decided with reference to section 2(1)(e) of the Act and thus the same would be at Varanasi in the present case.\n42. Sri K.K. Arora had also placed reliance on a decision of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of West Bengal (supra) to submit that if the proceedings initiated is one of the nature of section 8(before judicial authority) and section 11 of the Act (the Chief Justice or his delegates) applications filed before the Court inferior to the Principal Civil Court or to High Court having no original jurisdiction, the bar contained in section 42 would not apply. However, application filed under section 9 of the Act very much within the purview of section 42 as they are filed before the Court. \n43. Undisputedly, the application under section 11 of the Act is filed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice or his delegates, which is not a \"Court\" in the eye of law and as such clearly, the provision of section 42 of the Act would not apply but the same would certainly be applicable if the application is filed under section 9 of the Act, which was done at the first instance before the District Judge, Varanasi on 28.10.2006 in the present case. \n44. In view of the aforesaid discussion and the fact that admittedly the property in dispute is situated at Varanasi and the first application under section 9 of the Act was filed on 28.10.2006 in the Court of District Judge, Varanasi, which is undisputedly the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district having jurisdiction to decide questions forming subject-matter of the arbitration as provided under section 2(1)(e) of the Act, as section 42 of the Act had specifically provided that where with respect to any arbitration agreement when any application under this part (Part 1 of the Act which relates to domestic award) has been made in a Court, that Court shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of the agreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that Court and in no other Court, leaves no doubt that the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction at Varanasi i.e., District Judge, Varanasi will have the jurisdiction to entertain application under section 34 of the Act against the arbitral award.\"\n16. Accordingly, this Court holds that in light of Section 42 of the Act, the application under Section 34 of the Act, or for that matter any other application under Part 1 of the Act, will have to be made at Gautam Buddh Nagar. \n17. The question that remains now is whether this Court in exercise of its powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India can set aside the impugned order passed by the District Court at Gautam Buddh Nagar returning the application filed under Section 34 of the Act for want of territorial jurisdiction. \n18. Article 227 of the Constitution of India bestows upon the High Courts an extraordinary power of superintendence over all courts and tribunal within their respective jurisdiction. This power is a potent tool for ensuring the proper administration of justice and upholding the rule of law. It serves as a bulwark against judicial error, administrative excess, and procedural irregularity. Power of superintendence under Article 227 is inherent in the High Courts by virtue of their status of superior courts of record. This inherent jurisdiction enables the High Courts to exercise oversight over all subordinate courts and tribunals, irrespective of whether specific statutory provisions provide for such supervision. \n19. In Estelia Rubber -v- Dass Estate (P) Ltd. reported in (2001) 8 SCC 97, the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated the scope of Article 227 as follows:\n\"6. The scope and ambit of exercise of power and jurisdiction by a High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is examined and explained in a number of decisions of this Court. The exercise of power under this article involves a duty on the High Court to keep inferior courts and tribunals within the bounds of their authority and to see that they do the duty expected or required of them in a legal manner. The High Court is not vested with any unlimited prerogative to correct all kinds of hardship or wrong decisions made within the limits of the jurisdiction of the subordinate courts or tribunals. Exercise of this power and interfering with the orders of the courts or tribunals is restricted to cases of serious dereliction of duty and flagrant violation of fundamental principles of law or justice, where if the High Court does not interfere, a grave injustice remains uncorrected. It is also well settled that the High Court while acting under this article cannot exercise its power as an appellate court or substitute its own judgment in place of that of the subordinate court to correct an error, which is not apparent on the face of the record. The High Court can set aside or ignore the findings of facts of an inferior court or tribunal, if there is no evidence at all to justify or the finding is so perverse, that no reasonable person can possibly come to such a conclusion, which the court or tribunal has come to.\"\n20. In light of the aforesaid, it is palpably clear that the Commercial Court at Gautam Buddh Nagar has failed to exercise its jurisdiction. Accordingly, this Court, in exercise of its power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India sets aside the impugned order dated March 15, 2022 passed by the Commercial Court, Gautam Buddh Nagar. This Court also directs the Commercial Court, Gautam Buddh Nagar to adjudicate the application filed by the petitioners under Section 34 of the Act expeditiously, preferably within a period of six months from date. \n21. With the above directions, this petition is allowed. There shall be no order as to the costs. \nDate :- 17.05.2024 Kuldeep (Shekhar B. Saraf,J.)    ",

shall have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the execution petition and consequently holding that the commercial court, rajkot, shall have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the said commercial execution petition, the original respondent a judgmentdebtor, has preferred the present first appeal under section 13 of the commercial court, commercial division and commercial appellate division of the high courts act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \"the commercial courts act, 2015\"). 2. the facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as under: 2.1 it is not in dispute that in an international arbitration between the appellant herein and the original applicant, being icc case no.18836/cyk, an award has been passed against the appellant herein. at this stage, it is required to be noted that the said international arbitration proceedings were pursuant to article 4(2) of the icc rules of arbitration in force as from 01.01.2012. it appears that in its request for arbitration, the original claimant proposed that the language of the arbitration be in english and that there should be a sole arbitrator. that by a letter dated 25.07.2012, the secretariat of the icc international court of arbitration sent a request for arbitration to the original respondent. the said proposed arbitration proceedings were opposed by the appellant original respondent. it appears that thereafter, after two to three extensions, the international court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce decided to submit the matter to a sole arbitrator pursuant to article 12(2). that thereafter, upon the proposal of the hong kong group, the court at its session on 11.12.2012, appointed one mr.peter scott caldwell, hong kong, to act as a sole arbitrator. that thereafter, the sole arbitrator declared his award on 31.07.2014 and partly allowed the claim as mentioned in the operative portion of the award, in favour of the respondent herein original claimant. 2.2 it appears that thereafter, the respondent herein original claimant filed the execution petition, being execution application no.166/2015 in the court of learned additional district court at gandhidham. 2.3 that the applicants of civil application no.1/2018 axis bank limited and uco bank jointly submitted the application before the learned executing court, i.e. the learned additional district court at gandhidham, in whose court the said execution application was filed, inter alia praying for transfer of the execution petition. it was the case on behalf of the decree-holder that as the award under execution is a domestic arbitral award for more than specified value, the execution petition is required to be transferred to the commercial court. however, the learned additional district judge, gandhidham kutchh, was of the opinion that in view of the decision of this court in m/s.oci corporation v. kandla export corporation & ors. misc. civil application (for transfer) no.2969/2016 dated 11.11.2016 which is now reported in 2016 scc online guj 5981 in which it was held for execution application of arbitration award of more than specified value if it is award of international l arbitration, then commercial division would have jurisdiction, the learned additional district judge, gandhidham kutchh, by order dated 01.02.2017, returned the execution petition to the decreeholder for presenting it before the appropriate court. 2.4 that thereafter, the original decree-holder filed the present execution petition before the commercial court, rajkot, being commercial execution petition no.12/2017. that the appellant-herein judgment-debtor raised an objection that the commercial court, rajkot, does not have any jurisdiction to adjudicate the said petition and that only the commercial division of the high court shall have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the execution petition. heavy reliance was placed upon the decision of the division bench of this court in the case of m/s.oci corporation v. kandla export corporation & ors. misc. civil application (for transfer) no.2969/2016 dated 11.11.2016 reported in 2017(1) glh 383 : 2016 scc online guj 5981 [hereinafter referred to as \"m/s.oci corporation (i)\"]. reliance was also placed upon the subsequent decision of this court in the case of kandla export corporation & anr. v. oci corporation & anr. dated 28.09.2017 in first appeal no.3096/2017 and other allied appeals which came to be confirmed by the hon'ble supreme court vide its decision dated 07.02.2018 in civil appeal nos.1661-1663/2018 reported in 2018 scc online sc 170. however, by impugned order, the learned judge, commercial court, rajkot, has refused to follow the binding decision of this court in the case of m/s.oci corporation (i) (supra) on the ground that in the case of m/s.oci corporation (i) (supra) before this court it was a case of foreign award and in the present case, the award declared by the learned sole arbitrator is a domestic award. at this stage, it is required to be noted that as such, there are two decisions of this court in the case of m/s.oci corporation, one in misc. civil application (for transfer) no.2969/2016 dated 11.11.2016 i.e. m/s.oci corporation-i, which would have direct bearing on the issue involved in the present proceedings, and another, dated 28.09.2017 in first appeal no.3096/2017 and allied matters which was arising out of the order passed by the commercial division of the high court holding that the said foreign award sought to be executed is enforceable. both will be discussed hereinafter. therefore, by impugned order, the learned commercial court, rajkot, has overruled the objection raised by the appellant herein judgment-debtor and has held that the commercial court, rajkot, shall have jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the said execution petition. 2.5 feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order passed by the learned judge, commercial court, rajkot, overruling the objection raised by the appellant herein on the jurisdiction of the commercial court, rajkot, to entertain and adjudicate the said execution petition, and holding that for the execution of the award, the commercial court, rajkot, shall have jurisdiction, the original applicant original judgment-debtor has preferred the present appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015. 3. shri hardik modh, learned advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant herein original applicant who has raised an objection original judgment-debtor and shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate, has appeared with learned advocate shri udit mendiratta, on behalf of the respondent herein. shri tarak damani, learned advocate, has appeared on behalf of the applicant in civil application no.1/2018 and shri dhaval d. vyas, learned advocate, has appeared on behalf of the applicant of civil application no.2/2018. 4. shri hardik modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant original applicant original judgmentdebtor objector, has vehemently submitted that the learned judge has materially erred in overruling the objection raised by the appellant on the jurisdiction of the commercial court, rajkot, to entertain and adjudicate the execution petition to execute the award in case of international arbitration and has materially erred in holding that the commercial court, rajkot, shall have the jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the execution petition to execute the award sought to be executed which was arising out of the international arbitration. 4.1 it is vehemently submitted by shri modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant original judgment-debtor that as such, the learned judge has not properly appreciated and/or considered and/or has not considered at all the entire / whole decision of the division bench of this court in the case of m/s.oci corporation (i) (supra). 4.2 it is vehemently submitted by shri modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant original judgment-debtor that as such, the decision of this court in the case of kandla export corporation & anr. v. oci corporation & anr. dated 28.09.2017 in first appeal no.3096/2017 [hereinafter referred to as \"m/s.oci corporation -ii\"] as such would not have any bearing on the jurisdiction aspect and/or jurisdiction of the commercial court. 4.3 it is submitted by shri modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant original judgmentdebtor that the controversy in m/s.oci corporation -i (supra) and m/s.oci corporation ii (supra) were different and arising out of different proceedings / orders and as such, the learned judge, commercial court, rajkot, has not at all noticed the difference in the decisions in m/s.oci corporation-i (supra) and m/s.oci corporation ii (supra). 4.4 it is vehemently submitted by shri modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant original judgment-debtor that as such, in the present case, the decision of the division bench of this court dated 11.11.2016 in misc. civil application (for transfer) no.2969/2016 i.e. decision in m/s.oci corporation -i shall be applicable with full force. it is vehemently submitted by shri modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant original judgment-debtor, that in m/s.oci corporation i (supra), the division bench of this court has specifically observed and held that in case of an international arbitration, an execution petition to execute the award in connection with international arbitration shall be before the commercial division of the high court only. it is submitted that without considering the entire facts and findings as a whole, the learned judge has unnecessarily tried to justify facts and has erred in observing and holding that the decision in m/s.oci corporation -i (supra) and/or the decision in m/s.oci corporation -ii (supra) which came to be confirmed by the hon'ble supreme court vide judgment and order dated 07.02.2018 in civil appeal nos.1661-1663/2018 shall not be applicable as in the aforesaid case, the award was a foreign award and in the present case the award is a domestic award. 4.5 it is further submitted by shri modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant original judgment-debtor that the learned judge has unnecessarily drawn a distinction between the domestic award and foreign award, without further appreciating the fact that as such even the domestic award was also with respect to the international arbitration as defined under the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. it is submitted that in the case of m/s.oci corporation i (supra), the division bench of this court has, in conclusion, specifically observed and held that where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, all the applications or the appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the arbitration act shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the commercial division where such commercial division has been constituted in the high court. it is submitted that despite the above, the learned judge has materially erred in not following the said binding decision of the division bench of this court in the case of m/s.oci corporation i (supra). 4.6 it is vehemently submitted by shri modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant original judgment-debtor that even some of the observations made by the learned judge that the observations made by the high court and/or the order passed by the high court shall not be considered as a statute, are absolutely unwarranted and more particularly are made without properly appreciating and/or understanding the ratio of the judgment of this court in m/s.oci corporation i (supra). making above submissions and relying upon the decision of the division bench of this court in the case of m/s.oci corporation i (supra), it is requested to allow the present appeal and quash and set aside the impugned order and it is requested to hold that the commercial court, rajkot, would have no jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the execution petition to execute the award arising out of the international arbitration and that a commercial division of the high court shall have jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the said execution petition. 5. shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate has appeared on behalf of the respondent herein original judgment-creditor original claimant. 5.1 shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent herein original judgment-creditor original claimant has raised a preliminary objection on the maintainability of the present appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, against the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court. in support of his above submission, shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate, has heavily relied upon the decision of the bombay high court in the case of smt.sushila singhania & ors v. bharat hari singhania & ors. dated 29.03.2017 in commercial appeal no.4/2016 2017 scc online bom 360 (paragraphs 55, 70, 71, 100, and 101). 5.2 it is vehemently submitted by shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent original judgment-creditor original claimant that against the impugned order passed by learned commercial court, appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, shall not be maintainable as the impugned order is not appealable under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015. it is further submitted by shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate that even otherwise, as the arbitration was much prior to the arbitration and conciliation (amendment) act, 2015, and therefore, as per section 26 of the arbitration and conciliation (amendment) act, 2015, the amended act shall not be applicable and therefore, the definition of `court' contained in section 2(e) of the arbitration and conciliation act (amendment) act, 2015, shall not be applicable. it is submitted that therefore, the arbitration and conciliation (amendment) act, 2015, shall not be applicable retrospectively and shall not apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced prior to the arbitration and conciliation (amendment) act, 2015, and therefore, the commercial division of this high court shall not have jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the execution petition to execute the award arising out of the arbitration proceedings commenced prior to arbitration and conciliation (amendment) act, 2015. in support of his above submission, shri trivedi, learned senior advocate, has relied upon the recent decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of board of control for cricket in india v. kochi cricket pvt. ltd. and etc. dated 15.03.2015 in civil appeal nos.2879-2880/2018 reported in 2018 scc online 232. 5.3 now so far as the distinction drawn by the learned judge that in the present case as the award was the domestic award and in the case of m/s.oci corporation -i (supra), it was a foreign award and therefore, the decision of this court in the case of m/s.oci corporation i (supra) shall not be applicable in the present case, shri trivedi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original claimant original applicant has initially tried to support the same. however, he is not disputing that the arbitration before the learned sole arbitrator was an international arbitration and the award declared by the learned sole arbitrator was in connection with the international arbitration. 6. shri tarak damani and shri dhaval d. vyas, learned advocates appearing on behalf of the respective applicants in civil applications have supported the appellant herein and relying upon the decision of the division bench of this court in the case of m/s.oci corporation i (supra), it is submitted that the commercial court, rajkot, shall not have any jurisdiction to entertain/ adjudicate the execution petition in connection with international arbitration and only the commercial division of the high court shall have the jurisdiction. 7. in rejoinder and to the objection raised by shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent on maintainability of the present appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 against the impugned order passed by the learned judge, commercial court, rajkot, shri modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant judgment-debtor has submitted that as such, considering the first part of sub-section (1) of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, present appeal under section 13 of the act shall be maintainable. he has submitted and requested that in case this court comes to a conclusion that the present appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, against the impugned order passed by the learned judge, commercial court, rajkot, shall not be maintainable, the present appeal be converted into a petition under article 227 of the constitution of india, which otherwise, is as per the recent decision of this court dated 07.05.2018 in the case of state of gujarat v. union of india special civil application no.737/2018. 8. heard learned counsel for the respective parties at length. at the outset, it is required to be noted that the present appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, has been preferred by the appellant herein the judgmentdebtor challenging the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court, rajkot, overruling the objection raised by the appellant herein on the jurisdiction of the commercial court, rajkot, to decide and adjudicate the execution petition filed before it. 9. a preliminary objection is raised by shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent herein original judgment-creditor on the maintainability of the present appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, against the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court, rajkot, overruling and/or setting aside the objection on the jurisdiction of the commercial court, rajkot, to entertain and adjudicate the said execution petition. 9.1 heavy reliance has been placed by shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent on section 13(1) and the proviso to the said section of the commercial courts act, 2015. it is submitted that against the final decision/ judgment of the commercial court or the commercial division of the high court, appeal shall be maintainable to the commercial appellate division of the high court. it is also submitted by shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent that even under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, considering proviso to sub-section (1) of section 13, an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by the commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908, as amended by commercial courts act, 2015 and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 only. 9.2 having heard learned counsel for the respective parties and considering sub-section (1) of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent herein is right in raising the objection on the maintainability of the present appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, against the impugned order passed by the learned judge, commercial court. as such, the said issue does not seem to be now res-integra in view of the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of kandla export corporation & anr. v. oci corporation & anr. dated 07.02.2018 in civil appeal nos.1661-1663/2018 reported in 2018 scc online sc 170. a somewhat similar submission was made before the hon'ble supreme court and section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, 2015, fell for consideration before the hon'ble supreme court and while interpreting and/or considering sub-section (1) of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, the hon'ble supreme court in paragraphs 15 to 17 has observed and held as under:\"15. section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, with which we are immediately concerned in these appeals, is in two parts. the main provision is, as has been correctly submitted by shri giri, a provision which provides for appeals from judgments, orders and decrees of the commercial division of the high court. to this main provision, an exception is carved out by the proviso. the primary purpose of a proviso is to qualify the generality of the main part by providing an exception, which has been set out with great felicity in cit v. indo-mercantile bank ltd., 1959 supp (2) scr 256 at 266-267, thus: \"the proper function of a proviso is that it qualifies the generality of the main enactment by providing an exception and taking out as it were, from the main enactment, a portion which, but for the proviso would fall within the main enactment. ordinarily it is foreign to the proper function of a proviso to read it as providing something by way of an addendum or dealing with a subject which is foreign to the main enactment. it is a fundamental rule of construction that a proviso must be considered with relation to the principal matter to which it stands as a proviso. therefore it is to be construed harmoniously with the main enactment. (per das, c.j. in abdul jabar butt v. state of jammu & kashmir [(1957) scr 51, 59]). bhagwati, j., in ram narain sons ltd. v. assistant commissioner of sales tax [(1955) 2 scr 483, 493] said: it is a cardinal rule of interpretation that a proviso to a particular provision of a statute only embraces the field which is covered by the main provision. it carves out an exception to the main provision to which it has been enacted as a proviso and to no other.\" lord macmillan in madras & southern maharatta railway co. v. bezwada municipality [(1944) lr 71 ia 113, 122] laid down the sphere of a proviso as follows: \"the proper function of a proviso is to except and deal with a case which would otherwise fall within the general language of the main enactment, and its effect is confined to that case. where, as in the present case, the language of the main enactment is clear and unambiguous, a proviso can have no repercussion on the interpretation of the main enactment, so as to exclude from it by implication what clearly falls within its express terms.\" the territory of a proviso therefore is to carve out an exception to the main enactment and exclude something which otherwise would have been within the section. it has to operate in the same field and if the language of the main enactment is clear it cannot be used for the purpose of interpreting the main enactment or to exclude by implication what the enactment clearly says unless the words of the proviso are such that that is its necessary effect. (vide also corporation of city of toronto v. attorney-general for canada [(1946) ac 32, 37] .)\" 16. the proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by the commercial division of the high court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure code, 1908, and section 37 of the arbitration act. it will at once be noticed that orders that are not specifically enumerated under order xliii of the cpc would, therefore, not be appealable, and appeals that are mentioned in section 37 of the arbitration act alone are appeals that can be made to the commercial appellate division of a high court. 17. thus, an order which refers parties to arbitration under section 8, not being appealable under section 37(1)(a), would not be appealable under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. similarly, an appeal rejecting a plea referred to in sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 16 of the arbitration act would equally not be appealable under section 37(2)(a) and, therefore, under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act.\" 9.3 applying the law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in the aforesaid decision to the facts of the case on hand and considering sub-section (1) of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, we are of the opinion that against the final judgment and/or decision of the commercial court or the commercial division of the high court only, appeal shall be maintainable before the commercial appellate division of the high court. however, an appeal shall also lie from such orders passed by the commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code as amended by the commercial courts act, 2015 and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. therefore, the submission on behalf of shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate on behalf of the respondent that an appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, shall lie only from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code, as amended by the commercial courts act, 2015 and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, is not acceptable. as observed and held by the hon'ble supreme court, section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, 2015, is in two parts, one is with respect to providing appeal to the commercial appellate division of the high court against the final decision / judgment or order of the commercial court or the commercial division of the high court and the second part is with respect to providing appeal from such orders passed by commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code as amended by the commercial courts act, 2015 and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. however, at the same time, shri trivedi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent is justified in raising the objection on the maintainability of the present appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 against the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court, rajkot, overruling and /or setting aside the objection raised by the appellant herein on the jurisdiction of the commercial court, rajkot, to entertain and adjudicate the execution petition. 10. in view of the above discussion, it is observed and held that the present appeal under section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, against the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court, rajkot, shall not be maintainable. however, considering the request made by shri modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant and considering the fact that the issue with respect to the jurisdiction of the commercial court, rajkot, would be a pure question of law and it is with respect to the jurisdiction, as held by the division bench of this court in state of gujarat v. union of india (supra), a petition under article 227 of the constitution of india shall be maintainable and therefore, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant is permitted to convert the present first appeal into a writ petition under article 227 of the constitution of india. registry is directed to register the present first appeal as special civil application under article 227 of the constitution of india by giving a separate, new number accordingly. 11. now so far as the challenge to the impugned order on merits is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that as such, the issue involved in the present petition with respect to the jurisdiction of the commercial court, rajkot, to decide and adjudicate the said execution petition is now no more res-integra in view of the decision of the division bench of this court in the case of m/s.oci corporation -i (supra). in the aforesaid decision, in paragraph-63, the division bench of this court has specifically observed and held as under:\"63. the sum and substance of the above discussion would be, (1) where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, all the applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the commercial division where such commercial division has been constituted in the high court i.e. in the present case high court of gujarat. (2) where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute but not of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, considering the provisions of arbitration and conciliation (amendment) act, 2015 the same shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the concerned high court. (3) where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is other than international arbitration, all the applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 shall be filed in and heard, decided and disposed of by the commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial court has been constituted.\" therefore, the learned judge, commercial court, rajkot, has unnecessarily distinguished the decision of this court in the case of m/s.oci corporation -i (supra) and thereby has erred in not following the said binding decision of this court. the decision of this court in m/s.oci corporation -i (supra) which is reported to be confirmed by the hon'ble supreme court, specifically lays down that if the award is in connection with the international arbitration, execution petition shall be maintainable before the commercial division of the high court alone. at this stage, it is required to be noted that as such, the applicability of the commercial courts act, 2015 and/or applicability of the arbitration and conciliation (amendment) act, 2015, cannot be disputed as the respondent herein original applicant itself has preferred the execution petition before the commercial court under the commercial courts act, 2015. in the aforesaid decision in m/s.oci corporation i (supra), after considering the scheme of the commercial courts act, 2015, and the object and purpose of the enactment of the commercial courts act, 2015, and the scheme of the arbitration and conciliation (amendment) act, 2015, it is specifically observed and held that against any decision and/or order where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, all the applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the commercial division where such commercial division has been constituted in the high court i.e. in the present case high court of gujarat. it is not in dispute that in the present case, the subject-matter of arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and the arbitration is an international commercial arbitration. even when the award is a domestic award as the venue might have been in india, the arbitration would still be an international commercial arbitration. under the circumstances, the impugned order passed by the learned judge, commercial court, rajkot, overruling / setting aside the objections raised by the appellant herein on the jurisdiction of the commercial court, rajkot, to entertain and adjudicate the execution petition with respect to the international commercial arbitration and the order passed by the learned commercial court that the said execution petition shall be maintainable before the commercial court, rajkot, cannot be sustained and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside. it is, accordingly quashed and set aside. the commercial court, rajkot, is hereby directed to return the said execution petition to the original applicant original claimant to present it before the commercial division of this court immediately and thereafter, the original claimant original applicant to file the execution petition before the commercial division of this court and if filed within a period of four weeks from the return of the execution petition to present it before the commercial division of this court, the same be considered in accordance with law and on merits at the earliest. rule is made absolute accordingly to the aforesaid extent. in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs. in view of the disposal of writ petition, respective civil applications stand disposed of. sd/(m.r. shah, j) sd/(a.y. kogje, j) sunil"
