This review petition has been filed by the applicants/respondents seeking review of the order dated 17th  August, 2021 passed in CM(M) 346/2020 which had been filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India against the order dated 26th November, 2019 passed by the learned Additional District Judge-1(South East), Saket Court, New Delhi in CS(COMM) 81/2018. For convenience and clarity, the non-applicant (M/S OK PLAY INDIA PVT. LTD.) shall be described as non- applicant/petitioner whereas the applicants of this review petition (A.P. DISTRIBUTORS & ANR.) shall be referred to as applicants/respondents. \n2. The facts that are relevant for the disposal of this review petition may be briefly stated. The non-applicant/petitioner had instituted a commercial suit for the recovery of money against the applicants/respondents. The written statement had been filed by the applicants/respondents belatedly and without an application seeking condonation of delay. The matter was heard and the orders on the objection of the non-applicant/petitioner that the written statement could not be taken on record as it was filed with delay and without an affidavit of admission and denial of documents and the application for condonation of delay, were reserved. The written statement which was to be filed by 22nd February, 2019 was filed with a delay of 4 days on 26th February, 2019. However, the affidavit of admission and denial was filed after a delay of 118 days on 20th May, 2019 and the application for condonation of delay was filed only on 31st October, 2019 after the learned Commercial Court had reserved the matter for orders on that same day. \n3. Vide the impugned order dated 26th November, 2019, the learned Commercial Court condoned the delay on the ground that the Court should not take a hyper technical view and subject to a cost of Rs.10,000/- imposed upon the applicants/respondents to be paid equally to the opposite side and the Bharat Key Vir Funds, the written statement was taken on record. When this order was challenged before this Court, vide the judgment dated 17th August, 2021, the said order was set aside and it was held that the learned Commercial Court had erred in accepting the written statement on record which was filed beyond the period statutorily provided. \n4. Mr. Shyam Moorjani, learned counsel for the applicants/respondents submitted that this Court had erred on facts and in law and therefore, the judgment dated 17th August, 2021 was liable to be reviewed. It was submitted that while recording the facts in para-No. 2 of the judgment, this Court had referred to the recovery of Rs. 7,68,000/-without referring to the interest claimed from the date the amount was due as per invoices. It was further submitted that this amount had to be quantified and court fees paid thereon but the non-applicant/petitioner had failed to do so. This objection was raised by the applicants/respondents on 15th May, 2019 and it was on 19th August, 2019 when the requisite court fees was paid. As such, the plaint had not been instituted till that date and limitation could not have started running before the plaint was validly filed. \n5. Learned counsel for the applicants/respondents further submitted that an application under Order VII Rule 11 was pending and the judgment dated 17th August, 2021 had curtailed the powers of the learned Commercial Court as it was now prevented from considering the said application. Further, the discretion that vested in the learned Commercial Court under Order VIII Rule 5 to call for evidence even without there being a written statement was further curtailed by the observations of this Court in Para No. 13 of the judgement dated 17th August, 2021. Furthermore, it was submitted that this Court had overstepped its jurisdiction in observing in Para No.10 that an application had to be filed for seeking condonation of delay, as Order VIII Rule 1 did not expressly and affirmatively provide for the filing of an application and, therefore, this Court had, by way of the judgment, stepped into the legislative field, which was impermissible. It was the contention of the learned counsel for the applicants/respondents that the proviso in fact when read carefully, would show that the Court of its own had to repeatedly, specify every thirty days, as to by which date the written statement had to be filed and there was no need to file an application seeking condonation. \n6. It was further submitted that the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 ('Original Side Rules' for short) were not applicable to the District Courts and, therefore, the filing of the affidavit of admission and denial could not be insisted upon before accepting the written statement. It was submitted that the Court had erred as \"Court\" as defined in the Original Side Rules, was the High Court of Delhi and not the District Courts and so the rules and procedures prescribed by the Original Sides Rules were not applicable to the District Courts. Rather, the summons that the applicants/respondents had received were only regular summons for settlement of issues and were not \"informed summons\" which are issued by the High Court of Delhi in terms of the Original Side Rules. \n7. The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents has relied upon the judgment of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Red Bull AG v. Pepsico India Holdings Pvt. Ltd., 2019 SCC OnLine Del 9901 to submit that in that case, this Court had not insisted on the filing of an application before taking on record the written statement which had been belatedly filed. Furthermore, he submitted that the judgment of the Supreme Court in SCG Contracts (India) (P) Ltd. v. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure (P) Ltd., (2019) 12 SCC 210 was not applicable to the facts of the present case as in that case, the written statement had been filed on the 160th day whereas, here it had been filed well before the 120th day as required under law. As regards the judgment in Friends Motel Pvt. Ltd. Through its director Mr. Arun Dwivedi Vs. Shreeved Consultancy LLP & Ors. (Judgment dated 15th January, 2020 in CS (COMM) 140/2019), it was submitted by the learned counsel for the applicants/respondents that the judgment was incomplete as it could not be predicted that had there been an application for condonation of delay, what view the Court would have taken. On all these grounds, the learned counsel submitted that the judgement dated 17th August, 2021 was liable to be reviewed. \n8. Per contra, Mr. Anirudh Wadhwa, learned counsel for the non- applicant/petitioner submitted that there was no error that was apparent in the judgment under review. It was submitted that the applicants/respondents had been served on 23rd January, 2019. On 26th February, 2019, the written statement had been filed without an affidavit of admission and denial. On 25th March, 2019, when the defendant first appeared before the Court, an objection was taken which was recorded by the Court that no affidavit of admission and denial had been filed. Thus, it was not as if the applicants/respondents were not aware of the need to comply with the strict and mandatory procedural requirements of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 read with the amended provisions of the CPC. Finally, the applicants/respondents filed the affidavit of admission and denial on 20th May, 2019. Again, there was no application filed for condonation of delay. Arguments on the said objections were heard on two dates, i.e., 19th August, 2019 and 31st October, 2019 and according to the counsel for the non-applicant/petitioner, probably when the applicants/respondents feared that the written statement may not be taken on record, the application for condonation of delay was filed on 31 st October itself, at 4:00 PM when the matter was put for orders. Even in the filing of the application for condonation of delay, 282 days of delay had occurred. Reference was made to the judgment of SCG Contracts (India) (P) Ltd(supra).\n9. The learned counsel for the non-applicant/petitioner once again referred to the judgment of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Unilin Beheer B.V. v. Balaji Action Buildwell, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 8498 to submit that when the written statement has been filed without an affidavit of admission/denial of documents, not only will the written statement not be taken on record but it would be appropriate to deem that the documents filed by the plaintiff are admitted and on that basis, the Court could proceed under Order VIII Rule 10 of the CPC and also that the timelines qua the filing of the written statement as have been observed in SCG Contracts (India) (P) Ltd(supra) shall also apply to the filing of the affidavit of admission/denial of documents and time for filing thereof also cannot be extended beyond what is the maximum period permitted. \n10. It was further submitted that the law was very clear as Order VI CPC had been expressly amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and, therefore, to claim that \"informed summons\" had not been issued was misplaced. It was further submitted that in any case, an objection had been raised by the learned counsel for the non-applicant/petitioner, on the very first date of the appearance of the applicants/respondents and nothing prevented the applicants/respondents from taking corrective measures well within time. It was also submitted that the additional Court fees had been paid only on account of the objections raised by the applicants/respondents and not on the directions of the learned Commercial Court and, therefore, it was not a case of rejection of plaint.\n11. It was further submitted by the learned counsel for the non- applicant/petitioner that there was no occasion for fresh summons to have been issued after the Court fees was paid. It was submitted that the judgment in Red Bull AG (supra) could be distinguished on facts. In that case, on the first date of hearing, when the defendant had appeared on advance notice, both the parties were referred to mediation. Summons for settlement of issues had not been directed at that time. After four months, when the mediation had failed, an objection was taken that the written statement had been filed with delay. The defendants in that case were issued summons on or around 28th November, 2018 and the written statement was filed on 06th March, 2019 beyond the period of thirty days from the date of service of summons but the pendency of the mediation was found sufficient to explain the delay. Learned counsel for the non- applicant/petitioner submitted that in Shreeved Consultancy LLP v. Friends Motels Pvt. Ltd., 2020 SCC OnLine Del 684, reference was made to the non-filing of the application for condonation of delay alongwith the written statement. The learned counsel further placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in Rajesh Goel v. Jasbir Singh, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 8370. Thus, it was urged that there were no grounds for review and the petition be dismissed. \n12. The CPC provides for a review under Order XLVII Rule 1 in the following circumstances- 1. Application for review of judgment.--(1) Any person considering himself aggrieved-- (a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred,\n(b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed, or (c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes, and who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree passed or order made against him, may apply for a review of judgment to the Court which passed the decree or made the order. \n13. The courts have repeatedly held that the powers of review are limited and are not equivalent to an appeal. The scope of review has been succinctly stated by the Supreme Court in Kamlesh Varma Vs. Mayawati & Ors. (2013) 8 SCC 320 wherein the following governing principles of review have been laid down- \"Summary of the principles 20. Thus, in view of the above, the following grounds of review are maintainable as stipulated by the statute:\n20.1. When the review will be maintainable:\n(i) Discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within knowledge of the petitioner or could not be produced by him;\n(ii) Mistake or error apparent on the face of the record;\n(iii)Any other sufficient reason.\nThe words \"any other sufficient reason\" have been interpreted in Chhajju Ram Vs. Neki AIR 1922 PC 112 and approved by this Court in Moran Mar Basselios Catholicos Vs. Most Rev. Mar Poulose Athanasius AIR 1954 SC 526 to mean \"a reason sufficient on grounds at least analogous to those specified in the rule\". The same principles have been reiterated in Union of India Vs. Sandur Manganese & Iron Ores Ltd. (2013) 8 SCC 337.\n20.2. When the review will not be maintainable: \n(i) A repetition of old and overruled argument is not enough to reopen concluded adjudications. \n(ii) Minor mistakes of inconsequential import. \n(iii) Review proceedings cannot be equated with the original hearing of the case. (iv) Review is not maintainable unless the material error, manifest on the face of the order, undermines its soundness or results in miscarriage of justice. \n(v) A review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and corrected but lies only for patent error. \n(vi) The mere possibility of two views on the subject cannot be a ground for review. \n(vii) The error apparent on the face of the record should not be an error which has to be fished out and searched. \n(viii) The appreciation of evidence on record is fully within the domain of the appellate court, it cannot be permitted to be advanced in the review petition. \n(ix) Review is not maintainable when the same relief sought at the time of arguing the main matter had been negatived.\"\n14. An error has thus to be one on the face of the order. The Court cannot be called upon to delve deep to \"discover\" an error. A re-argument or introduction of new pleas is also not permissible. In the present matter, it is evident that the learned counsel for the applicants/respondents has actually argued out his case which ideally ought to have been presented when the main petition was considered. Be that as it may, these submissions are considered at this juncture. \n15. At the outset, this Court rejects the argument of the learned counsel for the applicants/respondents that Original Side Rules are not applicable to the District Courts. The District Courts do not function in a vacuum. Specific to the Commercial Courts, it has to be noted that the Annexure E to the Original Side Rules provides for Practice Directions under Section 18 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015. The Practice Direction No.1 reads as below- \"1. These Practice Directions are issued by the Court in exercise of powers conferred under Section 18 of the Commercial Courts Act to supplement the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018, the provisions of Chapter II of the Commercial Courts Act or the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, in so far as such provisions apply to the hearing of commercial disputes of a specified value. said Act, as applicable, shall apply to all suits/ original proceedings in relation to \"commercial disputes\", as defined under Section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act.\"\n(Emphasis added)\n16. Furthermore, these Practice Directions apply to not only the Commercial Division (i.e., of the High Court) and the Commercial Appellate Division, but also to the Commercial Court. A Commercial Court has been defined under Section 2(1)(b) the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as one constituted under sub-section 1 of Section 3 of the Act. The same is reproduced herein below- 3. Constitution of Commercial Courts.--(1) The State Government, may after consultation with the concerned High Court, by notification, constitute such number of Commercial Courts at District level, as it may deem necessary for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on those Courts under this Act:\n[Provided that with respect to the High Courts having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the State Government may, after consultation with the concerned High Court, by notification, constitute Commercial Courts at the District Judge level:\nProvided further that with respect to a territory over which the High Courts have ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the State Government may, by notification, specify such pecuniary value which shall not be less than three lakh rupees and not more than the pecuniary jurisdiction exercisable by the District Courts, as it may consider necessary.]\n17. The reference to the Commercial Court in the Practice Directions, is therefore, an explicit and clear reference to the District Court which is trying a \"commercial dispute\" as defined under Section 2 (c) of the Act. \nThe suit filed by the non-applicant/petitioner for recovery of money on the basis of business transactions and invoices undisputedly involved a commercial dispute. Moreover, the Practice Directions seek to supplement the Original Side Rules alongwith the provisions of Chapter 2 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and the CPC insofar as these provisions apply to the hearing of the commercial disputes of a specified value. In other words, again there is a categoric application of the Original Side Rules to the commercial disputes even in the District Courts. Ignorance of the provisions of the rules cannot come to the aid and assistance of the applicants/respondents. \n18. The next contention of the learned counsel for the applicants/respondents was that this Court had entered into the legislative field as it had observed that an application for condonation was necessary. This Court finds no merit in the same as it has been the consistent view of this Court in Unilin Beheer B.V. (supra), Rajesh Goel (supra) and Shreeved Consultancy LLP (supra) and Mothers Pride Education Institution Pvt. Ltd. v. Shukla Sehgal, 2021 SCC OnLine Del 2407 that an application for condonation of delay is to be filed alongwith the written statement when there was a delay in filing the same. In Rajesh Goel(supra), this Court noted in Para No. 25 that despite knowledge that the written statement had been filed without an application for condonation of delay, no steps were taken to remove objections and get the written statement placed on the record thus, noting that an application for condonation was required with a written statement which was being belatedly filed. Similarly, the Division Bench of this Court in Shreeved Consultancy LLP (supra) noted in Para Nos.5 and 6 that though objections had been raised that an application seeking condonation of delay had not been filed, no steps were taken to remove the same and refile the written statement. It would be useful to reproduce Para Nos.5 & 6 of the judgment -\n\"5. We may note that the summons in the suit were served on the appellant No.1 on 13.04.2019, which fact remains undisputed, whereas the written statement was filed on 117th day i.e. after the expiry of 90 days, the period permissible in law. For reasons best known to the appellants, no application for condonation of delay was filed along with the written statement. Instead, the same came to be filed after 20 days, on 28.08.2019. Pertinently, till the date the impugned order came to be passed, the said application was not on the record and on enquiring from learned counsel for the appellants/defendants, he had stated before the learned Single Judge that objections had been raised by the Registry but no steps were taken either to take back the application from the Registry or remove the objections and re-file the same. \n6. In view of the aforesaid position, we see no reason to accept the submission made by learned counsel for the appellants that the written statement even though filed after the expiry of 90 days, but before 120 days, ought to have been taken into consideration. It is only in the event a defendant is able to make out sufficient cause or demonstrate any extraordinary circumstances does the Court condone a delay beyond the maximum period of 90 days. The appellants/defendants have miserably failed to demonstrate any such circumstances for the court to have condoned the delay beyond 90 days.\" \nOnce again, the judgment underlines the need for filing an application for condonation of delay when the written statement was filed with delay. \n19. As regards the contention that the law required the Court to automatically extend the period for filing a written statement beyond 30 days, the Division Bench in Shreeved Consultancy LLP (supra) has clearly rejected it. The defendant cannot claim extension as a matter of right. Extension of time to file the written statement is within the discretion of the Court. For exercise of such discretion, the defendant must explain what prevented him from filing the written statement within 30 days and explain the further delay, but within 120 days of service of summons and on such explanation being accepted alone can the delay be condoned. \n20. As regards the judgment in Red Bull AG (supra), the facts are so different and cannot be taken as providing that in no circumstance, was an application for condonation of delay required. As recorded in Para Nos.21 and 22 of the judgment in Red Bull AG (supra), there was clearly no formal order issuing summons to the defendants or directing the defendants to file a written statement as the parties were exploring the possibility of settlement, on the request of the plaintiff and thereafter on joint request. In these circumstances, the filing of the written statement on 06th March, 2019 was treated as being within the outer limitation provided under Order VIII Rule 1 CPC. However, that situation does not prevail in the present case. \n21. Under Order VIII Rule 1 CPC, the written statement is to be filed within 30 days from the date of service of summons. Therefore, once the applicants/respondents were served on 23rd January, 2019, the written statement had to be filed by 22nd February, 2019. The same was filed on 26th February, 2019 without the affidavit for admission and denial which was filed only on 20th May, 2019. No application for condonation of delay was filed till 31st October, 2019 when orders were reserved after the hearing on this issue of whether the belated written statement could be taken on record or not. Such a filing beyond even the outer limit available for exercise of discretion by the Commercial Court i.e., 282 days, could not have been considered by the learned Commercial Court in the instant case. \n22. Under Order VII Rule 11, the Court can reject a plaint if despite being so directed by the Court to correctly value the suit within a specified time, the same is not done and adequate Court Fee is not filed. In the present case, there is no order of the learned Commercial Court directing the payment of Court fees. Rather on the objections taken by the applicants/respondents, the non-applicant/petitioner had offered to and had paid the additional Court fees by 19th August, 2019. Therefore, there was no question of the rejection of the plaint on that ground. The contention of the learned counsel for the applicants/respondents that the plaint had not been properly instituted till that time is untenable and is rejected. \n23. With regard to the directions of this Court in the judgment dated 17 th August, 2021, in Para No.13 to the learned Commercial Court to consider the course of action under Order VIII Rule 10 CPC, the same reflect no error. The orders that can be passed under Order VIII Rule 10 are \"in relation to the suit\" as to pronounce judgments or make further orders. This would be sufficient to enable the learned Commercial Court to exercise its discretion under Order VIII Rule 5 CPC, if it so desired. \n24. There is no merit in the review petition which is accordingly dismissed with costs of Rs.10,000/- imposed upon the applicants/respondents, which shall be shared equally between the non- applicant/petitioner and Bharat Key Vir Funds. \n25. The judgment be uploaded on the website forthwith. \n(ASHA MENON) JUDGE OCTOBER 25, 2021 ak",

2. when an interim relief under section 9 is refused by the court considering a o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 petition under section 34 of the act, whether the high court can interfere under article 227 of the constitution, especially in the absence of the four parameters culled out in whirpool corporation v. registrar of trademarks, mumbai[(1998) 8 scc 1]?

(arbitration) no.1/2023 under sec.34 of the act. the learned senior counsel then contended that the rights and entitlement of the parties should have been o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 decided based on the state of affairs prevailing as on the date of application and therefore, dismissal of the interlocutory application to encash the bank guarantee, based on the findings in the subsequent award, is flawed in law. as regards the challenge to the maintainability of the original petition under article 227 of the constitution of india, in view of the alternate remedy under sec.37(3) of the act, learned senior counsel relied upon a judgment of the hon'ble supreme court in i.t.i v. seimens public communications network ltd. [(2002) 5 scc 510], which, in turn, relied upon the land mark judgment of the hon'ble supreme court in l. chandrakumar v. union of india [(1997) 3 scc 261]. arguments advanced in o.p.(c) no.2650/2023: here again, learned senior counsel would challenge the approach of the learned sub judge in dismissing i.a.no.2/2023 by placing sole o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 reliance upon the findings in the award. it was emphasised that the scope of the interlocutory application was only to renew/keep alive the bank guarantee, so that the subject matter can be preserved pending consideration of application under section 34 of the act. dismissal of i.a.no.2/2023 is all the more bad in law, since the issue as to invocation of the bank guarantee was not adjudicated by the arbitrator; instead, it was left open. as regards the respondent's contention that the remedy under section 9 is an independent proceeding, wherefore, the same cannot be invoked by way of an interlocutory application in a petition under section 34, learned senior counsel would contend that the same whittles down the scope of section 9 of the act, in which regard learned senior counsel relied upon the judgment of the honourable supreme court in essar house private limited v. arcellor mittal nippon steel india limited [air o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 2022 sc 4294]. 6. respondent's contentions: refuting the above submissions, learned senior counsel for the respondent put forward the following arguments: o.p.no.2612/2023:in respect of both the original petitions, the first point canvassed is with respect to the maintainability of the original petition. learned senior counsel relied upon the judgment of the hon'ble supreme court in (1). deep industries limited v. oil and natural gas corporation [(2020) (15) scc 706] (2). whirlpool corporation v. registrar of trade marks, mumbai and others [1998 (8) scc 1] and (3). madhya pradesh high court advocates bar association and another v. union of india and another [air 2022 sc 2713], to contend that, in the absence of infringement of a fundamental right; violation of o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 principles of natural justice; or when the order impugned is wholly without jurisdiction, or the vires of the statute is under challenge, an original petition under article 227 of the constitution, is not maintainable. the specific contentions raised with respect to o.p.no. 2612/2023 is that, the order impugned passed in m.c.a.no.5/2021 is an order under section 37(2) (b) of the act, which refused an interim measure under section 17 and the same can be challenged only by way of an appeal to the hon'ble supreme court, as provided under section 37(3) of the act. the third point canvassed by the learned senior counsel is with respect to the scope of section 17 of the act. it was contended that, section 17 contemplates only an interim measure and once the arbitral proceedings comes to an end, all interlocutory orders merge with the award and orders passed under section 17 will become infructuous. in other words, m.c.a. o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 no.5/2021 preferred under section 37 of the act has become infructuous, since the arbitral proceedings culminated in an award in favour of the respondent. the next point canvassed by the learned senior counsel is that, the bank guarantee has become unenforceable, since the contingency upon which the bank guarantee could be invoked does not and cannot exist, the award passed being wholly in favour of the respondent herein, dismissing the claim of the petitioner. simultaneous with this point, learned senior counsel emphasised the fact that, the award in question has not been stayed by the court in the proceedings initiated under section 34 of the act. as a matter of fact, even an application for stay has not been preferred, wherefore, the question of encashment of bank guarantee after the award does not arise at all. that being so, m.c.a.no.5/2021 could only have been dismissed, is the submission. o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 7. o.p.no.2650/2023:apart from the issue on maintainability, which is common to both the original petitions, it was urged that, the relief sought for by way of an application under section 9, in a petition under section 34, to keep the bank guarantee alive, itself was misconceived. the only power available under section 34 of the act is to set aside an arbitral award and there is no power for grant of any interim relief, except a stay of the impugned award, as provided under section 36(3) of the act. it was pointed out in this context that, the remedy contemplated under section 9 is an independent proceeding, which remedy can be invoked even after the arbitral award has been passed. however, the same would not justify the instant facts, where an application, purportedly under section 9, is filed as an interim one, in a petition under section 34. such interim o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 application in an application to set aside an arbitral award under section 34, is not maintainable. learned senior counsel further canvassed, based on section 36 (2) of the act, that an application under section 34 will not make the award inoperative or unenforceable, unless the operation of the award is stayed by the court under section 36(3) of the act. in the instant facts, there is not even an application preferred by the petitioner seeking stay of the arbitral award, wherefore, the award binds the parties as per section 35 of the act. therefore, the question of keeping the bank guarantee alive does not surface, so long as the award is not stayed. in answer to the contentions of the learned counsel for the petitioner that an arbitral award becomes enforceable only when the time prescribed for setting aside the arbitral award expires, wherefore, the petitioner was not obligated to seek a stay of the award, which was o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 otherwise not enforceable learned senior counsel submits that the petitioner cannot claim the benefit of 90 days' time to seek stay of operation of the award, once an application to set aside the award under section 34 had infact been filed. it was further contended that even the said period of 90 days expired on 28.11.2023, wherefore, the subject interim application to keep the bank guarantee alive, in the absence of a stay of arbitral award cannot be granted at all. relying upon the canara nidhi limited (m/s) v. m shashikala and others [2019 (9) scc 462], learned senior counsel submitted that, proceedings under section 34 of act is summary in nature and the same is not in the nature of a regular suit. there cannot be any judicial intervention as prohibited by section 5 of the act, except where it is so provided in the act. finally, it was submitted that the high court, in exercise of jurisdiction of article 227 of the o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 constitution, cannot delve into the merits of the case or the propriety of the award. 8. analysis:having heard the learned senior counsel appearing for the respective parties elaborately, this court will first address the challenge in o.p.(c) no.2612/2023. ext.p6 order of the commercial court, manjeri rendered in m.c.a. no.5/2021 is under challenge in the said original petition. as already indicated, the subject matter of challenge in this miscellaneous civil application was the refusal of an injunction sought for by the respondent company, seeking to restrain the petitioner authority from encashing the bank guarantee. injunction was sought for as an interim measure before the arbitral tribunal under section 17 of the act. the petitioner authority preferred a cross objection to enable encashment of the bank guarantee. during the o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 pendency of the m.c.a, the arbitral award was passed on 28.08.2023. an interim order was holding sway pending the m.c.a. restraining the petitioner authority from encashing the bank guarantee. pursuant to the award, the respondent company preferred an application to dispose of m.c.a. in accord with the award, whereas the petitioner authority preferred i.a.no.17/2023 seeking a permission to encash the bank guarantee. the learned sub judge noticed that the award found breach of agreement on the part of the petitioner authority, on which premise, the claim of the respondent company was allowed and the counter claim of the petitioner authority was dismissed. it was also noticed that the award left open the issue with respect to invocation of bank guarantee, due to the pendency of m.c.a. no.5/2021. when no amount is due to the petitioner authority as per the award, the learned sub judge found that there is no o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 justification in the petitioner's request to encash the bank guarantee. accordingly, the appeal, as also, the cross objection were dismissed as infructuous and the sub court directed release of the bank guarantee in favour of the respondent company herein. 9. a copy of the agreement between the petitioner authority and the respondent company is produced as ext.p1 in both the o.ps. article 7 of the agreement deals with the security deposit, as per which, the selected bidder has to deposit a bank guarantee equivalent to the amounts specified therein with the petitioner authority in the first phase. clause 7.3 speaks of a further deposit to be made in the second phase. clause 7.7 deals with appropriation of security deposit, wherein it is contemplated that the petitioner authority shall without prejudice to its other rights and remedies under o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 the agreement or as per law, be entitled to appropriate the relevant amounts from security deposit as damages on the event of the respondent company committing default, which default is seen expressed in clause 7.7 as \"concessionaire event of default\". 10. it could thus be seen that the essential event which enables the petitioner authority to invoke the bank guarantee is a default on the part of the respondent company. it is true that to invoke a bank guarantee, the pendency of a dispute/litigation is not necessary. it is also settled that the bank guarantee is essentially a contract between the bank and the beneficiary, which is independent and distinct from the main contract between the parties. to invoke the bank guarantee, it requires no adjudication or arrival of a finding that the respondent company had committed breach of the agreement and, therefore, o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 in default. it is only a matter of satisfaction of the petitioner authority that there is a default on the part of the respondent company, which entails loss to the petitioner authority. nor does the bank has a say in the matter to refuse encashment of bank guarantee, except in the two situations namely, a fraud in obtaining the bank guarantee and in a case, where very serious and irreparable prejudice/injury will be caused to the contracting party, who offered the bank guarantee. [see in this regard (1). vinitec electronics private limited v. hcl infosystems limited. [(2008) 1 scc 544]; (2). u.p.state sugar corporation v. m/s.surnac international ltd. [(1997) 1 scc 568]; and (3). hindustan construction co. ltd. v. state of bihar & ors. [(1999) 8 scc 436]]. in view of the above settled position, the petitioner authority could have invoked the bank guarantee and got encashed the amount, even before the dispute precipitated and o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 culminated in litigation. even during the course of litigation, the petitioner authority could have impressed upon the courts concerned to vacate the interim orders, preventing invocation of the bank guarantee. 11. however, there will be a paradigm shift to the situation, once an award is passed, finding that there is absolutely no default on the part of the respondent company and that it was the petitioner authority, who committed default and breached the agreement, thereby nullifying the very essential pre-requisite to invoke the bank guarantee. when we say that the contract of bank guarantee is independent and distinct from the main contract between the parties and that it is not essential to establish default/breach on the part of the party, who offered the bank guarantee, it cannot be understood in law that bank guarantee can be invoked at the whims and o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 fancy of the party to whom it was offered, in an arbitrary manner. rather, it is not a matter of pure and absolute discretion, even in the absence of factual and circumstantial support as regards default on the part of the other party. it may be true that the bank, which offered the guarantee on behalf of its customer, cannot have any power or authority in stock to oppose the bank guarantee being invoked. however, when the matter is before the court, in the form of an injunction sought for by one party to restrain the other from invoking the bank guarantee, the situation is different. the considerations of prima facie case, balance of convenience, irreparable injury etc., may have to be gone into, based on the facts and circumstances, consistent with the legal position as regards invocation of the bank guarantee. in the instant case, we have crossed that stage; and the litigation has culminated in an arbitral award, which categorically arrived at o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 a finding that breach is committed by the petitioner authority, thus implying that there is no default, whatsoever, on the part of the respondent company. 12. it is in the above referred state of affairs that m.c.a.no.5/2021 was brought up for consideration before the learned sub judge. as rightly found by the learned sub judge, the award was in force as on the date of consideration of the above said miscellaneous civil case and hence, that court could have only disposed of the m.c.a. in terms of the award, for reasons more than one. firstly, there exists no material suggesting default on the part of the respondent company, so as to permit invocation of the bank guarantee. the award in fact indicates vice versa. secondly, the order under challenge before the learned sub judge in the m.c.a was in respect of an interim measure contemplated under o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 section 17 of the act, which cannot have any life or survival, once the arbitration proceedings culminates in an award. 13. this court also does not find merit in the contention made by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner, based on the principle that the act of the court shall not prejudice anybody. this principle is sought to be pressed into service on the premise that the petitioner was prevented from invoking the bank guarantee only because of the interim order of injunction restraining the petitioner from doing so. the right of the parties are liable to be decided as on the date of application of m.c.a no.5 /2021 and not based on a subsequent award passed in the arbitration proceedings, is the submission made by the learned senior counsel. this court cannot entertain the said submission. primarily, this court is of the opinion that, if the petitioner o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 had a right to invoke the bank guarantee even before the commencement of the arbitration proceedings, or after the commencement of the arbitration proceedings, effective steps ought to have been taken by the petitioner to get the injunction restraining the same vacated. the same having not been done, the petitioner authority cannot now blame the court, for its inability to invoke the bank guarantee. this court also cannot find fault with the sub court, manjeri in taking note of the subsequent event of passing of award, which declined the entire claim of the petitioner and accepted the respondent's claim. again, it is important to notice that the m.c.a arose from a petition under section 17 of the act, which has relevance only during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings and once the proceedings had culminated in an award, the significance of the order under challenge in m.c.a no.5/2021 pale into insignificance. o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 14. ratiocinating as above, this court finds no reason to interfere with the well considered order of the learned sub judge in m.c.a.no.5/2021, with the result, the challenge in o.p.(c) no.2612/2023 fails and the same will stand dismissed. 15. o.p.no.2650/2023:coming to the above captioned original petition, the first and foremost issue to be addressed is with respect to the maintainability of i.a.no.2/2023 in the o.p.(arb)no.1/2023 seeking to renew/keep alive the bank guarantee. learned senior counsel for the respondent contended that such an interlocutory application is not contemplated by the relief under section 34 of the arbitration act, whereas the said proposition is disputed by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner. according to the petitioner, the o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 petitioner has 90 days time to seek a stay of the impugned award and therefore, to pursue an independent remedy under section 9 of the act, the petitioner has 90 days time. it is during the interregnum period that the relief is sought for by virtue of the subject interim application to keep alive the bank guarantee, as otherwise, the amount offered as bank guarantee is liable to be withdrawn by the respondent company, especially when there is an enabling order in m.c.a.no.5/2021. such an event may frustrate the very purpose of o.p.(arb)no.1/2023, in case the same is ultimately decided in favour of the petitioner, is the submission made by the learned senior counsel. 16. having considered the rival contentions, this court is of the opinion that the subject interlocutory application preferred in o.p.(arb)no.1/2023 is not maintainable. o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 a salutary aspect which requires to be taken note of is that the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, contemplates a special remedy which is different, independent and distinct from the ordinary civil remedy, the purpose being expeditious settlement of disputes, especially of a commercial nature. the second important aspect to be noted is that the remedy under section 34 is neither that of an appeal, nor of a review. it is a provision where the aggrieved person can seek to set aside an arbitral award on certain specified grounds. coupled with said aspect, it is worthwhile to notice that remedy under section 9 is available before, during and after the arbitral proceedings. there is no dispute that the remedy under section 9 is of an interim nature. therefore, when a specific provision caters to needs of an interim character, invocation of the remedy of filing an interlocutory application in a petition under o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 section 34 is not envisaged. it may not be proper to import the ordinary principles of civil procedure into a challenge under section 34, to find that an interim application is always maintainable in a main petition. 17. in this regard, this court also takes stock of section 5 of the act, which defines the extent of judicial intervention in respect of matters provided for under the act. section 5 starts with a non-obstante clause and interdicts the intervention by a judicial authority, except where it is so provided by the act. the interdiction contained in section 5 is also a pointer which leads to the proposition that judicial intervention by virtue of an interim application filed in a proceeding under section 34 of the act cannot have legal sanction, inasmuch as the same is not so provided in section 34. even a stay of the impugned arbitral o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 award, pending consideration of an application under section 34, is not contemplated in section 34 of the act; instead it is provided under section 36(3), which is all the more a reason for this court not to read into section 34, a power for grant of an interim relief. in this regard, this court may profitably refer to the dictum of the honourable supreme court in canara nidhi limited (supra), which frowned upon an application under section 151 of c.p.c to adduce evidence in support of the grounds canvassed under section 34 of the act, holding that the proceeding under section 34 is not an appeal, but summary in nature. 18. this court also finds that the scope of interference under article 227 of the constitution of india, in the factual scenario as obtaining in this case, is also very limited. the legal position has been succinctly stated by a o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 three judges bench of the hon'ble supreme court in deep industries limited v. oil and natural gas corporation limited and another [(2020) 15 scc 706]. in that decision, the hon'ble supreme court, of course, held that the constitutional provision of article 227 remains untouched by the non-obstante clause in section 5 of the act. however, the hon'ble supreme court cautioned that, while interfering under article 227, the high court should be extremely circumspect, taking into account the statutory policy of the act and that interference shall be restricted to orders which patently lacks inherent jurisdiction. there cannot be any quarrel on the proposition canvassed by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner, based on the constitution bench decision of the honourable supreme court in l.chandra kumar v. union of india and others [(1997) 3 scc 261], as regards the high court's power of superintendence over o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 the tribunals. the question is one of propriety in exercise of the discretion, especially in the absence of the four parameters culled out in paragraph no.15 of whirlpool corporation v. registrar of trade marks, mumbai [(1998) 8 scc 1] this court is therefore of the opinion that an interference under article 227 is not warranted as against the order of the sub court, manjeri, dated 22.11.2023, dismissing i.a. no.2/2023. 19. this court is also impelled to consider the issue, on facts as well. as emphatically contended for by the learned senior counsel for the respondent and as taken stock of and relied upon by the learned sub judge, a stay of the impugned award has neither been sought for, nor obtained under section 36(3) of the act, by the petitioner herein. by virtue of the provision under section 36(2), mere filing of an application to set aside the arbitral award under o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 section 34 will not render the award unenforceable, unless its operation has been stayed in terms of section 36(3). it could, thus, be seen that the award remained enforceable, when the matter was considered by the learned sub judge and it continues to be so, even now. this court cannot endorse the submission made by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner had three months' time to challenge an arbitral award as per section 34(3) of the act, until which time the award cannot be enforced, going by section 36(1) of the act. according to the learned senior counsel, the petitioner had time till 28.11.2023, which is the date of expiry of three months' period afore referred; and since the award cannot be enforced until such time, the petitioner was under no legal obligation to obtain a stay of operation of the award. in other words, at the time when the learned sub judge considered the interlocutory o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 application to keep alive the bank guarantee, the award remained unenforceable, since the period of three months had not expired, wherefore, absence of a stay of the award should not have been taken stock of and relied upon by the learned sub judge to refuse the relief, is the submission made by the learned senior counsel. as already indicated, this court cannot countenance the said argument. it is true, that section 34(3) stipulates a period of three moths from the date of receipt of the arbitral award to prefer an application under section 34. it is equally correct that the enforcement of the award is permissible only on the expiry of the said period of three months, as per section 36(1), which would necessarily imply that the award is unenforceable till the expiry of such period. however, one cannot loose sight of the fact that the enforcement of the award is dealt with under section 36 of the act, wherein sub-section 2 of section 36 specifically provides o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 that mere filing of an application to set aside the arbitral award, by itself, will not render the award unenforceable, unless the operation of the arbitral award is stayed by the court under section 36(3). thus, when the entire provisions of section 36 is considered as a whole, harmoniously, the inescapable conclusion is that, once an application under section 34 is filed, the applicant cannot take recourse to section 36(1), to contend that the award cannot be enforced until the expiry of the period of three months stipulated in section 34(3). the winner of the award is only under an obligation to wait till the expiry of the period prescribed for filing an application under section 34 to seek enforcement of the award; and he cannot be under any fetters in law, in so far as enforcement of the award is concerned, once a petition is filed under section 34 and a stay has not been obtained. an interpretation, to the contrary, o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 would affront the provisions of section 36(2) and this court is of the opinion that the section 36(1) cannot be read independent of and divorced from the remaining provisions under section 36. 20. in the light of the above discussion, this court finds that it was the fundamental obligation of the petitioner to obtain a stay of operation of the award, before seeking any interim relief, even if the same was to preserve the subject matter of the proceeding under section 34; and a failure in this regard would only keep the award alive, in which case, the finding that the respondent company was not at default would stand in the way, even in respect of a prayer to keep the bank guarantee alive. in other words, so long as the findings as regards default on the part of the petitioner authority, coupled with absence of any such default on the part of the respondent company, stare at the o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 petitioner authority, the relief contemplated in i.a. no.2/2023 could not have been granted. that being so, this court cannot find fault with the impugned order of the learned sub judge. in the light of the above discussion, o.p. no.2650/2023 will also stand dismissed. sd/c.jayachandran, judge tr/skk/ww/vdv o.p.(c).nos. 2612 & 2650 of 2023 appendix of op(c) 2650/2023 petitioner
