Sambre, J. \n                                         Date:      March 11, 2021 \n                    P.C.:- \n\n\n                    1]       Identical orders passed by the Principal District Judge, rejecting\nthe prayer for transfer of proceedings under Section 24 of the Civil Procedure Code are subject matter of challenge in the present Writ Petitions.\nWPST-99295-2020.doc 2] Parties to the Petition and nature of challenge in main proceedings of which transfer is sought are also identical. 3] In view of above, by consent, both these Petitions are heard together and disposed of by this common order. \n4] For the sake of convenience, facts in Writ Petition (St) No.99295 of 2020 are taken into account. \n5] Petitioners initiated proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act in the Court of District Judge, Pune questioning the interim Arbitration Award dated 12/2/2020. Alongwith the said proceedings, Petitioner filed pursis dated 8/7/2020 stating that the said application under Section 34 is not commercial proceedings. Considering the nature of challenge raised under Section 34 another Application under Section 24 of the C.P.C. being Application No.500 of 2020 came to be moved before the learned Principal District Judge with a prayer that the proceedings preferred under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act be transferred from the file of 8th District Judge to WPST-99295-2020.doc Commercial Court at district level in Pune. After resistance by the Respondents, vide order impugned dated 4/12/2020, said prayer was rejected by the learned Principal District Judge. As such, this Writ Petition. \n6] Mr. Anturkar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Petitioners would urge that provisions of Section 24 of C.P.C., particularly sub-sections (1), (3) and (5) provide that the Court of learned District Judge is subordinate to Principal District Judge. He would rely on the judgment of this Court in the matter of D.M. Corporation Pvt Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra and others reported in 2018(4) Mh.L.J. 457 so as to substantiate his contention that nature of dispute in the present proceedings is commercial dispute within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\" for the sake of brevity) and as such Commercial Court alone will have jurisdiction to entertain the proceedings.\n7] According to him, court below has failed to exercise jurisdiction and that being so, case for interference is made out.\nWPST-99295-2020.doc 8 ] Mr. Gorwadkar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 would urge that the learned Principal District Judge rejected the prayer under Section 24 of the C.P.C. seeking transfer of the proceedings, particularly when there is scope to disagree with the submission about existence of commercial dispute. As such, according to him, Petitions are liable to be dismissed. 9] I have appreciated aforesaid rival contentions. 10] Parties to the Petition are family members and also partners in around four Firms which are into real estate development business. In view of differences inter se in the capacity of partners of Firms, in 2012 a Mediator was appointed to resolve the dispute. 11] Since the mediation failed, a recourse was taken to arbitration proceedings and an interim award came to be passed on 12/2/2020 in which directions are issued in regard to the amount to be shared between the  parties in their capacity as partners of the Firms . On 16/3/2020, final award came to be passed wherein dispute in relation WPST-99295-2020.doc to management of the Firms, its assets and Accounts came to be adjudicated. \n12] The fact remains that Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is relating to domestic, international commercial arbitration and also provides for enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. In case of domestic arbitration, under the same Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, the \"Court\" is defined to mean \"the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district\". The said definition is not inclusive. \n13] In 2018, Commercial Courts Act underwent amendment wherein under Section 2(1)(b), \"Commercial Court\" is defined to mean the Commercial Court constituted under sub-section (1) of Section 3. The said amendment permits State Government to constitute Commercial Courts at district level also. Sub-section (3) of Section 3 enables constitution of Commercial Court at the level of District Judge or below to that level and as per Amended Section 3A Commercial Appellate Court at District Judge level. Section 6 defines jurisdiction and Section 10 deals with jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters. \nWPST-99295-2020.doc 14] Section 11 provides for bar of jurisdiction of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions. Inherent lack of jurisdiction of Civil Court is equally made applicable to the Commercial Court. The Commercial Court substitutes Civil Court in the matter of jurisdiction to be exercised in the case of commercial dispute, as appears to be legislative intent. As at District Court level even Commercial Appellate Court are constituted by 2018 Amendment which powers are to be exercised based on pecuniary jurisdiction, appeal therefrom lies to the Commercial Appellate Court. The legislative object is to provide speedy remedy. \n15] Following provisions of the Act are required to be appreciated. Section 2(c) of the Act defines \"commercial dispute\" whereas Section 2(i) defines \"Specified Value\". It further makes reference to Section 12 of the Act. Section 12 provides for determination of Specified Value. Sub-clause (c) of Section 12 in my opinion is relevant for the case in hand. In case where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to immovable property or to a right therein, the market value of the immovable property, as on the date of filing of the WPST-99295-2020.doc suit, appeal or application is required to be taken into account for determining Specified Value. \n16] Sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the said Act provides for jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters. In case if arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, application or appeal arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 which ordinarily lie before principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a District (not being a High Court) is required to be heard and disposed of by Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial Court has been constituted. \n17] With the assistance of respective Senior Counsels, I have perused the final award which is a subject matter of challenge under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. Admittedly, the Award deals with commercial dispute in between the parties to the present Petition as could be apparent from adjudication reflected therein. The said Award is a subject matter of challenge under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and the Petitioner who initially opted WPST-99295-2020.doc for dealing with the said application as arbitration application. Petitioner at that point of time has not opted for invoking jurisdiction under sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act to try the same as commercial dispute. \n18] Once it can be inferred under Section 2 sub-clause (i) read with Section 12 that there exists a commercial dispute with Specified Value above  3 lakhs then the provisions of Commercial Courts Act are applicable. It is required to be noted that commercial dispute as defined under the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act covers dispute arising out of agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively for trade or commerce, partnership agreements etc. As such, having regard to nature of dispute and claim therein it can be inferred that there exists a commercial dispute in between the parties to the present proceedings. Once it is inferred that there exists a commercial dispute between the parties, provisions of sub-section (3) of Section 10 as regards jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters is attracted. As such, Mr. Anturkar was justified in claiming that there exists a commercial dispute of Specified Value and same is required to be decided in accordance with the procedure laid down under sub- WPST-99295-2020.doc section (3) of Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act. 19] There is one more facet to the matter i.e. admittedly proceedings are arising out of the Arbitration Award and that being so, from the contents of the Award, it can be inferred that commercial dispute of Specified Value of more than  3 lakhs exists between the parties. 20] In the aforesaid backdrop, once having held that there exists a commercial dispute of Specified Value which is arising out of arbitration proceedings, the application preferred by the Petitioner has to be treated to be one under the provisions of sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the Act. \n21] Once it is held that nature of proceedings is commercial dispute with a Specified Value and Section 10 sub-section (3) provides for jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matter, the proceedings at the behest of the Petitioner under Section 34 will lie before the Commercial Court in accordance with the said provision. Merely because Petitioner has filed an application thereby praying for treating the application to be one under Section 34 of the Arbitration and WPST-99295-2020.doc Conciliation Act will not operate as an embargo or rider on the right of the Petitioner to claim trying of the said proceedings questioning the Award passed under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act as arbitration matter under sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the Act. 22] As such, it can be noticed that Commercial Court Act is a later legislative enactment which operates in tandum with Arbitration Act with the aim to achieve speedy adjudication. \n23] Considering the very scheme of these Statutes, the applications under Arbitration Act are required to be lodged and entertained by Commercial Court. \n24] That being so, in my opinion, learned District Judge has every power under Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code to transfer the proceedings to the Commercial Court for dealing with the same in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of the Act and the principle of estoppel will not come in the way of the Petitioner as same will not operate against the law.\nWPST-99295-2020.doc 25] Of course, from the aforesaid it can be inferred that inherent jurisdiction is vested in the Court under the provisions of Section 10 of the Act based on the subject matter of the dispute, as prima facie it appears that it is the Commercial Court which will have jurisdiction over it. Atleast it is not demonstrated as to why proceedings cannot be covered within the meaning of \"commercial dispute\" at this stage. However, aforesaid findings are required to be termed as prima facie in nature and the Respondents have every right to raise the issue of absence of any commercial dispute if they so desire as they have disputed the same before this Court and this Court is required to appreciate the contentions canvassed by the parties in the light of the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. \n26] As such, for the aforesaid reasons, in my opinion, both the Writ Petitions need to be allowed and are allowed in terms of payer clauses (a) and (b).\n( NITIN W.

(open court) 1. the south delhi municipal corporation (hereafter \"sdmc\") appeals an order of the learned single judge which directed it to deposit 50% of the awarded amount; even whilst directing the final hearing of its petition under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. it is also contended that this direction could not have been made when the application preferred by the sdmc for stay of the award was pending. 2. the respondent's threshold contention was that the appeal is per se not maintainable in view of the phraseology of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015. in answer, mr. sanjay poddar, learned senior counsel urges on behalf of sdmc that the impugned order in all intents and purposes amounts to an attachment before judgment, as the awarded amount is directed to be secured, and is therefore covered by provisions of order xxxviii rule 2 of code of civil procedure (c.p.c.). it is further submitted that such order is appealable by virtue of section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, 2015 (hereafter \"the cc act\") read with order xliii rule 1(q) of the cpc, given that the mandate of section 36 of the act, cpc applies to proceedings under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the arbitration act\"). 3. it was lastly contended by mr. poddar, that except order xxxviii rule 2 of cpc, there is no provision enabling the court, much less one enforcing the award, to direct deposit of amounts by way of security and that consequentially the impugned order is traceable to order xxxviii and therefore appealable under order xliii rule 1(q). 4. mr. sandeep sethi, learned senior counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, urges that there is no merit in the sdmc's argument with respect to maintainability. he points out that order xliii alludes to an order or direction under order xxxviii of cpc which presupposes the pendency of a suit. it is furthermore highlighted that section 36 of the arbitration act only refers to the procedure outlined in the code with respect to proceedings for enforcement under the arbitration act, 1996 and that the principal objective of the cc act, 2015 was to eliminate all interlocutory appeals, except those provided for. he also cited the supreme court judgment in kandla export corporation & anr. vs. m/s. oci corporation & anr., (2018) 14 scc 715. 5. the relevant provision of commercial courts act, 2015 are as follows: \"8. bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order.--notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the commercial court. **************** *********** 11. bar of jurisdiction of commercial courts and commercial divisions. notwithstanding anything contained in this act, a commercial court or a commercial division shall not entertain or decide any suit, application or proceedings relating to any commercial dispute in respect of which the jurisdiction of the civil court is either expressly or impliedly barred under any other law for the time being in force. **************** *********** 13. appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions. (1) any person aggrieved by the decision of the commercial court or commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order, as the case may be: provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act. **************** *********** 21. act to have overriding effect. save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than this act.\" 6. a conjoint reading of the provisions especially section 8, 11 and 21 of the cc act, highlight the parliamentary intention to vest commercial courts and commercial appellate divisions with only limited jurisdiction. flowing from that, the scheme of section 13 of the commercial courts act, provides only two types of appeals; (1) in respect of specific matters enumerated in order xliii rule 1 (read with section 104) of the cpc and (2) appeals that are admissible under section 37 of the arbitration act. 7. the judgment in kandla export corporation (supra) noticed the statement of objects and reasons, of the commercial courts act. the supreme court had to deal with an enforcement appeal before a commercial appellate court, in regard to a foreign award, and its maintainability. the supreme court noticed not only the statement of objects and reasons but also various other provisions, especially the embargo placed upon the courts, embodied in sections 8 and 11 and the overriding nature of the cc act, to conclude that once appeals were held to be barred, an appeal to the division bench appeal against a commercial court's order in an enforcement of a foreign award issue was not maintainable. the court took into account its previous rulings in fuerst day lawson limited vs. jindal exports limited, (2011) 8 scc 333 and some other judgments. 8. the statement of objects and reasons for the commercial courts act, states that: \"the proposal to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes has been under consideration of the government for quite some time. the high value commercial disputes involve complex facts and questions of law. therefore, there is a need to provide for an independent mechanism for their early resolution. early resolution of commercial disputes shall create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive indian legal system. xxx 6. it is proposed to introduce the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts bill, 2015 to replace the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts ordinance, 2015 which inter alia, provides for the following namely:-(i) constitution of the commercial courts at district level except for the territory over which any high court is having ordinary original civil jurisdiction; (ii) constitution of the commercial divisions in those high courts which are already exercising ordinary civil jurisdiction and they shall have territorial jurisdiction over such areas on which it has original jurisdiction; (iii) constitution of the commercial appellate division in all the high courts to hear the appeals against the orders of the commercial courts and the orders of the commercial division of the high court; (iv) the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of such commercial courts and commercial division is proposed as one crore rupees; and (v) to amend the code of civil procedure, 1908 as applicable to the commercial courts and commercial divisions which shall prevail over the existing high courts rules and other provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. 7. the proposed bill shall accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the indian justice delivery system, and the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation.\" 9. it is quite evident that the legislative or parliamentary intent, was to confer upon the commercial appellate courts and commercial appellate division bench of a high court, extremely limited jurisdiction and circumscribe the appellate jurisdiction. thus, in interlocutory matters, as it were, commercial appellate division possesses jurisdiction in matters enumerated in the order xliii rule 1 no less no more. likewise, with respect to the appeals against orders made in the course of proceedings under the arbitration act, the court's power is delineated to what is enumerated in section 37 of cpc. 10. in kandla export corporation (supra), the court held as follows: \"14. section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, with which we are immediately concerned in these appeals, is in two parts. the main provision is, as has been correctly submitted by shri giri, a provision which provides for appeals from judgments, orders and decrees of the commercial division of the high court. to this main provision, an exception is carved out by the proviso. the primary purpose of a proviso is to qualify the generality of the main part by providing an exception, which has been set out with great felicity in cit v indo mercantile bank ltd, 1959 supp (2) scr 256 at 266-267, thus: ******** ********* 15. the proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by the commercial division of the high court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure code, 1908, and section 37 section 37 of the arbitration act. it will at once be noticed that orders that are not specifically enumerated under order xliii of the cpc would, therefore, not be appealable, and appeals that are mentioned in section 37 of the arbitration act alone are appeals that can be made to the commercial appellate division of a high court. 16. thus, an order which refers parties to arbitration under section 8, not being appealable under section 37 (1) (a), would not be appealable under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. similarly, an appeal rejecting a plea referred to in sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 16 of the arbitration act would equally not be appealable under section 37 (2) (a) and, therefore, under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act.\" 11. the reference to order xliii rule 1 relied upon on behalf of sdmc in the context of this case, in the opinion of this court, is misplaced. order xliii rule 1(q), upon which considerable emphasis was placed to say that the appeals against directions to secure amounts during pendency of proceedings applies to suits and suits alone (as is evident from order xxxviii and all the attendant provisions), and not to proceedings in respect of an award. thus, reference to order xliii to \"draw in\" the jurisdiction of the division bench, is wholly unjustified. likewise, the court also rejects the appellant's arguments that section 36 of the arbitration act attracts the provisions of the code of civil procedure. in fact, section 36 refers to and directs courts to follow cpc in proceedings relating to enforcement of arbitral awards. the logical corollary is that the provisions of the cpc that deal with the proceeding for enforcement of decrees and orders (such as in execution like order xxi cpc), would be attracted. 12. in view of the above discussions, we conclude that the present appeal is not maintainable. the appellant's remedy clearly lies elsewhere. an attempt was made to urge that no litigant can be deprived of remedy if there is a grievance: ubi jus ibi remedium; however, that argument is wholly without substance because an appeal, it has been repeatedly emphasised, is a specific creation of statute and cannot be claimed as a matter of right. this was explained pithily in ganga bai v vijay kumar, (1974) 2 scc 393, in the following terms: \"there is a basic distinction between the right of suit and the right of appeal. there is an inherent right in every person to bring suit of a civil nature and unless the suit is barred by statute one may, at one's peril, bring a suit of one's choice. it is no answer to a suit howsoever frivolous the claim, that the law confers no such right to sue. a suit for its maintainability requires no authority of law and it is enough that no statute bars the suit. but the position in regard to appeals is quite the opposite. the right of appeal inheres in no one and therefore an appeal for its maintainability must have the clear authority of law. that explains why the right of appeal is described as a creature of statute.\" 13. in view of the above discussion, it is held that the present appeal is plainly not maintainable by virtue of provisions of the commercial courts act, 2015; the appeal is therefore dismissed. no costs. s. ravindra bhat, j prateek jalan, j february 12, 2019 pkb"
