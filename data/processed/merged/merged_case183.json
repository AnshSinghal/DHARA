Admittedly, the possession of the land was handed over to the plaintiff company on 01.02.2007 and in terms of the lease deed the plaintiff company has to complete the construction within five years from the actual date of possession i.e. 01.02.2007 and further to pay the defendant authority in terms of the instalments fixed in the lease deed. Once the plaintiff company failed to comply with the aforesaid conditions then the defendant authority issued notices to the plaintiff company on 19.12.2013, 26.02.2014, 17.06.2020 and 14.07.2020 but the said notices were not responded by the plaintiff company. Finally, the defendant authority vide order dated 07.01.2021 had cancelled the lease deed executed in favour of the plaintiff company. \n8. Thereafter, the plaintiff-company had filed a Writ C No.13225 of 2021 (M/s Pathik Software Education Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of UP and 2 others) before this Court assailing the validity of the order dated 07.01.2021. However, the writ petition was dismissed on 27.7.2021 as withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh with better particulars. Meanwhile, the defendant authority had proceeded to make allotment of the plot in question in favour of M/s Innova AM Tech LLP, which is defendant no.2 in the suit, referred as defendant company3.\n9. The plaintiff company instituted a suit under the Commercial Courts Act registered as C.S. (Comm) No.167 of 2021 (M/s Pathik Software Education Pvt. Ltd. vs. CEO New Okhla Industrial Development Authority and others) in the Commercial Court, Gautam Budh Nagar seeking following reliefs:-\n\" 19 .          -\n.     ,   1    30,  2100 ,  142,                07/01/2021           1                     .         1  3         30,  2100 ,  142,          2         1  2            30,  2100 ,  142,                              \n.          \n.               \"\n10. The defendant authority had filed objections on 25.08.2021 under Order XXXIX Rule 1 & 2 of C.P.C. and taken specific stand that the Commercial Court had no jurisdiction to try and decide the suit because the provisions of the Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C. are applicable. Section 2 (1) (b) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 defines the meaning of \"Commercial Court\" and sub-section (1) (c) of Section 2 defines the meaning of \"Commercial Dispute\", wherein every category of the commercial disputes has been defined but nowhere such type of material is available, which co-relates to the present dispute under the suit. Therefore, the present suit of the plaintiff company is barred by the provisions of Section 9 of C.P.C.. The defendant authority has also taken an objection that the civil suit is barred by the provisions of Sections 34, 38 & 41 of Specific Relief Act. The suit of the plaintiff company is also barred by the provisions of Section 12A of Commercial Court Act, 2015. \n11. The defendant authority had also filed detailed written statement (WS) on 04.09.2021 and resisted the suit contending that before cancelling the plot in question the defendant authority sent letters/notices dated 19.12.2013, 26.02.2014, 17.06.2020 and 14.07.2020 to the plaintiff company at the available address and the address given by the plaintiff company in the lease deed but the notice dated 17.06.2020 was returned back with the remarks \"Bina Pata Bataye Chhod Gaye\" (left without giving the address). Therefore, it was incorrect that the plaintiff company had not received the letters. The objection was also taken that at both the addresses i.e. of the address of the company and also at the address of the Director, the letter dated 07.01.2021 was served to the plaintiff company and also the Director of the company. \n12. The plot was duly allotted in favour of the plaintiff company on 17.02.2006 @ Rs.3700/- per sq. meters and the location charges @ 2% were also added. Accordingly, the premium rate was charged @ Rs.3774/- per Sq. meters only and within 30 days from the date of allotment letter, the plaintiff company had to deposit 30% amount of the total premium, which was to the tune of Rs.18,35,755/- including one year lease rent of Rs.1,98,135/- and the balance amount of 70% of the total premium alongwith interest @ 11% was to be paid in instalments by the plaintiff company. After allotment, the lease deed was executed on 19.01.2007 and the possession of the plot in question was also handed over to the plaintiff company on 01.02.2007. While filing the written statement, specific objection was also taken to the effect that the plaintiff company had incorrectly stated that he had deposited total premium but in fact, the plaintiff company had never deposited the balance amount of the lease rent against the plot in question. Once the terms and conditions of the lease deed had been flouted by the plaintiff company and it failed to clear the outstanding amount then the defendant authority served the demand notice dated 26.02.2014 to pay the amount of Rs.1.12 crores upto 15.03.2014. Thereafter, another letter was served on 17.06.2020 to pay the amount of Rs.1,69,00,000/- within 15 days from the receipt of the letter but the said letter was returned back with the aforementioned remarks. When the plaintiff company did not pay the outstanding amount, the defendant authority issued a demand notice on 14.07.2020 to pay Rs.1,69,00,000/- within seven days. It is also claimed that the defendant authority had issued a demand notice on 13.12.2019 for Rs.2,69,78,938/- but subsequently, through another demand notice dated 03.02.2020 the amount to the tune of Rs.50,00,000/- was adjusted, which was already deposited by the plaintiff company on 16.05.2015 and accordingly, amended demand notice was served. Before cancelling the lease deed of the plot in question the defendant authority had sent various show cause notices but inspite of the repeated notices the plaintiff company did not respond to the notice, and neither deposited the amount in question nor raised any construction over the plot in question and further not obtained completion certificate after raising the construction within five years from the actual date of possession, which all were mandatory as per the lease deed. Therefore, the said act was in violation of Clause 13 (A) of the lease deed and accordingly, the defendant authority had cancelled the allotment on 07.01.2021 and taken back the possession of the plot in question on 18.02.2021. Thereafter, the same was allotted to the defendant company on 17.06.2021 under \"Institutional Plots Scheme OES 2020-2021\" and the defendant company had deposited the sale consideration. \n13. In the suit proceeding the defendant company had also filed written statement stating therein that the defendant company is engaged in the business of IT Software Products and Services. It applied for allotment of an institutional plot and made a pre-deposit of Rs.31,14,300/- as required in the public notice dated 22.02.2021. Thereafter, the defendant authority decided to allot the plot in question vide allotment letter dated 17.06.2021 and as per the terms of the allotment, the defendant authority was required to make a further payment of 30% of the total value of the plot, amounting to Rs.1,11,49,194/-, which was deposited by the defendant company on 22.06.2021. Thus, the defendant company has made payment of Rs.1,42,63,494/-. The defendant company has not only made the payment of huge amount to the defendant authority but it is also holding the balance payment of Rs.2,13,95,241/-, which is payable to defendant authority in respect of the plot. Total cost of the project is more than Rs.37 crores and the defendant company has already arranged the said amount but till date on account of the pendency of the said proceeding, it cannot utilise the said amount for any other purpose. \n14. The defendant company took an objection in written statement that admittedly, the plaintiff company has breached the terms of the lease deed dated 19.01.2007 and it had neither paid the balance amount nor had commenced the construction on the plot within the stipulated period of five years. Further the plaintiff company had not sought any extension of time for completion of the construction. As per lease deed dated 19.01.2007 the maximum period of time for completing the construction including two year's extension was seven years, which had already expired in the year 2014 and consequently, the lease deed dated 29.01.2007 was cancelled by the defendant authority. The plaintiff company made a default in payment of instalments under the lease deed dated 19.01.2007 and as such, it was not entitled to any relief from the Commercial Court. The defendant company had also obtained the balance sheets of the plaintiff company for the years 2015-2019 from the 'Ministry of Corporate Affairs', which indicated that the plaintiff company was an inactive, shell company and it has no business operations, no turnover and nil income. The amount of Rs.1,00,78,716/- paid to the defendant authority was reflected in its balance sheet as long term unsecured loans taken by the plaintiff company. The plaintiff company did not has any money, whatsoever, to either make the balance payment due to the defendant authority qua the plot in question or to make the construction on the plot in terms of the lease deed. It was also averred in the written statement that the allotment of an institutional plot was made to business entities by defendant authority on the concessional rate to promote business and employment. The plaintiff company with no operations, nil turnover and no business record whatsoever, was neither legally nor morally entitled to the benefit of the allotment of the said plot. The plaintiff company was only incorporated on 19.12.2005 just to procure the lease rights of the said plot. \n15. The Commercial Court, after exchange of the affidavits and pleadings, had framed three issues namely (i) jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the present matter; (ii) application under Order 13A CPC and (iii) application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC. Firstly, the Commercial Court had proceeded to deal with the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the suit (issue no.i) and found that admittedly \"Memorandum of Article of Association\" of the plaintiff company stated that it was a company formed for earning profits and further the lease deed was executed by the defendant authority in favour of the plaintiff company in the institutional area. Again the plaintiff company was incorporated with an intention to earn profits by conducting business of computer/software training institute. The Commercial Court had also taken note of the fact that the plaintiff company was a registered company under the Companies Act, 1956 and works for gain and profit. The terms of the lease deed, which was executed between the parties, speaks of development of suit property as computer/software institute etc. for its gains/profits. The lease deed was also executed between the parties, which was itself a contract between the parties and the allegation of the plaintiff company against the defendant authority was breach and violation of the terms of the said lease deed i.e. contract. Therefore, as there was breach of contract the Commercial Court had every jurisdiction to entertain the matter as there was a commercial dispute. Therefore, the dispute fell within the ambit of Section 2 (1) (c) (vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The Commercial Court held that the present dispute between the parties is undoubtedly a commercial dispute in terms of Section 2 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and thus, the Commercial Court has jurisdiction to decide the dispute. \n16. So far as the second issue with regard to the application of the defendant company under Order XIIIA of the CPC was concerned, the Commercial Court found that in the present case, the only dispute raised by the plaintiff company was that the plaintiff company was not served with the demand notice and subsequent cancellation notice as per the terms of the lease deed resulting in cancellation of the land in question and the plaintiff company had defaulted in making payments to the defendant authority as per the terms of the lease deed. The Commercial Court found that as there was dispute with regard to the payment, non-payment, sending of notice/non-sending of notice at various addresses of the plaintiff company and all other relevant issues in the present dispute were already on record, therefore, no evidence was required to be adduced. The Commercial Court had proceeded to decide the actual dispute based upon the pleadings of the parties and official record filed by the defendant authority before the Court. It also opined that only dispute between the parties were that the plaintiff claimed non-receipt of payment notice on its registered office as per lease deed and the defendant's plea was regarding non-payment of dues and non-construction of the building on the leased premises as per lease deed. The Commercial Court further found that the defendant company had no substantial right against the plaintiff company. There is no contract between the plaintiff company and the defendant company and only rights of the defendant company was against the defendant authority. Since there was no dispute with regard to the relevant facts between the parties and thus, the Commercial Court was of the opinion that the suit be decided summarily under Order XIII of the CPC. \n17. Thereafter, the Commercial Court had proceeded to discuss the case on its merits qua service of notice, non-payment of dues/non-constructions on the leased land property and the relevant law and found that admittedly, the aforesaid lease deed was executed between the plaintiff company and the defendant authority on 19.01.2007, wherein rights and obligations of the parties were clearly mentioned. The lease deed is a complete contract between the plaintiff company and the defendant authority. As per the terms of the lease deed the plaintiff company was to make the entire payment of the consideration amount to the defendant authority within the stipulated period and in case of default the plaintiff company was liable to pay interest to the defendant authority @ 14% and allotment was also liable to be cancelled as per Clause-2 of the allotment letter dated 17.02.2006. As per the lease deed dated 19.01.2007 the entire consideration amount was to be paid by 16.02.2014, out of which Rs.23,77,620/- was paid at the time of execution of the lease deed and the remaining amount of Rs.55,47,780/- plus interest was to be paid in 16 equal half yearly instalments of Rs.3,46,737/- plus interest. In case of default the plaintiff company was required to pay 14% interest compounded half yearly on the defaulted amount instead of 11% within the time period i.e. upto 16.02.2014. The plaintiff company was to complete the construction at the site within five years from the date of actual possession and in case of non-compliance of the construction, the allotment was liable to be cancelled. \n18. The Commercial Court found that purported notices dated 30.06.2020 and 14.07.2020 were sent to the plaintiff company, wherein a demand of Rs.1,69,00,000/- was raised against the plaintiff company and these dues included interest for non-payment of amount and penalty for non-construction on the suit property from the year 2013. As per record of the defendant authority, the amount due till 31.12.2020 was of Rs.1,96,10,802/- which included an amount of Rs.25,09,710/- for non-construction and the defendant authority had extended the time of construction on payment of extension charges. The Commercial Court further found that the demand notices dated 17.06.2020 and 14.07.2020 were not received by the plaintiff company and they were returned back with the endorsement \"left without giving the address\". The Court found that both the notices dated 17.06.2020 and 14.07.2020 were sent only at the residential address of one of the Directors of the plaintiff company and no notice was sent at the registered office of the plaintiff company at E-52, Pandav Nagar, Delhi-110092. In the lease deed between the plaintiff company and the defendant authority, the registered office of the plaintiff company was shown as E-52, Pandav Nagar, Delhi - 110092 and the residential address of one of the Director Smt. Brijesh Singh was shown as E-292A, Sector 22, Noida, U.P. It was also alleged that the cancellation notice of the plot was sent at both the addresses i.e. registered address - E-52, Pandav Nagar, Delhi - 110092 and E-292A, Sector 22, Noida, District Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P.. From the aforesaid facts, the Commercial Court opined that the demand notices dated 17.06.2020 and 14.07.2020 were not sent at the registered office of the plaintiff company but were rather sent at the residential address of one of it's Director, which was in breach of Section 43 of U.P. Urban Planning and Development Act, 19734.\n19. The Commercial Court further found that the cancellation notice dated 07.01.2021 was sent to both the addresses of the plaintiff company i.e. registered office and residential address of one of the Director of the plaintiff company and thus, it cannot be said by the defendant authority that the demand notice was not required to be sent at the registered office or the demand notice was duly served as per Section 43 of the Act, 1973. The Court further observed that the cancellation notice was sent to the plaintiff company at both the addresses but the demand notice was sent at the residential address of one of the Director of the Company and it was not sent at the registered address of the plaintiff company. There was breach on the part of the plaintiff company in adhering to the terms of the lease deed. However, the aforesaid breach was condonable and the defendant authority itself condoned this breach by raising a demand to the tune of Rs.1,69,00,000/- which included the penalty for non-construction on the plot and the interest on the late payment. The Commercial Court held that the defendant authority had the power to cancel the lease deed but it was not exercised as per the terms of the lease deed and thus, the cancellation notice dated 07.01.2021 was found to be in violation of terms of the contract between the parties and consequently, all subsequent actions were unsustainable. After considering the evidence, the Commercial Court by judgment and decree dated 28.3.2022 decreed aforesaid Suit (Comm) No.167 of 2021 with following directions:-\n\"i) Cancellation notice dated 07.01.2021 cancelling the lease deed dated 19.01.2007 of land bearing Plot No.30, measuring 2100 sq. mtrs. Situated at Sector 142 Noida Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P. by New Okhla Industrial Development authority, is declared null and void and hence set aside;\nii) all consequential actions subsequent to the aforesaid cancellation notice dated 07.01.2021 are also declared as null and void;\niii) Defendant No.1 is directed to issue fresh demand notice for recovery of pending dues/penalties against the plaintiff upto 31.03.2022 within 15 days from the date of the judgment. It is clarified that all benefits (waivers on penalty, interest etc.) which are available to the other allottees similar to the plaintiff shall also be given to the plaintiff as per rules of the authority;\niv) the plaintiff is at liberty to pay the aforesaid amount within 30 days from the receipt of demand notice as mentioned in para (iii) above. It is clarified that in case the plaintiff fails to make the payment of entire dues of the Defendant No.1 within 30 days the Defendant No.1 shall be at liberty to take action as per the terms of the lease deed;\nv) the Defendant No.2 is at liberty to avail all its contractual rights against the Defendant No.1 (including re-allotment/refund with interest etc.) and this judgement is not affecting any legal right of the Defendant No.2 against Defendant No.1;\nvi) all pending applications including application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC etc. stand disposed of in the light of above order.\nvii) no order as to cost.\"\n20. Sri Kaushalendra Nath Singh, learned counsel for the defendant authority submitted in support of First Appeal Defective No.218 of 2022 that the category of commercial disputes, which are in jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, are enumerated in the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Admittedly, the plaintiff company did not commence any construction on the plot in question within stipulated period of five years and further the plaintiff company had not sought extension of time for constructions in terms of Clause 13B and 13C of the lease deed. The plaintiff company failed to adhere the payment schedule contained in Clause-1 of the lease deed dated 19.01.2007 and made default in payment as per the lease deed, despite receipt of show cause notices dated 19.12.2013 and 26.02.2014 from the defendant authority. The plaintiff company had not made any sincere efforts to comply with the terms of the lease deed dated 19.01.2007. Even though the land was free from any encroachment and possession was also handed over to the plaintiff company but the plaintiff company failed to comply its obligations by not paying the future instalments, and not starting the business within the stipulated time for which the plot was allotted at a consessional rate. The plaintiff company did not seek extention of time, they had virtually abandoned the project. Ultimately, the defendant authority had no other option except to cancel the allotment made in favour of the plaintiff company in terms of Clause 13 of the lease deed and the plot was re- allotted to the defendant company on 17.06.2021. The plaintiff company did not dispute receipt of the show cause notice dated 19.12.2013 sent by the defendant authority seeking an explanation for failure to raise constructions on the demised plot within the time stipulated in the lease deed. \n21. Learned counsel drew attention to the relief sought in the suit and submitted that the suit of the plaintiff company was valued at Rs.80 lakhs whereas, the valuation of the plot was much higher. As such, the suit filed by the plaintiff company was undervalued and the court fees paid was insufficient. The valuation of a suit has to be in accordance with the Court Fees Act, even if the relief pertains to a right in immovable property. There is no provision in the lease deed, which mandates service of prior notice upon the lessee (plaintiff company) prior to cancellation/termination of the lease deed. The Commercial Court illegally concluded that the demand notices were not sent on the registered address of the plaintiff company and as such, the cancellation of the lease deed was without requisite notice as mentioned in sub-clause (vi) of Clause 26 of the lease deed. Sub-clause (vi) of clause 26 of the lease deed was not at all attracted to the case at hand inasmuch as the allotment made in favour of the plaintiff company was cancelled in terms of Clause 13B and 13C of the lease deed. Under the lease deed the defendant authority was not required to send a notice prior to cancellation of the allotment. The notice was sent to the Director of the plaintiff company at E-292A, Sector-22, NOIDA, which was the address for all correspondence by the plaintiff company. There was sufficient compliance of the provisions of Section 43 of the Act, 1973. The plaintiff company was using the aforesaid address as its place of business from the date of application for allotment of the land in question till the date of last payment by the plaintiff company. In the plaint the only case set up by the plaintiff company to challenge the cancellation of lease deed was that the notices dated 13.12.2019, 03.02.2020, 17.06.2020 and 14.07.2020 were not sent to the registered address of the plaintiff company and the same were sent to E-292A, Sector-22, NOIDA. The Commercial Court had erred in law in concluding that the lease deed was cancelled without serving the requisite notice. \n22. Learned counsel for the defendant authority submitted that the plaintiff company had challenged the notice dated 07.01.2021 in Writ C No.13115 of 2021 and the same was dismissed as withdrawn. The suit was not maintainable and the Commercial Court had no jurisdiction to decide the same as per Order VII Rule 11 of CPC. Section 2 (1) (b) of Commercial Court Act, 2015 defines the meaning of \"Commercial Court\" constituted under sub-section (1) of Section 3. Further under Section 2 (1) (c) the meaning of Commercial Dispute is defined. Every category of the commercial disputes has been defined but, nowhere, such type of claim is available, which co-relates to the present dispute under the suit. Therefore, the present suit of the plaintiff is barred by the provisions of Section 9 of CPC. The Commercial Court failed to consider that the plaintiff company has become a victim of its own wrongs and there is no law or grounds to save the illegal interests of the plaintiff. The Commercial Court also failed to realize that the suit was barred by the provisions of Sections 34, 38 and 41 (e) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and further the suit was barred by the provisions of Section 12A of Commercial Court Act, 2015.\n23. Sri Kaushalendra Nath Singh further submitted that the lease deed did not contain any provision for issuance of notice before cancellation in case of breach of the lease deed by the plaintiff company, it was an admitted fact that the show cause notices were sent to the plaintiff company in the years 2013 and 2014, which were duly received by the plaintiff company, address was allegedly changed only in the year 2015. Despite receipt of these notices, the plaintiff-company did not take any concrete steps to rectify the breaches or even asked for further time for carrying out construction. The Commercial Court erred in law in not appreciating this aspect of the matter and further committed procedural illegality in deciding the application (42-Ga) under Order 13A CPC and interim injunction application (6GA) under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC alongwith the suit itself vide the impugned judgement. The Commercial Court further exceeded its jurisdiction in directing the defendant authority to provide to the plaintiff company \"all benefits (waiver of penalty, interest etc.) which are available to the other allottees\", while raising fresh demand for recovery of pending dues/penalties. Section 2 (1) (c) (vii) of Commercial Courts Act, 2015 will come into play only if the lease deed is relating to immovable property 'used' exclusively in trade or commerce. Referring to the terms of lease deed and the averments made in the plaint, it was submitted that the land was given on lease for conducting business, which was yet to commence and therefore, the lease deed was not one relating to property 'being used' for trade or commerce, but property 'to be used' for such purpose. In support of his submission, he had placed reliance on the judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd. vs. K.S. Infraspace LLP & another5.\n24. Sri Shashi Nandan, learned Senior Advocate assisted by Ms. Shreya Gupta, Advocate for defendant company has made detailed submissions referring to the documents to contend that the plaintiff company has not adhered to the payment schedule contained in Clause-1 of the lease deed and has defaulted in the payment of the dues payable under the lease deed despite receipt of show cause notices dated 19.12.2013 and 26.02.2014 sent by the defendant authority. Admittedly, the plaintiff had not completed the construction or obtained completion certificate after raising the construction within five years of from the actual date of possession. Neither the plaintiff company sought any extension of time for construction nor paid 4% extension charges in terms of Clause 13-B & C of the lease deed. The defendant authority was well within its rights to have cancelled the lease deed in terms of Clauses 13-B and C of the lease deed. It was open to the defendant authority to re-enter the lease premises in case the same was not occupied and no building had been constructed thereon by the lessee (plaintiff company) and the plot could be re-allotted by the defendant authority under Clause 26-III of the lease deed. The plaintiff company has not disputed receipt of show cause notice dated 19.12.2013 sent by the defendant authority seeking an explanation for non-construction on the allotted plot within the stipulated time and further it did not offer any explanation whatsoever in the plaint filed before the Commercial Court as to what steps the plaintiff company took to seek further extension of time for construction. The plaintiff company received a show cause notice dated 26.02.2014 from the defendant authority demanding an amount of Rs.1,12,00,000/- by 15.03.2014 but the plaintiff deposited only Rs.50,00,000/- on 16.05.2015. The plaintiff failed to explain as to why it did not comply with the demand made vide the said notice and what steps the plaintiff took to remedy the breach and default after the receipt of notice dated 26.02.2014 from the defendant authority. At no point of time the plaintiff company had informed to the defendant authority regarding change of its address, viz E-292A, Sector 22, Noida. In fact, right from the date of application for allotment till the date of last payment, the plaintiff company was using the said address for all communication purposes, even the same address is mentioned in the recital of the lease deed. The plaintiff company had also mentioned the same very address to be its address even in the year 2021, when it had filed Writ C No.13225 of 2021 before this Court, which was dismissed as withdrawn.\n25. The learned Senior Advocate for the defendant company further submitted that the defendant company had filed a detailed written statement indicating, therein, that the defendant company had obtained the balance sheet of the plaintiff company for the years 2015-19 from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, wherein, the plaintiff company was infact shown as an inactive company, which has no business operations, no turnover and no income. The amount of Rs.1,00,78,716/- paid by the plaintiff company to the defendant authority in respect of the said plot was reflected in its balance sheet as long term unsecured loans taken by it. At the relevant point of time the plaintiff company did not have any money whatsoever to either make the balance payment due to the defendant authority or to make the construction on the plot as required under the terms of the lease deed. He submitted that the allotment of institutional plot at special rates was made to business entities by the defendant authority to promote business and employment in the Noida. However, the plaintiff company with no operations, nil turnover and no business, was neither legally nor morally entitled to benefit from such allotment. The plaintiff company was incorporated on 19.12.2005 before the process of bidding of the plot in question and it was formed only to procure the lease rights of the said plot at discounted allotment rates so as to later sell it at premium in the market. The defendant company has already invested a sum of Rs.1,42,63,494/- (Rs.1,11,49,194/- + Rs.31,14,300/-) for the plot in suit and the remaining payment, which is to be made upon execution of the lease deed, has been kept on hold by the authority. The project proposed to be implemented by the defendant company on the plot in question was worth more than Rs.37 crores and has potential of providing employment to hundreds of persons. The allotment was made by the defendant authority in favour of the defendant company upon perusal of the project report submitted by it. The averments in the written statement filed by the defendant company remained unrebutted by the plaintiff company and the Commercial Court did not take it into consideration and made observations that the defendant company has no substantial right against the plaintiff as there is no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendant company. \n26. Sri Shashi Nandan, learned Senior Advocate further submitted that before the Commercial Court, it was not the case of the plaintiff company that no breach of the terms of the lease deed was committed by it. The plaintiff company had challenged the cancellation of lease only on the ground that the purported notices were not sent at registered address of the plaintiff company office, rather sent at the place, which were already abandoned by the plaintiff company and further no notice was published or affixed. He submitted that the lease deed did not contain any such provision for issuance of notice before cancellation in case of breach by the lessee. It is an admitted fact that the show cause notices were sent to the plaintiff by the defendant authority as early as in 2013 and 2014, which were duly received by it whereas the plaintiff had claimed in para 11 of its plaint that its address changed only in 2015. Despite receipt of the said notices, the plaintiff company took no steps to rectify the breaches. The plaintiff relied upon the provision of Section 43 of the Act, 1973, which simply stipulates that any notice required to be sent to a company under the provisions of the Act, 1973, it may be sent at its registered office or its principal office or its place of business. The consistent use of the said address by the plaintiff itself in all its documents including the lease deed shows that the plaintiff projected the said address as its place of business and the provisions of the Act, 1973 do not provide for any prior notice to be sent to an allottee/lessee prior to cancellation and in case of breach of the terms of the lease deed, the notices were duly sent by the defendant authority to the plaintiff company at its place of business.\n27. Ms. Shreya Gupta, Advocate for the defendant company had also made detailed submissions and referred documents (written statement) filed by the defendant-authority to contend that the dispute raised in the suit is not a 'commercial dispute' as defined under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The plaintiff company was not using the property/land, which was earmarked for the purpose and admittedly, the construction was also not made within stipulated time in terms of the lease agreement. She further submitted that even purported claim of the plaintiff company is also contrary to record. Admittedly, the land involved was not being used for trade or commerce and even the plaintiff company had not sought for any extension of time for raising constructions for establishing unit or to use for commercial purpose. It was contended that the suit was filed seeking a declaration that the allotment of the plot in favour of the defendant company by the defendant authority may be declared as null and void. Further, the plaintiff company had sought a relief of permanent injunction restraining the defendant company and defendant authority from interfering in the possession of the plaintiff company. Further defendant authority may be restrained from executing the lease deed in respect of the plot in favour of the defendant company. The land was not used for trade or commerce and therefore, a suit in the said form could not be maintained before the Commercial Court. The Commercial Court had exceeded its jurisdiction in directing the defendant authority to raise a fresh demand for recovery of pending dues/penalties, by providing 'all benefits (waiver on penalty etc.) to the plaintiff company, which were available to other allottees'. In issuing such directions the Commercial Court granted relief numbers (iii), (iv) & (v), which were not even prayed for by the plaintiff company, therefore, the impugned judgement is nullity. She submitted that the impugned judgment and decree is untenable as the Commercial Court went further in granting to the plaintiff company the liberty to pay the amount to defendant authority within 30 days from the receipt of fresh demand notice. In doing so the Commercial Court had re-written the terms of the contract entered between the parties. The aforesaid indulgence granted to the plaintiff company was wholly illegal and unwarranted and renders the impugned judgement as nullity. She lastly submitted that the plaintiff company which was not only made default in payment but also made default in adhering the schedule for the construction and making the unit operational in terms of the lease deed, the cancellation of the lease by the defendant authority was entirely valid and legal. The plaintiff company was not at all entitled to receive such discretionary reliefs by the Commercial Court, which had patently acted not as a civil court but like a writ court exercising extra ordinary powers. The discretion was illegally exercised by the Commercial Court in favour of the plaintiff company and as such, the impugned judgement is liable to be set aside by this Court. In support of her submission, she had placed reliance on the judgement of Apex Court in Bachhaj Nahar vs. Nilima Mandal and another6 and Mrs. Akella Lalitha vs. Sri Konda Hanumantha Rao & another7.\n28. On the other hand, Sri Vishnu Gupta, learned Senior Advocate for the plaintiff company submitted that the plaintiff-company had not been served with the demand notice/show cause notice. The plaintiff company had changed its residential address after 16.05.2015 but the registered office of the plaintiff company remained at E-52, Pandav Nagar, Delhi. The defendant authority deliberately did not send the demand notice at the registered office of the plaintiff company which resulted in non-payment and subsequent cancellation of the lease deed of the plaintiff company. The plaintiff company had referred the resolution of the defendant authority dated 30.07.2019, wherein, it was resolved that all the allottees, who have not paid the lease amount should be served with notices and in case the notices are not served or received, the notices were required to be affixed at the correspondence address or to ensure the publication in newspaper via public notice. In the present case the demand notice was not sent to the registered office of the plaintiff company, which was mentioned in the lease deed and further no notice was published in the newspaper. Thereafter the plaintiff company filed the aforesaid suit seeking declaration of the cancellation notice dated 07.01.2021 as null and void and the possession of the suit property may not be taken from the plaintiff company wherein, an interim injunction was passed by the Court on 12.08.2021 restraining the defendant authority from transferring the property to any other person till the next date. In the suit proceeding both the defendants filed their written statement and taken similar pleas in their written statements by stating that the plaintiff company had not complied with the terms of the lease deed/contract between the parties and the termination of the lease deed by the defendant authority and the subsequent re-allotment of the suit property in favour of the defendant company was legal. After completing inter-se pleadings and hearing the parties at length the Commercial Court had decreed the aforesaid suit on 28.03.2022 and declared the cancellation notice dated 07.01.2021 as null and void and all consequential actions subsequent to the aforesaid cancellation notice dated 07.01.2021 have also been declared as null and void and the defendant authority has rightly been directed to issue fresh demand notice for recovery of pending dues/penalities against the plaintiff company upto 31.03.2022, within 15 days from the date of the judgment. In support of his submission, he has placed reliance on the judgment of Apex Court in Sri Saurav Jain & Anr. vs. M/s A.B.P. Design & Anr8. He submitted that there is no infirmity or illegality in the judgement and decree and as such both the first appeals are liable to be dismissed. \n29. Heard rival submissions and perused the record. \n30. At the outset, it is noticed that the consideration required in the present case is as to whether the agreement/transaction between the parties, which is subject matter of suit, could be considered as a \"commercial dispute\" so as to enable the Commercial Court to entertain the suit. \n31. The preamble of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 reads as under:-\n\"An Act to provide for the constitution of Commercial Courts, Commercial Appellate Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts for adjudicating commercial disputes of specified value and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\"\n32.

Transfer of pending cases. - (1) All suits and applications, including applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of Specified Value pending in a High Court where a Commercial Division has been constituted, shall be transferred to the Commercial Division.\n(2) All suits and applications, including applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a Commercial Court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such Commercial Court:\nProvided that no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the Court prior to the constitution of the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court shall be transferred either under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2).\n(3) Where any suit or application, including an application under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of specified value shall stand transferred to the Commercial Division or Commercial Court under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the provisions of this Act shall apply to those procedures that were not complete at the time of transfer.\n(4) The Commercial Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be, may hold case management hearings in respect of such transferred suit or application in order to prescribe new timelines or issue such further directions as may be necessary for a speedy and efficacious disposal of such suit or application in accordance 3 [with Order XV-A] of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).\nProvided that the proviso to sub-rule (1) of Rule 1 of Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall not apply to such transferred suit or application and the court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which the written statement shall be filed. \n(5) In the event that such suit or application is not transferred in the manner specified in sub-section (1), sub-section (2) or sub-section (3), the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court may, on the application of any of the parties to the suit, withdraw such suit or application from the court before which it is pending and transfer the same for trial or disposal to the Commercial Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be, having territorial jurisdiction over such suit, and such order of transfer shall be final and binding.\" \n42. Insofar as transferred cases as per Section 15 (4) of the Act, the Commercial Division or Commercial Court shall prescribe new timelines or issue further directions for speedy and efficacious disposal of such suit or application in accordance with Order XVA of the Code of Civil Procedure. New time period for filing written statement shall be prescribed and the proviso to sub-rule (1) of rule 1 of Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure shall not apply to the transferred cases and the Court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which the written statement shall be filed. \n43. As per Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended under the Act, shall apply in the trial of suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value. Section 16 of the Act reads as under:-\n\"16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes. - (1) The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule. (2) The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value. \n(3) Where any provision of any rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail\". \n44. From the perusal of the provisions extracted as above, it is noticed that the disputes arising out of lease deed of immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce will qualify to be a commercial dispute to be tried by Commercial Courts. The question, therefore, would be that in the instant case though the parties have executed the lease deed of the land in question on 19.01.2007, which was subsequently cancelled by the order/notice dated 07.01.2021 and presently in the aforesaid suit the declaration/cancellation of the notice dated 07.01.2021 pertaining to the land in question is sought, whether the immovable property involved could be considered as being used exclusively in trade or commerce.\n45. In the case of Bachhaj Nahar vs. Nilima Mandal & Anr. (supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court dealt with the issue as to whether court can go beyond what is pleaded in pleadings for adjudication and while deciding the appeal also made a distinction on what is to be determined while adjudicating upon easement rights. The Supreme Court held that courts cannot exercise its judicial position to grant relief which is not even sought by parties in the pleadings. Relevant paras of the above judgement are reproduced hereinafter:-\n\"22. The observation of the High Court that when a plaintiff sets forth the facts and makes a prayer for a particular relief in the suit, he is merely suggesting what the relief should be, and that it is for the court, as a matter of law, to decide upon the relief that should be granted, is not sound. Such an observation may be appropriate with reference to a writ proceeding. It may even be appropriate in a civil suit while proposing to grant as relief, a lesser or smaller version of what is claimed. But the said observation is misconceived if it is meant to hold that a civil court may grant any relief it deems fit, ignoring the prayer. \n23. It is fundamental that in a civil suit, relief to be granted can be only with reference to the prayers made in the pleadings. That apart, in civil suits, grant of relief is circumscribed by various factors like court fee, limitation, parties to the suits, as also grounds barring relief, like res judicata, estoppel, acquiescence, non-joinder of causes of action or parties etc., which require pleading and proof. Therefore, it would be hazardous to hold that in a civil suit whatever be the relief that is prayed, the court can on examination of facts grant any relief as it thinks fit. In a suit for recovery of Rs.one lakh, the court cannot grant a decree for Rs. Ten lakhs. In a suit for recovery possession of property 'A', court cannot grant possession of property 'B'. In a suit praying for permanent injunction, court grant a relief of declaration or possession. The jurisdiction to grant relief in a civil suit necessarily depends on the pleadings, prayer, court fee paid, evidence let in, etc.\n24. In the absence of a claim by plaintiffs based on an easementary right, the first defendant did not have an opportunity to demonstrate that the plaintiffs had no easementary right. In the absence of pleadings and an opportunity to the first defendant to deny such claim, the High Court could not have converted a suit for title into a suit for enforcement of an easementary right. The first appellate court had recorded a finding of fact that plaintiffs had not made out title. The High Court in second appeal did not disturb the said finding. As no question of law arose for consideration, the High Court ought to have dismissed the second appeal. Even if the High Court felt that a case for easement was made out, at best liberty could have been reserved to the plaintiffs to file a separate suit for easement. But the High court could not, in a second appeal, while rejecting the plea of the plaintiffs that they were owners of the suit property, grant the relief of injunction in regard to an easementary right by assuming that they had an easementary right to use the schedule property as a passage. \n25. We accordingly allow these appeals and set aside the judgment and order of the High Court and restore the judgment of the first appellate court. Parties to bear their respective costs.\" \n46. In the case of Messrs. Trojan & Co. Ltd. vs. Rm. N.N. Nagappa Chettiar9, the Apex Court considered the issue as to whether relief not asked for by a party could be granted and that too without having proper pleadings. The Apex Court held as under:-\n\"It is well settled that the decision of a case cannot be based on grounds outside the pleadings of the parties and it is the case pleaded that has to be found. Without an amendment of the plaint, the Court was not entitled to grant the relief not asked for and no prayer was ever made to amend the plaint so as to incorporate in it an alternative case.\" \n47. In the case of Vasu Healthcare Private Limited vs. Gujarat Akruti TCG Biotech Limited10 the Division Bench of Gujarat High Court held that on a plain reading of Clause 2(1) (c) of Commercial Courts Act, 2015 the expression \"used\" must mean \"actually used\" or \"being used\". It is further explained that if the intention of the legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the phraseology \"likely to be used\" or \"to be used\" would have been employed. The relevant part of the judgement is reproduced herein below:-\n\"Therefore, if the dispute falls within any of the clause 2(c) the dispute can be said to be \"commercial dispute\" for which the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. It is required to be noted that before the learned Commercial Court the original plaintiff relied upon section 2(c)(i), 2(c)(ii) and 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act only. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has candidly admitted and/or conceded that the case shall not fall within clause 2(c)(i); 2(c)(ii) or 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that case would fall within section 2(c)(vii) of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we have considered on merits whether even considering section 2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between the parties can be said to be \"commercial dispute\" within the definition of section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act or not? Considering section 2(c)(vii), \"commercial dispute\" means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable property/plots the agreements between the parties cannot be said to be agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter developed by the original defendant No. 1 and after providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it, the same is required to be given to other persons like the original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that as the original defendant No. 1 has failed to provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the agreement has been filed. There are other alternative prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the agreement is as such relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that as in clause (vii) of section 2(c), the pharseology used is not \"actually used\" or \"being used\" and therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also, section 2(c)(vii) shall be applicable and therefore, the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted that important words used in the relevant provisions are \"immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce\". If the submission on behalf of the original plaintiff is accepted in that case it would be adding something in the statute which is not there in the statute, which is not permissible. On plain reading of the relevant clause it is clear that the expression \"used\" must mean \"actually used\" or \"being used\". If the intention of the legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the phraseology used would have been different as for example, \"likely to be used\" or \"to be used\". The word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and it cannot be said to be either \"ready for use\" or \"likely to be used\"; or \"to be used\". Similar view has been taken by the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) in the case of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal (Supra) and it is observed and held that the word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and not merely \"ready for use\". It is reported that SLP against the said decision has been dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\" \n(emphasis supplied) \n48. The provisions of Section 2(i)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Court Act, 2015 has to be read as it is. The Statute lays down that only those agreement relating to immovable property which has been exclusively put to use in trade or commerce would be included in the ambit of Section 2(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The Statute is absolutely clear, plain and unambiguous, hence, the Courts are bound to give effect to that meaning. Since the Statute is precise and unambiguous then it is imperative to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words used in the clause clearly lay down the intent of the law makers. Hence, Clause vii of Section 2(1)(c) of the C.C. Act 2015 has to be read as it is and cannot be expounded to give larger intent. \n49. In an identical situation, Lord Brougham in Crawford v. Spooner11 has held as under :\n\"to take the words as the Legislature have given them, and to take the meaning which the words given naturally imply, unless where the construction of those words is, either by the preamble or by the context of the words in question, controlled or altered.\"\n50. Viscount Haldane, LC in Attorney General v. Milne12, has held as under :\n\"if the language used \"has a natural meaning we cannot depart from that meaning unless, reading the statute as a whole, the context directs us to do so\".\n51. Lord Atkinson in Corp of the City of Victoria v Bishop of Vancouver Island13 has held as under :\n\"In the construction of statutes, their words must be interpreted in their ordinary grammatical sense unless there be something in the context, or in the object of the statute in which they occur or in the circumstances in which they are used, to show that they were used in a special sense different from their ordinary grammatical sense.\"\n52. Viscount Simon, LC in Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd14 has held that :\n\"The golden rule is that the words of a statute must prima facie be given their ordinary meaning.\" \n53. Hon'ble Apex Court in Harbhajan Singh vs. Press Council of India15 has held as under :\n\"....Legislature does not waste its words. Ordinary, grammatical and full meaning is to be assigned to the words used while interpreting a provision to honour the rule- Legislature chooses appropriate words to express what it intends, and therefore, must be attributed with such intention as is conveyed by the words employed so long as this does not result in absurdity or anomaly or unless material - intrinsic or external - is available to permit a departure from the rule.\" \n54. In Chandrika Misir v. Bhaiya Lal16, Hon'ble Supreme Court was hearing a special leave petition concerning the possession of parties over the suit property which was the subject of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act (Act 1 of 1951). While adjudicating on whether the suit was barred by limitation, Justice DG Palekar, speaking for a two Judge bench, observed that the civil court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the suit at all. Although the plea of bar on jurisdiction had not been raised in the courts below, the Apex Court held that: \n\"6. It is from this order that the present appeal has been filed by special leave. It is to be noticed that the suit had been filed in a civil court for possession and the Limitation Act will be the Act which will govern such a suit. It is not the case that U.P. Act 1 of 1951 authorises the filing of the suit in a civil court and prescribes a period of limitation for granting the relief of possession superseding the one prescribed by the Limitation Act. It was, therefore, perfectly arguable that if the suit is one properly entertainable by the civil court the period of limitation must be governed by the provisions of the Limitation Act and no other. In that case there would have been no alternative but to pass a decree for possession in favour of the plaintiffs. But the unfortunate part of the whole case is that the civil court had no jurisdiction at all to entertain the suit. It is true that such a contention with regard to the jurisdiction had not been raised by the defendant in the trial court but where the court is inherently lacking in jurisdiction the plea may be raised at any stage, and, it is conceded by Mr Yogeshwar Prasad, even in execution proceedings on the ground that the decree was a nullity. If one reads Section 209 and 331 of the U.P. Act 1 of 1951 together one finds that a suit like the one before us has to be filed before a Special Court created under the Act within a period of limitation specially prescribed under the rules made under the Act and the jurisdiction of the ordinary civil court is absolutely barred.\" \n55. In the case of Federation of A.P. Chambers of Commerce & Industry and Ors. vs. State of A.P. and Ors.17 the Apex Court observed as under:-\n\"6. Section 3 of the said Act speaks of \"land is used for any industrial purpose\", \"land is used for any commercial purpose\" and \"land is used for any other non-agricultural purpose\". The emphasis is on the word \"is used\". For the purpose of levy of assessment on non-agricultural lands at the rate specified in the Schedule for land used for industrial purposes, therefore, there has to be a finding as a fact that the land is in fact in praesenti in use for an industrial purpose. The same would apply to a commercial purpose or any other non-agricultural purpose.\" \"9. We are in no doubt whatever, therefore, that it is only land which is actually in use for an industrial purpose as defined in the said Act that can be assessed to non-agricultural assessment at the rate specified for land used for industrial purposes. The wider meaning given to the word \"used\" in the judgment under challenge is untenable. Having regard to the fact that the said Act is a taxing statute, no Court is justified in imputing to the legislature an intention that it has not clearly expressed in the language it has employed.\" \n(emphasis supplied) \n56. In the case of Shri Saurav Jain & Anr v. M/s A. B. P. Design & Anr (supra) the Apex Court has held that though the appellant did not assail the finding of the trial Court on the issue of jurisdiction before the Allahabad High Court under Order XLI Rule 22 CPC either by filing a memorandum of cross-objection or otherwise, he was not precluded from raising the argument before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, in view of its plenary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution read with its power to do complete justice under Article 142, can entertain new grounds raised for the first time, if it involves a question of law which does not require adducing additional evidence, specifically one concerning jurisdiction of the court which goes to the root of the matter. Relevant paragraph-39 of the judgement reads as under:-\n\"39. We have come to the conclusion that the suit instituted by the first respondent had to be dismissed. The judgment of the Trial Judge dismissing the suit was correct, but for the following reasons: (i) The purported transfer of the suit land by Zahid Hussain to the first respondent was before the Repeal Act was enacted. The dual conditions stipulated under Section 5(3) of ULCRA were not fulfilled before the transfer was made since the statement under Section 6 had not been submitted and the Competent Authority had not issued a notification under Section 10(1) of the ULCRA (which was in operation at the time). Therefore, even if the Zahid Hussain had the title to the suit land, the transfer to the first respondent was null and void under section 5(3) of ULCRA; (ii) When Zahid Hussain had filed a declaration seeking permission for transfer of the suit land, the permission under Section 27 of ULCRA was not granted since there was a pending suit concerning the said land. He then filed another application seeking permission for transfer of land admeasuring 1295 sq. mt of his 'retainable' 2000 sq. mt. of land. The permission that was granted under Section 27 of ULCRA by the Office of the Competent Authority on 5 May 1993 was for the transfer of lands from his 'retainable' property and not the suit land; (iii) The plaintiff- first respondent has artfully drafted the plaint to challenge the validity of the auction and sought an injunction and declaration, when the substantive cause of action of the suit arises out of the land ceiling proceedings; (iv) The ULCRA impliedly excludes the jurisdiction of the civil court on matters arising out of the ceiling proceedings; and (v) Though the appellant did not assail the finding of the Trial Court on the issue of jurisdiction before the High Court under Order XLI Rule 22 CPC either by filing a memorandum of cross-objection or otherwise , he is not precluded from raising the argument before this Court. This Court in view of its plenary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution read with its power to do complete justice under Article 142, can entertain new grounds raised for the first time if it involves a question of law which does not require adducing additional evidence, specifically one concerning jurisdiction of the court which goes to the root of the matter.\" \n57. In Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd (supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the dispute relating to immovable property per se may not be a commercial dispute but it becomes a commercial dispute if it falls under sub-section (vii) of Section 2 (1) (c) of the Commercial Court Act, 2015. It was further held that the words \"used exclusively in trade and commerce\" are to be interpreted purposefully. The word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and it cannot be either \"ready for use\" or \"likely to be used\" or \"to be used\". It should be \"actually used.\". The relevant part of the judgement is reproduced herein below:-\n\"24. It appears that the trial court has proceeded under the footing that the parties to the suit more particularly, the appellant-plaintiff seems to be carrying on business as Estate Agent and to manage land, building, etc. and the very object as enumerated in Memorandum and Articles of Association of the appellant-plaintiff company established that the property in question are being used exclusively in trade or commerce rather in the business of the plaintiff. As rightly pointed out by the High Court, there is nothing on record to show that at the time when agreement to sell came to be executed in 2012, the property was being exclusively used in trade and commerce so as to bring dispute within the ambit of sub-clause (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. Merely because, the property is 15 likely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same cannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court. \n25. In the case of Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah 2017 SCC Guj 583, a Special Civil Suit No.533/2011 was instituted for declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs.17.76 crores executed by the appellant-original defendant No.1 in favour of respondent No.4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent injunction with respect to the land in question. The appellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed, it has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls within the meaning of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to be transferred to the Commercial Court. Trial court rejected the said application which was challenged before the Gujarat High Court. The Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of establishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that the cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such 16 a suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings and/or is dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the Commercial Division/Commercial Court, there shall not be any difference between the Regular Civil Courts and the Commercial Division/Commercial Courts and the object for the establishment of the Commercial Division/Commercial Courts shall be frustrated. \n26. In Vasu Healthcare Private Limited v. Gujarat Akruti TCG Biotch Limited & Another 2017 SCC OnLine Guj 724, referred to in extenso by my learned Brother, it was held that \"on plain reading of the relevant clause, it is clear that the expression \"used\" must mean \"actually used\" or \"being used\". If the intention of the legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the phraseology used would have been different as for example, \"likely to be used\" or \"to be used\". The word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and it cannot be said to be either \"ready for use\" or \"likely to be used\"; or \"to be used\". We entirely agree with the above purposive interpretation adopted by the Gujarat High Court. \n27. The object and purpose of the establishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that the cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost 17 to the litigants. Keeping in view the object and purpose of the establishment of the Commercial Courts and fast tracking procedure provided under the Act, the statutory provisions of the Act and the words incorporated thereon are to be meaningfully interpreted for quick disposal of commercial litigations so as to benefit the litigants especially those who are engaged in trade and commerce which in turn will further economic growth of the country. On the above reasonings, I agree with the conclusion arrived at by my esteemed brother Justice A.S. Bopanna\"\n58. Bombay High Court in M/S Glasswood Realty Pvt Ltd vs Chadravilas Kailashkumar18 has held that the dispute arising out of transactions between the persons who are classified in Clause 1 of Section 2(c) only qualify to be covered by the definition of 'commercial dispute'. The Court further held that it is necessary to adopt a careful approach in scrutinizing whether the dispute would fall within the purview of 'commercial dispute', and if not, it would fall in the category of ordinary civil dispute and such dispute cannot be permitted to be tried by Commercial Court but has to be tried as a normal suit under the prescribed provisions of CPC. \n59. The Delhi High Court in Kailash Devi Khanna vs. DD Global Capital Ltd.19 held that all suits for recovery of monies cannot brought under Section 2(1)(c)(i) of the Act where the suit is not based on any transaction relating to mercantile documents. \n60. The Madras High Court in R. Kumar vs. T.A.S. Jawahar Ayya 20 was of the view that since the plaintiffs did not transact in the capacity of financiers, the dispute was not a \"commercial dispute\" and that an ordinary transaction of the four classes of persons mentioned in 2(1)(c)(i) arising out of mercantile documents alone would fall within the definition of a commercial dispute. \n61. The object and purpose of the establishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that the cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigants. Keeping in view the object and purpose of the establishment of the Commercial Courts and fast tracking procedure provided under the Act, the statutory provisions of the Act and the words incorporated thereon are to be meaningfully interpreted for quick disposal of commercial litigations so as to benefit the litigants especially those who are engaged in trade and commerce which in turn will further boost the economic growth of the country. \n62. Though such rival contentions were put forth by the counsel on either side, the said submissions cannot be dealt with in abstract. Instead the nature of the dispute and the jurisdiction to try the same is to be reflected in the pleadings set up in the suit itself before the Commercial Court. The pleadings made in the averments in the plaint would at the outset be relevant to confer jurisdiction to the competent Commercial Court. Therefore, before adverting to the merits and other aspects, it would be necessary to carefully examine the plaint, written submission and other pleadings set up by the parties before the Commercial Court. The defendant company has referred to the nature of the transaction between the appellant authority and plaintiff company. As the details regarding the pleadings and plaint were already given in detail as above, this is admitted situation that in terms of the lease agreement neither the plaintiff company deposited the amount as per scheduled nor raised any construction within stipulated time. Even it has not moved any application for extension or enlargement of time for raising the constructions even before filing of the suit. \n63. The Commercial Court is exclusively constituted to try the commercial disputes, which has jurisdiction to try the same. In that background, a perusal of the prayer made in the plaint would essentially indicate that the suit was filed seeking declaration/cancellation of notice dated 07.01.2021 issued by the defendant authority by which the lease deed dated 19.01.2007 executed in favour of the plaintiff company was cancelled by the defendant-authority. Even if the immovable property under the lease deed was the subject matter, it is necessary to plead and substantiate that the same was being used in trade or commerce due to which the jurisdiction of Commercial Court was invoked. Without such basic pleadings in the plaint, any explanations sought to be put forth subsequently would only lead to a situation that if an objection is raised, in every suit a consideration would be required based on extraneous material even to ascertain as to whether the intended transaction between the parties was of such nature that it is to be construed as a commercial dispute. \n64. The defendant company had filed written statement in the aforesaid suit, which was appended with the paper book, stating inter alia certain facts and also that a decree of declaration and dislodge or extension is discretionary relief to which the plaintiff company was not entitled for the reason that the defendant company had also filed the balance sheet of the plaintiff company for the year 2015-19 from the 'Ministry of Corporate Affairs' and perusal thereof clearly shows that the plaintiff company concealed the fact that, it was inactive shell company, which had no business operations, no turnover and nil income. The amount of Rs.1,00,78,716/- paid by the plaintiff company to the defendant authority in respect of the plot was reflected in its balance sheets as long term unsecured loans taken by the plaintiff company, which was on record and therefore, on the basis of record it was also pressed before us that at the relevant time the plaintiff company had no money whatsoever, to either make the balance payment to the defendant authority or to make constructions on the said plot as required under the terms of the lease deed. Therefore, it was also pleaded in the written statement by the defendant company that the allotment of an institutional plot at special rates was made to business entities by the defendant authority to promote business and employment in the Noida region. But in fact the plaintiff company is a company with no operations, nil turnover and no business record whatsoever and neither it was legally nor morally entitled to benefit from such allotment. It was also pleaded in the written statement filed by the defendant company that the plaintiff company was only incorporated on 19.12.2005 shortly before process of bidding of the plot in question just to procure lease rights of the said plot at the discounted allotment rates so as to later sell it at premium in the market, and to make a quick buck, as a real estate deal. \n65 . It was also pressed that even though the appellant company filed detailed written statement, which remained unrebutted by the plaintiff company, but the Commercial Court did not take into consideration and rather brushed aside the said objection with the summary observations that the defendant company had no substantial right against the plaintiff company as there is no privity of contract between the plaintiff company and the defendant company. Before the Commercial Court it was conveniently pressed by the plaintiff company as there was no breach of the lease deed. The only case set up by the plaintiff company to challenge the cancellation of the lease on the ground that the notices dated 13.12.2009, 03.02.2020, 17.06.2020 and 14.07.2020 sent by the defendant authority prior to cancellation, were not sent to the registered address of the plaintiff company but in fact the same were sent to E-292A, Sector 22, Noida, which was the address of the Director of the company at which the plaintiff company was no longer available and further no notice was affixed at the correspondence address or to ensure the public notice. \n66. In this backdrop, we have also examined the lease deed, which does not contain any provision for issuance of notice before cancellation in case of breach by lessee, contrarily as per record it is admitted fact that the show cause notices were sent to the plaintiff company by the defendant authority as early as in 2013 and 2014, which is duly acknowledged/claimed in para-11 of the plaint that its address changed only in the year 2015. The plaintiff company had not pleaded any case in the plaint regarding any steps or measures in response to the aforesaid notices. Heavy reliance has also been placed by the Commercial Court on the provisions of Section 43 of the Act, 1973, which stipulates that any notice required to be sent to a company under the provision of the Act may be sent at its registered office or its principal office or its place of business. It is also reflected from the record that the plaintiff company has consistently used the said address in all its documentation including the lease deed, which shows that the plaintiff company projected the said address as its place of business. In fact the same address has been used as the company's address in the earlier writ petition (Writ C No.13225/2021) filed before this Court in 2021. Hence, the contention, that the address was changed in 2015, is also not accepted. \n67. From the statements made in the plaint it is evident that the plaintiff company approached the appellant authority for grant of lease in respect of an immovable property for the purpose of trade and commerce. The lease deed of the plot in question was executed on 19.01.2007 and pursuant to the lease deed the plaintiff company deposited 30% of the amount. Admittedly, the possession of the land was handed over to the plaintiff company on 01.02.2007. In terms of Clause 13 (A) of the lease deed the plaintiff company had to complete the construction within five years from the actual date of possession, which could be extended further two years. Neither it deposited the required money in terms of the agreement nor moved any application for enlargement of time for construction. Consequently, the lease deed was cancelled and the property was re-allotted in favour of the defendant company. The aforesaid suit was filed seeking declaration/cancellation of notice dated 07.01.2021 whereby the lease deed dated 19.01.2007 executed in favour of the plaintiff company was cancelled by the defendant authority. The instant suit has been filed for adjudication of a dispute arising out of the lease deed relating to immovable property. \n68. There is nothing on record to show that at the time when the lease deed was executed in 2007, the property was being exclusively used in trade and commerce so as to bring dispute within the ambit of sub-clause (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Commercial Court Act, 2015. Merely because, the property is likely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same cannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court. \n69. The question arises in aforementioned facts as to whether the dispute involved in the present case can be considered as commercial dispute, which would be within the ambit of Commercial Court Act, 2015. On plain reading of Section 2 (1) (c) of the Commercial Court Act, 2015 it is clear that the expression \"used\" must mean \"actually used\" or \"being used\". If the intention of the legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the phraseology \"likely to be used\" or \"to be used\" would have been used. A matter will fall under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court or the Commercial Division of the High Court on the following factors namely (i) it shall be a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section 2(1)(c) of the Commercial Court Act, 2015; and (ii) such commercial disputes are of a specified value as per Section 2 (i) of the Commercial Court Act, 2015.\n70. From the above it has been established that a dispute relating to immovable property per se may not be a commercial dispute but the same becomes a commercial dispute, if it falls under sub-clause (vii) of Section 2 (1) (c) of the Act viz. \"the agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce\". The words \"used exclusively in trade or commerce\" are to be interpreted purposefully. The word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and it cannot be either \"ready for use\" or \"likely to be used\" or \"to be used\". It should be \"actually used\". \n71. On a perusal of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Commercial Court Act, 2015 and the various amendments to Civil Procedure Code and insertion of new rules to the Code applicable to suits of commercial disputes it is evident that it has been enacted for the purpose of providing an early disposal of high value commercial disputes. A purposive interpretation of the Objects and Reasons and various amendments to Civil Procedure Code leaves no room for doubt that the provisions of the Act require to be strictly construed. If the provisions are given a liberal interpretation, the object behind constitution of Commercial Division of Courts, viz. putting the matter on fast track and speedy resolution of commercial disputes, will be defeated. If we take a closer look at the Statement of Objects and Reasons, words such as 'early' and 'speedy' have been incorporated and reiterated. The object shall be fulfilled only if the provisions of the Commercial Court Act, 2015 are interpreted in a narrow sense and not hampered by the usual procedural delays plaguing our traditional legal system. \n72. Learned Commercial Court totally misinterpreted the definition of commercial dispute and failed to appreciate that there is a difference between the \"Commercial Dispute and Commercial Relation\". As such, the finding of learned Commercial Court that there is a commercial dispute between the parties suffers from infirmity. \n73. In view of above, we are of the considered opinion that there is no commercial dispute. The Commercial Court had no jurisdiction to decide the present dispute between the parties. Once we have decided commercial Court has no jurisdiction in view of Commercial Court Act, 2015, the other issues are only academic in nature which are not required to be considered or to be answered by the Court. \n74. For the aforesaid reasons we allow both appeals and set aside the judgment and decree dated 28.3.2022 passed by the Presiding Officer, Commercial Court, Gautam Budh Nagar in Suit (Comm) No.167 of 2021. \nOrder Date :- 06.09.2023 RKP/    ",

(ii) it is further alleged in the plaint that when the plaintiff demanded the defendant to repay the debt, the defendant issued cheques on 08-05-2021 dated 21-7-2021 for a sum of rs.20,00,000/and cheque dated 25-06-2021 for a sum of rs 25,00,000/and two cheques dated 267-2021 for a sum of rs.50,00,000/each. it is stated in the plaint that when the cheques were presented, it was dishonoured under the endorsement either funds insufficient or exceeds, thereby, entitling the plaintiff to send a statutory legal notice on 10-8-2021 demanding the cheque amounts. though the notice was received on 11-8-2021 instead of honouring the cheque, the defendant seems to have sent a reply on 16-8-2021 to which the plaintiff sent a rejoinder notice on 21-8-2021 that was received by the defendant and the defendant seems to have issued reply to the rejoinder notice sent by the plaintiff. (iii) thereafter, the plaintiff has initiated criminal proceedings before the judicial magistrate v, salem on 20-9-2021 for an offence under section 138 negotiable instruments act. however, reserving his right to file civil suit against the defendant. therefore the plaintiff, who is the respondent herein has held the defendant / petitioner herein in the first above three revision petitions liable to pay rs.2,34,00,000/alongwith https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 interest at the rate of rs.1/per 100 per month to the plaintiff. thus, the plaintiff has invoked the commercial courts act 2015 and filed the same before the commercial court at salem, district judge of salem. (iv) pending suit, immediately after the receipt of the suit summons, the defendant/the petitioner in the 1st three above referred revisions has filed i.a. no. 2 of 2022 invoking order 7 rule 11(a) and (d) of cpc seeking rejection of plaint on the ground that the commercial court has no jurisdiction to try the money suit, which is otherwise capriciously drafted to attract the commercial courts act 2015, apart from various among other grounds raised in this petition. though, the petition under order 7 rule 11 cpc was filed and arguments were heard from both the sides, the learned district judge, commercial court, salem has dismissed i.a no. 2 of 2022 in a one line order without specifying any reasons on merits and discussing the same which is fervous and hence c.r.p.no. 3672 of 2022 is filed challenging the same. (v) as far as c.r.p.no.3800 of 2022 is concerned, an application was filed in i.a.no. 4 of 2022 by the respondent / plaintiff seeking to amend the plaint filed in commercial original suit in no.9 of 2022 under order 6 rule 17 of cpc and the same was allowed by order dated 3-9-2022 and the same is challenged in this revision petition. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 (vi) further, c.r.p.no. 2123 of 2023, is filed by the petitioner / defendant to strike off the plaint in c.o.s.no.10 of 2023 on the file of district judge, commercial court, salem. the said suit was filed by the respondent, viz., niranjani, wife of madhanraj invoking commercial court jurisdiction at salem seeking a decree in favour of her directing the petitioners / defendants to pay a sum of rs.2,84,85.962/along with the accrued interest on rs.2,16,00,000/at rs.1 per 100 per month from the date of institution of suit. (vii) the c.r.p.no.338 of 2023 is filed by the petitioner / plaintiff as against the order made in i.a.no.6 of 2022 dated 20.10.2022 [which was preferred by the respondent / defendant to file statement of truth under order 6 rule 15-a of cpc], on the ground that the statement of truth ought to have been filed within 120 days i.e., 13-2-2022 and has been filed with a delay of 249 days, which according to the plaintiff is an erroneous order passed by the district judge, commercial court at salem and the court below allowed the said pettion by permitting the statement of truth. 3. the learned senior counsel appearing for revision petitioner in c.r.p.3672 of 2022 and c.r.p. no. 3800 of 2022 would contend that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 dismissal of the petition filed under order 7 rule 11(a) and (d) seeks intervention of this court, in as much as the learned district judge dismissed the same in one line order, despite the petitioner had taken earnest effort to convince the court that the suit itself is not maintainable invoking commercial courts act, 2015 and if at all the same is maintained, the suit is barred by limitation, as contemplated under the commercial courts act 2015 and the limitation act. thatapart, the learned senior counsel also urged upon this court that the commercial courts act is not intended from the suits of ordinary money claim on alleged promissory note to invoke the commercial courts act and the jurisdiction of the court which the very purpose of the act will be defeated. he would further contend that that the claim made by the plaintiff in this suit does not fall under any one of the 22 categories, as mentioned under section 2(1)(c) of the act. the plaintiff has pouched his pleadings to fit in the jurisdiction of the commercial courts act, which in otherwise would ordinarily be a money suit rather than being filed under commercial courts act, 2015. the learned counsel further submitted that the promissory notes have not authorized to file under the commercial courts and commercial division, as the same are not mercantile documents as defined in section 2(1) of the commercial courts act, hence, pleaded the dismissal of the suit in c.o.s.no.9 of 2022 and allow c.r.p.nos 3672 and 3800 of 2022. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 4. lastly, the learned senior counsel appearing for revision petitioner in c.r.p.3672 of 2022 and c.r.p. no. 3800 of 2022 would contend that when the suit itself is not maintainable, as not arising under the commercial courts act, the question of permitting the plaintiff to amend the plaint, after filing of the petition under order 7 rule 11 (a) and (d) of cpc would not arise and the learned district judge ought to have dismissed the petition seeking amendment of plaint. 5. the learned senior counsel for the petitioner in c.r.p.no. 2123 of 2023 submitted that the suit in c.o.s.no.10 of 2023 is breft of the jurisdiction of the court for invoking the commercial courts act 2015, when the act clearly specifies that pre-institutions mediation and settlement under section 12(a) of the commercial courts act, 2015, the suit ought not to have been taken on file for want of compliance under section 12(a) of commercial courts act, 2015. the learned senior counsel relied upon the following judgments to support his contention. a. judgment of the hon'ble supreme court reported in (2020) 7 supreme court cases 366 [dahiben vs. arvindbhai kalyanji bhanus ali (gajra) dead through legal representatives and others] b. judgment of the hon'ble supreme

2023 and petitioner in c.r.p. no.338 of 2023 would contend that the crp filed by the petitioner / defendant in crp nos.3672, 3800 and 2123 of 2023 is not maintainable, as there is a specific bar in approaching this court, as she ought to have filed only appeal as specified under section 13 of commercial courts act, 2015. the respondent counsel contended that the transaction between the respondent and the petitioner are the commercial transaction, which is clearly covered under section 2(1)(c)(i) of commercial courts act. that apart, the learned counsel also contended that the respondent is a licensed money lender and the petitioner borrowed money from the respondent for his business and family expenses by executing promissory notes agreeing to repay the debts with interest. apart from the same, the learned senior counsel traversing through the plaint averments would state that the documents produced viz., the promissory notes and communications between the plaintiff and the defendant would itself establish the commercial transaction between the plaintiff and the defendants. further, the defendant continues to borrow money from the plaintiff for commercial purpose and the plaintiff periodically renewed his lending license will also https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 established the transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant is commercial in nature that would attract the jurisdiction under commercial courts act, 2015 and hence the suit filed invoking the commercial courts act 2015 is maintainable. as far as the revision petition in crp no.338 of 2023 is concerned, the learned senior counsel emphasized more upon order 6 rule 15(a)(4) of cpc, where the learned senior cousel submitted that the defendant was continuously aware that the statement of truth, ought to have been filed within 150 days from the date of service of summon and on an expiry of 120 days, the defendant forfeit the such right to file the written statement. the district court allowed the i.a. no.6 of 2022, thereby accepted the statement of truth, which cannot be sustained as the same is beyond the competency of the court to accept such statement of truth when the statute prohibits such receival after 120 days. hence, revision petition filed in crp no. 338 of 2023 has to be allowed and order passed in i.a. no. 7. the learned senior counsel further submitted as against the argument made by the learned senior counsel, mr.n. jothi in crp no. 2123 of 2022 that section 12(a) of the commercial courts act is only a procedural aspect, which is curable even pending suits. section 12(a) of the commercial courts act is only a conciliated procedure which can even be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 undertaken for pending suit referring the parties of the suit for mediation as contemplated under section 12(a) of the commercial courts act. hence, the suit filed by niranjani in cos no. 10 of 2023 before the district judge commercial court, salem cannot be rejected that has to be sustained and proceeded for further trial. the learned senior counsel sought dismissal of c.r.p.no. 2123 of 2023. 8. further, the learned counsel for the petitioner in crp no.3672 of 2022 in support of her contention has relied upon the judgment of the delhi high court reported in 2022 scc online del 3636 [ihhr hospitality (andhra) pvt., ltd., vs. seems swami and others] at paragraph nos.10 to 12, wherein it is held as follows:10. in the case of lady moon towers pvt. ltd. vs. mahindra investment advisors pvt. ltd. manu/wb/0547/2021 it was observed by the high court of calcutta that the definition contemplates a commercial dispute and not any other form of dispute where the basis of disagreement between the parties has a non-commercial cause. the gradation of disputes in section 2(i)(c) takes into account all possible forms of agreements from which a commercial dispute may arise; it makes it clear that the framers of the statute gave emphasis on the commercial flavour of the transaction as opposed to agreements entered into between the parties without a commercial purpose. the commercial purpose would generally mean a transaction by which a person's commercial or economic interest may be advanced and would result in an economic benefit to that person. it would not include an agreement where profit making is an incidental outcome of the transaction or may happen by accident. home loan for example is given by a person or entity to another with the expected outcome of principle sum being returned with interest. the essential commercial flavour in such a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisloan may be lost by way of informal terms under which the money is c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 lent and advanced and the digitally signed by:priyanka aneja signing date:04.11.2022 13:23:37 2022/dhc/004647 consequent uncertainty which may result therefrom. it was further observed that in terms of section 2(i)(c) ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents implies ordinary transactions between the named persons and the \"mercantile documents\" indicates that all transactions between the specified classes of persons will not result in a commercial dispute where the transaction does not relate to mercantile documents. only those disputes arising out of a transaction between the named classes of persons which has been formalised by way of a mercantile document would be termed as a commercial dispute. in the said suit, a loan of rs. 50 lakhs had been given by the plaintiff company to the defendant since the directors of the plaintiff company were known to the defendant since long. it was held that simplicitor because a loan transaction was involved would not attract a commercial flavour to it and was held to be not a commercial dispute. 11. this court in kailash devi khanna vs. dd global capital ltd. 2019 scc online del 9954 held that all suits for recovery of monies cannot brought under section 2(1)(c)(i) of the act where the suit is not based on any transaction relating to mercantile documents. the bombay high court in bharat huddanna shetty vs. ahuja properties & developers (interim application (l) no.14350 of 2021; decided on 13 th july, 2021) rejected the contention that the suit should be treated as a commercial summary suit on the mandate that the transaction had occurred between merchants, bankers, financiers and traders and further clarified that transactions between individuals where the plaintiff gives a friendly loan to a needy friend will not be seen as a transaction in the course of ordinary business. the madras high court in r. kumar vs. t.a.s jawahar ayya manu/tn/4159/2020 was digitally signed by:priyanka aneja signing date:04.11.2022 13:23:37 2022/dhc/004647 of the view that since the plaintiffs did not transact in the capacity of financiers, the dispute was not a \"commercial dispute\" and that an ordinary transaction of the four classes of persons mentioned in 2(1)(c)(i) arising out of mercantile documents alone would fall within the definition of a commercial dispute. the calcutta high court in associated power co. ltd. vs. ram taran roy air 1970 cal 75 focused its gaze on a \"mercantile document\" within the meaning of the first schedule of the city civil court act, 1953 as a document between merchants and traders where the construction, interpretation and meanings of words and clauses of the mercantile documents would assume significance. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 12. it should also be pointed out that the words used in subclause (i) of clause(c) are \"ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents.\". the placement of the underlined words between ordinary transactions of the named persons and the mercantile documents indicates that all transactions between the specified classes of persons will not result in a \"commercial dispute\" where the transaction does not relate to mercantile documents. hence, only a dispute arising out of a transaction between the named classes of persons which has been formalised by way of a mercantile document will be a \"commercial dispute\" under section 2(1)(c)(i) of the 2015 act. 9. that apart, the learned counsel for the petitioner in crp no.3672 of 2022 in support of her contention has relied upon the judgment of the high court of calcutta reported in 2022 scc online cal 3010 [venkatesh vincom pvt., ltd., vs. spice of joy, multicuisine restaurant cum bar and others] \"7. reverting to the core issue the eventuality enshrined in clause (i) of section 2(1)(c) of the said act postulates that a dispute arising out of the ordinary transaction of financer relating to mercantile documents including its enforceability and interpretation are the important factors to be borne in mind. the said clause can be segregated into 3 parts. firstly, the dispute must arise out of ordinary transaction of financer and secondly, such ordinary transaction must relate to a mercantile document and thirdly, the enforceability and the interpretation of such document is involved. admittedly, the appellant is a non banking financial corporation which would be evident from the averments made in the plaint and the certificate of incorporation annexed thereto. the primary function of the non banking corporation is to extend financial supports and can be regarded as an fmat 20 of 2022 page-8 ordinary https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judistransaction of the financer. we find no ambiguity in this regard that c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 lending money by the appellant is fundamentally the transactions which it does and can be regarded as the ordinary transaction. the parties are not ad idem on the expression \"mercantile document\" appearing in the said clause for the reason that there was no agreement in writing nor any document evincing the money given as loan to the respondents. the mercantile document is not defined in the said act. however, the said act defines 'document' in section 2(1)(f) to mean any matter expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures, or marks, or electronic means or, by more than one of those means, intended to be used, or which may be used, for the purpose of recording that manner. the definition of a document is expansive and is not restricted to any agreement to be executed by and between the parties recording the transactions at the beginning thereof. the definition is wide enough to include any expression or a description of any substance by means of letters, marks or figures or electronic means which would be sufficient enough to bring clarity of the matter. the word 'mercantile' in ordinary parlance means a document relating to a merchant or trading or a document which is commercial in nature. in black's law dictionary, 8th edition 'mercantile' is defined as in \"bld\" 8. since the word 'mercantile' includes the transaction which is of commercial nature the \"commercial paper\" is also defined in the black's law dictionary as an instrument other than the cash for the payment of money and include negotiable instrument of a particular kind in the following: fmat 20 of 2022 page-9 \"commercial paper: 1. an instrument, other than cash, for the payment of money. commercial paper typically existing in the form of a draft (such as a check) or a note (such as a certificate of deposit) is governed by article 3 of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 ucc. but even though the ucc uses the term commercial paper when referring to negotiable instruments of a particular kind (drafts, checks, certificates of deposit, and notes as defined by article 3), the term long predates the ucc as a business and legal term in common use. before the ucc, it was generally viewed as synonymous with negotiable paper or bills and notes. it was sometimes applied even to nonnegotiable instruments. also termed mercantile paper; company's paper. see negotiable instrument.\" \" 'commercial paper' is rather a popular than a technical expression, often used, however, both in statutes and in decisions of courts, to designate those simple forms of contract long recognized in the world's commerce and governed by the law merchant.\" \"defined most broadly, commercial paper refers to any writing embodying rights that are customarily conveyed by transferring the writing. a large subset of commercial paper consists of such writings that are negotiable, which means that the law enables a transferee to acquire the embodied rights free of claims and defences against the transferor.\" fmat 20 of 2022 page-10 \"sec. 2 (c) \"commercial dispute\" means a dispute arising out of (ii) ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents, including enforcement and interpretation of such documents. 9. the stroud's judicial dictionary defines the commercial action to mean and include any cause arising out of ordinary transactions of merchants and traders and without prejudice to generosity of the following words: any cause relating to construction of a mercantile document, the export or import of mercantile, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 insurance, banking, mercantile agency and mercantile uses. it, thus, engulfed within itself any action or undertaking with an object to make a profit therefrom (see punjab university vs. unit trust of india & ors., (2015) 2 scc 669). in ladymoon towers pvt. ltd. (supra) the single bench of this court has relied upon various judgments of the delhi high court, bombay high court and madras high court as well as the calcutta high court to ascertain the meaning of a mercantile document. it has been held therein that all suits of recovery of money may not come within the purview of section 2(1)(c)(i) of the act if not based on any transaction relating to mercantile document. the view of the bombay high court has also been noticed to the effect that the suit cannot be treated as a commercial suit unless the transaction has occurred between the merchants, traders, bankers and financers and, therefore, any transaction of two individuals in extending a friendly loan cannot be regarded as a commercial transaction or a transaction in an ordinary course of business. the view of the madras high court as relied on by the single fmat 20 of 2022 page-11 bench in ladymoon towers pvt. ltd. (supra) was that if the plaintiffs have not transacted in a capacity of a financer it cannot come within the purview of the aforesaid definition clause. so far as the calcutta high court view as noticed by the single bench in the above noted decision was based on the definition of a mercantile document appearing in the first schedule of city civil courts act, 1953 to be a document between merchant and traders and the construction, interpretation and meaning of the words and clause of the mercantile document would assume a greater significance. though the aforesaid judgments were noticed by the single bench in the above referred cases but ultimately it was held that the suit for recovery of money lend and advanced as friendly loan does not satisfy the definition of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 a commercial dispute. it is no doubt true that every nature of the monetary transaction cannot come within the ambit of a commercial dispute defined in the said act. such monetary transaction in an ordinary course of business transacted by the merchants, bankers, financers and traders based upon a mercantile documents are regarded as a commercial transactions and a suit before the commercial court is maintainable. taking a clue from the definition of a 'merchant', what was a conservative view at one point of time have seen a radical change with the varied varieties of transaction which can be manifestly seen from the expansive definition of a commercial dispute under section 2(1)(c) of the said act. by advancement of technology the mode and the nature of transactions have also been changed and what was earlier known as a negotiable instrument in a primitive stage has been gradually taken out of practice and the mode of the transaction has been well accepted in electronic form. the interpretative tool fmat 20 of 2022 page-12 is an evolving process and changes with the behavioural pattern of the society more particularly in commercial transactions and, therefore, any rudimentary form of the interpretation may not be compatible with the changing pattern of the commercial transactions.\" 12. it leads to another question whether the loan extended to one of the partners for and on behalf of the firm can be regarded as a transaction with the firm. the answer can be traced from the provisions contained in chapter iv of the indian partnership act, 1932. section 18 of the said act postulates that the partner is an agent of a firm for the purpose of business of the firm. section 19 contemplates the implied authority of the partner as an agent of the firm and section 22 thereof binds the firm for any act of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisinstrument done or executed by the partner or other persons on c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 behalf of the farm to be regarded as done or executed by the firm. undisputedly, the cheque was issued by the appellant to the respondent no. 2 and the receipt or a note evincing such transaction, was issued by the respondent no. 1 firm. it is not a case where the respondent no. 2 utilised the money for his individual purposes but in fact the money given by the appellant was used and utilised by the respondent no. 1 firm and the tds certificate also corroborate the same. even the interest is paid by the respondent no. 1 firm and, therefore, even if the cheque covering the loan amount was issued in the name of one of the partners but shall be regarded as a payment to the firm. as indicated above, there is no condition laid down in the said definition 'commercial dispute' that the mercantile document must be executed at the beginning or before the transaction having affected rather the document defined in section 2(1)(f) of the act includes any matter expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures or marks or electronic means intended to be used or which may be used for the purpose of recording the fmat 20 of 2022 page-16 matter. we, therefore, find no difficulty in considering that the mercantile document as an instrument by any other means coming within the ambit of the definition of a document executed by a merchant in an ordinary course of business and any restrictive interpretation would frustrate the legislative intent and the object and purpose underlying the promulgation of the commercial courts act, 2015. we, therefore, have no hesitation to hold that the dispute involved in the instant pattern satisfies the definition of a commercial dispute and the order of the commercial court cannot be sustained.\" https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 10. heard the learned senior counsels and learned counsels for the c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 appropriate parties and perused the records carefully. 11. though the parties to the c.r.p. nos. 3672 of 2022, 3800 of 2022 and 338 of 2023 are madanraj, hindu undivided family, as plaintiff and radha alias ramalingam, as defendants arising out of c.o.s. no. 9 of 2022 are taken up along with crp no. 2123 of 2023, arising out of t.niranjani as plaintiff and r. radha as defendant in c.o.s. no.10 of 2023 on the file of district judge, commercial court salem and the parties are described to their respective rank as placed in the suits. 12. on the perusal of the records it is seen that the plaintiff, viz., madanraj seems to have filed c.o.s.no.118 of 2021, which was subsequently renumbered as c.o.s.no.9 of 2022 on the file of commercial district court, salem. the plaintiff had approached the district court invoking jurisdiction under commercial act, 2015, claiming for a decree in favour of the plaintiff directing the defendant to pay rs.2,86,67,748/with accrued interest on rs.2,34,00,000/at rs.1/per 100 per month from the date of suit till the date of realisation of amount that on the ground that the defendant one radha ramalingam bororrwed money from the plaintiff on various dates starting from 21.11.2013 by way of cash or by way of bank account of transfer. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 13. the plaintiff has further averred that the defendant was liable to pay rs.2,09,72,300/to the plaintiff towards principal and interest on 07.12.2019. however, after negotiation with the defendant, the plaintiff and defendant had arrived an amount of rs.2,05,00,000/and thereby waiving a sum of rs.4,72,300/to satisfy the above amount claimed, which is a debt to be paid by the defendant, he had executed a promissory note dated 07.12.2019 for the above said sum of rs.2,05,00,000/apart from he has issued various cheques dating from 08.05.2021 to 26.07.2021. when the cheque was presented for clearing, the defendant had failed to honour the cheque, either it was for want of sufficient funds or returned with an endorsement of 'exceeds insufficient'. the cheques were returned and the same is evident from the series of exchange of notices between the plaintiff and the defendant and when the amount were not been received by the plaintiff, the plaintiff had initiated criminal proceedings under section 138 of negotiable instruments act. 14. it is further seen from the records available that the defendant had invoked order 7 rule 11(a) and (d) of cpc seeking the court's intervention to reject the plaint in c.o.s. no.118 of 2021 by way of i.a.no.2 of 2022, which was filed on 07.02.2022, for the said i.a., a counter was also filed by the plaintiff as early as 11.02.2022. pending the said i.a., the defendant https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 has also filed a written statement on 01.06.2022. the said i.a.no.2 of 2022 came to be decided by the learned district judge, commercial district court, salem on hearing the arguments on both the sides, finally an one line order and decreetal order came to be passed on 28.07.2022 and the said order reads as follows:\"orders pronounced in open court. in the result, the petition is hereby dismissed with costs\" and the decreetal order which reads as follows: (1)that the petition be and the same is hereby dismissed. (2)that the petitioner do pay a sum of rs.1,000/to the respondents to the cost of the petition\". it is seen from the records that the defendant have raised several grounds in the affidavit in support of the petition filed under order 7 rule 11(a) and (d) of cpc, which was primarily on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, maintainability of the suit under the commercial courts act, 2019 and not following the mandatory provisions under commecial courts act, 2015. when the defendant has raised several grounds apart from the said grounds, none of them were discussed by the learned single judge while dismissing i.a.no.2 of 2022. 15. the hon'ble supreme court as well as the high court in various states have consistently held that proper reasons have to be given when the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 lower judiciary is disposing of any applications and no creptic order can be passed, especially one line order dismissing the application, which exhibits clear non application of mind by the said district judge. when the defendant has raised a maintainability and it is the duty of the district judge to answer the reasons for his dismissal and even though the lower court need not answer all the grounds in favour or against any party when a question is raised in the suit that too when application was filed under order 7 rule 11, it becomes the mandatory duty of the district court to discuss the application or non application of order 7 rule 11 cpc, when it has been raised by the parties concerned. for this reason alone, the order impugned in c.r.p. no.3672 of 2022 has to be set aside and when cryptic order is passed in i.a.no.2 of 2022 in cos no.9 of 2022 is unbecoming of the learned district judg, the district court has to rectify. accordingly, crp no.3672 of 2022 is allowed and order passed in i.a.no.2 of 2022 dated 28.07.2022 is set aside. 16. as far as crp no.3800 of 2022 is concerned, the plaintiff had filed i.a.no.4 of 2022 seeking amendment of plaint under order 6 rule 17 of cpc on 06.08.2022 after dismissal of i.a.no.2 of 2022. the amendment petition and the affidavit filed in support to the petition and the details of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 amendment clearly shows that those grounds which were raised for nonmaintainability of the suit in the written statement filed by the defendant, the plaintiff has come forward to rectify the mistakes by amending his plaint and the details sought for amendment are extracted hereunder:\" 1. add the following in between the words, 'years' and 'hindu' in the 2nd line in the plaintiff long cause title in the page no.1 of the plaint, \"consisting of the kartha madhan raj and its members b.niranjani aged 43 years the wife of the kartha and amitha aged 19 years the daughter of the kartha,\" 2. add the following in between the words, 'years' and 'the' in the 2nd line in para no.3 in the page no.1 of the plaint, \"the plaintiff is a licensed money lender\" 3. add the following in between the words 'plaintiff' and 'karur' in the 3rd line in para no.7 in the page no.2 of the plaint, \"at the plaintiff's residence at salem,\" 4. add the following at the end of para no.11 in the page no.3 of the plaint, \"as agreed by the defendant in the promissory notes, from 07.12.2019 to 16.12.2021 for the 1st promissory note and from 18.02.2021 to 16.12.2021 for the 2nd promissory note which comes totally rs.52,67,748/and further accrued interest at the rate of rs.0.033 per hundred per day after 16.12.2021.\" 5. add the following in between the words, 'plaintiff' and 'to' in the 7th line in para no.15 in the page no.4 of the plaint, \"at their residence at salem.\" the said petition seeking for the amendment was resisted by the defendant https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, limitation, non joinder of parties and no cause of action arisen for commercial dispute to invoke the jurisdiction of commercial courts act and for want of proper documents, being filed in support of the plaint averments, the said i.a.no.4 of 2022 was also heard and allowed by the learned district judge, commercial court, salem by an order dated 03.09.2022 and the relevant portion is extracted hereunder:\"12. when considering the transaction involved, this is an ordinary transaction of a money lender, who is a financier referred under section 2(1)(c)(i) of commercial courts act and prima facie this court is vested with jurisdiction to try this suit. a promissory note is a negotiable instrument and when filed in a commercial transaction, it becomes a mercantile document also, between the merchants and traders. therefore, the contentions raised by the respondent / defendant that these amendments introduce a new cause of action, that it alters the nature of the suit cannot sustain and question of estoppel cannot be gone into in this stage which has no relevance at all and the defendant does not lose any of his advantage, if any which accrued to him earlier because of this amendment. though the amendment is allowed, the defence if any which is available to the respondent / defendant is not washed away and he has all the opportunity to raise these aspects in his defence during trial. hence this petition is hereby allowed and there is no order as to cost.\" https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 17. on a careful perusal of the above said order, it is seen that the c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 defendant was given an opportunity to raise her defence during the trial. the learned judge while considering the amendment petition has confined only with regard to the amendment petition, which is the only way to decide the amendment petition as the predecessor has already decided and rejected the petition under order 7 rule 11 (a) and (b) of cpc. though the reasons are not acceptable and not in consonance with the commercial courts act, especially under section 2(1)c(i), this court is not inclined to interefere with the order for the reason that the defendant has always opportunity to raise his defense during trial. the incumbent learned judge has taken note of dismissal of i.a.no.2 of 2022 and passed orders in i.a.no.4 of 2022. 18. now, when we consider the facts under which c.r.p. no.338 of 2023 is filed, it is seen that the said revision is, as against order in i.a.no.6 of 2022, which was filed under order 6 rule 15-a and under section 151 of cpc, seeking to accept statements of truth and the learned district judge, commercial court, salem by an order and decreetal order dated 20.10.2022 has allowed the petition. it is well settled that the statute prescribed under order 6 rule 15-a for filing statement of truth, that ought to have been filed within 120 days from the date of service of summons, i.e., the time limit is 120 days, however, it is seen that the defendant has filed the application to receive the statement of truth on 20.10.2022 with the delay https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 of 249 days. the trial court has allowed the i.a.no.6 of 2022, as the delay is not very huge for the courts not to condone the same and this court finds no infirmity in the order and decreetal order of the district judge, especially, when the parties have brought before the court within the condonable time frame with appropriate reasons stated, the courts have always power to condone the same, hence this court is not inclined to interefere with the order passed in i.a.no. 6 of 2022 as there is no infirmity. accordingly, c.r.p. no.338 of 2023 is dismissed. 19. as far as c.r.p. no.2123 of 2023 is conconcerned, the same has been filed to strike off the plaint in c.o.s. no. 10 of 2023 filed by niranjani, who is none other than wife of madanraj, who is the plaintiff in d c.o.s. no.9 of 2022. though c.o.s.nos.9 of 2022 and 10 of 2023 are two different suits filed by husband and wife against the common defendant, the present revision is also taken along with the three crps by all the respective counsels. the c.o.s. no.10 of 2023 is filed by niranjani, plaintiff therein, invoking section 2(1)(c) of commercial courts act, 2015, seeking for a decree against the defendants therein to pay her a sum of rs.2,84,85,962/along with the accured interest on rs.2,16,00,000/at rs.1/per hundred per month from the date of suit till the date of realisation of the amount. the plaintiff, viz., niranjani has claimed that the defendants https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 were borrowing money on various dates from 24.03.2011 to 18.02.2021 and the defendants borrowed additional loan also and to repay the debts, the defendants issued cheques and on various dates, which on presentation on bank returned as insufficient funds. the plaintiff claims that she is a business woman, financier and an licensed money lender authorised to lend money for interest. when the money was not paid back, she initiated the proceedings under 138 of negotiable instruments act, before the learned judicial magistrate court, salem. when the suit summons were served, the defendants have approached this court by the present revision on the ground that section 12 (a) of the commercial courts act, 2015, which has pre-requisite and mandatory provision for mediation, without which the suit ought not to have been entertained. 20. in the recent judgment of the hon'ble supreme court reported in (2022) 10 supreme court cases 11, [patil automation pvt., ltd., & others vs. rakheja engineers pvt., ltd.,], the hon'ble apex court had an occasion to reset 12(a) of commercial courts act, 2015, and the relevant portions are extracted hereunder:24. he would submit that having regard to the purport of section 12a, the interest of justice would be subserved if the procedure which is adopted by the court in his case is accepted. in other words, if the court after the institution of the suit immediately refers the parties to the mediation, the appellants may not be justified in insisting on pre institution https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judismediation. in this regard, he would emphasisethat pre litigation mediation c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 contemplated in section 12a does not pertain to inherent jurisdiction of a court. while mediation is to be encouraged, the court may not lose sight of the fact that a half-way house between the two extremes has been attempted by the court in the case, which suffices, having regard to the fact also that no penal consequences are provided and no right of the defendant is imperilled. 25. he next draws our attention to the aspect of court fees. he would submit that the plaintiff is bound to pay the whole court fee under the law in question. when the plaint gets rejected under order vii rule 11, the plaintiff suffers a loss of the entire court fee. this is one of the consequences which this court should not lose sight of, it is contended. here again, the procedure which has been adopted in the case is commended for our acceptance as substantial compliance with section 12a which at the same time, will not reach such disastrous consequences for the litigants. he also touches upon the possible consequence of a plea of limitation overwhelming a fresh suit of the plaintiff after rejection of the first suit. 26. section 12a of the act reads as follows: 12a. pre-institution mediation and settlement— (1) a suit, which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief under this act, shall not be instituted unless the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of preinstitution mediation in accordance with such manner and procedure as may be prescribed by rules made by the central government. (2) the central government may, by notification, authorise the authorities constituted under the legal services authorities act, 1987 (39 of 1987), for the purposes of pre-institution mediation. (3) notwithstanding anything contained in the legal services authorities act, 1987 (39 of 1987), the authority authorised by the central government under sub-section (2) shall complete the process of mediation within a period of three months from the date of application made by the plaintiff under sub-section (1): provided that the period of mediation may be extended for a further period of two months with the consent of the parties: provided further that, the period during which the parties remained occupied with the pre-institution mediation, such period shall not be computed for the purpose of limitation under the limitation act, 1963 (36 of 1963). https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 (4) if the parties to the commercial dispute arrive at a settlement, the same shall be educed into writing and shall be signed by the parties to the dispute and the mediator. (5) the settlement arrived at under this section shall have the same status and effect as if it is an arbitral award on agreed terms under subsection (4) of section 30 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996).\" 27. the act was enacted in the year 2015. at the time, the monetary limit for a suit liable to be tried by the commercial court was fixed at rs.1 crore. 51. lastly, we may notice that in prem lala nahata v. chandi prasad sikaria16, justice p.k. balasubramanyan, speaking on behalf of justice s.b. sinha, also held as follows: \"16. order 7 rule 11(d) speaks of the suit being \"barred by any law\". according to black's law dictionary, bar means, a plea arresting a law suit or legal claim. it means as a verb, to prevent by legal objection. according to ramanatha aiyar's law lexicon, \"bar\" is that which obstructs entry or egress; to exclude from consideration. it is therefore necessary to see whether a suit bad for misjoinder of parties or of causes of action is excluded from consideration or is barred entry for adjudication. as pointed out already, on the scheme of the code, there is no such prohibition or a prevention at the entry of a suit defective for misjoinder of parties or of causes of action. the court is still competent to try and decide the suit, though the court may also be competent to tell the plaintiffs either to elect to proceed at the instance of one of the plaintiffs or to proceed with one of the causes of action. on the scheme of the code of civil procedure, it cannot therefore be held that a suit barred for misjoinder of parties or of causes of action is barred by a law, here the code. this may be contrasted with the failure to comply with section 80 of the 16 (2007) 2 scc 551 code. in a case not covered by sub-section (2) of section 80, it is provided in subsection (1) of section 80 that \"no suit shall be instituted\". this is therefore a bar to the institution of the suit and that is why courts have taken the view that in a case where notice under section 80 of the code is mandatory, if the averments in the plaint indicate the absence of a notice, the plaint is liable to be rejected. for, in that case, the entertaining of the suit would be barred by section 80 of the code. the same would be the position when a suit hit by section 86 of the code is filed without pleading the obtaining of consent of the central government if the suit is not for rent from a tenant.\" (emphasis supplied) views of high courts: https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisdiscordant notes? c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 52. in ganga taro vazirani v. deepak raheja17, the learned single judge of the high court of bombay, took the view that section 12a is a procedural provision. the learned single judge found further that when urgent relief is applied for, the procedure under section 12a need not be undergone. it was further observed that it was not, as if, the court lacks inherent jurisdiction to entertain a suit without complying with section 12a. still further, he refers to section 80 of the cpc. he refers to al. ar. 17 2021 scc online bombay 195 vellayan chettiar (decd.) & others v. government of the province of madras through the collector of ramnad at madura & another18, for the proposition that notice thereunder is given for the protection of the authority concerned and he can lawfully waive his right to the notice. reliance was also placed on the judgement in state of a.p. and others v. pioneer builders, a.p.19, wherein this court declined to interfere with the finding that having participated in the proceeding without raising objection about the maintainability of the suit, there would be waiver. learned single judge also took the view that even under section 12a of the act, in a given set of facts, the defendant could be held to have waived his right to set up section 12a. it is further found that, if there is substantial compliance, the plaintiff cannot be non-suited, i.e., if an attempt has been made for settling the dispute, which has failed and, therefore, the plaintiff is constrained to approach the court. it is this judgment, which has been relied upon in both the impugned judgments. 53. however, as pointed out by shri sharath chandran, a division bench of the high court of bombay, in an appeal, has found that the single judge, has erred in his view that section 12a is not mandatory. the division bench proclaimed that section 12a of the act is mandatory. it was further observed that considering the object and purpose of section 12a, being rooted in public interest, there is no question of it being waived. when it came to the order to be passed in the appeal, we notice that the plaintiff contended that the suit was allowed to be filed by the registry because of a confusion in the registry in the initial period, when the amending act came into force. there was oversight. the division bench stayed the suit and the impugned order for three months and referred the parties for mediation. 61.section 35 of the cpc in the schedule, inter alia, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judiscontemplates that in making an order for payment of costs, the c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 court shall have regard to the conduct of the parties and whether any reasonable offer to settle, is made by a party and unreasonably refused by the other party. sections 35(3) and 35(4) read as follows: \"35(3) in making an order for the payment of costs, the court shall have regard to the following circumstances, including— (a) the conduct of the parties; (b) whether a party has succeeded on part of its case, even if that party has not been wholly successful; (c) whether the party had made a frivolous counterclaim leading to delay in the disposal of the case; (d) whether any reasonable offer to settle is made by a party and unreasonably refused by the other party; and (e) whether the party had made a frivolous claim and instituted a vexatious proceeding wasting the time of the court.\" \"35(4) the orders which the court may make under this provision include an order that a party must pay(a) a proportion of another party's costs; (b) a stated amount in respect of another party's costs; (c) costs from or until a certain date; (d) costs incurred before proceedings have begun; (e) costs relating to particular steps taken in the proceedings; (f) costs relating to a distinct part of the proceedings; and (g) interest on costs from or until a certain date.\" [emphasis supplied] 66. we have noticed that a settlement arrived at in prelitigation mediation under section 12a, is to be treated as an award under section 30(4) of the arbitration and conciliation act. section 30(4) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, reads as follows: \"30(4) an arbitral award on agreed terms shall have the same status and effect as any other arbitral award on the substance of the dispute.\" 67. a mediation settlement arrived at under section 89 of the cpc must be scrutinised by the court and only on its imprimatur being given it is effective [see paragraph 40 of afcons infrastructure https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 limited and another v. cherian varkey construction company private limited and others25]. since a settlement under section 12a of the act is accorded the status of an award under the arbitration & conciliation act, it unerringly points to the object of the legislature to make pre-litigation mediation compulsory. we again underscore the vital role, the lawyers engaged can and must discharge in arriving at a just and valid settlement translating into an effective award and therefore, a decree. 68. rule 7 deals with the procedure to be adopted by the mediator. rule 9 enshrines the principle of confidentiality of mediation. the mediator, the parties, their authorised representatives or counsel are to maintain confidentiality about the mediation. rule 9 further declares that the mediator is not to allow stenographic or audio or video 25 (2010) 8 scc 24 recording of the mediation sittings. 84. one of the arguments of shri saket sikri is that, if a plaint is rejected under order vii rule 11, the plaintiff would be saddled with the deprivation of the court fee paid. he would contend that this aspect may be considered, when the court decides the question as to whether the provision is mandatory or not. whenever a plaint is rejected on the ground that the suit is barred under any law, this consequence is inevitable. [we may only, in this context, observe, that under section 4a of the kerala court fee and suit valuation act, 1959, the plaintiff needs to pay only one-tenth of the total court fee at the time of institution of the suit. the balance is to be paid not later than fifteen days from the date of framing of issues, inter alia. section 4a further provides that if the parties further settle the dispute within the period specified or extended by the court for payment of the balance court fee, the plaintiff shall not be called upon to pay the balance court fee.] if a plaint is rejected for failure to give a notice, as contemplated in section 80 of the cpc, the court fee paid, may be lost. equally, for violation of section 69 of the indian partnership act, if the plaint is rejected, the plaintiff loses the court fee. while it may appear to be hard on the plaintiff, the effect of the provision contained in order vii rule 11, cannot be diluted. therefore, we are not impressed by the argument, subject to what we will hold later on\" and the hon'ble supreme court while discussing in the said judgment has also considered various other judgments in the same line of arguments and finally in paragraph no.84, extracted supra, has decided and declared that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 section 12a of the act is mandatory and further any suit instituted violating the mandatory provision of section 12a must be revisited with the rejection of plaint under order 7 rule 11. in fact, the hon'ble apex court has also held that the power to reject can be exercised even suo motu by the courts, applying the said judgment to the present case on hand, this court finds that the defendant having invoked order 7 rule 11 (a) and (d) of cpc in i.a.no.2 of 2022 in c.o.s.no.9 of 2022 and having invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of this court 's intervention under article 227 of constitution of india and superintending power as against cos no.10 of 2023 in both the suits, there are no records to find that the parties have exhausted rule 12a of the commercial courts act, 2015, as mandated by the hon'ble supreme court in the above said judgments, which mandates that c.o.s. no.9 of 2022 and 10 of 2023 on the file of commercial courts, district judge, salem, have failed. in the nutshell, the crps are decided in the following manner: (i) c.r.p.no.3672 of 2022, which is filed against the one line docket order passed in i.a.no.2 of 2022 [filed to reject the plaint in cos no.9 of 2022 on various grounds including the ground of mainatainability] dated 28.07.2022 is set aside and the said crp is allowed. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 (ii) since the above said crp no.3672 of 2022 is allowed, i.a.no.4 of 2022, seeking amendment of plaint in cos no.9 of 2022, which was allowed by order dated 03.09.2022 is hereby setaside, thereby the crp no.3800 of 2022 is allowed. (iii) c.r.p.no.338 of 2023, which is filed against the docket order dated 20.10.2022 in i.a.no.6 of 2022 [filed to accept the statement of truth] cannot be interefered with and the said crp is dismissed. (iii) c.r.p.no.2123 of 2023, which is filed to strike off the plaint in cos no.10 of 2023 on the file of learned district judge, commercial court, salem is hereby allowed and the plaint in cos no.10 of 2023 is hereby rejected for want of compliance of section 12-a of the commercial courts act, 2015. (iv) it is left open to the parties to work out their remedies available under the act, as held and directed by the hon'ble apex court. consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed. no costs. 30.11.2023 index:yes/no; internet:yes/no speaking / nonspeaking order ssd https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 to the commercial district judge, salem v.bhavani subbaroyan j. ssd c.r.p.nos.3672, 3800 of 2022 and 338 and 2123 of 2023 c.m.p.nos.19457, 20005 of 2022 and 12931 of 2023 30.11.2023 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis"
