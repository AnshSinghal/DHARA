Rfa No 04 of 2018 was filed on 05.10.2018 against the judgment and decree dated 30.07.2018 (impugned judgment and M/s Thomas Enterprises & Anr. vs. M/s Yuksom Breweries Ltd.  decree) passed by the learned District Judge, South Sikkim, at Namchi (the learned District Judge) in Money Suit No.3 of 2016 (Money Suit) . It was dealt with by the learned Single Judge of this court from 25.10.2018 till 22.10.2021. On examination the learned Single Judge came to a prima facie view that the matter pertained to a commercial dispute and ought to be tried as per the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (Commercial Act). In terms of Circular No.06/HCS/Judl. dated 27.04.2021 of this court the matter was directed to be placed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice for appropriate directions. On 22.10.2021 the Hon'ble Chief Justice of this court revoked Circular No.6/HCS/Judl. dated 27.04.2021. Pursuant thereto the matter came up for hearing before this Division Bench. \n2. We have heard Mr. Anmole Prasad, learned Senior Advocate for the appellant and Mr. Jorgay Namka, learned counsel for the respondent. Both the learned counsel expressed their view that since the dispute between the parties had not been tried as a commercial dispute there has arisen a legal conundrum and the only way out is to set aside the impugned judgment and decree and transfer the Money Suit to the Commercial Court.\n3. The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 came M/s Thomas Enterprises & Anr. vs. M/s Yuksom Breweries Ltd. into force on 23.10.2015. It was amended in the year 2018 and is now called the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (the Act). 4 Section 2 (1) (c) defines commercial dispute. The learned counsel for the parties agrees that the dispute in the present matter is a commercial dispute. The Money Suit filed by the respondent sought a decree against the appellants for a sum of Rs.1,29,00,728/- along with interest @ 12% per annum on and from 01.04.2014 till realization. It was the respondent's case that the appellant no.1 had been assigned its marketing/distribution work as its sole agent for the North Bengal region. The respondent relied upon memorandum of understanding and an agreement of agency between them as well as a promissory note executed by the appellant no.2. Considering the nature of the dispute it is apparent that it is a commercial dispute. 5 Vide Notification No.27/HCS/Judl. dated 20.08.2016 the Hon'ble Chief Justice in exercise of powers vested on him under Section 5(1) of the Act constituted the Commercial Appellate Division in this court to deal with appeals arising from orders/judgments/decrees passed by the Commercial Courts/Commercial Division as provided under Section 13 of the Act. \n6 The Government of Sikkim vide Notification No.58/Home/2016 dated 06.10.2016 in exercise of the powers M/s Thomas Enterprises & Anr. vs. M/s Yuksom Breweries Ltd. conferred by Section 3 of the Act designated the District & Sessions Court of all the four districts as \"Commercial Courts\"\nand the Judges of the District & Sessions Courts as the Judges of the Commercial Courts for the purpose of adjudicating commercial disputes within their respective jurisdiction with immediate effect.\n7 Section 6 of the Act provides for jurisdiction of the Commercial Courts. It has jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value arising out of the entire territory of the State over which it has been vested territorial jurisdiction. Section 2 (1) (i) defines specified value. Specified value, in relation to a commercial dispute, shall mean the value of the subject-matter in respect of a suit as determined in accordance with Section 12 which shall not be less than three lakh rupees or such higher value, as may be notified by the Central Government. Section 12 provides how specified value ought to be determined in a suit, appeal or application. \n8. Section 12-A of the Act mandates a pre-institution mediation and settlement. A suit which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief under the Act, shall not be instituted unless the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of pre-institution mediation in accordance with such manner and procedure as may be M/s Thomas Enterprises & Anr. vs. M/s Yuksom Breweries Ltd. prescribed by rules made by the Central Government. The Central Government may, by notification, authorise the authorities constituted under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 (LSA Act) for the purposes of pre-institution mediation. The Authority authorized by the Central Government is required to complete the process of mediation within a period of three months from the date of application made by the plaintiff. This period could be extended for a further period of two months with the consent of the parties. A settlement arrived at is required to be reduced into writing and signed by the parties and the mediator. The settlement shall have the same status as if it is an arbitral award on agreed terms under sub-section (4) of Section 30 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (the Arbitration Act). Notification No. S.O.3232(E), dated 3rd July, 2018 is a notification issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 12-A of the Act authorising the State Authority and the District Authority constituted under the LSA Act for the purposes of pre-institution mediation and settlement under Chapter III A of the Act. \n9. Section 15(2) of the Act provides that all suits and applications, including applications under the Arbitration Act relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in any Civil Court in any District or area in respect of which a M/s Thomas Enterprises & Anr. vs. M/s Yuksom Breweries Ltd. Commercial Court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such Commercial Court. The Money Suit was filed before the learned District Judge in August, 2016. At that time although the Act had been enforced, the Commercial Courts had yet not been constituted. However, after the constitution of the Commercial Courts in terms of Section 15(2) of the Act on 06.10.2016 the Money Suit was required to be transferred to the Commercial Court. This was apparently and admittedly not done. Resultantly, the Money Suit was not dealt in the manner required under the Act. \n10. An earnest glance of the Act makes it evident that commercial disputes are required to be dealt with as per the provisions of the Act. The procedure prescribed is different than how a Money Suit is dealt with under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC). Section 16 of the Act relates to the amendment to the CPC. The CPC stands amended in the manner as specified in the schedule. The schedule is an exhaustive list of amendments and substitutions of various provisions of the CPC. Section 16(2) mandates that the Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Act in the trial of a suit in respect of the commercial dispute. Section 16(3) provides that where any provision of any rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the CPC, by the State Government is M/s Thomas Enterprises & Anr. vs. M/s Yuksom Breweries Ltd. in conflict with the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Act, the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Act shall prevail. \n11. Section 13 of the Act provides for appeals from decrees of Commercial Court and Commercial Division. The present Regular First Appeal has not been preferred under Section 13 of the Act but under Order XLI, Rule 1 and 2 of CPC. Resultantly, it was placed and considered by the learned Single Judge of this court although in terms of Section 5 of the Act and Notification No.27/HCS/Judl. dated 20.08.2016 it ought to have been heard by a Division Bench. \n12. In terms of Section 15(2) of the Act after the constitution of the Commercial Courts in Sikkim the court of the learned District Judge which tried the Money Suit would have lost jurisdiction to try it as it related to a commercial dispute and ought to have been transferred to the jurisdictional Commercial Court which had been constituted. The failure of the learned District Judge to examine and transfer the Money Suit to the Commercial Court has resulted in defeating the very object of the enactment of the Act to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes. \n13. We are thus of the considered view that the impugned judgment and decree dated 30.07.2018 passed by the learned District Judge in the Money Suit must be set aside and the M/s Thomas Enterprises & Anr. vs. M/s Yuksom Breweries Ltd. Money Suit transferred to the files of the Commercial Court. The Money Suit shall then be tried by the Commercial Court as per the provisions of the Act. It is accordingly ordered. Pending application is also disposed. \n      (Bhaskar Raj Pradhan)                             (Meenakshi M.

as contemplated in the notification referred herein above irrespective of its judge being lower in hierarchy than the district judge. since the commercial court lower in hierarchy that the district level is not contemplated under subsection (1) of section 3, there would be no question of institution of the execution petition with the district judge and transfer by him under section 39 of cpc to the court lower in hierarchy than the such district judge. the principal civil court in the district court as defined in section 2 (1) (e) of the arbitration and conciliation act read with section 3 of the commercial courts act, in respect of the commercial disputes, would be the commercial court at the district level as constituted under subsection (1) of section 3 of the later act and would be the court competent to execute awards declared under section 34 of the arbitration act other than those relating to international arbitration. by virtue of the notification above referred, as also by c/ao/216/2018 order virtue of the provisions referred to herein above, the court contemplated in the notification, irrespective of the designation of the judge would be the commercial court at district level; and in absence of contemplation of commercial court of the lower hierarchy than the district level, in the commercial court act, it would execute the decree without transferring it under section 39 cpc.\" 9. mr. bharat kumar also relied upon the judgment of hon'ble supreme court of india in the case of radhey shyam & anr. vs. chhabi nath & ors. reported in (2015) 5 scc 423, in support of its contention that challenges to judicial order can lie by way of a petition under article 227 of the constitution of india. 10. hence, it is submitted by mr. kumar that the said impugned order dated 27.04.2019 passed by the district judge-xivcum-presiding officer, commercial court, dhanbad in execution case no. 29 of 2019 be quashed and set aside and the commercial court at dhanbad be directed to proceed ahead with the said execution case no. 29 of 2019 as per law. 11. learned counsel for the opposite partiesrespondents, mr. mitul kumar, submits that there is no infirmity or illegality in the impugned order, hence, the impugned order does not attract indulgence of this court. it is further submitted by mr. mitul kumar, that conduct of the petitioner is not fair and the vehicle has forcibly been repossessed by the goons of the petitioner company in bihar and after repossession, the petitioner company is still running the said vehicle standing in the name of respondent no. 1, hence it is submitted that there is no merit in this writ petition nor there is any merit in the execution petition which has rightly been dismissed by the learned court below. it is then submitted that this writ petition being without any merit, be dismissed. 12. having heard the submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner and after going through the materials in the record, this court finds force in the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner; as it is crystal clear that after amendment of section 2(1)(i) of the commercial courts act by the amendment act 28 of 2018, the \"specified value\" of the commercial courts established under section 3(1) of the commercial courts act, 2015 to be determined in accordance with section 12 of the said act is \"not less than three lakhs rupees\"; which in other words means an amount of rupees three lakhs or more with effect from 03.05.2018. as rightly submitted by mr. kumar, in the absence of any notification under section 3 (1-a) of the said commercial courts act, 2015 as amended by the said act 28 of 2018, the commercial court at dhanbad having been established under section 3(1) of the commercial courts act by the notification dated 24th may, 2016 will have its revised \"specified value\" of \"not less than three lakhs rupees\" w.r.e.f. 03.05.2018 instead of \"not less than rupees one crore\" as it stood fixed prior to 03.05.2018. 13. so far as the submission of mr. mitul kumar, learned counsel for the opposite partiesrespondents regarding merits of the case of the execution petition is concerned, learned commercial court, dhanbad has not applied its mind towards the merit of the case, hence, at this stage, this court expresses no opinion regarding merits of the execution petition and the respondents are free to raise all their contentions made in the counter affidavit filed in this case; before commercial court, dhanbad at the appropriate stage. 14. in view of the position of law as discussed above, this court is of the considered view that the impugned order dated 27.04.2019 passed by the presiding officer, commercial court, dhanbad in execution case no. 29 of 2019 by dismissing the said execution petition on the ground that the commercial court, dhanbad has no pecuniary jurisdiction is not sustainable in law and is liable to be set aside. 15. accordingly the impugned order dated 27.04.2019 passed by the district judge-xiv-cum-presiding officer, commercial court, dhanbad in execution case no. 29 of 2019 is quashed and set aside and this writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the commercial court at dhanbad to proceed with execution case no. 29 of 2019 in accordance with law, from the stage where it was, on the date said impugned order dismissing the said execution case no. 29 of 2019, was passed. 16. it is made clear that this court has not expressed any opinion regarding contention raised by the respondents in their counter-affidavit in this case and the commercial court, dhanbad is free to make its own independent order in respect of the said grounds, without being prejudiced by this order of this court, if and when, the said issues are agitated before it.
