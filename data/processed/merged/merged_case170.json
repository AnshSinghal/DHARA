Mohta, J.): \n-\nThis Commercial Appeal is filed by the Appellant-Original Defendant against the Judgment and order dated 6 June 2016, passed by the learned Single Judge of the Commercial Division in Summons for Judgment whereby, refused an unconditional leave to defend and has granted a leave to defend, but conditional. \nPreliminary objection to the maintainability of Commercial Appeal. \n2 To decide the preliminary objection of the maintainability of Commercial Appeal as filed, as raised by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Respondents, though the parties have consented to hear the Appeal on merits, we have re-listed the matter for hearing on ssm/dgm 3 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw the maintainability as it goes to the root of the matter in view of the confusion prevailing in the Office/Registry after the transfer of such pending summary suits because of the provisions of The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (for short, \"The Commercial Courts Act\"). \nBackground of proceedings-\n3 The following are the background dates of the proceedings as per the Respondent-Plaintiff (Idbi) to decide the maintainability of the Commercial Appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, apart from decision on merits. \nOn 11/09/14, Summary Suit No.776 of 2014 was filed by the Respondent (Plaintiff) (Idbi) on 11 September 2014, seeking a decree in the sum of over Rs.33 crores. \nDuring the pendency of the Summary Suit, the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division, Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Ordinance, 2015 (the Ordinance) was promulgated on 23 October 2015 with immediate effect. The Ordinance inter alia provided for the constitution of Commercial ssm/dgm 4 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Divisions in High Courts having ordinary original civil jurisdiction. \nAn order/notice dated 17 November, 2015 was issued by the then Hon'ble the Acting Chief Justice constituting the Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division under Sections 4 and 5 of the Ordinance. \nThe then Hon'ble Acting Chief Justice also issued an Assignment Order dated 22 December, 2015 of the Original Side of this Court to take effect from 4 January 2016, constituting the Commercial Division and the Commercial Appellate Division of this High Court and nominating Judges for the same. Mr. Justice S.C. Gupte was nominated as the \"Commercial Division\" of this Court and assigned all summary suits, i.e. including the present Summary Suit. \nAssignment Order dated 22 December 2015, was the order constituting the Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division. The Commercial Courts Act does not prescribe any particular form of the order to constitute such Divisions. The Chief Justice is required to pass only an administrative order, not a judicial order. \nOn 1 January, 2016, the Commercial Courts Act came to be notified in the Official Gazette with effect from 23 October 2015. \nssm/dgm 5 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw On 4 January 2016, the Commercial Divisions and the Commercial Appellate Divisions as constituted, have commenced functioning accordingly. On 7 January 2016, and from time to time thereafter, the Assignment Orders were varied as under :\na) Notice dated 7 January 2016 in partial modification of the Assignment order dated 22 December 2015.\nb) Assignment order dated 3 March 2016 with effect from 7 March 2016.\nc) Assignment order dated 15 March 2016 with effect from 21 March 2016.\nd) Assignment order dated 19 August 2016 with effect from 22 August 2016. \nAt all relevant times, the learned Judge continued to be nominated as the \"Commercial Division\" of this Court assigned to hear all summary suits, including the present summary suit. \n4 The Summons for Judgment in the Summary Suit was argued finally on merits by the counsel for the parties before the Commercial Division on 12 and 14 January 2016 and was reserved for orders on 14 January 2016. \nOn 13 May 2016, pending the final order in the Summons for Judgment, the captioned Summary Suit was formally transferred by a notice issued by the High Court (along with several other suits and proceedings) to the Commercial Divisions of this Court. The ssm/dgm 6 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw impugned order dated 6 June 2016 granting the conditional leave to defend the suit was passed by the learned Single Judge. \n5 On 12 July 2016, this Appeal was filed as a Commercial Appeal before this assigned Commercial Appellate Division of this Court. On 29 August 2016, this Appeal by consent, was heard finally on merits at the admission stage and the matter was closed for orders. \nThe time to deposit has been extended till this date. \nOn 1 September 2016 and 16 September 2016 , this Appeal was listed for directions and submissions on the question of the maintainability of this Appeal. \n6 Admittedly, for the Letters Patent Appeals under the Letters Patent Act, another Division Bench has been assigned to deal with the same. Apart from above, the submission is made that they have already moved a praecipe for passing final order even on merits, in either situation, by this Bench as we have already heard the matter on merits also. The Hon'ble the Chief Justice has passed order on 14 ssm/dgm 7 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw October 2016, accordingly. \nThe Commercial Courts Act-\n7 To provide for the constitution of Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts for adjudicating commercial disputes of specified value and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. \nIt is relevant to note that Law Commission of India in its 253 Report has recommended the establishment of Commercial Courts, the Commercial Division and the Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts for disposal of commercial disputes of specified value. \n9 On 23 December 2015, the Commercial Courts Act, having retrospective effect from 23 October 2015 by repealing the ordinance with the following rider has been promulgated-\n\"Section 23 -

In the decisions in Shah Babulal Khimji v. Jayaben D. Kania & Anr.1 and Midnapore Peoples' Co-op. Bank Ltd v. Chunilal Nanda,2 the Supreme Court observed as under :\n\"82. We now proceed to deal with the main controversy as to what is the true scope, meaning and purport of the word 'judgment' used in Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. Numerous authorities on both sides were cited before us in the course of the very able arguments advanced by counsels for the parties and it appears that there are three leading judgments which have spelt out certain tests to determine as to when an order passed by a Trial Judge can be said to be a 'judgment' within the meaning of. clause 15 of the Letters Patent. A very narrow view on this point was taken by a Division Bench Of the Calcutta High Court in the case of The Justice of the Peace for Calcutta (supra) where Sir Couch, C.J. On an interpretation of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent observed thus:-\nWe think that \"judgment\" in clause 15 means a decision which affects the merits of the question between the parties by determining some right or liability. It may be either final, or preliminary, or interlocutory, the difference between them being that a final judgment determines the whole cause or suit, and a preliminary or interlocutory judgment determines only a part of it, leaving other matters to be determined.\n\"113 ..........(3) Intermediary or Interlocutory judgment-Most of the interlocutory orders which contain the quality of finality are clearly specified in clauses (a) to (w) of Order 43 Rule 1 and have already been held by us to be judgments within the meaning of the Letters Patent and, therefore, appealable. There may also be interlocutory orders which are not covered by Order 43 Rule 1 but which also possess the characteristics and trappings of finality in that, the orders may adversely affect a valuable right of the party or decide an important aspect of the trial in an ancillary proceeding. 1 (1981) 4 Scc 8 2 Air 2006 Sc 2190 ssm/dgm 17 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Before such an order can be a judgment the adverse effect on the party concerned must be direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote. For instance, where the Trial Judge in a suit under Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure refuses the defendant leave to defend the suit, the order directly affects the defendant because he loses a valuable right to defend the suit and his remedy is confined only to contest the plaintiff's case on his own evidence without being given a chance to rebut that evidence. As such an order vitally affects a valuable right of the defendant it will undoubtedly be treated as a judgment within the meaning of the Letters Patent so as to be appealable to a larger Bench.\"....... \nThe Supreme Court in Midnapore Peoples' Co.op Bank Ltd.\n(Supra) has observed in para 16 as under:-\n\"16. Interim orders/interlocutory orders passed during the pendency of a case, fall under one or the other of the following categories:\n(i) Orders which finally decide a question or issue in controversy in the main case.\n(ii) Orders which finally decide an issue which materially and directly affects the final decision in the main case. \n(iii) Orders which finally decide a collateral issue or question which is not the subject matter of the main case. \n(iv) Routine orders which are passed to facilitate the progress of the case till its culmination in the final judgment. \n(v) Orders which may cause some inconvenience or some prejudice to a party, but which do not finally determine the rights and obligations of the parties. \nThe term 'judgment' occurring in Clause 15 of the Letters Patent will take into its fold not only the judgments as defined in Section 2(9) Cpc and orders enumerated in Order 43 Rule 1 of Cpc, but also other orders which, though may not finally ssm/dgm 18 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw and conclusively determine the rights of parties with regard to all or any matters in controversy, may have finality in regard to some collateral matter, which will affect the vital and valuable rights and obligations of the parties. Interlocutory orders which fall under categories (i) to (iii) above, are, therefore, 'judgments' for the purpose of filing appeals under the Letters Patent. On the other hand, orders falling under categories (iv) and (v) are not 'judgments' for purpose of filing appeals provided under the Letters Patent.\" \n(Emphasis added) The scheme of Commercial Courts Act-\n15 The terms \"Commercial Court\", \"Commercial Division\" and \"Commercial Appellate Division\" have been defined under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Commercial Courts Act. The constitution of the Commercial Courts is by the State Government which are at district level in territories other than the territories where the High Court has ordinary original civil jurisdiction. The constitution by the State Government is subject to the condition of consultation with the concerned High Court by publishing a notification in the Official Gazette specifying the local limits of jurisdiction of the Commercial Courts. It is also subject to nomination of one or more persons having experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be a Judge or Judges of Commercial Courts. \nssm/dgm 19 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 16 The constitution of Commercial Division of High Court is also subject to the order of Chief Justice of High Court consisting of Commercial Division, having one or more Branches consisting of a Hon'ble Judge/Judges. The Chief Justice of High Court, by the nomination, has appointed the Judges of High Court who have experience in dealing with the commercial disputes. The constitution of Commercial Appellate Division by the nomination, is also by the order of Chief Justice of the High Court, keeping in mind to nominate such Judges of High Court, who have experience in dealing with the commercial disputes. \n17 Chapter Ii of the Commercial Courts Act deals with the constitution of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions at various levels/courts. There is no issue that Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions are required to be constituted as per the prescribed provisions so referred above. The order/nomination by the Chief Justice in case of Commercial Division and the Commercial ssm/dgm 20 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Appellate Division is thus sufficient so far as the constitution of such Divisions under the Commercial Courts Act. The requirement of notification/ order by the State Government in consultation with the Chief Justice is also the requirement of the Act for the constitution of Commercial Courts in the district area/territories. So far as the Government of Maharashtra is concerned, a notification dated 13 June 2016 was issued under Section 3(1) constituting a Commercial Court in each district and in some places, Judges have been appointed to preside over the Commercial Court by appointment order dated 21 July 2016. As noted, the Commercial Divisions of the Bombay High Court have been constituted from time to time by nomination and so also the Commercial Appellate Divisions of High Court as contemplated under Sections 4 and 5 of The Commercial Courts Act. \n18 In view of Section 2(1)(c) of Commercial Courts Act, in view of definition of \"commercial dispute\" and \"specified value\" and as the summary suits fall within the definition of \"commercial dispute\" and the valuation of the ssm/dgm 21 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw subject matter exceeds one crore, the provisions of Commercial Courts Act would apply to such Suits, Petitions and Applications and the Appeal in question. There is no issue on this. \n19 Section 6 empowers the Commercial Court to try and hear all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute based upon the valuation so recorded above which is subject to territorial jurisdiction. All suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute where the subject matter exceeds Rupees one crore and which are pending in any Civil Court in any District shall be transferred to the Commercial Courts so constituted is the mandate of Section 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act. \nSection 7 empowers \"Commercial Division\" of High Court to hear \"All suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of the stated value of the subject matter which are filed in High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction\". \nThis includes all suits/applications filed before the commencement of the Commercial Courts Act/Ordinance and ssm/dgm 22 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw even the constitution of Commercial Division. This also includes all fresh suits, applications filed after the commencement of the Act and/or constitution of the Commercial Division provided it should be 'commercial disputes', having the valuation of the subject matter exceeding one crore. The mandate of Section 15(1) of the Commercial Courts Act is applicable even for all suits and applications pending in the High Court where commercial Division has been constituted - It shall be transferred to the Commercial Division of the High Court. It is, therefore, clear that Commercial Courts Act, in view of above provisions so reproduced is made applicable retrospectively and would take into its ambit all pending suits, petitions and applications relating to commercial dispute of the specified value and specified disputes. \nTherefore, all such suits, petitions and applications pending or fresh, will be governed by the Commercial Courts Act with effect from 23.10.2015. This is also clear, therefore, that all the rights in regard to pending suits, petitions and applications shall be governed by the Commercial Courts Act, once transferred. \nThe Commercial Court Appeal against Decision/Judgment/order/decree-\nssm/dgm 23 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 20 The jurisdiction of the Commercial Appellate Division as provided in Chapter Ii and specifically Section 13 provides that the Commercial Appellate Division of a High Court has jurisdiction to hear Appeals from decisions, judgments, orders or decrees passed by the Commercial Division of that High Court or by Commercial Courts within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the High Court. \n21 After giving due consideration to the provisions of Section 13(1) read with Section 13(2) it is apparent that it provides that Appeals will lie to the Commercial Appellate Division against the decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division. The words \"decision\", \"Judgment\", \"Order\" \"decree\" as such are not defined. It is defined and elaborated under the Cpc. From Section 13(1) it follows that it includes \"judgment\" or \"order\" and read with Sections 8, 13(2) it includes \"decree\" of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division.\nHowever, it is specifically mentioned in proviso to Section 13(1) that such orders as enumerated in Order Xliii of Cpc should be the order against which an Appeal against order is maintainable under Section\n13. Further the proviso contemplates that an Appeal would lie against appealable order under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation ssm/dgm 24 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Act, 1996. Section 13(2) has restricted the Appeals even for Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act by rider that \"no Appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court other than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\". This is also with \"notwithstanding\" clause under Section 13(2) whereby, it is mandated that \"notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of High Court\".\nTherefore, taking into consideration the overall provisions and intent of Section 13(1)and (2) which provides the specific orders against which an Appeal can be filed in such commercial matters. The Appeal under Section 13 is maintainable, once the Suits, Petitions Applications and Appeals are transferred and treated as commercial disputes having specified value, where the learned Commercial Division Judge has taken the decision and/or passed the \"judgment\"\nand/or \"order\" or \"decree\". It is relevant to note that under Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act, it is mandated and reinforced that the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act will prevail over the provisions of other Act. Therefore, an Appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act is maintainable against the decision/ judgment/ order or decree, if it falls within the ambit of the provisions ssm/dgm 25 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw of the Commercial Courts Act. This includes that the subject matter must be commercial dispute having valuation of more than one crore and falls within the territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction of the respective Court and/or Division and/or subject to the specific provisions like the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, read with the special statutes and the provisions so required, referred under umbrella of \"commercial dispute\" so defined. \nAppeal against any final decision include the judgment so passed by the Commercial Court and/or Commercial Division, the proviso to Section 13(1) will not be applicable to such decision/judgment, as the proviso refers to \"orders\". The reference to \"orders\" in the opening portion of Section 13(1) would relate to the application of the proviso to sub-section (1). However, the opening portion of sub-section (1) (words prior to the proviso) clearly use the words \"decision\", \"judgment\" and \"order\". Therefore, the ambit of this part of sub-section (1) is quite broader when it comes to appeals arising out of orders other than the category of orders falling under order Xliii of the Cpc. Therefore, an Appeal under Section 13(1), even if there is an order, but which has a tinge or colour of judgment ssm/dgm 26 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw as laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji v. Jayaben D. Kania & anr3 and Midnapore Peoples' Co-op. \nBank Ltd. (supra) , the Appeal under Section 13 against such order being a \"judgment\" within the meaning of Cpc, is maintainable. The provisions of Cpc (amended and unamended) are applicable to the Commercial Courts Act's proceedings. The term \"Judgment\" was not even defined under the Letters Patent Act. \nIn the summary suit, though it is an interlocutory order of granting Defendants conditional leave to defend such summary suit, as it directly affects and loses the valuable rights of the Defendant without giving full opportunity and as transferred and as heard by the learned Commercial Division Bench/Judge, the Commercial Appeal against such \"Judgment\" is maintainable. Therefore, we are of the view that there is no reason to hold that the Commercial Appeal as filed is not maintainable. \n\"Summary Suit\" and \"Summary Judgment\"-\n24 The conceptual position of \"summary suit\" as contemplated under Order Xxxvii of Cpc and its specific 3 (1981) 4 Scc 8 ssm/dgm 27 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw provisions are governed as per the original provisions of Cpc. \nThe amended Cpc, in view of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act inserted the provision for a \"summary judgment\", through Order Xiii-A which is made applicable to the classes of Suits (commercial suits) which required to be decided by the Commercial Division/Court. It prescribes the procedure and stages for application for summary judgment. This also includes and provides the powers of a Commercial Judge to pass conditional order including for evidence for hearing of summary judgment. We are concerned with Order Xiii-A, Rule 1(3) of Cpc, whereby it is specifically provided \"notwithstanding anything to the contrary, \"an application\" for summary judgment under this Order shall not be made in a Suit in respect of any commercial disputes that is originally filed as a summary suit under Order Xxxvii.\". Therefore, once the summary suit as originally filed, prior to the commencement of the and as now transferred, being commercial dispute matter, the original procedure as provided under Order Xxxvii shall be applicable to such summary suits. The parties are not entitled to prayer for summary judgment under Xiii-A in view of the specific ssm/dgm 28 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw provision so referred above. This also means that the judgments and the issues so decided in summary suit shall for all purposes be governed by the Cpc, even after such suits are transferred as commercial suits. The Commercial Division Judge is required to follow the original C.P.C. and is required to keep in mind the position in law revolving around all the facets of summary suits. The provisions of Section 13, therefore, is required to be interpreted and/or considered accordingly, when any decision is given by the Commercial Division/Court in such summary suit. The proviso to Section 13(1), will not affect the maintainability of such Appeal so filed against such order/judgment passed by the Commercial Division/Court in such summary suit. \n25 The submission that Section 13 proviso has extinguished, expressly and/or by necessary intentment the Appeal against the order passed by the Commercial Judge in summary suit granting the Defendant conditional leave to defend a summary suit is unacceptable. Section 13 itself contemplates that an Appeal is maintainable against the ssm/dgm 29 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw decision/judgment or order which has effect of \"judgment\", though it falls outside the purview of Order Xliii as observed above. \nThe right of appeal is creation of statute-\n26 It is settled that a right of Appeal is not a matter of procedure, but it is a matter of a substantive right which accrues to the litigant and as exists on the date of suit being instituted (see The Constitutional Bench decision in Garikapati Veeraya Vs. N. Subbiah Choudhry & Ors 4., para 23) Such right of Appeal is governed by the law prevailing at the date of the institution of the suit or proceedings and not by the law that prevails at the date of its decision or at the date of filing of the Appeal. It is equally settled that a vested right of Appeal is not absolute; and that it can in fact be abrogated either explicitly or by implicit intendment. [Kamal Kumar Dutta vs. Ruby General Hospital5]. The Commercial Courts Act provides for an Appeal against the decision, judgment and order so referred above. An Appeal is available if the commercial 4 Air 1957 Sc 540 5 (2006) 7 Scc 613 ssm/dgm 30 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw suit/dispute is dealt with by the Commercial Division/Commercial Court and passes order/judgment and/or take decision. This statutory Appeal as provided, therefore, cannot be taken away notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court [Section 13(2)]. The Commercial Courts Act or special Statute, if empowers, the Appellate Division Court to deal with the Appeal against the Judgment/order passed by the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court, the bar so submitted of proviso to Section 13(1) is not applicable in each and every matter specifically when the subject matters are commercial disputes as defined under the Commercial Courts Act and are also governed by the Special Act/Statute other than the Cpc. The specific provisions/ Statute/ Act will prevail as substantial rights, if are created over the provisions of Order Xliii Cpc, as provided in proviso to Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. \nFiling of Appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, cannot be occluded-\nssm/dgm 31 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 27 Section 13 Scheme itself provides Appeal against decision which includes judgment/order passed by the Commercial Division/Court. There is no provision of revision against the interlocutory order in view of bar of Section 8. Section 8 further clarifies that only Appeal against such order is available subject to Section 13 proviso. Even the issue of jurisdiction or such challenge will be subject to Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. Therefore, the aggrieved parties have no option but to file Appeal against the decision/order. The Appellate Court, however, may or may not entertain appeal against the order or interlocutory order, in view of proviso to Section 13(1). But filing of Appeal under Section 13, in our view, cannot be occluded. The Appeal against any decision of any Commercial Division/Court is maintainable. To entertain or not is the Appellate Court's power and the jurisdiction depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case. \nThe effect of not permitting to file the Commercial Appeal, in such matters-\n28 Another factor is, if such Appeals are not permitted, the aggrieved parties shall have no option but to invoke ordinary jurisdiction of the High Court or Court to challenge the interlocutory ssm/dgm 32 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw order or order though the decision is by the Commercial Division/Court, as commercial disputes are transferred and governed by the Commercial Courts Act for all the purposes. Such dichotomy, in our view, is surely not the intention of the legislature as followed from a cumulative reading of the various provisions as noted by us. \nThe filing of such Commercial Appeal by the party in the ordinary Court, except where suit/application, valuation is less than one crore, therefore, is not what is contemplated. It will frustrate the ambit and object of the Commercial Courts Act. \nThe commercial disputes of specified valued shall be governed by the Commercial Act only-\n29 There is no scope to any authority, not to transfer the commercial suits, having one crore and above valuation, for the purpose of pecuniary jurisdiction under the Commercial Courts Act, in case of a commercial dispute. The State Government needs to take steps as contemplated under Sections 19 and 20 of the Commercial Courts Act. All and every concerned authority are bound to aid and assist to give effect to these provisions to all the pending Suits/Applications, to achieve the object of the Commercial Courts Act. All are bound by the provisions, including amended Cpc to ssm/dgm 33 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw expedite the pending Suits filed prior or post the Commercial Courts Act. The Appeals are also expedited by the provisions so also pending Arbitration Petitions/Appeals as specified, though filed prior to the enforcement of the Commercial Courts Act. Sections 10, 13 and 15 deal with the pending Arbitration matters, including Appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The Supreme Court in a recent decision in Arun Dev Upadhyaya Vs. Integrated Sales Service Ltd. & Anr.6, now has expanded and included even the Appeal under Section 50 of the Arbitral Act in the facts of the case. It needs to be subject to valuation of the Suit/Appeal. \n30 We are also inclined to observe that the vested right of Appeal is not taken away by the Commercial Courts Act. However, it is subject to Section 13 so recorded above and/or Section 13 in no manner takes away and/or extinguishes right of Appeal in pending summary suits which are transferred and dealt with by the Commercial Division/Court. \n31 Having once observed that the Appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act is maintainable, we are dealing with the 6 2016(9) Scale 427 ssm/dgm 34 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw merits of the matters on the facts and in the background already reflected/mentioned in the initial paras. \n32 The background of the litigations between the parties is relevant for consideration of this Appeal on merits. \nThe Respondent (Plaintiff) is a Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and is a Debenture Trustee of the debentures issued to Vinca Developer Private Limited (\"Vinca\") by Amazia Developers Private Limited (\"Amazia\") and Rubix Trading Private Limited (\"Rubix\"). Amazia and Rubix are wholly owned subsidiaries of Vinca. The Appellant (Defendant) and its individual promoters collectively own 90 per cent shareholding in Vinca. \nNederlandse Financierings - Maatschappiji Voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (\"Fmo\") is a Corporation constituted under the Laws of Netherlands. Fmo holds 10 per cent shareholding in Vinca. Fmo also holds 3 Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (CCDs) issued by Vinca.\nThe said three CCDs were convertible within a period of 60 months from December 2009. Upon such conversion, Fmo would hold 90% shareholding in Vinca. The investment made by Fmo in Vinca in the form of three CCDs was used by Vinca to purchase Optionally ssm/dgm 35 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Convertible Debentures (\"OPCDs\") issued by Amazia and Rubix. In respect of the OPCDs, a Debenture Subscription and Debenture Trust cum Mortgage Deed was executed on 1 December 2009 between Amazia, the Defendant and the Plaintiff. Similarly in respect of the OPCDs issued by Rubix, a Debenture Subscription and Debenture Trust cum Mortgage Deed dated 1 December 2009 was executed between Rubix, the Defendant and the Plaintiff as amended by Opcd Amendment Agreement dated 8 September 2010. The aforesaid deeds shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as \"the Debenture Trust Deeds\" (DTDs). In respect of the liability arising under OPCDs, the Defendant executed a Deed of Corporate Guarantee dated 9 December 2009 in favour of the Plaintiff, (the Guarantee). \n33 For the purpose of the present Appeal, the case of the Respondent-Plaintiff is as under:-\nOn 1 December 2009, Facility Agreement was executed between inter alia Rubix Trading Private Limited (as Borrower), Deutsche Investments India Private Limited (as Lender), the Respondent (Plaintiff) (as Security Trustee) and the Appellant-Hubton (Defendant) (as Confirming Party), Diipl has provided Rubix with a ssm/dgm 36 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw loan facility of Rs.23,50,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Three Crores and Fifty Lakhs only). On 9 December 2009, the Defendant (as Guarantor/Surety) has executed a Deed of Guarantee cum Mortgage and under which the Defendant has inter alia agreed to stand surety/guarantor and provide guarantee on behalf of Rubix in favour of the Plaintiff for the benefit of Diipl on the terms and conditions more particularly set out therein. On 22 January 2010, the said facility was disbursed to Rubix by Diipl. On 22 April 2012, Rubix was liable to pay interest on the facility each quarter. However, Rubix defaulted in payment of interest on the facility since 22 April 2012. \nOn 5 March 2013, Rubix made part payment of Rs.42,54,745/-. \n34 The Respondent-IDBI (Plaintiff) filed Summary Suit No. 520/2013 on 16 May 2013 against the Defendant for recovery of dues under the said Guarantee. Prior to the filing of the Suit, the Respondent (Plaintiff) (Idbi) on 10 May 2013, filed Company Petition No. 644 of 2013 seeking winding up of the Defendant on the ground that the Defendant has failed to comply with the statutory notice to pay the amount under the guarantee. On 12 February 2014, the Respondent-IDBI (Plaintiff) filed Summary Suit No. 480 of 2014 for ssm/dgm 37 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw recovery of the back end coupon dues payable under the said guarantee which amount was not included in the above summary Suit. \nThe Defendant (Hubton) has filed its affidavit in the Summons for Judgment raising several contentions. The Plaintiff too has filed affidavits dealing with the contentions raised by the Defendant. An additional affidavit is filed on behalf of the Plaintiff dated 4 July 2014 in Company Petition No. 644 of 2013 bringing on record the various facts. \n35 In view of the aforesaid defaults on the part of Rubix and the Defendant, Diipl vide its letter dated 5 June 2013, cancelled the facility with immediate effect and declared that all of the facility, along with accrued interest thereon were immediately due and payable. On 8 June 2013, the Advocates for Rubix sent Diipl a holding reply. On 9 June 2013, in the meantime, considering that Rubix had not fulfilled its obligations under the facility Agreement and considering that Rubix failed and/or neglected to repay the amounts demanded under the Recall Notice, the Plaintiff was constrained to issue a Demand Certificate to the Defendant for the enforcement of the Guarantee, in terms of the Deed of Guarantee. \nssm/dgm 38 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 36 Rubix's aforesaid holding reply was followed by a further reply dated 18 July 2013, as stated, false, baseless and wholly untenable allegations in its defence. On 8 August 2013, Diipl vide their letter replied to Rubix's letter dated 18 July 2013. Despite repeated requests and reminders and post several meetings and discussions, the Defendant and/or Rubix have failed and/or neglected to repay the Facility along with all amounts due and/or accrued thereunder including interest and default interest since 23 April 2012. \nIn view thereof, on 14 August 2014, Diipl was constrained to issue a supplementary recall notice to Rubix. On 19 August 2014, the Plaintiff (Idbi) issued supplementary Demand Certificate to the Defendant (Hubton) for the enforcement of the Guarantee, in terms of the Deed of Guarantee. No reply has been received to the aforementioned supplementary recall notice and supplementary demand certificate. Hence the summary suit and summons for Judgment No.39/2013.\n37 The Single Judge (Coram:- S.J. Kathawalla, J.) on 8 May 2015 in Summons for Judgment No. 39 of 2013 in Summary Suit No. ssm/dgm 39 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 520 of 2013 has passed the following order:-\n\"42. In the circumstances I am of the view that the Defendant has raised triable issues which require adjudication on further evidence at the time of final disposal of the suit. Hence the following order:\n(i) Unconditional leave is granted to the Defendant to defend the above suit;\n(ii) The suit is transferred to the list of commercial causes and the Defendant is directed to file its written statement on or before 15th June, 2015;\n(iii) The hearing of the suit is expedited and the Court will endeavour to dispose of the suit within a period of one year from the date of this order. It is clarified that the Suit shall be decided without being influenced by any of the observations made in the present order;\n(iv) Place the suit for framing of issues on 29th June, 2015. \nThe Summons for Judgment is accordingly disposed of.\"\n38 The Respondent-IDBI's (plaintiff's) case in Summons for Judgment No.111 of 2014 in Summary Suit No.776 of 2014, is as under:-\nThe Respondent's (Plaintiff's) case is that the Deed of Guarantee executed by the Appellant (Defendant) relates to the following three separate and distinct transactions:-\nssm/dgm 40 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw\n(a) Repayment of the amount of Rs.23.50 Crores loaned by Diipl to Rubix under the Facility Agreement;\n(b) Due performance and repayment by Amazia, of its OPCDs of Rs.150 Crores issued to Vinca on terms and conditions mentioned in Amazia Opcd Subscription and Debenture Trust Deed of 1 December 2009; and\n(c) Due performance and repayment by Rubix of OPCDs totaling Rs.268 Crores issued and allotted to Vinca on terms and conditions mentioned in Rubix Opcd Subscription and Debenture Trust Deed of 1 December 2009. \nAmazia and Rubix transactions referred to in (b) and (c) above involved Vinca which was a 100% holding company of both Amazia and Rubix. There was a separate Summary Suit filed by the Plaintiff herein for enforcement of the guarantee given by the Defendant herein for those two transactions. It was the case of the Defendant in that suit that the OPCDs reflected investments made by Fmo (referred to above), though ostensibly in Vinca, actually meant for Amazia and Rubix operating in the housing sector and what the transaction really contemplated was Fdi with assured/fixed returns in housing sector, ssm/dgm 41 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw i.e. in Amazia and Rubix, through a nominal recipient, Vinca. On a Summons for Judgment taken out in that suit, a learned Single Judge came to the conclusion that the factual matrix and transaction documents prima facie established that the transaction of routing Fdi through the newly interposed Vinca was a colourable device and was structured to enable Fmo to secure repayment of Fdi at a fixed rate of return, thus contrary to the Fdi policy and statutory Fema regulations and thus, opposed to public policy and illegal. The learned Judge held that the Deed of Guarantee issued by Vinca being a part of this structure was also prima facie unenforceable. (The learned Judge (S.J. Kathawalla,J), accordingly, granted unconditional leave to defend on 8 May 2015). \n39 It is, however, the Respondent-IDBI (Plaintiff's) case in the present summary suit that the Deed of Guarantee insofar as it relates to the Dippl Loan (forming part of (a) above), which is the subject matter of the present suit, is on the basis of the Facility Agreement which is in fact a plain vanilla Indian Rupee loan provided by the Plaintiff, an Indian registered Non-Banking Finance Company to Rubix, an Indian Entity, to which no Fdi law or policy applies. It is ssm/dgm 42 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw submitted that though this guarantee is contained in the same document as the guarantee provided for Amazia and Rubix OPCDs, it has nothing to do with either of these two transactions. It is submitted that it is an altogether separate transaction and in any event, severable from the other transactions. \n40 The defence of the Appellant-Original Defendant (Hubtown) was noted in para 6 and 12 of the said Summons for Judgment, which reads thus:-\n\"The Defendant disputes this case. Mr. Chinoy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Defendant, relies on paras 8(iv), (x), (xiii), (xxi) and (xxiv), and paras 15 and 16 of the affidavit in reply and paras 4, 9, 14, 18, 20, 22, 24 and 25 of the affidavit in rejoinder and argues that the circumstances reflected therein show that these three transactions were related and formed part of one whole transaction.\nThe gist of his contentions is this : Deutsche Bank A.G. agreed to act as an arranger of funds to be invested in a group company/companies of the Defendant to the tune of Usd 60 million (with an option to increase it to Usd 90 to 100 million) at an Irr of upto 20% per annum. (The OPCDs of Rubix and Amazia were part of this ssm/dgm 43 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw investment.) The consideration payable to Deutsche Bank was a stipulated arranger fee. The foreign investor identified by Deutsche Bank (i.e. Fmo) was willing to invest around Usd 90 to 100 million at a lower Irr (i.e. 14.75 % p.a.). As a result, Deutsche Bank asked for an increased arranger fee. The Defendant and its group companies being in a desperate need of funds, had to give in to this demand and were constrained to pay revised arranger fee. Deutsche Bank, in turn, agreed to reroute a part of the revised arranger fee as a loan to the Defendant or any of its group companies. The loan of Rs.23.50 extended by Diipl, at a far higher rate of interest, was a part of that commitment and thus, a part and parcel of the illegal structuring undertaken by Deutsche Bank. The Defendant submits that it was at the instance of the foreign investor that the loan of Rs.23.50 Crores was extended as an \"Indian leg of the structured transaction of the Foreign Investor along with Deutsche Bank A.G..... inspite of the fact that Rubix was in no need of the additional secured loan of Rs.23,50,00,000/from Diipl\". Relying on these facts, namely, of increased arranger fees, proximity of the dates of the individual transactions and common security documents, Mr. Chinoy submits that the transaction is one whole and the Diipl loan and the Deed of ssm/dgm 44 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Guarantee insofar as it relates to that loan cannot be separated from Fdi brought into India in an illegal and impermissible manner.\" \n\"Learned Counsel for the Defendant relies on the analysis of the facts of the case in the Plaintiff's suit for enforcement of guarantees in respect of Amazia and Rubix Opcd transactions in Idbi Trusteeship Services Ltd. Vs. Hubtown Ltd . 7 by the Learned Judge (S.J. Kathawalla, J.), whilst dealing with the case of Videocon Industries Limited Vs. Intesa Sanpaolo S.P.A . 8 in support of his defence. In that case, the learned Judge was considering the severability of the routing of Fdi investment in Amazia and Rubix through the newly interposed Vinca (as the nominal recipient of Fdi) and the guarantee given by the Defendant to ensure repayment of the Fdi. The learned Judge held them to be prima facie inseverable. Here, we are considering the severability of the guarantee towards repayment of Fdi and towards repayment of the Indian loan, which is separate from the Fdi transaction. The observations dated 8 May 2015 of Kathawalla, J. in that case have no bearing on this severability.\" \n41 The operative part of the impugned order dated 6 June 7 Summons for Judgment No.39-13 in Summary Suit No.520-13 decided on 8 May 15. 8 2014 Scc OnLine Bom 1276 ssm/dgm 45 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 2006 passed in Summons for Judgment No.111 of 2014 in summary suit, is as under:-\n\"14 Accordingly, the Summons for Judgment is disposed of in terms of the following order:-\n(i) The Defendant is granted leave to defend on and subject to the condition of depositing a sum of Rs.33,55,16,946.85 in this Court within a period of twelve weeks from today;\n(ii) Upon such deposit being made, the suit shall be transferred to the list of commercial causes;\n(iii) The Defendant to file its Written Statement in the suit within twelve weeks of making of the deposit;\n(iv) The amount of deposit, if any, shall be invested by the Prothonotary & Senior Master of this Court in a fixed deposit of a Nationalized Bank initially for a period of two years and thereafter, to be renewed from time to time and to abide by further orders that may be passed in the suit;\n(v) The suit to come up on board for directions after twenty four weeks from today.\"\n42 Hence, this Commercial Appeal filed on 12 July 2016. \nThe reasons for the reversal of the impugned order- Two views on construction of documents-question of law-triable issue-\n43 Admittedly, the findings given by the learned Single Judge on documents being severable or unseverable, goes to the root of the ssm/dgm 46 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw interpretation and the construction of the same documents and the related transactions. The contrary view so expressed by the learned Judge in the impugned order (para 40 and 41), in view of the earlier findings (para 39) itself require a consideration in the suit and more particularly when another learned Single Judge in Summary Suit No. 520 of 2013 (supra) has prima facie held the document/guarantee is inseverable. In this position we are not persuaded to accept that the ratio of the decision of the Supreme Court in B.O.I. Finance Ltd. Vs. Custodian & Ors. 9, and in Canbank Financial Services Ltd. Vs. The Custodian & Ors. 10 would be applicable to the facts in hand. Reasoning of the learned Single Judge, (S.J. Kathawalla, J.) in order dated 8 May 2015, in para 37.2, 37.3 read thus-\n\"37.2 In the case in hand, I am prima facie of the view that the structure/device of routing FMO's Fdi amount of Rs. 418 crores to Amazia and Rubix through the newly interposed Vinca (as the nominal recipient of the Fdi) was a colourable device structured only to enable Fmo to secure repayment (through Vinca) of its Fdi amount and interest thereon at 14.75%, contrary to the statutory Fema Regulations and the Fdi policy embodied therein, which only permit Fdi investment in townships/real estate development sector to be made in the form of equity (including Compulsorily Convertible Debentures) and preclude any assured return. I am also prima facie of the view that the Defendant's guarantee (which is the basis of the 9 (1997) 10 Scc 488 10 (2004) 8 Scc 355 ssm/dgm 47 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Company Petition No. 644 of 2013) though ostensibly in favour of Vinca, an Indian Company, was part of the aforesaid illegal structure/scheme and was given to ensure that Fmo received back its Fdi amount with interest as aforesaid through Vinca. The Guarantee was therefore part of the aforesaid illegal structures/scheme and therefore prima facie illegal and unenforceable. \n37.3 Further the question of the Defendant not being allowed to plead its own wrong also does not arise in the facts of the present case. Through the present Petition, the Plaintiff (who is admittedly acting at the instance of FMO/FMO's nominees) is in effect seeking the assistance of this Court to enable/enforce recovery by Fmo of its Fdi amount and interest thereon (through Vinca), contrary to the provisions of the Fema Regulations and Fdi policy embodied therein. As has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Immami Appa Rao vs. G. Ramalingamurthi (supra), the Plaintiff who wants orders in his favour, is actually seeking the active assistance of the Court to achieve what the law prohibits/declares illegal and that is clearly and patently inconsistent with public interest. Moreover, as has been held by the Supreme Court in the above case, in such a case there can be no question of estoppel and the paramount consideration of public interest requires that the plea be allowed to be raised and tried.\" \nThe defence so raised itself being the question of law, as the interpretation of documents itself goes to the root of the transactions/contract and the claim based upon it. In the present case, B.O.I. Finance Ltd. (Supra), as relied is not applicable on facts and the laws. That was a case of ssm/dgm 48 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw ready forward contract. In the case in hand, three documents and the transactions, of which two views of the learned Judges unless decided finally in due trial, it is difficult to accept the case that the view taken by the one learned Judge that transactions are sham and bogus and unseverable and other Judge hold it to be severable, without trial and by overlooking the earlier opinion, this itself is a triable issue. The Appellate Bench also may not decide such issue on such question of law, considering the scope and purpose of law on order Xxxvii of the Cpc, at this stage of the Summary Suit. It should be after final Judgment. In the present case, the same documents are interlinked and interconnected as observed by the earlier learned Judge, therefore, unless these findings are set aside, the findings in the impugned order that those are severable just cannot be accepted, without the trial. The case of misconstruction or interpretation of all connected documents itself made out a case of good defence. It cannot be treated as sham or bogus defence. The misinterpretation itself affects the rights and the transaction/claim. Therefore, the construction of documents is always question of law so is the position in case in hand. The distinction, therefore, at this stage, in summary proceedings like this, itself will not sufficient to deny the order of unconditional leave as ssm/dgm 49 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw granted by one Judge on the basis of same documents. (Sir Chunilal V. Mehta and sons Ltd. Vs. Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. 11 and Hero Vinoth (Minor) Vs. Seshammal12) Interpretation of documents and the nature of transactions-triable issue-\n44 We have to consider the legal position in view of the contentions so raised by the learned counsel appearing for the parties. \nThe Apex Court in Smt. Krishnabai Bhritar Ganpatrao Deshmukh Vs. Appasaheb Tuljaramarao Nimbalkar13, while dealing with the aspects of interpretation of any deed or documents, has held as under:-\n\"27. Secondly, there is ample authority for the proposition that when there is a dispute in regard to the true character of a writing, evidence de hors the document can be led to show that the writing was not the real nature of the transaction, but was only an illusory, fictitious and colourable device which cloaked something else, and that the apparent state of affairs was not the real state of affairs. [See Chandi Prasad Singh v. Piari Bidi C.A. No. 75 of 1964, decided on 16-3-1966, and Bhagwan Dayal v. Mst. Reoti Devi (supra) ]. \n45 While dealing with the effect of various transactions, based upon the various documents, the Court required to deal with and take into consideration every connected transactions and the documents, to 11 Air 1962 Sc 1314 12 (2006) 5 Scc 545=Air 2006 Sc 2234 13 (1979) 4 Scc 60 ssm/dgm 50 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw give total effect to the transactions by treating them all as one document. The Apex Court in (S.Chattanatha Karayalar Vs. The Central Bank of India Ltd.)14 has observed as under:-\n3. .......... \"The principle is well established that if the transaction is contained in more than one document between the same parties they must be read and interpreted together and they have the same legal effect for all purposes as if they are one document. In Manks v.\nWhiteley 1912-1 Ch. 735 at p. 754 ,, Moulton, L.J. Stated:\n\"Where several deeds form part of one transaction and are contemporaneously executed they have the same effect for all purposes such as are relevant to this case as if they were one deed. Each is executed on the faith of all the others being executed also and is intended to speak only as part of the one transaction, and if one is seeking to make equities apply to the parties they must be equities arising out of the transaction as a whole.\" \nConditional or unconditional leave? \n46 The law with regard to Order Xxxvii, Rule 2 and 3 of Cpc to grant or not to grant conditional and/or unconditional leave is elaborated as under, by the Apex Court in M/s. Mechelec Engineers & Manufacturers Vs. M/s. Basic Equipment Corporation15-\n\"8. In Sm. Kiranmoyee Dassi v. Dr. J. Chatterjee (49Cwn246, 253 :Air 1949 Cal 479), Das. J., after a comprehensive review of authorities on the subject, stated the principles applicable to cases covered by order 14 Air 1965 Sc 1856 15 (1976) 4 Scc 687 ssm/dgm 51 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 17 C.P.C. in the form of the following propositions (at p.\n253) :\n(a) If the defendant satisfies the Court that he has a good defence to the claim on its merits the plaintiff is not entitled to leave to sign judgment and the defendant is entitled to unconditional leave to defend.\n(b) If the defendant raises a triable issue indicating that he has a fair or bona fide or reasonable defence although not a positively good defence the plaintiff is not entitled to sign judgment and the Defendant is entitled to unconditional leave to defend. \n(c) If the defendant discloses such facts as may be deemed sufficient to entitle him to defend, that is to say, although the affidavit does not positively and immediately make it clear that he has a defence, yet, shows such a state of facts as leads to the inference that at the trial of the action he may be able to establish a defence to the plaintiff's claim the Plaintiff is not entitled to judgment and the defendant is entitled to leave to defend but in such a case the court may in its discretion impose conditions as to the time or mode of trial but not as to payment into court or furnishing security. \n(d) If the defendant has no defence or the defence set up is illusory or sham or practically moonshine then ordinarily the plaintiff is entitled to leave to sign judgment and the defendant is not entitled to leave to defend. \n(e) If the defendant has no defence or the defence is illusory or sham or practically moonshine then although ordinarily the plaintiff is entitled to leave to sign judgment, the court may protect the plaintiff by only allowing the defence to proceed if the amount ssm/dgm 52 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw claimed is paid into court or otherwise secured and give leave to the defendant on such condition, and thereby show mercy to the defendant by enabling him to try to prove a defence.\" \n\"9. The case before us certainly does not fall within the class (e) set out above. It is only in that class of case that an imposition of the condition to deposit an amount in Court before proceeding further is justifiable.\" \n47 The Apex Court in this regard has further reiterated above principle and on facts as case was made out granted an unconditional leave. This makes the position of law clear, which need to be kept in mind while granting and/or refusing leave to defend. The case in hand, in our opinion, falls within the ambit of clauses (a) and (b) as expressed in Mechelec Engineers & Manufacturers (supra). [Sunil Enterprises and Anr. Vs. Sbi Commercial & International Bank Ltd. 16 and State Bank of Saurashtra Vs. Ashit Shipping Services (P) Ltd. 17, R. Savarna Prabhu and Anr. Vs. Videocon Leasing and Industrial Finance Limited & Anr.18] 48 The learned Single Judge, S.G. Kathawalla, as recorded in 16 (1998) 5 Scc 354 17 (2002) 4 Scc 736 18 (2013)14 Scc 606 ssm/dgm 53 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw earlier Suit filed by the Idbi, dealt with the same documents and transactions between the parties and has granted the conditional leave. Therefore, taking note of the reasons so given and recorded, we see there is no case to discard these reasons by overlooking the above basic principles of law. We have to keep in mind the basic principles so laid down, while considering the present case/Appeal also. We have taken note of the facts and circumstances, as well as the reasons given by the learned Single Judge, S.G.Kathawalla, and the Supreme Court Judgments so referred above, interpreting the transactions and the documents between the same parties and we are inclined to observe that a sufficient case is made out by the Appellant that they have a good defence to claim on its merits. This itself means, in the trial, they may be able to establish the defence to the Plaintiff's claim therefore, the Appellant-Defendant, at this stage, is entitled for the unconditional leave. The discretion so exercised and order so passed by imposing condition while granting leave, is unsustainable in the facts and the law and is liable to be interfered with. \n49 Therefore, taking overall view of the matter, we are of the opinion that this is a case where on merit, unconditional leave required to be granted to the Appellant on similar line as granted by ssm/dgm 54 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw the learned Single Judge dated 8 May 2015. \n50 Therefore, considering the totality of the matter, we are inclined to pass the following order-\nOrder\na) Appeal filed under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, is maintainable against the order of grant of conditional leave directing the parties to furnish the security/depositing the money in Sum mary Suit; \nb) Impugned Judgment and order dated 6 June 2016 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Commercial Division in Summons for Judgment No. 111 of 2011, is quashed and set aside, as the Defendant has raised the triable issues, which required adjudication on further evidence at the time of final disposal of the Suit;\nc) Unconditional leave is granted to the Defendant to defend the above suit;\nd) The Suit is transferred to the list of commercial causes and the Defendant is directed to file its written statement on or before 28 November 2016;\nssm/dgm 55 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw e) The hearing of the Suit is expedited.

contract and the entire work was required to be completed within 22 months from the date of issuance of letter of intent. it also further provided tow months grace period and as per the said clause, the accepted rates will be valid for a further period of two months grace period. since the letter of intent was issued on 27.11.2001, the work was to be completed by 27.11.2003 including two months' grace period. that according to the sil, there was a delay on the part of the gmdc in releasing drawing works and due to non providing the fronts / drawings and details of drawings by the gmdc from the very beginning, the construction could not be completed within the time prescribed in the work order. according to the sil, prior to schedule completion date, sil wrote a letter dated 23.10.2003

judgment and order insofar as allowing the claim no.3 which was disallowed by the learned arbitrator, the learned commercial court has exceeded in its jurisdiction under section 34 of the arbitration act. hc-nic page 7 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 5.2. it is further submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that though the arbitrator had nowhere held gmdc solely responsible for delay, the learned commercial court has materially erred in holding that such was the finding of the arbitrator. 5.3. it is further submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that while passing the impugned judgment and order, the learned commercial court has substituted its own view for an entirely possible view of the arbitrator. 5.4. it is further submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that even learned commercial court has substituted the standard of evidence and has re­appreciated the evidence which is not permissible while considering the application under section 34 of the arbitration act. 5.5. it is further submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that as such learned commercial court has passed the impugned order and has exercised the jurisdiction as if learned commercial court was exercising the appellate jurisdiction over the award declared by the learned arbitrator. it is further submitted by shri soparkar, leaned counsel for the gmdc that as per the catena of decisions of the hon'ble supreme court as well as this court, in exercise of powers under section 34 of the arbitration act is not siting as an appellate court over the award. 5.6. it is further submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that learned commercial court has as such allowed the hc-nic page 8 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 claim no.3 and has decided the matter on equity and fairness and has ignored the contract altogether. 5.7. it is further submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that the learned commercial court has as such caused a novation of contract at the stage of adjudication of disputes, which is not permissible. 5.8. it is further submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that learned commercial court has materially erred in not properly appreciating the fact that as per the contract between the parties and as per the terms and conditions of the work order, there was no provision for escalation even for the period beyond the time prescribed under the contract, more particularly, with respect to the extended period of time. it is further submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that therefore, though the escalation was alien to the contract, the learned commercial court has awarded escalation in violation of contractual provisions. 5.9. it is further submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that though in the award learned sole arbitrator though not given any findings that the delay was attributable to gmdc and though even simplex did not make such allegation in its correspondence, learned commercial court has materially erred in coming to the conclusion that delay was attributable to the gmdc. 5.10. it is vehemently submitted by shri soparkar, learned hc-nic page 9 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 counsel for the gmdc that as per the catena of decisions of the hon'ble supreme court as well as this court the scope of judicial intervention while considering the application under section 34 of the arbitration act is very narrow and the merits, factual findings, reasonings, consideration of evidence and the final view taken by the learned arbitrator are not required to be interfered with by the court in exercise of powers under section 34 of the arbitration act. 5.11. it is vehemently submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that section 37 of the act is co­terminus with the narrow scope and limited expanse of the power of the commercial court under section 34 of the act. 5.12. it is vehemently submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that in the present case though not permissible and while allowing the claim no.3 with respect to escalation, the learned commercial court has re­appreciated the evidence and as such has passed an order on equity and fairness ignoring the contractual provisions. 5.13. shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc has heavily relied upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of associate builders v. delhi development authority, reported in (2015) 3 scc 49 in support his elaborate submissions with respect to scope and ambit of judicial intervention by the court, while exercising the powers under section 34 of the arbitration act. shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc has also relied upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of nhai v. itd cementation india ltd. reported in (2015) 14 hc-nic page 10 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 scc 21 as well as another decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of swan gold mining ltd. v.hindustan copper ltd. reported in (2015) 5 scc 739. he has also relied upon the decision of the division bench of the delhi high court in the case of puri construction pvt. ltd. & ors. v. larsen & toubro ltd. & anr. rendered in fao (os) 21/2009. 5.14. it is vehemently submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that as the view taken by the learned arbitrator was correct view and even if the commercial court was of the opinion that the another view is possible, in that case also, learned commercial court is not justified in rigors in the finding of the award declared by the learned arbitrator with respect to the claim no.3 ­ claim for escalation. 5.15. it is vehemently submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that the learned commercial court has materially erred in allowing the claim for escalation by treating the computation rendered by sil as a valid computation, without either calling upon gmdc to rebut the computation, or verifying the authenticity of the claim or manner of computation, or appreciating the evidence based on which the claim appears to have been allowed. it is submitted that, therefore, the learned commercial court has erred in summarily granting a claim and reversing the reasoned view of the arbitrator. 5.16. it is vehemently submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that while allowing the escalation claim, the learned commercial court has not properly appreciated the hc-nic page 11 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 following facts and events. (1). prior issuance of the work order by gmdc to simplex, the issue of escalation already stood decided; (2). simplex had, originally, vide its letter dated 21.07.2001 submitted its bid with an escalation clause for work done beyond the contractual date of completion; (3). gmdc, vide its letter dated 10.08.2001, categorically rejected any provision for escalation and requested simplex to submit a bid with firm rates without escalation; (4). simplex had, therefore, by its letter dated 18.08.2001, withdrawn its deviation in respect of escalation and had clearly submitted to firm contractual rates; (5). therefore, the work order dated 07.02.2002 was awarded to simplex. clause 3 of the work order (pg. 19) clearly mandated that the prices under the contract were firm and no escalation would be allowed. it was also clarified that the rates would remain firm (without escalation) without any upper ceiling limit; (6). the letters dated 23.10.2003 (pg. 25) and 17.08.2004 (pg. 30) addressed by simplex demanded escalation. however, it is pertinent to note that simplex has never alleged any delay on part of gmdc. these letters, therefore, use the phrase \".due to different reasons not attributable to us.\". however, no evidence is adduced nor correspondence addressed by simplex to contend that any delay was attributable to gmdc; hc-nic page 12 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 (7). even during course of argument before this hon'ble court, simplex does not contend that delay was only attributable to gmdc. therefore, at best, the case of simplex is that delay was allegedly attributable to both parties. however, there is no evidence in support of the said baseless contention of simplex; (8). by its letter dated 24.11.2004 (pg. 31) and 22.02.2007 (pg. 38), gmdc categorically rejected simplex's demand for escalation and clearly, in no uncertain terms, stated that the rates under the contract would remain firm; (9). even otherwise, neither the hon'ble arbitrator nor the hon'ble commercial court have engaged into the exercise of computing the claims or verifying their authenticity or arithmetic accuracy; (10) inasmuch as issue no. 1 (liquidated damages of rs. 5,39,106/­) is concerned, simplex has attempted to utilise the arbitrator's direction to gmdc to refund the said amount in its favour. however, it is pertinent to note that the issue of refund of liquidated damages (ld) has no bearing on the other issues for the following reasons: (10.1). the arbitrator did not reject gmdc's claim for ld on merits. (10.2). it was only on account of gmdc's procedural lapse in not issuing a notice upon simplex (as is the statutory requirement under section 74 read with section 55 of the contract act) that gmdc was required to refund the amount so deducted by gmdc hc-nic page 13 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 as per the prescriptions under the contract. 5.17. shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc has further submitted that even otherwise while exercising the powers under section 34 of the arbitration act learned commercial court was only empowered to set aside the award and could not have modified the award. in support of his above submissions, shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc has heavily relied upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of mcdermott international inc. v.burn standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181 as well as decision of the bombay high court in the case of pushpa p. mulchandani & ors. v. admiral radhakrishan tahiliani & ors. rendered in appeal no. 981/2001 dated 4.10.2007; decision of the allahabad high court in the case of u.p. state handloom corporation v. asha lata talwar & anr. reported in (2009) 76 alr 233 as well as decision of the delhi high court in the case of puri construction pvt. ltd. & ors. v. larsen & toubro ltd. & anr. rendered in fao (os) 21/2009 dated 30.04.2015. 5.18. it is vehemently submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that neither the arbitrator nor the commercial court have engaged into the exercise of computation of the claim for escalation. 5.19. it is submitted that the basis of escalation claim is neither certified by gmdc, nor verified by any judicial forum. that the manner of computation or the content and basis of the hc-nic page 14 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 calculation has never been subjected to judicial scrutiny, and rightly so, since the contract did not provide for escalation in the first place. it is submitted that therefore, learned commercial court has erred in allowing a claim that was completely unverified. 5.20. it is vehemently submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that the learned arbitrator arrived at a conclusion that since sil did not become eligible to claim escalation or extra­cost in the first place, inter alia, on account of lack of evidence to establish its said claims, the question of engaging into the exercise of computing the said claims was unnecessary and redundant. therefore, the learned arbitrator had no occasion to consider the escalation claim on merits and more particularly with respect to the computation made by the sil of escalation claim. 5.21. it is vehemently submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that as such neither learned commercial court while exercising the powers under section 34 of the arbitration act nor even this court while exercising the power under section 37 of the arbitration act can remand the matter to the learned arbitrator to consider the escalation claim on merits afresh. 5.22. it is vehemently submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that as such the issue of remanding the matter was considered by the learned commercial court, however both the parties refused for remanding the matter to the learned arbitrator and therefore, the matter is not required to be remitted hc-nic page 15 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 to the learned arbitrator. it is submitted that even otherwise remanding the matter to the learned arbitrator by the court while exercising the powers under section 34 of the arbitration act is wholly impossible as once the learned arbitrator has declared the award thereafter the learned arbitrator becomes the functus officio. 5.23. shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc has further submitted that it would be pointless to remit the matter back to the commercial court as the commercial court cannot adduce additional evidence in the present matter, lack of which is the reason for even considering remittance in the first place. 5.24. it is further submitted that even otherwise the sil cannot be permitted to have second innings in the matter wherein it could fill in the blanks, produce additional evidence, and remove all obstacles, to make a fresh claim for escalation and over­stay. making above submissions and relying upon the above decisions, it is requested to allow the appeal preferred by the gmdc and quash and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned commercial court in so far as allowing claiming no.3 while modifying the award declared by the learned arbitrator. first appeal nos. 618 of 2017 & 778 of 2017 6.0. shri p.c. kavina, learned counsel for the original applicant ­ sil has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned commercial court has not committed any error in modifying the award declared by the learned arbitral hc-nic page 16 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 tribunal thereby granting claim of escalation to original applicant. 6.1. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil that it is an admitted position that as per the work order / contract between the parties the work was to be completed by 27.11.2003 including two months grace period. it is submitted that it was the obligation of the gmdc to provide drawings / fronts. however, sil was not provided with the fronts/ drawings / details of drawings by gmdc from the very beginning. as a consequence, the construction plan was jeopardized from the very beginning and the execution of the work was delayed. it is submitted that sil wrote various letters to gmdc from time to time, requested for use of the drawings and work fronts and pointing out the delay on the part of the gmdc. however, gmdc never replied to such letters or otherwise controverted the delay alleged by the sil. it is submitted that thus, the gmdc accepted that sil was not responsible for the delay. 6.2. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil that as such vide communication dated 17.08.2004 the sil categorically informed gmdc that it is going to raise the escalation bills as per the formula which was provided at the time of bid offer. it is submitted that pursuant thereto sil raised 7 periodical bills for escalation and two interim bills for extra costs. it is submitted the despite the above, the gmdc maintained the complete silence and the work was accepted by the gmdc without protest or demur. it is submitted that after about one year from the schedule hc-nic page 17 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 date of completion, the original work order came to be amended vide gmdc's letter dated 24.11.2004 and the value of the work was almost doubled from rs. 5,80,71,292/­ to rs.10,78,71,292/­. it is submitted that the said letter contained a standard clause providing that the prices shall remain firm and no escalation shall be allowed. it is submitted that the aforesaid letter of the gmdc was replied to by the sil on the very same day i.e. 24.11.2004, wherein it was categorically mentioned that condition stipulated in the amendment that the rates are firm and no escalation will be allowed is not acceptable as it was practically impossible to execute the work at fixed rates. it is submitted that therefore, sil requested gmdc to make payments for the work executed beyond the contractual completion period as per the escalation formula already submitted by the sil. it is submitted that communication dated 24.11.2004 was neither replied by the gmdc nor rejected the escalation and extra costs bills submitted by sil. it is submitted that in fact the gmdc continued to accept the work from sil without any demur or protest and also through its various representatives assured sil that gmdc would look into the matter and make provision for appropriate payments and requested sil to continue execution of work. it is submitted that the aforesaid is evident from the letter dated 22.2..2007 issued by the gmdc wherein it had recapitulated the discussions in a meeting held between the representatives of the parties on the said date. it is submitted that with respect to escalation and overstay, it was submitted that these points will be taken into consideration during the contract closure along with penalty, liquidated damages etc. as per contract. it is submitted that at that time even the sil replied to hc-nic page 18 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 the said letter vide its letter dated 6.3.2007 stating that the points of penalty and liquidated damages raised by gmdc were unwarranted, irrelevant and against the spirit of the contract, since the work had already been completed to gmdc's satisfaction. it is submitted that thereafter also in various communications / letters addressed by sil, the sil mentioned about assurance given by the gmdc that pending issues will be looked into after completion of work and receipt of final bill duly certified by gmdc's project office. it is submitted that the sil completed the work on 30.09.2006. it is submitted that therefore, considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case when the learned commercial court has modified the award declared by the learned arbitrator and has awarded escalation / claim, the same is not required to be interfered with by this court in exercise of powers under section 37 of the arbitration act. 6.3. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil that the bills raised by the sil about escalation price were as per the formula already submitted by the sil, which were never disputed by the gmdc and the escalation bills were as per the formula and as per actual expenses incurred, the learned commercial court has rightly awarded entire claim no.3 as per the statement of claim submitted by the sil. it is further submitted that for the aforesaid as such no further evidence was required to be led and the formula suggested by sil was already on record and the claim submitted by the sil with respect to the escalation was as per the formula already submitted by the sil. hc-nic page 19 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 6.4. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the original applicant that in the facts and circumstances of the case, as the learned arbitrator ignored the evidence on record and thereby rejected the claim of the claimant with respect to escalation and learned commercial court is justified in interfering with the award passed by the learned arbitrator in exercise of powers under section 34 of act. 6.5. shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil has submitted that the considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances and the material on record, the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of mcdermott international inc. v.burn standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181 and the decision of the delhi high court in the case of puri construction pvt. ltd. & ors. v. larsen & toubro ltd. & anr. rendered in fao (os) 21/2009 shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand. 6.6. shri , learned counsel for the sil has heavily relied upon the decision of the madras high court in the case of gaytri vs. isg novasoft technologies ltd. rendered in manu/tn/2293/2014 in support of his submission that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned commercial court has rightly modified the award declared by the learned tribunal in exercise of powers under section 34 of the arbitration act. making above submission and relying upon the above decision, it is requested to dismiss the appeal preferred by the gmdc. hc-nic page 20 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 7.0. now, so far as appeal preferred by the sil (first appeal no. 778 of 2017) challenging the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned commercial court in dismissing the commercial civil miscellaneous application no. 52 of 2016 preferred by the sil insofar as confirming the award declared by the sole arbitrator with respect to other claims are concerned, it is vehemently submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the original applicant that in the facts and circumstances of the case the learned commercial court has materially erred in confirming the award declared by the learned sole arbitrator insofar as rejecting the other claims (except claim no.3). 7.1. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil that the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court to the extent it relates to claim no.4 (claim for extra costs due to overstay) erroneously upholds the decision of the learned tribunal in this regard, which is unreasoned. it is submitted that there is no reference to copious evidence. 7.2. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil that the arbitral award to the extent it relates to claim no.4 is against the substantive law of india and is therefore, violative of section 28(1)(a) of the arbitration act and therefore, was liable to be set aside/ modified under section 34 of the act. it is submitted that learned commercial court has failed to give any reasons whatsoever as to why the observations of the learned arbitrator with regard claim no.4 are required to be upheld. 7.3. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the hc-nic page 21 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 sil that both the learned arbitrator and the commercial court have erroneously held that in the instant case, the delay is not attributable only to the gmdc and claimant (sil) was also responsible for delay in certain cases. it is submitted that there is no any material on record that sil is even partially responsible for the delay. it is submitted that on the contrary, the sil placed on record various uncontroverted letters pointing out the delay on the part of the gmdc. 7.4. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil that while observing herein above, the learned arbitrator as well as learned commercial court have failed to appreciate and / or consider the series of letters by the sil to gmdc wherein sil time and again brought to the notice of gmdc that the work is being suffered and delay is caused due to non­supply of drawings/fronts on part of gmdc. it is submitted that said letters were neither rebutted nor protested on receipt by gmdc. it is submitted that even the same were neither controverted by documentary or oral evidence even during the course of arbitration. 7.5. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the original applicant that as such while dealing with the claim of escalation, learned commercial court after taking into consideration the various letters by sil to gmdc, rightly held that the delay has been caused by reasons attributable to gmdc. it is submitted that therefore, once the learned commercial court has hc-nic page 22 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 come to the conclusion that the delay was caused by gmdc, the natural corollary is that the entire period of overstay was due to reasons attributable to gmdc and therefore sil is entitled to expenditure incurred during the entire period of overstay. 7.6. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil that both learned arbitral tribunal and learned commercial court failed to appreciate that sil under the head of overstay has sought reimbursement of expenses as per actuals and which were unavoidably incurred by sil only on account of overstay for completion of work for gmdc such as labour charges, insurance renewal charges. it is submitted that therefore, when the expenses incurred were unavoidable and a natural consequence of extension of work beyond contract period, the question of sil proving any efforts to mitigate the expenses did not arise. it is submitted that therefore, learned commercial court has materially erred in upholding the observation made by the learned arbitrator with respect to claim no.4. 7.7. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the original applicant that learned arbitrator has materially erred in observing that as three other construction works were being carried on by sil at the same site and there is no independent reliable evidence to show that only on account of this contract simplex had to incur further cost. it is submitted that while observing the above, both, the learned arbitrator and the learned commercial court have completely overlooked the voluminous documents filed by sil in support of its claim for extra costs and hc-nic page 23 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 have not considered the various heads of extra costs claimed by sil which show that certain claims made by sil such as towards renewal of bank guarantees & insurance policy and head office overheads would not be affected by the fact that sil was executing three other contracts at the same site. 7.8. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil that as such in the present case the gmdc in its written statement filed before the learned arbitrator in relation to the claim for extra costs due to overstay admitted that sum of rs. 31,58,299.55 was due and payable towards extra costs. it is submitted that therefore, in view of such admission by the gmdc, the same ought to have been considered by the learned arbitrator and learned commercial court. 7.9. shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil has submitted that as such by not allowing the claim no.4 with respect to the extra costs due to overstay, both, the learned arbitrator as well as learned commercial court have disregarded the contractual terms operating between the parties. it is submitted that clause no.4 of the order dated february 7, 2002 provides that \"prices are firm and no escalation will be allowed during the currency of the contract period\". it is submitted that therefore, necessary corollary of the same is that if sil was required to undertake any work beyond the contract period on account of reasons not attributable to sil, the prices would not be considered fixed. it is submitted that in such a situation the fixed price clause or no­escalation clause would not survive nor would be binding on sil. it is submitted that clause 4 of hc-nic page 24 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 the work order provides that the entire work shall be completed within a period of twenty two (22) calendar months but the accepted rates will be valid for a further two (2) months' grace period. it is submitted that letter of intent was issued on november 27, 2001 and thus, the tender rates were valid for a period of twenty four (24) months from the said date, i.e. up to november 27, 2003. it is submitted that therefore, both the learned arbitrator as well as learned commercial court have completely ignored the aforesaid contractual terms. 8. now, so far as submission on behalf of the gmdc that while exercising powers under section 34 of the arbitration act, the commercial court has no jurisdiction to re­appreciate the evidence on record and / or finding recorded by the learned arbitrator is concerned, shri kavina, learned counsel for the original applicant ­ sil has submitted that it is a settled law where a finding is based on no evidence; or arbitral tribunal takes into account something irrelevant to the decision which it arrives at; or ignored vital evidence in arriving at a decision, such decision would necessarily be perverse and therefore, the court in exercise of powers under section 34 of the arbitration act will be justified in interfering with such a perverse decision. 8.1. now, so far as submission on behalf of the gmdc that assuming the court under section 34 of the act court can appreciate the evidence, however it has power to either accept the award or set aside the award, but the court cannot pass a decree, but the parties shall have recourse to fresh arbitration is concerned, hc-nic page 25 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 it is submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil that by such contention gmdc seeks to narrow the scope of jurisdiction of the courts under section 34 of the act to merely either act as a court of approval or dis­approval; to accept the award as it is or set it aside the same and nothing more. it is submitted that if the aforesaid contention of the gmdc is accepted, the same would lead to anomalous situations and would nothing be less than a catastrophe of justice. it is submitted that in a case if the arbitrator rejects all the claims of a party and the court under section 34 of the act, only sets aside the award and as it could not modify the same, the party shall have to be relegated back for fresh arbitration and the said process would continue until the party gets the desired result. it is further submitted that further the matter would have to be sent to a new arbitral tribunal as the old arbitral tribunal would have become functus officio after rendering the award. it is submitted that therefore, if the contention of the gmdc is accepted, it would render the very recourse under section 34 of the act otiose and redundant. it would further defeat the very purpose of having a cost effective and speedy alternate dispute resolution by way of arbitration. 8.2. it is submitted that even the words \"set aside\" used in section 34 of the act need to be given \"purposive interpretation\" so as to envisage that the power to set aside or confirm the arbitral award brings within its fold, the power to undo the miscarriage of justice caused by a perverse award or an award vitiated by the grounds mentioned in section 34 since the intention of the legislature cannot be interpreted to mean that courts are to turn a blind eye hc-nic page 26 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 despite the perversities and patent illegalities of an order challenged before it. it is submitted that if such a narrow interpretation is given effect to then the entire purpose behind having a recourse of section 34 of the act shall be rendered futile and would be nothing but a mere recourse on paper. 8.3. shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil has submitted that even in the present case section 55 and 70 of the contract act shall squarely be applicable. 8.4. shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil has submitted that due to following facts the case of the sil squarely falls within the provisions of section 55, part iii of the contract act: \"(a) simplex putting gmdc at notice of its intention to claim escalation and additional costs for overstay due to the delays vide its letter dated october 23, 2003 as well as its subsequent letter dated august 17, 2004 and various bills for escalation and additional costs raised by simplex; (b) no protest on part of gmdc to such letters and bills, (c) no reply to the letter of simplex refusing to accept the letter dated 24.11.2004 addressed by gmdc (d) further acceptance of work without any demur, and (v) assurances / studied silence on the part of gmdc makes it apparent that the case of simplex falls within section 55 of the contract act and gmdc is liable to pay simplex the escalation and extra costs claimed by it.\" 8.5. it is further submitted by shri kavina, learned counsel for the original applicant­sil that even assuming though not admitting that section 55 of the contract act does not apply, as the work hc-nic page 27 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 executed by the sil under the a commercial contract and the same was executed with no intention of same being a gratuitous act, considering section 70 of the contract act, for the work executed by the sil beyond the contractual period and with a specific notice of claiming compensation in the form of escalation and extra­costs, the sil will be entitled to escalation price as well as extra costs due to overstay. making above submissions and relying upon the following decisions, it is requested to dismiss the appeal preferred by the gmdc and allow the appeal preferred by the sil and modify the award declared by the learned arbitrator rejecting the other claims and consequently to allow other claims including claim no.3.

13. in as much as serious objections have been taken to the division bench judgment on the ground that it has ignored the parameters laid down in a series of judgments by this court as to the limitations which a judge hearing objections to an arbitral award under section 34 is subject to, we deem it necessary to state the law on the subject. 14. section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act reads as follows­ \"34. application for setting aside arbitral award.­(1) recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub­section (2) and sub­section (3). (2) an arbitral award may be set aside by the court only if­ (a) the party making the application furnishes proof that­ hc-nic page 31 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 (i) a party was under some incapacity; or (ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or (iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration: provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or (v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this part from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this part; or (b) the court finds that­ (i) the subject­matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force, or (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of india. explanation.­without prejudice to the generality of sub­clause (ii), it is hereby declared, for the avoidance of any doubt, that an award is in conflict with the public policy of india if the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81. hc-nic page 32 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 (3) an application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal: provided that if the court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter. (4) on receipt of an application under sub­section (1), the court may, where it is appropriate and it is so requested by a party, adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of arbitral tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award.\" 15. this section in conjunction with section 5 makes it clear that an arbitration award that is governed by part i of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 can be set aside only on grounds mentioned under section 34 (2) and (3), and not otherwise. section 5 reads as follows: \"5. extent of judicial intervention.­notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this part.\" 16. it is important to note that the 1996 act was enacted to replace the 1940 arbitration act in order to provide for an arbitral procedure which is fair, efficient and capable of meeting the needs of arbitration; also to provide that the tribunal gives reasons for an arbitral award; to ensure that the tribunal remains within the limits of its jurisdiction; and to minimize the supervisory roles of courts in the arbitral process. 17. it will be seen that none of the grounds contained in sub­ clause 2 (a) deal with the merits of the decision rendered by an arbitral award. it is only when we come to the award being in conflict with the public policy of india that the merits of an arbitral award are to be looked into under certain specified circumstances. hc-nic page 33 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 what can be said to be against the public policy of india has been discussed by the honble supreme court in the said decision. at this stage, it is required to be noted that it is not the case on behalf of the appellants that the award declared by the learned arbitral tribunal is in conflict with the public policy of india. under the circumstances, the same is not required to be dealt with any further. thereafter, the honble supreme court has considered the fourth head namely patent illegality. while considering what can be said to be patent illegality the honble supreme court has observed in paragraph nos.40 to 45 as under; patent illegality 40.we now come to the fourth head of public policy namely, patent illegality. it must be remembered that under the explanation to section 34 (2) (b), an award is said to be in conflict with the public policy of india if the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption. this ground is perhaps the earliest ground on which courts in england set aside awards under english law. added to this ground (in 1802) is the ground that an arbitral award would be set aside if there were an error of law by the arbitrator. this is explained by lord justice denning in r v. northumberland compensation appeal tribunal. ex parte shaw., 1952 1 all er 122 at page 130: \"leaving now the statutory tribunals, i turn to the awards of the arbitrators. the court of king's bench never interfered by certiorari with the award of an arbitrator, because it was a private tribunal and not subject to the prerogative writs. if the award was not made a rule of court, the only course available to an aggrieved party was to resist an action on the award or to file a bill in equity. if the award was made a rule of court, a motion could be made to the court to set it aside for misconduct of the arbitrator on the ground that it was procured by corruption or other undue means: see the statute 9 and 10 will. iii, c. 15. at one time an award could not be upset on the ground of error of law by the arbitrator because that could not be said to be misconduct or undue means, but ultimately it was held in kent v. elstob, (1802) 3 east 18, that an award could be set aside for error of law hc-nic page 34 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 on the face of it. this was regretted by williams, j., in hodgkinson v. fernie, (1857) 3 c.b.n.s. 189, but is now well established.\" 41. this, in turn, led to the famous principle laid down in champsey bhara company v. the jivraj balloo spinning and weaving company ltd., air 1923 pc 66, where the privy council referred to hodgkinson and then laid down: \"the law on the subject has never been more clearly stated than by williams, j. in the case of hodgkinson v. fernie (1857) 3 c.b.n.s. 189. \"the law has for many years been settled, and remains so at this day, that, where a cause or matters in difference are referred to an arbitrator a lawyer or a layman, he is constituted the sole and final judge of all questions both of law and of fact . the only exceptions to that rule are cases where the award is the result of corruption or fraud, and one other, which though it is to be regretted, is now, i think firmly established viz., where the question of law necessarily arises on the face of the award or upon some paper accompanying and forming part of the award. though the propriety of this latter may very well be doubted, i think it may be considered as established.\" \"now the regret expressed by williams, j. in hodgkinson v. fernie has been repeated by more than one learned judge, and it is certainly not to be desired that the exception should be in any way extended. an error in law on the face of the award means, in their lordships' view, that you can find in the award or a document actually incorporated thereto, as for instance, a note appended by the arbitrator stating the reasons for his judgment, some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which you can then say is erroneous. it does not mean that if in a narrative a reference is made to a contention of one party that opens the door to seeing first what that contention is, and then going to the contract on which the parties' rights depend to see if that contention is sound. here it is impossible to say, from what is shown on the face of the award, what mistake the arbitrators made. the only way that the learned judges have arrived at finding what the mistake was is by saying: \"inasmuch as the arbitrators awarded so and so, and inasmuch as the letter shows that then buyer rejected the cotton, the hc-nic page 35 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 arbitrators can only have arrived at that result by totally misinterpreting cl.52.\" but they were entitled to give their own interpretation to cl. 52 or any other article, and the award will stand unless, on the face of it they have tied themselves down to some special legal proposition which then, when examined, appears to be unsound. upon this point, therefore, their lordships think that the judgment of pratt, j was right and the conclusion of the learned judges of the court of appeal erroneous.\" this judgment has been consistently followed in india to test awards under section 30 of the arbitration act, 1940. 42. in the 1996 act, this principle is substituted by the 'patent illegality' principle which, in turn, contains three sub heads ­ 42.1 (a) a contravention of the substantive law of india would result in the death knell of an arbitral award. this must be understood in the sense that such illegality must go to the root of the matter and cannot be of a trivial nature. this again is a really a contravention of section 28(1)(a) of the act, which reads as under: \"28. rules applicable to substance of dispute.­(1) where the place of arbitration is situated in india,­ (a) in an arbitration other than an international commercial arbitration, the arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute submitted to arbitration in accordance with the substantive law for the time being in force in india;\" 42.2 (b) a contravention of the arbitration act itself would be regarded as a patent illegality­ for example if an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award in contravention of section 31(3) of the act, such award will be liable to be set aside. 42.3 (c) equally, the third sub­head of patent illegality is really a contravention of section 28 (3) of the arbitration act, which reads as under: \"28. rules applicable to substance of dispute.­ (3) in all cases, the arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract and shall take into account the usages of the trade applicable to the transaction.\" this last contravention must be understood with a caveat. an arbitral tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract, but if an arbitrator construes a term of the contract in a reasonable manner, it will not mean that the award can be set hc-nic page 36 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 aside on this ground. construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide unless the arbitrator construes the contract in such a way that it could be said to be something that no fair minded or reasonable person could do. 43. in mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181, this court held as under: \"112. it is trite that the terms of the contract can be express or implied. the conduct of the parties would also be a relevant factor in the matter of construction of a contract. the construction of the contract agreement is within the jurisdiction of the arbitrators having regard to the wide nature, scope and ambit of the arbitration agreement and they cannot be said to have misdirected themselves in passing the award by taking into consideration the conduct of the parties. it is also trite that correspondences exchanged by the parties are required to be taken into consideration for the purpose of construction of a contract. interpretation of a contract is a matter for the arbitrator to determine, even if it gives rise to determination of a question of law. (see pure helium india (p) ltd. v. ongc [(2003) 8 scc 593] and d.d. sharma v. union of india [(2004) 5 scc 325]). 113. once, thus, it is held that the arbitrator had the jurisdiction, no further question shall be raised and the court will not exercise its jurisdiction unless it is found that there exists any bar on the face of the award.\" 44. in msk projects (i) (jv) ltd. v. state of rajasthan, (2011) 10 scc 573, the court held: \"17. if the arbitrator commits an error in the construction of the contract, that is an error within his jurisdiction. but if he wanders outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits a jurisdictional error. extrinsic evidence is admissible in such cases because the dispute is not something which arises under or in relation to the contract or dependent on the construction of the contract or to be determined within the award. the ambiguity of the award can, in such cases, be resolved by admitting extrinsic evidence. the rationale of this rule is that the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined outside and independent of what appears in the award. such a jurisdictional error needs to be proved by evidence extrinsic to the award. (see gobardhan das v. lachhmi ram [air 1954 sc 689], thawardas pherumal v. union of india [air 1955 sc 468], hc-nic page 37 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 union of india v. kishorilal gupta & bros.

[(1984) 4 scc 679 : air 1985 sc 1156] ).\" 45. in rashtriya ispat nigam ltd. v. dewan chand ram saran, (2012) 5 scc 306, the court held: \"43. in any case, assuming that clause 9.3 was capable of two interpretations, the view taken by the arbitrator was clearly a possible if not a plausible one. it is not possible to say that the arbitrator had travelled outside his jurisdiction, or that the view taken by him was against the terms of contract. that being the position, the high court had no reason to interfere with the award and substitute its view in place of the interpretation accepted by the arbitrator. 44. the legal position in this behalf has been summarized in para 18 of the judgment of this court in sail v. gupta brother steel tubes ltd. [(2009) 10 scc 63: (2009) 4 scc (civ) 16] and which has been referred to above. similar view has been taken later in sumitomo heavy industries ltd. v. ongc ltd. [(2010) 11 scc 296: (2010) 4 scc (civ) 459] to which one of us (gokhale, j.) was a party. the observations in para 43 thereof are instructive in this behalf. 45. this para 43 reads as follows: (sumitomo case [(2010) 11 scc 296 : (2010) 4 scc (civ) 459] , scc p. 313) \"43. . the umpire has considered the fact situation and placed a construction on the clauses of the agreement which according to him was the correct one. one may at the highest say that one would have preferred another construction of clause 17.3 but that cannot make the award in any way perverse. nor can one substitute one's own view in such a situation, in place of the one taken by the umpire, which would amount to sitting in appeal. as held by this court in kwality mfg. corpn. v. central warehousing corpn. [(2009) 5 scc 142 : (2009) 2 scc (civ) 406] the court while considering challenge to arbitral award does not sit in appeal over the findings and decision of the arbitrator, which is what the high court has practically done in this matter. the umpire is legitimately entitled to hc-nic page 38 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 take the view which he holds to be the correct one after considering the material before him and after interpreting the provisions of the agreement. if he does so, the decision of the umpire has to be accepted as final and binding.\" 10.2. applying the law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in the aforesaid decisions, this court is required to examine and / or consider whether the learned commercial court is justified in modifying the award declared by the learned arbitral tribunal and in allowing the claim no.3 i.e. claim with respect to the escalation which was rejected by the learned tribunal, in exercise of powers under section 34 of the arbitration act ? this court is also required to consider whether in the facts and circumstances of the case learned commercial court is justified in rejecting section 34 application in so far as confirming the award declared by the arbitral tribunal rejecting the claim no.4 i.e. claim with respect to extra costs on account of overstay ? 11. now, so far as the claim no.3 with respect to escalation price is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that in the contract/ agreement / work order, it was specifically mentioned that prices are \"firm and no escalation will be allowed during the currency of the contract period.\" however, subsequently sil insisted for escalation price even at the time when the period of contract was extended. however, gmdc did not agree for the same and therefore, sil at the relevant time did not pursue their insistence for escalation clause. it is true that thereafter the sil continued the work and complete the work within the extended hc-nic page 39 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 period. it is also true that subsequently when the sil submitted the invoices, the same were with escalation price as per formula earlier suggested by it but was not accepted by the gmdc. however, it was the case on behalf of the sil that in the communication dated 22.02.2007 the gmdc agreed to consider their claim of escalation price. it appears that entire claim of the escalation by the sil was based on the premise that gmdc did not object to their letter dated 17.08.2004 written by the sil and that if allowed the claimant to proceed with the work. it was also the case on behalf of the sil that officer of the gmdc assured that the escalation price would be paid. however, in absence of any specific evidence with respect to time and name of the officer by whom such representation was made and in absence of any evidence led by sil with respect to such assurance, learned arbitrator did not accept the case of the sil. at this stage, it is required to be noted that as such sil had not led any oral evidence. from the reasons and the findings recorded by learned arbitral tribunal, it appears that the learned arbitral tribunal rejected the claim no.3 i.e. claim with respect to escalation on the ground that (1) claim not supported by documentary evidence; (2) gmdc specifically denied escalation; (3) no evidence / corroborative as regards delinquent or officer of the gmdc (4) section 55 of the indian contract act shall not be applicable. 11.1. however, the learned commercial court has reversed the finding recorded by the learned arbitral tribunal by observing that parties had chosen not to lead any ocular evidence and therefore, the submission on behalf of the gmdc that document in question have not been proved by the sil by way of leading oral hc-nic page 40 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 evidence do not find any force. however, it is required to be noted that by the aforesaid conduct, the requirement of proving case was not done away and still the sil was required to prove its case by leading evidence. under the circumstances, learned commercial court has materially erred in reversing the finding recorded by the learned sole arbitrator and that too in exercise of powers under section 34 of the arbitration act. 11.2. now, so far as the letter dated 22.02.2007 which was heavily relied upon by the sil and in which, according to the sil, the gmdc stated that question of escalation will be considered by it, it is required to be noted that in the said communication dated 22.02.2007 there does not appear to be any such assurance given by the gmdc to consider the claim regarding escalation. what is stated is that \"mr. u.b.singh has also raised points regarding escalation & over run of contract. it is informed that during contract closure these points alongwith penalty, liquidated damages etc. as per contract will be taken in consideration as per the contract\". the learned arbitrator has observed that the communication/ letter dated dated 22.02.2007 cannot be said to be acceptance of escalation price. however, the learned commercial court has reversed the finding recorded by the learned arbitral tribunal in relation to the letter dated 22.02.2007 by observing that \"even assurances given by the responsible and authorized representative of the respondent cannot be given a go­ bye as it emerges from the correspondence appears to have been hc-nic page 41 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 find force and, therefore, no cogent reasons even has been adduced by the respondent for not believing the same.\" from the aforesaid, it appears that learned commercial court has therefore, materially erred in reversing the finding recorded by the learned arbitrator in relation to the letter dated 22.02.2007 and in considering and / or treating the letter dated 22.02.2007 addressed by the gmdc to simplex as acceptance of claim in relation to escalation. 11.3. it is required to be noted that the sil heavily relied upon section 55 of the indian contract act as well as section 62 of the indian contract act. now, so far as reliance placed upon the 3rd part of the section 55 of the contract act is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that in the facts and circumstances narrated herein above, section 55, more particularly, 3rd part of section 55 shall not be applicable and / or of any assistance to the sil. merely because, time to complete the work was extended by the gmdc, the sil shall not be entitled to compensation for any loss occasioned by the non performance of the promise at the time of agreement. at this stage, it is required to be noted that as such learned arbitrator did not go into the merits, on who was responsible for delay. 11.4. now, so far as reliance placed upon section 62 of the contract act is concerned, section 62 shall be applicable in a case where there was novation of contract and the original contract is entirely substituted. when new contract comes into effect the original contract need not be performed at all. this was not the hc-nic page 42 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 case in the instant case. in the original contract only, the gmdc granted extension of time. therefore, the reliance upon section 62 of the contract act was absolutely misplaced. considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it appears that learned commercial court has materially erred in reversing the finding recorded by the learned arbitral tribunal in relation to the escalation. the learned commercial court has exceeded its jurisdiction in exercising the powers under section 34 of the arbitration act as an appellate court, which is not permissible. 11.5. even otherwise, the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned commercial court in allowing the claim no.3 in toto and that too in exercise of powers under section 34 of the arbitration act, cannot be sustained. whatever the claim was made by the claimant so stated in the statement of claim, the same has been allowed by the commercial court. it is required to be noted that as such sil did not lead any oral evidence and therefore, did not prove the claim and computation by leading evidence, its claim in relation to escalation. at this stage, it is required to be noted that as such gmdc specifically denied the claim no.3 and even computation of claim no.3. therefore, the same was required to be proved by leading evidence, by sil. 11.6. at this stage, it is required to be noted that in fact during the course of the hearing, even the learned commercial court directed, rather requested learned counsel for both the parties to avail the scope of section 34(4) of the arbitration act, instead of seeking remittance of award under section 16 of the old arbitration act. hc-nic page 43 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 however, the same was not accepted by the learned counsel for the respective parties and they requested for disposal of the application under section 34 of the arbitration act in accordance with law. at this stage, it is required to be noted that even learned counsel for the sil submitted that while exercising the powers under section 34(4) of the arbitration act both the issue pertaining to escalation and extra costs incurred on account of overstay be referred to the arbitrator. however the same was not amenable to the learned counsel for the gmdc. even the similar request was made by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil to remand the matter to the learned arbitrator, which is vehemently opposed by learned counsel for the gmdc. learned counsel for the gmdc has vehemently submitted that remanding the matter to the learned arbitrator, by the court in exercise of powers under section 34/ 37 of the arbitration act is not permissible. it is submitted by shri soparkar, learned counsel for the gmdc that once the learned arbitrator declares the award, thereafter learned arbitrator becomes functus officio and thereafter he has no authority to continue with the arbitration proceedings. 11.7. even otherwise it is required to be noted that there are no such powers of remand vested with the court exercising the powers either under section 34 or section 37 of the arbitration act. the only power the court possesses is under section 34(4) of the arbitration act, which is the repository of power invested in the court. section 34(4) of the arbitration reads as under: \"34. . hc-nic page 44 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 (4). on receipt of an application under sub­section (1), the court may, where it is appropriate and it is so requested by a party, adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of arbitral tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award.\" 11.7.1 considering the aforesaid provision it is amply clear that the court can defer the hearing of the application filed under section 34 of the arbitration act setting aside the award on a written request made by a party to the arbitration proceedings to facilitate the arbitral tribunal by resuming the arbitration proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of the arbitral tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. the quintessence for exercising the the power under this provision is that the arbitral award has not been set aside. the challenge to the said award has been set up under section 34 of the arbitration act about the deficiencies in the arbitral award which may be curable by allowing the arbitral tribunal to take such measures which can eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. no power has been invested by the parliament in the court to remand the matter to the arbitral tribunal except to adjourn the proceedings for the limited purpose mentioned in sub­section (4) of section 34. the view which we are expressing is supported by the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of mcdermott international inc. vs. burn standard ltd. reported in (2006) 11 scc 181. hc-nic page 45 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 11.7.2 even considering sub­section (4) of section 34 of the arbitration act, the limited discretion available to the court under sub­section (4) of section 34 can be exercised only upon a written application made in that behalf by a party to the arbitration proceedings. even such a request can be made before formally setting aside the award. before formally setting aside the award, if the party to the arbitration proceedings fails to request the court to defer the proceedings pending before it, then it is not open to a party to move an application under sub­section (4) of section 34 of the arbitration act. as observed hereinabove, consequent to disposal of the main proceedings under section 34 of the arbitration act by the court, it would become functus officio. therefore, the limited remedy available under section 34(4) of the arbitration act is required to be invoked by the party to the arbitration proceedings before the award is set aside by the court. at this stage it is required to be noted that in the present case even without any formal application by either of the parties to the arbitration proceedings, the learned commercial court gave an option to the original applicant to go before the arbitral tribunal under section 34(4) of the arbitration act. that however, the parties refused to the said suggestion and requested the court to pass the order on merits. therefore, now, it is not open for the original applicant ­ sil to request to remand the matter to the learned arbitral tribunal. under the circumstances, the request made by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil to remand the matter to the arbitrator, hc-nic page 46 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 canot be accepted. 11.8. now, so far as reliance placed upon the decision in the case of a.m. ahmed and co (supra) relied upon by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that in the said decision it was specific finding recorded by the learned arbitrator that there was a delay in execution of the contract due to the conduct of food corporation of india and therefore, corporation was liable for the consequence of the delay viz. increase in statutory wages. it is required to be noted that in the present case there is no such finding given by the learned arbitrator and / or even learned commercial court that the delay was attributable to the gmdc. the learned arbitrator specifically observed that in the facts and circumstances of the case, it is not necessary to go into the merits of the rival contention as regards the reasons of delay attributable to whom. despite the above, learned commercial court has observed that gmdc never appeared to have fulfilled its obligation of providing drawings and work fronts in time resulting in delay in completion of the project. even in the reasoning assigned while disposing of the claim no.1, the learned commercial court has observed that delay is not attributable to the claimant only. therefore, what was required to be thereafter considered was whether who was responsible for the delay and to what extent was again required to be considered. as observed herein above, the learned arbitrator did not go into the merits of the rival contention as regards reasons of delay attributable to whom. under the circumstances, the aforesaid decision shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand. hc-nic page 47 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 11.9. now, so far as reliance placed upon the decision in the case of k.n.sathyapalan (supra) relied upon by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that in the case before the hon'ble supreme court there was absence of of any price escalation clause in the original agreement and even there was absence of specific prohibition to the contrary in the supplemental agreement. in the instant case, in the original agreement there is specific price escalation clause and it is stated that there shall not be any escalation allowed and price will remain firm. even in the subsequent correspondence also, gmdc never agreed for price escalation even at the time when period of contract was extended. under the circumstances, the decision shall not be applicable to the facts of the case. 12. in view of the above and for the reasons stated above, we are of the opinion that learned commercial court has materially erred in allowing claim no.3 which was rejected by the learned arbitrator, by reversing the finding recorded by the learned arbitrator, while exercising the powers under section 34 of the arbitration act. under the circumstances, appeal preferred by the gmdc being first appeal no. 618 of 2017 deserves to be allowed and is accordingly allowed. first appeal no. 778 of 2017 13. now, so far as first appeal no. 778 of 2017 preferred by the sil against the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned commercial court dismissing the application under section 34 of the arbitration act and confirming the award declared by the hc-nic page 48 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 learned tribunal rejecting the claim no.4 i.e. claim with respect to extra costs on account of overstay is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that as such there are concurrent findings of fact recorded by the learned arbitrator as well as learned commercial court. therefore, the present appeal which will be under section 37 of the arbitration act is concerned, the court would have very limited scope and the jurisdiction. as observed and held by the hon'ble supreme court as well as this court in catena of decisions, against the order passed by the learned arbitrator even the first court exercising the power under section 34 of the arbitration act would have very limited scope and the jurisdiction and as observed herein above, the court while considering the application under section 34/37 of the act is not sitting as an appellate court against the award declared by the learned arbitrator. the scope and exercise of jurisdiction by this court in exercise of powers under section 37 of the arbitration act by this court will be co­terminus with the scope of section 34 of the act and therefore, unless and until the case is made out for interference as per law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of associate builders (supra), this court would not be justified in interfering with the findings recorded by the learned arbitrator, confirmed by the learned commercial court. 13.1. it is required to be noted that so far as claim no.4 i.e. with respect to extra costs on account of overstay is concerned, it was the case on behalf of the sil that as the sil had to remain on the site for the period beyond the date of completion of the contract, on account of which, it had to incur extra costs. the same hc-nic page 49 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 came to be negatived and / or rejected by the learned arbitrator by giving specific finding that the sil has failed to justify the claim by proving (1) that the entire period of overstay was due to the reasons attributable to the respondent; and (2) the sil had made all possible efforts to mitigate the expenses which it might have incurred on account of overstay. even the sil also failed to prove by way of producing cogent proof to show that during this entire period of overstay only on account of this contract work, it had to incur further costs in addition thereto to show that the extra expenses were incurred by the claimant during the period of overstay. the learned arbitrator while considering the aforesaid claim specifically observed that at the very site where the particular contract work was carried out, there were three other construction works which were being carried on by the sil. even, sil failed to adduce any cogent evidence to prove the payment made towards maintenance of the site machinery, manpower engaged and the payment made by them. therefore, in absence of any cogent evidence on record, the learned arbitrator rightly rejected the said claim. the aforesaid has been confirmed by the learned commercial court. considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case and the findings recorded by the learned arbitrator recorded while rejecting the claim no.4 i.e. with respect to claim on account of extra costs incurred due to overstay, it cannot be said that the same deserve any interference of this court in exercise of powers under section 37 of the arbitration act. we are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned arbitrator as well as learned commercial court. hc-nic page 50 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 14. now, so far as submission made by shri kavina, learned counsel for the sil that in fact in the written statement of defence filed by the gmdc of 30.01.2010 before the learned arbitrator, the gmdc admitted the claim in part, in respect to the amount payable by the gmdc to sil towards extra costs/ overstay is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that as such no such submissions were made either before the learned arbitrator or before the learned commercial court. even considering, the written statement of the sil before the commercial court submitted by the gmdc it does not appear that there was any such admission. it is required to be noted that in the original written statement filed by the gmdc, the gmdc had denied the claim of overstay in toto. in fact, further written statement, which according to the sil there is an admission, it appears that the same was submitted to display the arithmetic and logical inaccuracy in sil's calculation and the same cannot be said to be in any way admission on the part of the gmdc. 14.1. as rightly observed by the learned arbitrator as well as learned commercial court merely because the sil continued to carry on the work after a period of 22 months, the sil is not entitled to compensation for the overstay. the sil was required to prove that the overstay was due to the delay on the part of the gmdc and that sil was required to be adduced cogent evidence with respect to the actual claim and the expenditure incurred. 14.2. now, so far as reliance placed upon section 70 of the contract act is concerned, assuming that section 70 of the contract hc-nic page 51 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 act may be applicable in that case also, even while claiming compensation, the sil was required to prove that entire period of overstay was due to the reasons attributable to the gmdc, that the sil made all possible efforts to mitigate the expenses which it might have incurred on account of overstay. importantly even, sil was required to prove by producing cogent evidence the actual expenses / costs incurred/ made towards maintenance of the site machinery, manpower engaged and the payment made to them. 14.3. considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances and the reasoning given by the learned arbitrator as well as learned commercial court, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned commercial court confirming the award declared by the learned arbitrator with respect to claim no.4 i.e. with respect to extra costs on account of overstay. we are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned arbitrator as well as learned commercial court. 14.4. under the circumstances, the present first appeal no. 778 of 2017 preferred by the sil deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed. 15. in view of the above and for the reasons stated above, first appeal no. 618 of 2017 preferred by the gmdc is hereby allowed and the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned commercial court, ahmedabad dated 28.12.2016 in commercial civil miscellaneous application no. 52 of 2016 is hereby quashed and set aside in so far as modifying the award declared by the learned arbitrator and allowing the claim no.3 with respect to hc-nic page 52 of 53 created on sun aug 13 04:15:17 ist 2017 escalation. 15.1. in view of the above and for the reasons stated above, first appeal no. 778 of 2017 is hereby dismissed and the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned commercial court, ahmedabad dated 28.12.2016 in commercial civil miscellaneous application no. 52 of 2016 rejecting section 34 application and confirming the award declared by the learned arbitrator with respect to claim no.4 ­ with respect to extra costs on account of overstay is hereby confirmed. in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs. sd/­ (m.r. shah, j.) sd/­ (b.n. karia, j.) kaushik
