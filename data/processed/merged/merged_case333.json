This '20.03.2024 order' made by Salem Commercial Court shall be referred to as 'impugned order' for the sake of convenience. \n2. In and vide the impugned order, Salem Commercial Court has allowed an implead application taken out by a partnership firm and its partner seeking to implead themselves as respondents 4 and 5 [R4 & R5] in Arb.O.P.No.1 of 2024. To be noted, Arb.O.P.No.1 of 2024 is an application under Section 9 of 'The Arbitration and Conciliation Act (Act No.26 of 1996)' [hereinafter 'A and C Act' for the sake of convenience and clarity]. To put it with precision, it is an application under Section 9(1)(ii)(e) of A and C Act with a prayer for temporary/mandatory injunction, directing HDFC Bank to permit operation of a Bank account https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A (CAD) (SR) No.41810 of 2024 in the name of 'M/s.Narasus Spinning Mill (a Partnership firm)' [hereinafter 'said firm' for the sake of brevity and convenience] and a temporary injunction restraining one of the partners of said partnership firm from interfering in the affairs of the said firm. \n3. To be noted, captioned CMA has been listed under the cause list caption 'FOR MAINTAINABILITY' as Registry has entertained doubts as to whether an appeal under Section 37(1)(b) of A and C Act would lie as impugned order has acceded to an implead prayer i.e., it has neither granted nor refused any measure under Section 9 of A and C Act. \n4. Mr.M.S.Seshadri, learned counsel for appellants is before us and for the sake of completion of facts, we deem it appropriate to say that four appellants before us have filed a petition under Section 11 of A and C Act in this Court vide O.P.No.3 of 2024 and this Section 11 petition is predicated on arbitration agreement ['arbitration agreement' within the meaning of Section 2(1)(b) read with Section 7 of A and C Act] which is in the form of a clause in a 'partnership deed dated 26.05.2020' [hereinafter 'said partnership deed' for the sake of convenience]. This Court is informed that this Section 11 OP is pending. Aforementioned Arb.O.P.No.1 of 2024 i.e., Section 9 application is 'before' arbitral proceedings is learned counsel's say. To be noted, the date of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A (CAD) (SR) No.41810 of 2024 commencement of arbitral proceedings i.e., commencement within the meaning of Section 21 of A and C Act is 17.06.2023 as that is the date on which noticee received trigger notice dated 12.06.2023. \n5. This Court, having captured the essentials, now deems it appropriate to get it into the legal drill qua maintainability of captioned CMA. \n6. Mr.M.S.Seshadri, learned counsel placed reliance on three orders. One is an order dated 24.02.2020 made in V.G.Santhosam and Others Vs. Shanthi Gnanasekaran and Others reported in 2020 SCC OnLine Mad 560 by a Hon'ble single Judge of this Court, the second is an order dated 02.02.2021 in M.Mythrai Vs. T.Ramesh and Others reported in 2021 SCC OnLine Mad 13704 made by another Hon'ble single Judge of this Court and the third is an order dated 24.07.2023 in Arupri Logistics Pvt. Ltd., Vs. Vilas Gupta and Others reported in 2023 SCC OnLine Del 4297 made by a Hon'ble single Judge of Delhi High Court. \n7. The aforementioned three orders were relied on by the learned counsel to say that the captioned CMA is maintainable though it is an order acceding to an implead prayer by a Section 9 Court. Learned counsel predicated his campaign on his sheet anchor submission that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A (CAD) (SR) No.41810 of 2024 'implead' is an 'order under Section 9' and that it is an 'order under Section 9(1)(ii)(e) of A and C Act to be precise'.\n8. Before we proceed further with the maintainability drill on hand, we deem it appropriate to say that the expression '(and from no others)' occurring in parenthesis in sub-section (1) of Section 37 of A and C Act is a clear negative import qua statutory expression, it came up for consideration before Hon'ble Supreme Court in Fuerst Day Lawson Limited Vs. Jindal Exports Limited reported in (2011) 8 SCC 333 and relevant paragraphs are Paragraphs 89 to 91 and the same read as follows:\n89.It is, thus, to be seen that Arbitration Act, 1940, from its inception and right through to 2004 (in P.S. Sathappan [(2004) 11 SCC 672] ) was held to be a selfcontained code. Now, if the Arbitration Act, 1940 was held to be a self- contained code, on matters pertaining to arbitration, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which consolidates, amends and designs the law relating to arbitration to bring it, as much as possible, in harmony with the UNCITRAL Model must be held only to be more so. Once it is held that the Arbitration Act is a self-contained code and exhaustive, then it must also be held, using the lucid expression of Tulzapurkar, J., that it carries with it a negative import that only such acts https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A (CAD) (SR) No.41810 of 2024 as are mentioned in the Act are permissible to be done and acts or things not mentioned therein are not permissible to be done. In other words, a letters patent appeal would be excluded by the application of one of the general principles that where the special Act sets out a self-contained code the applicability of the general law procedure would be impliedly excluded. \n90.We, thus, arrive at the conclusion regarding the exclusion of a letters patent appeal in two different ways; one, so to say, on a micro basis by examining the scheme devised by Sections 49 and 50 of the 1996 Act and the radical change that it brings about in the earlier provision of appeal under Section 6 of the 1961 Act and the other on a macro basis by taking into account the nature and character of the 1996 Act as a self-contained and exhaustive code in itself.\n91.In light of the discussions made above , it must be held that no letters patent appeal will lie against an order which is not appealable under Section 50 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. \n9. Reverting to the maintainability legal drill on hand, we tested the aforementioned argument of learned counsel on a demurrer i.e., accepting the argument that impugned order is an order under Section 9(1)(ii)(e) of A and C Act. The neat question is, whether this is a interim measure of protection, even if tested on a demurrer in this manner, it https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A (CAD) (SR) No.41810 of 2024 does not answer in the affirmative the straight /neat question i.e., whether the impugned order will tantamount to 'granting or refusing an interim measure under Section 9 of A and C Act'. We do not propose to further this legal drill as we are leaving open this question as learned counsel for appellants at this stage fervently submitted that it will suffice if right to contest the impugned order is left open after the Salem Commercial Court takes a decision i.e., either grants or refuses the prayer in Section 9 application and that such contesation will be only as part of a Section 37(i)(b) appeal against Section 9 order either as an applicant or as a respondent as that would depend on outcome of pending Section 9 application. \n10. As we are leaving open the question that has arisen, we refrain from expressing any opinion one way or the other on aforementioned two orders of Hon'ble single Judges of this Court in V.G.Santhosam case, M.Mythrai case and order of Hon'ble single Judge of Delhi High Court in Arupri Logistics case. However, as a matter of good order, we deem it appropriate to say that we have noticed that V.G.Santhosam case has been carried to Hon'ble Supreme Court by way of S.L.P (C) Nos.9234- 9237/2020 and Hon'ble Supreme Court has made the following order:\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A (CAD) (SR) No.41810 of 2024 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A (CAD) (SR) No.41810 of 2024 11. The aforementioned order makes it clear that V.G.Santhosam case remains an order of Hon'ble single Judge of this Court. The reason is Doctrine of merger has not kicked in owing to Kunhayammed principle i.e., Kunhayammed and Others Vs. State of Kerala and another reported in (2000) 6 SCC 359.\n12. In other words, the aforementioned order has been made prior to issue of notice in the first part of Article 136 of Constitution of India and therefore, there is no Doctrine of merger. Paragraph 80 of V.G.Santhosam case wherein and whereby Hon'ble single Judge has left open rights qua a civil suit also becomes relevant as Hon'ble Supreme Court has notice this in dismissing SLP i.e., not granting leave. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A (CAD) (SR) No.41810 of 2024 13. In M.Mythrai case vide Paragraph 70, Hon'ble single Judge has only followed V.G.Santhosam case. Arupri Logistics being an order of another Hon'ble High Court, we deem it appropriate to say that we are not expressing any opinion at this juncture and we reserve for a matter where a legal drill becomes imperative. \n14. The petitioners in the implead application, namely, the firm and its partner, who are R1 and R2 in captioned CMA have lodged a caveat qua anticipated CRP but learned counsel for appellants has been very fair in favouring the learned counsel for caveator copies of the captioned matter and Ms.Suba Shiny, learned counsel for caveator is also before this Court. As the matter is listed for maintainability, learned counsel for caveator does not have a say. To be noted, counsel for caveator would not have a say even if the matter is tested for admission. Learned counsel for caveator would get audience only when the question of granting interim order is considered. Therefore, we deem it appropriate to just record the factual position that learned counsel for caveator is also before this Court when this proceedings unfurled and we leave it at that. \n15. In the light of the narrative thus far, the following order is made:\ni) The learned Judge presiding over the Commercial https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A (CAD) (SR) No.41810 of 2024 Court, Salem is requested to dispose of Arb.O.P.No.1 of 2024 as expeditiously as the business of the Court would permit but in any event on or before 30.04.2024. To be noted, in making this request this Court has also noticed the pendency in the Salem Commercial Court as reflected in the 'National Judicial Data Grid' ('NJDG');\nii) Salem Commercial Court to decide the Section 9 application de hors this order i.e., untrammelled by this order;\niii) This means that on or before 30.04.2024, Salem Commercial Court would either grant or refuse interim measure sought for under Section 9 of A and C Act;\niiv) This Court is informed that the next listing before the Salem Commercial Court is 24.04.2024. It is open to the parties to make a prayer to advance the hearing;\nv) After Salem Commercial Court decides Arb.O.P.No.1 of 2024 either by granting or refusing the interim measure, it will be open to any party /parties aggrieved to come before this Court by way of appeal/appeals under Section 37(1)(b) of A and C Act. \nvi) If an appeal as above is filed in this Court, we make https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A (CAD) (SR) No.41810 of 2024 it clear that the question as to the correctness of the Commercial Court acceding to the implead prayer in I.A.No.2 of 2024 or in other words the correctness of the impugned order is left open to be tested. To put it differently, parties to such a petition under Section 37(1)(b) can raise the plea that the Commercial Court ought not to have acceded to the implead prayer and counter argument which will be considered as part of Section 37(1)(b) legal drill if that be so. \n16. With the above directions and observations, this CMA is disposed of at the SR stage itself. There shall be no order as to costs. \n(M.S.,J.)

allahabad neutral citation no. 2024:ahc:76378-db chief justice's court case :appeal under section 37 of arbitration and conciliation act 1996 no. 161 of 2024 appellant :ganga prasad memorial trust and

singh and tejas singh, ashish kumar singh hon'ble arun bhansali,chief justice hon'ble vikas budhwar,j. 1. this appeal under section 37 of arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the act\") is directed against the order dated 18.01.2024 passed by commercial court, varanasi, whereby the application, filed by the respondent, under section 9 of the act has been partly allowed. 2. the respondent filed application under section 9 of the act, inter alia, with the submissions that its main work was academic consultancy, teacher training and academic delivery system in education field meant for schools being run as per c.b.s.e. norms. the said services are provided to the societies, trusts, companies and other educational institutions on payment of consultancy charges for over 20 years. it was indicated that a memorandum of understanding was entered into between the appellant and the respondent on 30.01.2017 and a registered agreement dated 11.12.2018 was executed indicating the terms of the agreement. it was indicated that the academic consultancy charges amounting to rs. 45,57,781/were due for which cheques were issued, which were dishonoured. on account of violation of the agreement, notice was issued on 10.04.2023, which was not responded. however, the appellant continued to use the logo and school name which it was using under the agreement. based on the said submissions, injunction was sought against the respondent for not using the name 'sunbeam' and logo etc. and not to run the school in the name of sunbeam school, babatpur. 3. it appears that by order dated 21.10.2023, the opportunity to file response of the respondent was closed by the court whereafter when the matter came up for arguments on the application, the order impugned was passed. 4. learned counsel for the appellant made submissions that the commercial court was not justified in accepting the application. submissions have been made that the order has been passed in a cursory manner wherein only on account of closing of opportunity to file response, the order impugned has been passed without recording any finding on the aspects of prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury, which is necessary for the purpose of grant of injunction/interim order. further submissions have been made that in view of the provisions of section 9(3) of the act, once the arbitral tribunal has been constituted, the court cannot entertain an application, unless the court finds that the circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under section 17 efficacious. in the present case, the application under section 9 of the act was filed on 27.04.2023, the arbitral tribunal was appointed by this court on 16.11.2023 and the impugned order has been passed on 18.01.2024. it was submitted that once the arbitral tribunal was constituted on 16.11.2023, the order impugned could not have been passed on 18.01.2024 and on that count also, the order impugned deserves to be set aside. reliance was placed on arcelor mittal nippon steel india ltd. v. essar bulk terminal ltd. : (2022) 1 scc 712. 5. learned counsel for the respondent vehemently opposed the submissions. it was submitted that the commercial court was justified in passing the order impugned as the response was closed. further submissions were made that the c.b.s.e. has already directed the appellant not to use the name 'sunbeam' and its logo. further, the recognition of the appellant stood terminated on 31st march onwards by basic shiksha adhikari, varanasi and, therefore, the appeal deserves to be dismissed. learned counsel for the respondent further emphasized that under section 9(3) of the act, the court in the present circumstances could entertain the application despite the constitution of the arbitral tribunal. the application was filed before the constitution of the tribunal and the word 'entertain' has been interpreted by hon'ble supreme court to mean \"to consider the application by applying mind to the issues involved/raised\" and as the commercial court had already applied its mind to the issues raised in the present matter as various applications were filed after filing of the application under section 9 of the act, wherein the appellant had questioned the maintainability of the proceedings, amendment applications were filed by the respondent and the court had directed on 15.11.2023, fixing 21.11.2023 for the evidence of the respondent, which necessarily means that the matter has already been entertained by the court and, therefore, the plea raised in this regard has no substance. reliance was placed on observations made in arcelor mittal nippon steel india ltd. (supra). 6. we have considered the submissions made by counsel for the parties and have perused the material available on record. 7. it would be appropriate to quote the relevant portion of the order passed by the commercial court, which reads as under: \"16. आवेदक एवं विपक्षीगण के विद्वान अधिवक्तागण की बहस सुनी गयी एवं पत्रावली पर उपलब्ध अभिलेखों एवं साक्ष्यों का अवलोकन एवं परिशीलन किया। 17. वादी

would reveal that the commercial court merely referred to the documents produced by the respondent, the judgments and the law cited and observed that as the response has been filed by the appellant after passage of the prescribed time, the same cannot be read regarding which order has already been passed on 21.10.2023 and as qua the averments made by the applicant no evidence on behalf of the appellant was admissible, the application deserves to be partly allowed and passed the order, as indicated. 9. it is, thus, apparent that the order impugned has been passed only on account of the fact that the response filed to the application under section 9 of the act was ordered not to be taken into consideration as the same was filed beyond the prescribed time. however, non filing of the response to the application/non consideration of the reply filed, by itself does not entitle the applicant to get the relief as prayed for. the commercial court, while dealing with an application under section 9 of the act, is required to record findings on the three parameters, i.e., (i) prima facie case, (ii) balance of convenience, and (iii) irreparable injury, which determination is sine qua non for the purpose of grant of relief in any application of the present nature. failure of the commercial court to record any finding on the said aspects worth the name, vitiates the order impugned. 10. coming to the issue pertaining to the order impugned being in violation of section 9(3) of the act, the relevant provision, inter alia, reads as under: \"9. interim measures, etc., by court.--(1) a party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36, apply to a court-(i) . (ii) . (2) . (3) once the arbitral tribunal has been constituted, the court shall not entertain an application under sub-section (1), unless the court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under section 17 efficacious.\" 11. a bare reading of the above provision reveals that though a party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or any time after making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36, apply to a court seeking interim measures, sub-section (3) restricts the power of the court in entertaining an application under sub-section (1) once the arbitral tribunal has been constituted, unless the court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under section 17 efficacious. 12. in the present case, admittedly, the application was filed on 27.04.2023 before the commercial court, varanasi, the arbitrator was appointed by order of this court on 16.11.2023 and the order impugned has been passed on 18.01.2024. the above provisions has been exhaustively dealt with by hon'ble supreme court in the case of arcelor mittal nippon steel india ltd. (supra) wherein the term 'entertain' has been explained and it has, inter alia, been laid down as under: \"90. in kundan lal v jagan nath sharma and ors. (supra), a division bench of allahabad high court held that the expression \"entertain\" did not mean the same thing as the filing of the application or admission of the application by the court. the dictionary meaning of the word \"enterain\" was to deal with or to take matter into consideration. the high court further held:\"7. the use of the word 'entertain' in the proviso to r. 90 of or. xxi denotes a point of time at which an application to set aside the sale is heard by the court. this appears to be clear from the fact that in the proviso it is stated that no application to set aside a sale shall be entertained 'upon any ground which could have been taken by the applicant on or before the date on which the sale proclamation was drawn up.' surely, the question as to the consideration of the grounds upon which the application is based can only arise when it is being considered by the court on the merits, that is, when the court is called upon to apply its mind to the grounds urged in the application. in our view the stage at which the applicant is required to make the deposit or give the security within the meaning of cl. (b) of the proviso would come when the hearing of the application is due to commence.\" 91. in hindustan commercial bank ltd. v punnu sahu (supra), the court held that the expression \"entertain\" in the proviso to clause (b) order 21 rule 90 (as amended by allahabad high court), means to \"adjudicate upon\" or \"proceed to consider on merits\" and not \"initiation of proceeding.\" 92. in martin & haris limited (supra), the court was considering proviso to section 21 of the u.p. urban buildings (regulation of letting, rent and eviction) act, 1972 which provided that where the building was in the occupation of a tenant since before its purchase by the landlord, such purchase being made after the commencement of this act, no application shall be entertained on the grounds mentioned in clause (a), unless a period of 3 years has elapsed since the date of such purchase and the landlord has given a notice in that behalf to the tenant, not less than 6 months before such application, and such notice may be given before the expiration of the aforesaid period of 3 years. the court held :-\" thus the word \"entertain\" mentioned in the first proviso to section 21(1) in connection with grounds mentioned in clause (a) would necessarily mean entertaining the ground for consideration for the purpose of adjudication on merits and not at any stage prior thereto as tried to be submitted by learned senior counsel, shri rao, for the appellant.\" 93. it is now well settled that the expression \"entertain\" means to consider by application of mind to the issues raised. the court entertains a case when it takes a matter up for consideration. the process of consideration could continue till the pronouncement of judgment as argued by khambata. once an arbitral tribunal is constituted the court cannot take up an application under section 9 for consideration, unless the remedy under section 17 is inefficacious. however, once an application is entertained in the sense it is taken up for consideration, and the court has applied its mind to the court can certainly proceed to adjudicate the application. 94. mr. sibal rightly submitted that the intent behind section 9(3) was not to turn back the clock and require a matter already reserved for orders to be considered in entirety by the arbitral tribunal under section 17 of the arbitration act. 95. on a combined reading of section 9 with section 17 of the arbitration act, once an arbitral tribunal is constituted, the court would not entertain and/or in other words take up for consideration and apply its mind to an application for interim measure, unless the remedy under section 17 is inefficacious, even though the application may have been filed before the constitution of the arbitral tribunal. the bar of section 9(3) would not operate, once an application has been entertained and taken up for consideration, as in the instant case, where hearing has been concluded and judgment has been reserved. mr. khambata may be right, that the process of consideration continues till the pronouncement of judgment. however, that would make no difference. the question is whether the process of consideration has commenced, and/or whether the court has applied its mind to some extent before the constitution of the arbitral tribunal. if so, the application can be said to have been entertained before constitution of the arbitral tribunal.\" 13. it would be seem that hon'ble supreme court referred to the judgment in kundan lal's case, a division bench judgment of this court, wherein it has been laid down that the question as to the consideration of the grounds, upon which the application is based can only arise when it is being considered by the court on the merits, i.e., when the court is called upon to apply its mind to the grounds urged in the application. further it has been categorically laid down that once an arbitral tribunal is constituted, the court cannot take up an application under section 9 for consideration, unless the remedy under section 17 is inefficacious. 14. merely because in the present application seeking dismissal of the proceedings under section 9 of the act and two amendment applications were dealt with by the tribunal and order was passed on 15.11.2023, a day before the tribunal was constituted, for leading evidence, it cannot be said that the court had considered the case on merits, as the consideration on merits would necessarily mean for the purpose of grant of injunction and not for the purpose of deciding the applications filed during the pendency of the application. 15. in view of the above facts situation, it is apparent that once the tribunal was constituted on 16.11.2023, passing of the order on 18.01.2024 by the commercial court was in the teeth of the provisions of section 9(3) of the act. 16. so far as the submissions made by counsel for the respondent on the merit of the dispute is concerned, the said aspect cannot be considered in the present appeal arising from the order passed by commercial court, which has been found to be in violation of provisions of section 9(3) of the act. 17. in view of the above discussion, the appeal filed by the appellant is allowed. the order dated 18.01.2024 is quashed and set aside. the application filed by the respondent under section 9 of the act is dismissed in view of the provisions of section 9(3) of the act. the respondent would be free to approach the arbitral tribunal under the provisions of section 17 of the act. order date :29.4.2024 p.sri.
