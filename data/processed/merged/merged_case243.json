S.Shanthi, reported in 2021 (6) CTC 1, another Division Bench of this Court had referred the following questions for determination by the Full Bench:\n(i) Whether an order passed by this Court, on its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, exercising powers under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent for High Court of Madras, granting leave to any applicant to institute suit within the jurisdiction of this Court, can be said to be an order passed under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015? and further (ii) Whether an order passed by this Court refusing to revoke leave granted to any applicant as referred in (i) above, can be said to be an order passed under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015?\n2. The facts which are necessary for disposal of this reference are https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 as follows:\nThe first respondent in all these Appeals instituted a suit against the appellants, four in number, seeking a money decree for Rs.12,39,749.55 US Dollars at the exchange rate on the date of the judgment payable towards the 17 unpaid Bills, to pay interest of Rs.18,46,665.39 calculated at 12% per annum on the said bills and to pay interest at 12% per annum on 12,39,749.55 US Dollars from the date of plaint till date of realisation.\n2.1 The said suit was filed during June 2018 along with an application seeking leave to file the suit in this Court under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent. Leave was granted by this Court on 02.07.2018. \nUpon service, the defendants in the suit/the appellants herein filed independent Applications in Application Nos.10178 of 2018, 726 of 2019, 8040 and 8043 of 2018 seeking revocation of the leave on various grounds. The Commercial Division which heard the Revocation Applications, dismissed the Applications by a common order dated 11.11.2019. Aggrieved, the defendants 1 to 4 filed independent Appeals in OSA Nos.26 to 29 of 2020. \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 2.2. The Appeals came up for hearing before the Commercial Appellate Division of this Court where a doubt was raised regarding the jurisdiction of the Commercial Appellate Division to hear these Appeals. Since the Commercial Appellate Division, prima facie felt that the Appeals may have to go before the Court having the roaster, since it did not consider it to be a Commercial Court matter at present, a direction was issued on 25.11.2021 directing the Appeals to be listed before the Bench having the roaster for hearing Appeals against orders on the original side of this Court. Pursuant to the said direction, the Appeals were listed before the Bench which had made the reference as aforesaid. \n2.3. We have heard Mr.N.Vijayaraghavan and Mr.Sharath Chandran, learned counsel appearing for M/s.N.P.Vijaya Kumar, for the appellant in OSA Nos.26 and 27 of 2020, Mr.Arun Karthik Mohan, learned counsel appearing for the appellant in OSA Nos.28 and 29 of 2020 and Mr.K.Sukumaran, learned counsel appearing for M/s.M.R.Gogulkrishnan and Mr.S.Patrick, for the first respondent in all https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 the Appeals. \n2.4. Mr.N.Vijayaraghavan, Mr.Sharath Chandran and Mr. Arun Karthik Mohan, learned counsel appearing for the appellants would vehemently contend that at the stage of granting leave, the Judge sitting on the Original Side of this Court does not exercise powers under the Commercial Courts Act and therefore, the orders passed refusing to revoke the leave cannot be termed as once passed by the Commercial Division in exercise of the powers under the Commercial Courts Act. According to them in order to enable the respondent to contend that the Appeals are barred in view of the proviso to Section 13 read with Subsection 2 of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act it should be shown that the order granting leave and the order refusing to revoke it should be shown to have been passed in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on the Commercial Division under Section 7 ot the Commecial Courts Act 2015. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants would contend that the decision in Hindustan Unilever Limited Ponds House v. S.Shanthi, requires a reconsideration on more than one ground. They https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 would submit that the Division Bench in Hindustan Unilever Limited Ponds House v. S.Shanthi, did not consider the question as to whether an order either granting leave under Clause 12 or refusing to revoke the leave granted could be said to be an order passed in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred under the Commercial Courts Act. \n2.5. The learned counsel would further attempt to make a distinction based on the stage of the suit and according to them, a suit could become a commercial suit only upon its numbering and the cognizance of it is taken by the Commercial Court and not before that. According to them, the solitary issue that needs to be considered relates to grant of leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent and not the other issues which were dealt with and decided by the Division Bench in Hindustan Unilever Limited Ponds House v. S.Shanthi. A distinction is sought to be made by the learned counsel to the effect that an application under Clause 12 is not a suit. It being an application anterior to the suit there is no suit registered as a commercial cause before the Commercial Division when the application for grant of leave is taken up https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 by the Court. It is also their contention that the application for leave is heard by the Judge on the Original Side and not by the Commercial Division under the Commercial Courts Act. Relying upon the language of Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act, the learned counsel would contend that the Commercial Division would come into play only in a suit and not at any prior stage. \n2.6. Arguing further, the learned counsel would submit that till such time the issue relating to grant of leave is finally decided the proceedings are only on the Original Side of this Court and not before the Commercial Division. Therefore, according to the learned counsel, an order refusing to revoke the leave granted being a judgment under Clause 12 is appealable under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent dehors the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. It is also contended that since it is the Judge of this Court who is sitting as a Commercial Division exercising jurisdiction under the Commercial Courts Act irrespective of the order being passed by the Judge sitting in the Commercial Division or the Judge sitting in the Original Side of this Court, if the order is not one https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 passed in exercise of the jurisdiction under the Commercial Courts Act, the bar or prohibition contained under Section 13 would not be attracted.\n2.7. Taking shelter under the language of Clause 12 of the Letters Patent, the appellants would contend that it is a special power vested in the Chartered High Courts by virtue of the Letters Patent and therefore, the exercise of such power cannot be deemed to be one under a particular enactment. If the power is not exercised under the particular enactment the prohibition contained in the said enactment would not stand attracted. In essence, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants is that there are two stages in hearing of a commercial dispute, one before numbering and the other after numbering. A suit does not part take the character of a commercial suit before it is numbered and any order passed at a stage anterior to numbering cannot be said to be one passed in exercise of the jurisdiction under the Commercial Courts Act by the Commercial Division and therefore, such orders are appealable under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent dehors the prohibition or the bar contained in Section 13 of the Act. \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 3. Contending contra Mr.K.Sukumaran, learned counsel appearing for the first respondent in all the Appeals would submit that the stage at which the order is passed does not really matter. It is the subject matter of the suit that has to be looked into. If it is found that the subject matter of the suit could be termed as a commercial dispute within any one of the Sub Clauses (i) to (xxi) of Sub Section (c) of Section 2 of the Commercial Courts Act, then the same would qualify as a commercial dispute which is to be dealt with by the Commercial Division. \n3.1. Terming the distinction that is sought to be made by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant as non-existent, Mr.K.Sukumaran, learned counsel appearing for the first respondent would submit that the provisions of the enactment must be interpreted in such a manner that they would further the objects of the enactment and not otherwise. Drawing us to the objects and reasons of the Commercial Courts Act, Mr.K.Sukumaran, would submit that the very object being one to fast track the litigation by curtailing unnecessary appeals at the interlocutory stages, the provisions of the Act must be read in such a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 manner to further the said intention, viz. quick disposal. He would also point out that the reference order attempts to make an artificial distinction on the basis of the stage at which the order is passed overlooking the fact that the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act do not lend support to such distinction being made. The learned counsel on either side would rely upon various judgments in support of their submissions. \n4. Before adverting to the submissions of the counsel in detail, it will be useful to extract the relevant statutory provisions. Clause 12 of the Letters Patent reads as follows:\n12. Original Jurisdiction as to Suits: - And we do further ordain that the said High Court of Judicature at Madras, in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, shall be empowered to receive, try, and determine suits of every description if, in the case of suits for land or other immovable property, such land or property shall be situated, or, in all other cases, if the cause of action shall have arisen, either wholly, or, in case https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 the leave of the Court shall have been first obtained, in part, within the local limits of the ordinary original jurisdiction of the said High Court: or if the defendant at the time of the commencement of the suit shall dwell or carry on business or personally work for gain, within such limits; except that the said High Court shall not have such original jurisdiction in cases falling within the jurisdiction of the Small Cause Court at Madras, in which the debt or damage, or value of the property sued for does not exceed one hundred rupees. Clause 15 of the Letters Patent reads as follows:\n15. Appeal from the Courts of Original Jurisdiction to the High Courts in its appellate jurisdiction: - And we do further ordain that an appeal shall lie to the said High Court of Judicature at Madras from the judgment] (not being a judgment passed in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 Court subject to the superintendence of the said High Court, and not being an order made in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction, and not being a sentence or order passed or made in the exercise of the power of superintendence under the provisions of Section 107 of the Government of India Act, or in the exercise of criminal jurisdiction of one Judge of the said High Court or one Judge of any Division Court, pursuant to Section 108 of the Government of India Act, and that notwithstanding anything herein before provided an appeal shall lie to the said High Court from a judgment of one Judge of the said High Court or one Judge of any Division Court, pursuant to Section 108 of the Government of India Act made (on or after the 1st day of February 1929) in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a Court subject to the superintendence of the said High Court, where the Judge who passed the judgment declares that the case is a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 fit one for appeal; but that the right of appeal from other judgments of Judges of the said High Court or of such Division Court shall be to Us, Our Heirs or Successors in Our or Their Privy Council as hereinafter provided. 4.1. It will be useful to advert to the recommendations of the law commission of India contained in 188 th Report dated 15th December 2003 which led to the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act :\n1.Purpose to expedite commercial cases of high pecuniary value The purpose of the proposals in this report is to expedite commercial cases of high pecuniary value and create confidence in the commercial circles, within India and outside, that our Courts are quite fast, if not faster than Courts elsewhere. \nThe last decade has brought about phenomenal changes leading to enormous growth in the commerce and industrial sector of India. The policies of the Government have changed radically from 1991, the year in which our economy was opened up to foreign investment in a big way. Privatisation, liberalization https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 and globalisation have resulted in giving a big boost to our economy. At the same time, world has become very much competitive. \nWith such rapid increase in commerce and trade, commercial disputes involving high stakes are likely to increase. Unless, there is new and effective mechanism for resolving them speedily and efficiently, progress will be retarded. \nThe overall benefits that may accrue to the economy of the country as a whole by the establishment of the Commercial Division will, in our opinion, be in several hundreds of crores of Rupees. In view of the present era of globalisation and liberalization, investment in India, both domestic and foreign is bound to increase tremendously once the investors of the world know with certainity and assurance that the Commercial Division in the High Courts in India will dispose of the matters within a maximum period of two years which is comparable to the period of pendency in USA or UK. The expense involved in establishment of the Commercial Division will, in our view, be a small fraction of the overall benefits that will accrue to the economy of the country. Investors will make freely investment in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 business ventures without fear of blocking their substantial business capital in undue prolonged litigation in courts. The proposed changes are likely to render the overall market friendly change in investment in business scenario. \n2.Method of expeditious disposal of Commercial cases of high pecuniary value in NUTSHELL: \nWe recommend the creation of Commercial Division in each of our High Courts so that these may handle 'commercial cases' of a high threshold value of (say) Rs. 1 crore and above, or such higher limit as may be fixed by the High Court and on fast- track basis. Such a procedure was recommended in our Report on Amendments to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for 'fast-track' arbitration. The objective is that a commercial case of such high value should be disposed of within a period of one year or at the most two years in all the States in India. A maximum period of two years is perfectly justified and is comparable to the period of pendency in most courts abroad and in particular in US and UK. The proposed Divisions should be manned by Judges of the High Court who are well- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 versed in civil law and in particular, commercial laws. It is also proposed that High Court Judge should be given extensive exposure to the fast growing changes in commerce occurring globally and that their knowledge levels in respect of new branches of commercial law should be updated constantly by a programme of continuing lectures. The commercial cases above the pecuniary limit of (say) Rs. 1 crore or more as stated above must, in our view, be taken up on the original side of the High Court and to be allocated to the Commercial Division. Simultaneously, pending appeals before the High Court in relation to commercial cases of the high pecuniary value abovementioned must also to be allocated to the Commercial Division straightway rather than stand in queue along with other civil appeals pending in the High Courts. Likewise, the execution of decrees passed by the Commercial Division must also be undertaken by the same Division. \nThe Statement of objects and reasons of the Commercial Courts Act is as follows:\nStatement of Objects and Reasons https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 The proposal to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes has been under consideration of the Government for quite some time. The high value commercial disputes involve complex facts and question of law. Therefore, there is a need to provide for an independent mechanism for their early resolution. Early resolution of commercial disputes shall create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive Indian legal system. \n2. The Law Commission of India in its 188th Report had recommended the constitution of the Commercial Division in each High Court. Accordingly, the Commercial Division of High Courts Bill, 2009 was introduced and passed by the Lok Sabha. However, during the discussion of the aforesaid Bill in the Rajya Sabha, some Members raised certain issues and in view thereof, the matter was again referred to the Law Commission of India for its examination. \nThe Law Commission of India, in its 253rd Report, has recommended for the establishment of the Commercial Courts, the Commercial Division and the Commercial Appellate Divisions in the High Courts for disposal of commercial disputes of specified value. \n3. Based on the recommendations of the Law Commission made in its 253rd Report, a Bill namely, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 24th April, 2015 and the same is at present under the consideration of the Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice. As provided in the said Bill, 2015, all the Suits, Appeals or Applications related to commercial disputes of specified value i.e. one crore or above, are to be dealt with by the Commercial Courts or the Commercial Division of the High Court 4. By way of the Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act, 2015, the ordinary original jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court has been increased from rupees twenty lakhs to rupees two crore and there is a provision for transfer of pending case from the Delhi High Court to District Courts. On the enactment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015, some of the Commercial Disputes which are to be transferred to the District Courts from the Delhi High Court may again be required to be transferred to the Commercial Division of the High Court of Delhi. It would cause delay in the disposal of cases as well as inconvenience to the parties and counsels and may also result in confusion. Therefore, it became necessary that the provisions of the Delhi High Court https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 (Amendment) Act, 2015 and establishment of the Commercial Courts and Commercial Division of the High Courts may be brought into force simultaneously. \n5. As Parliament was not in session and urgent steps were needed to be taken, the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division in High Courts Ordinance, 2015 was promulgated on 23rd October, 2015. \n6. It is proposed to introduced the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015 to replace the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Ordinance, 2015 which, inter alia, provides for the following namely:\n(i) constitution of the Commercial Courts at District level except for the territory over which any High Court is having Ordinary Original Civil jurisdiction;\n(ii) constitution of the Commercial Divisions in those High Courts which are already exercising ordinary civil jurisdiction and they shall have territorial jurisdiction over such areas on which it has Original jurisdiction;\n(iii) constitution of the Commercial Appellate Division in all the High Courts to hear the appeals against the Orders of the Commercial Courts and the Orders of the Commercial https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 Division of the High Court;\n(iv) the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of such Commercial Courts and Commercial Division is proposed as one crore rupees; and (v) to amend the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as applicable to the Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions which shall prevail over the existing High Courts Rules and other provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. \n7.The proposed Bill shall accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the Indian Justice delivery system, and the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation.\n8. The Bill seeks to replace the aforesaid Ordinance. 4.2. The relevant provisions of the Commercial Courts Act 2015 are as follows:\nSection 2(c) of the commercial Courts Act enlists various disputes which would be classified as commercial disputes. While Section 3 provides for constitution of Commercial Courts, Section 3(A) provides for constitution of Commercial Appellate Courts. Insofar as High Courts https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 which are having ordinary Original Civil jurisdiction, Section 4 provides for constitution of Commercial Division of High Court, the said Section reads as follows:\n4. Constitution of Commercial Division of High Court.  (1) In all High Courts, having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the Chief Justice of the High Court may, by order, constitute Commercial Division having one or more Benches consisting of a single Judge for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under this Act.\n(2) The Chief Justice of the High Court shall nominate such Judges of the High Court who have experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be Judges of the Commercial Division. Section 7 sets out the jurisdiction of the Commercial Division of High Courts and it reads as follows:\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 7. Jurisdiction of Commercial Divisions of High Courts. All suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a Specified Value filed in a High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of that High Court:\nProvided that all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes, stipulated by an Act to lie in a court not inferior to a District Court, and filed or pending on the original side of the High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court: Provided further that all suits and applications transferred to the High Court by virtue of sub-section (4) of section 22 of the Designs Act, 2000 (16 of 2000) or section 104 of the Patents Act, 1970 (39 of 1970) shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court in all the areas over which the High Court exercises ordinary original civil jurisdiction. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 Section 13 provides for Appeals against the decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions, it reads as follows:\n13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions. (1) Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court below the level of a District Judge may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order. \n(1A) Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order:\nProvided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 this Act and section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996). ] (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act. The other provisions of the Act may not be very relevant for our purposes. \n5. At the outset, it must be borne in mind that Commercial Courts Act is an enactment which aims at speedy disposal and the legislature, with the said object in mind, had tinkered with certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure to enable fast tracking of commercial litigations by curtailing Appeals at the interlocutory stages and by providing mandatory time lines for performance of certain acts. The failure to adhere to the time lines would lead to orders being passed against the party who fails to adhere to such time lines. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in various decisions has held that the time lines prescribed under the Act https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 are mandatory and they have to be strictly adhered to. None of the parties seriously dispute the above said position of law. \n6. We have extracted the relevant provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. Section 4 deal with Constitution of Commercial Division of High Courts and such constitution is for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under the Act. Section 7 which deals with jurisdiction of Commercial Divisions of High Courts confers the jurisdiction to hear and dispose of all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value filed in the High court. Section 13 provides for Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions. Section 13(1A) permits an Appeal by a person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Division of the High Court to appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court. Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 13 confines Appeals against the orders that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 7 . Subsection 2 of Section 13 which contains a non-obstante clause provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Letters Patent of the High Court, no Appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act. As could be seen from the provisions a conscious attempt has been made by the parliament to prohibit Appeals and Civil Revisions from orders of the Commercial Division and the Commercial Courts at the interlocutory stages. Section 8 of the Act bars a Revision Application against an interlocutory order; Section 13 bars Appeals otherwise than in accordance with the Act; Section12(3) bars an Appeal or Revision under Section 115 of the Code against an order determining the jurisdiction made by the Commercial Court. Care has been taken by the parliament to prevent Appeals and to make some of the judgments which made Appeals against certain interlocutory orders possible inoperative. \n8. In Shah Babulal Khimji v . Jayaben D. Kania and another, reported in 1981 (4) SCC 8, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that Order https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 XLIII Rule (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure does not override or control Clause 15 of the Letters Patent, thereby enabling Appeals against orders which are not specifically made appealable under Order XLIII Rule (1) invoking Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. The effect of this judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is sought to be nullified by Subsection 2 of Section 13 by inserting a non-obstante clause and thereby making Clause 15 of the Letters Patent unavailable to commercial disputes. \n9. In P.S.Sathappan(dead)by LRs. v. Andhra Bank Ltd and others, reported in 2004(11) SCC 672, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that despite the bar under Section 104 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, Clause 15 could be invoked for Appeals against the judgments of Single Judges of the High Court made in the exercise of original jurisdiction. The effect of this judgment is also sought to be nullified by Section 13(2) of the Commercial Courts Act. \n10. In Iridium India Telecom Ltd v. Motorola Inc, reported in 2005 (2) SCC 145, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had held that the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 provisions of Rule 1 of Order VIII would be subject to the Rules framed under the Letters Patent which are protected under Section 129 of the Code of Civil Procedure, thereby concluding that the longer period of limitation of six weeks provided under the Original Side Rules framed under Section 129 of the Code of Civil Procedure would apply to suits in the original side of the High Court. The effect of this judgment is sought to be undone by Subsection 3 of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act. Subsection 3 of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act provides that any Rule of the jurisdictional High Court which is in conflict that the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, will not prevail over the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by the Commercial Courts Act. Rule 1 of Order VIII has been amended by the Commercial Courts Act by providing an unalterable fixed period of limitation for filing a written statement and Sub-section 3 of Section 16 makes Rule 1 of Order VIII as amended by the Commercial Courts Act to override the Rules framed by the High Court on its Original Side. \n11. To sum up the Parliament has taken care to undo the effect of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 at least three judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court by introducing the non-obstante clause in Subsection 2 of Section 13 and by Subsection 3 of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act. We are pointing out the above feature only with the view to high light the importance that has been given, for speedy disposal of commercial litigation, by the Parliament.\n12. Adverting to the contentions of the learned counsel for the appellants that a suit does not become a commercial cause unless it is numbered and any order passed prior to the stage of numbering would not be an order passed by the Commercial Division in exercise of the powers conferred under the Act, we have to necessarily express our disinclination to accept the said argument. The reasons are not far to seek. We have extracted the provisions of the Act. Section 4 provides for constitution of a Commercial Division in the High Court for the purposes of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under the Act. \n13. Section 7 prescribes the jurisdiction of the Commercial Divisions of High Courts. The main Section provides that All suits and applications relating to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 commercial disputes of a specified value filed in a High Court having ordinary civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court. \nSection 7 does not seek to make a distinction between applications anterior to or posterior to numbering of the suit. Of course the learned counsel appearing for the appellants would contend that a suit could be said to be instituted only on presentation of the plaint and not otherwise. Accordin to them since Clause 12 enables an application for leave to institute a suit could be accompanied by a copy of the plaint and therefore, there is no institution of a suit upon presentation of an application for leave to file the suit. \n14. Our attention in this regard is drawn to Clause 16 of Rule 4 of Order I of the Original Side Rules, which defines the suit as all proceedings commenced by the filing of a plaint. Rule I of Order III of the Original side Rules which deals with an application for leave to institute https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 the suit enables a party to file an application accompanied by the plaint in the intended suit or a copy thereof. We do not think such a fine distinction could be made inasmuch as the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act are wide enough to cover even stages prior to the numbering of the suit. As we had already pointed out Section 7 confers the jurisdiction to hear and dispose of all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes to the Commercial Division of the High Court. If we are to accept the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants then we will be importing the words in such suits between the words applications and relating occurring in Section 7, so as to read it as all suits and applications in such suits relating to Commercial disputes. \n15. We cannot add to a legislative provision in order to restrict the jurisdiction that is conferred on a Court by the legislature. We are therefore unable to accept the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that an application anterior to the numbering of the suit cannot be heard by a Commercial Division and it should be deemed that it is heard and disposed of by the High Court on its original side. No doubt a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 certain criticism is made by the learned counsel appearing for the appellants on certain conclusions reached by the Division Bench in Hindustan Unilever Limited Ponds House v. S.Shanthi, wherein the Division Bench at paragraph 60 while dealing with maintainability of OSA CAD Nos.24, 25, 26 and 27 of 2021, which are Appeals filed against orders directing return of plaints under Order VII Rule 10, an Appeal would lie under Order XLIII Rule 1(A) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The complaint of the counsel for the appellants is that the Division Bench has overlooked the fact that in view of Order XLIX Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Order VII Rule 10 would not apply to the original side of a Chartered High Court. They would also point out that the Division Bench had at paragraph 107 relying upon R.P.O. Connor v. P.G.Sampath Kumar, reported in AIR 1953 Mad 897, held that the return can be made under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. \n16. It is the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that if it is an order of return under Section 151 of the Code of Civil https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 Procedure which is not specifically made appealable under Rule 1 of Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, the conclusion of the Division Bench regarding maintainability of those Appeals is incorrect. May be there is some substance in the submission of the learned counsel but we do not propose to go into the same as that question does not fall within the scope of reference made to us. \n17. Mr.K.Sukumaran, learned counsel appearing for the first respondent would invite our attention to the judgment of the Honble Supreme Court in Owners and Parties Interested in the Vessel M.V.Polaris Galaxy v. Banque Cantonale De Geneve reported in 2022 SCC Online SC 1293, to contend that the Honble Supreme Court had gone into the object of the Act and held that the object of the Commercial Courts Act, vis-a-vis the Admiralty Act and concluded that the Commercial Courts Act would prevail over the Admiralty Act. In doing so, the Honble Supreme Court refused invoke the doctrine generalia specialibus non derogant, and concluded as follows:\n81. If such an order under the Code of Civil Procedure https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 which does not fall under Order XLIII of CPC is held to be appealable, then the entire purpose of the Commercial Courts Act would be defeated, and every single order passed in a course of a trial of an admiralty suit would be appealable under section 14 of the Act. Such orders would be large in number including orders in relation to discovery, inspection, case management hearing, admissibility of evidence, framing of issues, interrogatories, etc. This would make a mockery of the intended purpose of Parliament in enacting the Commercial Courts Act, which is to expedite trials in commercial suits of a specified value, and restrict the number of interlocutory appeals. \n18. In deciding the above question, the Honble Supreme Court also pointed out that Section 14 of the Admiralty Act which provides for an Appeal from any judgment, decree, final order or interim order of a single Judge of the High Court under the Admiralty Act to the Division https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 Bench of the High Court should be read harmoniously with Order XLIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in view of Section 12 of the Admiralty Act read with Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act.\n19. The Honble Supreme Court has also gone into the legislative intent and concluded that the Courts while interpreting the provisions of a legislation particularly a legislation which seeks to achieve speedy disposal should give effect to the intendment of the legislature and shall not aid a litigant to delay trial by filing Appeal even from inconsequential orders. We respectfully follow what the Honble Supreme Court has pointed out in the above judgment to conclude that an Appeal against an order which is not made specifically appealable under Order XLIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, cannot be maintained and the distinction that is sought to be made with reference to the stage at which the order is passed is an artificial distinction not contemplated by the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. \n20. As we have already pointed out the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act do not aid the interpretation that is sought to be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 placed by the counsel for the appellants. In interpreting a statute particularly a statute like Commercial Courts Act, we have to necessarily go by the language employed by it and we cannot supplant or add to the provisions of the Act, so as to enlarge the scope of the provision. As we had already pointed out Section 7 which invests the jurisdiction to hear and dispose of commercial disputes in the Commercial Division of the High Court does not make a difference between pre-institution and post institution applications. Once we reject the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants which attempts to make out an artificial line of distinction, the necessary conclusion would be that both the questions referred have to be answered in the negative. An Application for grant of leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent will definitely fall within the jurisdiction of a Commercial Division in terms of Section 7 of the said Act and it cannot be said to be an order passed outside the Commercial Courts Act 2015. \n21. We answer the questions referred as follows:\n(i) An order passed by this Court in its Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction exercising powers under https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 Clause 12 of the Letters Patent for the High Court of Madras granting leave to any applicant to institute a suit within the jurisdiction of this Court will be an order passed under the Commercial Courts Act 2015 in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on the Commercial Division under Section 7 of the said Act. \n(ii) An order passed by this Court refusing to revoke leave granted to any applicant as referred in (i) above will also be an order passed under the Commercial Courts Act 2015.\n22. In the normal course, we should direct the appeals to be posted before the concerned Division Bench for disposal after answering the reference. We do not deem it necessary to do so since the reference itself is in relation to the maintainability of the Appeals which has retained us for nearly three years now, we do not propose to further delay the matter by directing the Appeals to be listed before the appropriate Division Bench. In view of our answers to the questions referred to us, the Appeals will stand dismissed as not maintainable. There shall be no https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis OSA.Nos.26 to 29 of 2020 order as to costs. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed. \n                                        (R.S.M., J.)      (T.K.R., J.)

[2.1] feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned passed below exh.39 by the learned commercial court in commercial civil suit no.91/2017 by which the learned commercial court has rejected the said application preferred by the original defendant no.1 which was submitted under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996, the original defendant no.1 has preferred the first appeal no.587/2018. [3.0] for the sake of convenience the facts in first appeal no.588/2018 are narrated and first appeal no.588/2018 be treated and considered as a lead matter. [3.1] that the appellant herein original defendant no.1 (hereinafter referred to as \"original defendant no.1\") and the respondent no.1 herein original plaintiff (hereinafter referred to as \"original plaintiff\") entered into the license agreement on 07.04.2005 whereby the original defendant no.1 as a licensor permitted the original plaintiff as a licensee to operate two manufacturing units of the defendant no.1 being a.c. sheet and cement grinding, for consideration on terms specified therein. the duration of the said agreement was specified as 84 months (7 years). [3.2] that another license agreement of the same nature was executed c/fa/588/2018 judgment by and between the original defendant no.1 and a sister concern of the original plaintiff named apurva vinmay pvt. ltd. (subject matter of first appeal no.587/2018) on the same date i.e. 07.04.2005 under which the original defendant no.1 licensor permitted the said sister concern of the original plaintiff and licensee to operate another manufacturing unit of the original defendant no.1 being a.c. pressure pipe, for consideration and on terms specified therein. the duration of the said agreement was also specified as 84 months (7 years). [3.3] that supplementary agreement was executed in respect of the aforesaid license agreements also on the same date i.e. 07.04.2005. that the said supplementary agreement was between the original plaintiff, original defendant no.1 and the aforesaid sister concern of the original plaintiff plaintiff of commercial civil suit no.91/2018. it appears that the purpose of the said supplementary agreement was to facilitate financial assistance to the original defendant no.1 by the original plaintiff on enable the original defendant no.1 to discharge his liabilities towards its creditors. that in the supplementary agreement which as such during the occurrence of the aforesaid sister concern as confirming party thereto, that as consideration for rendering financial assistance to the original defendant no.1 it would be permissible for the original plaintiff to create mortgage in its favour in respect of aforesaid three manufacturing units of the original defendant no.1. [3.4] that thereafter an amendment agreement was executed by and between the original plaintiff and the original defendant no.1 for amendment of clauses 11 and 15 of the license agreement for re­ purchase of the assets and for provision of bonus, vide amendment agreement dated 25.06.2015. [3.5] that thereafter a tripartite agreement was executed by and c/fa/588/2018 judgment between the original plaintiff, original defendant no.1 and the bank of baroda dated 06.07.2006. under the aforesaid tripartite agreement the original defendant no.1 agreed for the creation of first charge of the bank of baroda on its specified assets for securing repayment of the corporate loan of rs.500 lakh provided to the original plaintiff by the bank of baroda. the said agreement also provided that the bank of baroda would release its first charge only with the consent of the plaintiff unless the repayment of the loan was made directly by the original defendant no.1. that thereafter an amendment was introduced to the aforesaid tripartite agreement on 23.01.2018 for incorporating therein a condition that the title deeds of the land of the original defendant no.1 would not be transferred to anybody by the original defendant no.1 during the currency of the aforesaid license agreement. [3.6] it appears that thereafter the original plaintiff call upon the original defendant no.1 to extend the tenure of the aforesaid license agreement on 22.02.2012, to extend the tenure of the aforesaid license agreement further by 84 months. it appears that the original defendant no.1 replied to the aforesaid denying the claim of the plaintiff as also the proposal for extension of license agreement vide reply dated 29.02.2012. it appears that instead of handing over the possession of the aforesaid manufacturing units on completion of tenure of the license agreement, the plaintiff declared his intention to continue with the possession of the same by addressing in this regard to the employees of the original defendant no.1. it is the case on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that thereafter attempts were made to resolve the dispute arising out of the said agreement between april 2012 to march 2015, but nothing materialized. [3.7] that thereafter the original defendant no.1 issued notice to the c/fa/588/2018 judgment plaintiff claiming recovery of the possession of the licensed manufacturing units as also the amount which according to the original defendant no.1 was due from the plaintiff as per the license agreement, vide notice dated 07.01.2015. that the original plaintiff replied to the aforesaid notice, vide reply dated 20.04.2015 disputing the claim of the original defendant no.1 for possession and the amount. it appears that again attempts were made for resolving the dispute between 26.08.2015 to 17.11.2016 for resolving the dispute, however there was no positive outcome. therefore, the original defendant no.1 caused to serve upon the original plaintiff a notice under section 21 of the arbitration act, 1996 invoking the provisions for arbitration contained in the license agreement. that vide communication dated 27.03.2017 the original plaintiff replied to the aforesaid notice stating that the dispute raised is not arbitrable. [3.8] that the original defendant no.1 preferred composite arbitration petition being iaap no.63/2017 against the original plaintiff as well as the aforesaid sister concern of the plaintiff, before this court. that the said iaap was preferred on 26.04.2017. [3.9] it appears that on 27.04.2017, the original plaintiff preferred the commercial civil suit no.90/2017 against the original defendant no.1 and others seeking mainly the following reliefs. (1) decree against the original defendant no.1 for rs.32.66 crore alongwith the interest thereon as due from the original defendant no.1 under the license agreement; (2) injunction restraining the original defendant no.1 from disturbing the possession of the original plaintiff in respect of the licensed manufacturing units as original plaintiff was stated to be entitled to continue with the possession pursuant to the license agreement; c/fa/588/2018 judgment (3) declaration that the conveyance deeds executed by the original defendant no.1 in favour of third parties (joined as defendants) in respect of the parcels of land on which the licensed manufacturing units was located in the suit as void as the same were de hors the license agreement; (4) direction upon bank of baroda for non­release of title deeds of the concerned land in favour of private respondents to whom the land was transferred by sale by the original defendant no.1. that the original defendant no.1 preferred an application under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996 in the aforesaid suits, for reference of dispute forming the subject matter of the suit to arbitration. that the original defendant no.1 filed the written statement in the suit in which an objection was also raised to the jurisdiction of the commercial court in view of the arbitration clause contained in the license agreement. the original plaintiff also filed the reply to the application of the original defendant no.1 under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996. the original defendant no.1 filed the affidavit in rejoinder to the aforesaid reply on 03.07.2017. it appears that as iaap no.63/2017 was a composite petition against both, plaintiff of commercial civil suit no.90/2017 as well as its sister concern, therefore, the original defendant no.1 withdrew the aforesaid composite petition being iaap no.63/2017 with a liberty to file fresh separate petitions. [3.10] it appears that thereafter the original defendant no.1 preferred two separate iaaps under section 11 of the arbitration act, 1996 being iaap no.90/2017 as well as iaap no.89/2017 against the original plaintiff and its sister concern on 13.07.2017. c/fa/588/2018 judgment that the original defendant no.2 bank of baroda submitted written submissions on 06.12.2017 in response to the application under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996. it appears that on the very day i.e. on 06.12.2017, the original defendant no.1 submitted the purshis stating that though the original defendant no.2 bank of baroda is paid its dues by the original plaintiff, the original defendant no.1 was prepared to deposit the additional 500 lakh in the court subject to the outcome of the arbitration and title deeds of the land be deposited with the hon'ble court and the same to be given to the original defendant no.1 subject to outcome of the arbitration. that thereafter the learned commercial court has passed the impugned order rejecting the application under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996, which is the subject matter of present first appeal no.588/2018. a similar order has been passed in commercial civil suit no.91/2017, which was preferred by the sister concern which is the subject matter of first appeal no.587/2018. [3.11] that thereafter vide order dated 15.12.2017 and considering the order passed by the learned commercial court rejecting section 8 application, this court rejected the aforesaid iaaps, however with a liberty to file fresh applications after the outcome of the present appeals and regardless of the outcome thereof. [3.12] thus, the impugned orders passed by the learned commercial court rejecting section 8 applications preferred by the original defendant no.1 are the subject matter of present first c/fa/588/2018 judgment appeals. [4.0] shri d.c. dave, learned senior advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant of first appeal no.588/2018, shri premal nanavati, learned advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant of first appeal no.587/2018 and shri shalin mehta, learned senior advocate has appeared on behalf of the respondent no.1 in both the first appeals. first appeal no.588/2018 [5.0] shri d.c. dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, learned commercial court has materially erred in rejecting section 8 application application and not referring the matter / parties to the arbitration, despite the specific arbitration clause contained in the license agreement. [5.1] it is specifically submitted by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that as such it is the settled proposition of law that the provision of section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996 is obligatory in nature whereby once it is admitted that there is an arbitration clause in the agreement, then in view of mandatory language of section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996, the civil court is bound to refer the disputes to the arbitrator. [5.2] it is further submitted by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that looking to c/fa/588/2018 judgment the contents of the plaint as a whole and even the reliefs sought in the suit, it is crystal clear that the grievances of the plaintiff emanates from the contractual obligations contained in the license agreement executed between the plaintiff and the original defendant no.1. [5.3] it is further submitted that as such the original plaintiff has not provided any break­up or details of the heads of claims under which the plaintiff has sought the recovery of sum of rs.32.66 crore in the entire plaint. it is submitted that therefore, the pleadings and averments contained in plaint are vague and ambiguous in nature. it is submitted that however during the course of hearing, it was maintained by the plaintiff that the said claim was based upon the license agreement and the accounting details of the same were placed on record vide the list of documents submitted alongwith the plaint. it is submitted that therefore so far as the prayer (a) in para 33 of the plaint is concerned, not only the amount is claimed against the original defendant no.1 but the same is claimed on the basis of the license agreement. it is submitted that therefore the relief prayed in prayer (a) of para 33 of the plaint falls within the domain of arbitration clause enshrined in clause 32 of the license agreement. [5.4] it is further submitted by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that so far as the relief in prayer (b) of para 33 of the plaint is concerned, the genesis thereof is the license agreement, because it claimed on the premise that according to the plaintiff the license agreement c/fa/588/2018 judgment continues and during continuance of the same, original defendant no.1 has no right to transfer the land upon which the licensed units were located. it is submitted that it is true that the said relief would affect third party purchasers. however, the said relief is predominantly against the original defendant no.1 as the right of the original defendant no.1 is questioned thereunder. [5.5] it is submitted that apart, third parties (original defendant nos.3 to 5), who have purchased the immovable property, have no objection if the application moved by the original defendant no.1 under section 8 is to be allowed. it is submitted that as such they expressed their willingness and consent to join the arbitration proceedings, if required as per the purshis dated 06.12.2017. it is submitted that therefore when the parties who are not parties to the arbitration agreement have no objection to the application under section 8, the plaintiff, who is admittedly a party to the arbitration agreement, cannot be permitted to object to such an application on the premise that non­parties to the arbitration agreement would be dragged to the arbitration. it is submitted that as such, when non­parties to the arbitration agreement are prepared to join arbitration, the proper course would be to invoke application of section 89 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. in support of his above submissions, shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 has relied upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of afcons infrastructure ltd. vs. cherian varkey construction co. p. ltd. reported in (2010) 8 scc 24. it is submitted that therefore even the prayer (b) of para 33 of the plaint can be c/fa/588/2018 judgment referred to arbitration. [5.6] it is further submitted by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that so far as the relief in prayer (c) of para 33 of the plaint is concerned, the same pertains to protecting the possession of the plaintiff, which the plaintiff claims as per clause 31 on the ground that the plaintiff is entitled to hold the possession till the recovery claims of the plaintiff arising out of the license agreement are satisfied. it is submitted that therefore also, the said prayer is covered within the ambit of the arbitration clause. [5.7] it is further submitted by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that so far as relief in prayer (d) of para 33 of the plaint is concerned, the same is misconceived in nature as the bank has already been paid its dues as per the tripartite agreement by the plaintiff and therefore, the dispute only survives amongst the plaintiff and original defendant no.1 regarding payment of the dues. moreover, the original defendant no.1 had also declared by way of a purshis dated 06.12.2017 before the learned commercial court that it is ready and willing to deposit a sum of rs.5 crore before the learned commercial court and therefore, no cause would survive against the bank for the plaintiff. it is submitted that therefore, prayer (d) will not hinder the relief prayed below exh.39. it is submitted that the defendant no.2 bank has not even bothered to file a written statement before the learned commercial court and has only filed written submissions against exh.39 to object the prayers under c/fa/588/2018 judgment section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996 and therefore, it is crystal clear that the plaintiff and the defendant no.2 are acting in collusion and defendant no.2 has been wrongly joined in the suit proceedings to defeat the object and intent of the arbitral clause enshrined in the license agreement. [5.8] it is further submitted by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that so far as prayer (e) of para 33 of the plaint is concerned, the third party purchasers viz. defendant nos.3 to 5 who have purchased the immovable property have expressed their willingness and consent to join the arbitration proceedings as per the purshis dated 06.12.2017. it is submitted that therefore also the said prayer can be covered under the domain of arbitral clause as the defendant nos.3 to 5 cannot be said to be parties who are objecting and who are dragged into arbitration proceedings. [5.9] it is further submitted by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that so far as prayer (f) in para 33 is concerned, the same is a result of clever drafting whereby no such powers have been enshrined upon the bank to take over the assets of the original defendant no.1 and satisfy the recovery claim of the plaintiff in any of the agreements namely license agreement, supplementary agreement and tripartite agreement. it is further submitted that such prayer is only prayed with a malicious intention to defeat the arbitral clause and title the suit as a 'mortgage suit' however the suit in the present case cannot be branded as a 'mortgage suit' inasmuch it does not seek c/fa/588/2018 judgment redemption or foreclosure of any mortgage and as such the entire pleadings averred in the plaint are for recovery claim of the plaintiff which arises purely out of the license agreement. it is submitted that suit on mortgage can be filed by either mortgagor or mortgagee. it is submitted that the plaintiff is neither of the two. it is submitted that therefore the said prayer clause in the plaint cannot hinder the prayer prayed in application at exh.39. [5.10] it is further submitted by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that infact original defendant nos.2 to 5 are as such neither necessary nor proper party to the suit and there is a clear mis­joinder of causes of action and the entire plaint is cleverly drafted only in order to scuttle the mechanism provided in the license agreement for resolution of disputes. it is therefore, submitted that mere joining the defendant nos.2 to 5 in the plaint, the plaintiff cannot object the mechanism provided under the license agreement for resolution of the disputes. in support of his above submissions, shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 has relied upon the decision of the bombay high court in the case of a.b.k. dubhash and others vs. petit towers reported in 2011 (2) mh.l.j. 57. it is submitted that in the aforesaid decision the bombay high court has held that the joining of the third party in a suit the subject matter of which is otherwise covered within the arbitrable clause, cannot be a ground to reject the application under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996. it is submitted that it is held in the aforesaid decision that the object of section 8 is laudable and mandatory and the parties to an agreement cannot c/fa/588/2018 judgment ignore an arbitral clause merely because a third party has been joined by the applicant in order to frustrate an arbitral clause. [5.11] shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 has also relied upon the decision of the andhra pradesh high court in the case of m/s. srivenkateswara constructions & ors. vs. union of india reported in 1973 scc online ap 163 in support of his above submissions. it is submitted that in the aforesaid decision the andhra pradesh high court, while dealing with section 34 of the arbitration act, 1940 which is comparable with section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996, has held that if by way of ingenious drafting, the parties which are not parties to the arbitration agreement are joined in the suit as defendants by claiming relief against them which could have been either omitted or prayed for by filing an independent suit against such parties, the courts should not permit such things to frustrate arbitration agreement. [5.12] shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 has also heavily relied upon the decision of the delhi high court in the case of wpil vs. ntpc ltd. & ors. reported in 2009 (108) drj 404. it is submitted that the delhi high court held that when non­parties to arbitration agreement are joined in the suit proceedings to defeat the arbitral clause then the judgment of the hon'ble supreme court in sukanya holdings (p) ltd. vs. jayesh h. pandya reported in (2003) 5 scc 531 cannot be an authority to reject the application under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996. c/fa/588/2018 judgment [5.13] it is further submitted by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that it is a settled position of law that issue of fraud simplicitor cannot be a ground to reject an application preferred under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996. it is submitted that even in order to plead fraud, the plaintiff is bound to aver necessary pleadings as to particulars of fraudulent act and merely by stating that a fraud has been committed upon the plaintiff, a ground of fraud is unsustainable in view of the provision contained in rule 4 of order vi of the code of civil procedure, 1908. it is submitted that in the case of a. ayyasamy vs. a. paramasivam and ors. reported in (2016) 10 scc 386, the hon'ble supreme court has held that the reference to the arbitrable proceedings cannot be refused on the ground of fraud simplicitor. it is submitted that therefore the defence of fraud contended by the plaintiff in opposition to application under section 8 preferred by the original defendant no.1 is unsustainable. [5.14] it is further submitted by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that looking to the plaint as a whole and the pleadings contained therein, it is crystal clear that the grievance of the plaintiff pertains to recovery of dues which are admittedly claimed as per the principal agreement viz. license agreement and the plaintiff wants to protect his possession in order to secure its claims. it is submitted that therefore the grievances of the plaintiff are covered within the ambit of arbitrable clause. c/fa/588/2018 judgment [5.15] it is further submitted by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that it is required to be noted that the plaintiff in its reply notice dated 20.04.2015 specifically stated that the dispute between the original plaintiff and the original defendant no.1 have to be resolved through the mechanism provided in the license agreement and not in any other way. it is submitted that therefore the plaintiff is now estopped from seeking reliefs from any other forum of law except the mechanism for resolution of disputes viz. arbitration. [5.16] shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 has submitted that the hon'ble supreme court in the case of m/s. sundaram finance ltd. and anr. vs. t. thankam reported in (2015) 14 scc 444 has held that once an application under section 8 is preferred, the approach of a court should be to see whether its jurisdiction has been ousted in compliance of a special statute. it is submitted that the general law should yield to the special law. it is submitted that in such situation, the approach shall not be to see whether there is still jurisdiction in the civil court under the general law. it is further submitted that such approaches would only delay the resolution of disputes and complicate the redressal of grievances and of course unnecessarily increase the pendency in the court. [5.17] it is further submitted by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that the hon'ble supreme court in the case of chloro controls p. ltd. vs. severn trent water purification inc. and ors. reported in (2013) 1 scc c/fa/588/2018 judgment 641, has held that the reference of disputes to arbitration where non­signatory are concerned is not unknown to the arbitration jurisprudence. it is submitted that it was further held that in cases of multiple agreements where the ancillary agreements emanates from the parent agreement containing the arbitral clause, then the approach of the court should be to refer the parties to arbitration. making above submissions and relying upon above decisions it is requested to quash and set aside the impugned order rejecting application under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996 and refer the dispute / parties to arbitration tribunal as per the license agreement. [6.0] shri premal nanavaty, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant in first appeal no.587/2018 has adopted the submissions made by shri dave, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant of first appeal no.588/2018 and has requested to quash and set aside the impugned order and allow the application under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996 preferred by the original defendant no.1. [7.0] both these appeals are vehemently opposed by shri shalin mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no.1 herein original plaintiff. shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case the learned commercial court has rightly rejected the application under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996 and has rightly not referred the matter to the arbitration. c/fa/588/2018 judgment [7.1] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such the original suit has been preferred as a mortgage suit. that the prayer in the suit is to restrained the bank of baroda i.e. respondent no.2 herein original defendant no.2 from releasing its equitable mortgage in favour of the plaintiff, in favour of defendant no.1 without consent of the plaintiff as per the terms of the tripartite agreement. it is submitted that there is an equitable mortgage by deposit of title deeds of the suit property in favour of the bank of baroda. it is submitted that the amount advanced by the bank of baroda to the original defendant no.1 was paid over to the gujarat composite limited. it is submitted that therefore the mortgage suits are excluded from the coverage of section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996 and therefore, the same is not arbitrable. it is submitted that the commercial suit which is preferred is also a suit for enforcement of mortgage being an enforcement of a right in rem and hence, the same is to be adjudicated by the courts of law and not by the arbitral tribunal. in support of his above submissions, shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has relied upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of booz allen hamilton inc. vs. sbi home finance ltd. reported in (2011)5 scc 532 (paras 21 to 30). [7.2] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that though the mortgage is in existence, the original defendant no.1 time and again approached the bank of baroda to release all the title deeds and therefore, specific relief has been sought against the bank of c/fa/588/2018 judgment baroda for not releasing the same. [7.3] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that tripartite agreement, based on which certain reliefs have been even prayed in the suit does not have any provision of arbitration. [7.4] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that as per the settled law, the suit is required to referred to arbitration only when the entire subject matter of the suit is subject to arbitration agreement. it is submitted that in the present case the suit is not only founded upon the license agreement, but also the tripartite agreement. it is submitted that tripartite agreement is not under the purview of arbitration because the same does not provide for arbitration. it is submitted that like the supplementary agreement, which is ancillary to the license agreement, the tripartite agreement is not ancillary to the license agreement. it is submitted that the tripartite agreement is altogether an independent agreement between the original plaintiff, original defendant no.1 and the bank of baroda. it is submitted that the bank of baroda who is party to the tripartite agreement is as such is not a party to the license agreement which contains the arbitration clause. it is submitted that thus the subject matter of the present suit is not fully covered by arbitration and therefore, the suit is not required to be sent to arbitration. in support of his above submissions, shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has heavily relied upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of sukanya c/fa/588/2018 judgment holdings (p) ltd. (supra) (paras 8, 14 to 18) as well as the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of s.n. prasad, hitek industries (bihar) limited vs. monnet finance limited & ors. reported in (2011)1 scc 320 as well as in the case of deutsche post bank home finance limited vs. taduri sridhar and anr. reported in (2011) 11 scc 375. [7.5] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that even though the original title deeds are even today with the original defendant no.2 bank of baroda and an undertaking was given by the original defendant no.1 to this effect, the original defendant no.1 behind the back of the band of baroda and even the plaintiff has sold portions of unit land to third parties and such third parties had initiated process for mutation of the said land. it is submitted that the said sale deeds have been executed with malicious and malafide intentions and knowledge. it is submitted that the sale deeds for which the prayer is sought in the suit to quash and set aside the same are nothing but fraud played by the appellant original defendant no.1, alongwith the original defendant nos.3 to 5 with the original defendant nos.1 and 2. it is submitted that therefore when there is a fraud, which is apparent on the record, the said issue can only be settled by the court through furtherance of detailed evidence and not by arbitration. in support of his above submissions, shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has heavily relied upon the decisions of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of n. radhakrishnan vs. m/s. maestro engineers & ors. reported in (2010) 1 scc 72 and in the c/fa/588/2018 judgment case of a. ayyasamy (supra). it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that even otherwise the suit in question involves complicated issues involving facts and law and hence also, the commercial court shall be the appropriate forum to adjudicate and decide the said issues. [7.6] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that even sale of the units land by the original defendant no.1 is even in blanket violation of the interim order dated 22.12.2006 passed by this court in civil application no.8943/2006 in special civil application no.2212/2004, wherein this court while specifically permitting the original defendant no.1 to sell 6500 sq. meter of units land property, specifically restrained the original defendant no.1 from disposing of any part of the said land without the express permission of this court. it is submitted that despite the above the original defendant no.1 has executed the sale deeds in favour of the original defendant nos.3 to 5 which as such is in contravention to the directions issued by this court. it is submitted that even the said sale deeds, which are under challenge, are also in contravention of the undertaking as submitted before the industrial tribunal. [7.7] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that the arbitration shall not entirely cover all the disputes between the original plaintiff and the original defendant no.1 as there are parties involved and also the entire disputes are not covered under the c/fa/588/2018 judgment arbitration agreement. [7.8] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that the alleged dispute related to several transactions under various separate documents / agreements, which does not provide for arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. it is further submitted that in the suit there are third parties to whom the agreements have been executed by the original defendant no.1 which are sought to be quashed and set aside and as they are not party to the license agreement and therefore also, the matter is not arbitrable. [7.9] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that that original defendant nos.2 to 5 against whom the specific reliefs have been prayed are not forming part of the main agreement and hence, no arbitration can be undertaken against them. it is submitted that in the present case even the original defendant nos.2 bank of baroda have also filed their detailed objections before the commercial court against the matter being sent for arbitration and infact they have not consented to the same. [7.10] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that it is not possible to institute a separate suit against the bank for enforcement of mortgage without joining original defendant nos.1, 3, 4 and 5. it is submitted that the principal prayer in the suit is to not release the equitable mortgage in favour of the original defendant no.1 without the plaintiff's consent. it is submitted that since the relief is c/fa/588/2018 judgment sought against the bank i.e. original defendant no.2 and the original defendant no.1, both will have to be joined as party defendants in the original suit. it is submitted that during the subsistence of the license and tripartite agreement, the original defendant no.1 has sold the mortgaged properties to defendant nos.3 to 5 and the said defendants want the title deeds of the mortgaged properties from the bank. it is submitted that therefore, these bonafide purchasers will have to be joined as party defendants in the original suit also without which the suit will suffer from non­joinder of necessary parties. it is submitted that as held by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of sukanya holdings (p) ltd. (supra), bifurcation of the claims and cause of action is not permissible. making above submissions and relying upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of sukanya holdings (p) ltd. (supra) and the decision of the division bench of this court in the case of amin associates vs. bharatbhai purshottambhai patel & ors. rendered in special civil application no.18399/2016 (paras 6.1 to 6.10), it is requested to dismiss the present first appeals. [8.0] heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties at length. considered and perused the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court by which the learned commercial court has rejected the application submitted by the original defendant no.1 to refer the dispute / matter to arbitration in exercise of powers under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996. while considering the issue involved in the present first appeals c/fa/588/2018 judgment viz. whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the learned commercial court has committed any error in rejecting application under section 8 of the arbitration act, law on the point and few decisions of the hon'ble supreme court as well as this court are required to be discussed and considered, which are as under: [8.1] first decision on the point is the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of sukanya holdings (p) ltd. (supra). while considering the applicability of section 8 of the arbitration act, the hon'ble supreme court has observed and held that where a suit is commenced in respect of a matter which falls partly within the arbitration agreement and partly outside and which involves parties some of whom are parties to the arbitration agreement while some are not so, section 8 of the arbitration act is not attracted. while interpreting word \"a matter\" in section 8 of the arbitration act, the hon'ble supreme court has observed and held that words \"a matter\" in section 8 indicate that the entire subject matter of the suit should be subject to arbitration agreement. it is further observed and held that there is no provision in the act for bifurcation of the suit into two parts, (1) to be referred to arbitration for adjudication and (2) to be decided by the civil court. it is further observed and held that neither section 5 of the arbitration act nor section 89 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 nor section 34 of the arbitration act, 1940 can be resorted to for interpreting section 8. before the hon'ble supreme court the learned counsel appearing for a party to the arbitration agreement submitted under section 8 of the arbitration act, the court was c/fa/588/2018 judgment required to refer the dispute arising because of the dissolution of the partnership firm to the arbitrator as contemplated by the arbitration clause. it was further submitted that in any case there is no bar in referring the dispute which arises between the parties to the agreement some of the parties to the suit, who are bound by the agreement, to the arbitrator as envisaged in the partnership deed. it was next contended that if the interpretation given by the high court is accepted (not to refer the matter to the arbitration for adjudication), arbitration clause could be defeated by an interested party by adding some reliefs which are not covered by the arbitration clause or by adding a few parties who are not bound by the arbitration clause. it was submitted that such interpretation would be against the object and purpose of the arbitration act and against the spirit of section 89 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. it was further submitted that the third parties who purchased the flat which were stock in trade of the firm and entered into transactions in connection with the business of the firm, are not necessary parties to the disputes amongst the partners relating to dissolution and account of the firm and therefore, the dispute ought to have been referred to the arbitrator. on the other hand, it was the case on behalf of the other side that the dispute in the suit and/or a matter in the suit is not required to be referred to arbitrator as the plaintiffs have prayed various reliefs in the suit which could not be referred to arbitrator and that some of the defendants are not parties to the arbitration agreement. by holding the order passed by the high court rejecting section 8 application preferred by the original defendant nos.1 and 2, the hon'ble supreme court has observed and held in paras 11 to 17 as under: c/fa/588/2018 judgment \"11. for appreciating the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the parties, we would refer to the relevant provisions namely sections 5 and 8 of the act, which are as under: \"5. extent of judicial intervention.­notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this part. 8. power to refer parties to arbitration where there is an arbitration agreement. (1) a judicial authority before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so applies not later than when submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration. (2) the application referred to in sub­section (1) shall not be entertained unless it is accompanied by the original arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof. (3) notwithstanding that an application has been made under sub­section (1) and that the issue is pending before the judicial authority, an arbitration may be commenced or continued and an arbitral award made.\" (emphasis supplied) 12. for interpretation of section 8, section 5 would have no bearing because it only contemplates that in the matters governed by part­i of the act, judicial authority shall not intervene except where so provided in the act. except section 8, there is no other provision in the act that in a pending suit, the dispute is required to be referred to the arbitrator. further, the matter is not required to be referred to the arbitral tribunal, if (1) the parties to the arbitration agreement have not filed any such application for referring the dispute to the arbitrator; (2) in a pending suit, such application is not filed before submitting first statement on the substance of the dispute; or (3) such application is not accompanied by the original arbitration agreement or duly certified copy thereof. this would, therefore, mean that arbitration act does not oust the jurisdiction of the civil court to decide the dispute in a case where parties to the arbitration agreement do not take appropriate steps as contemplated under sub­ sections (1) & (2) of section 8 of the act. 13. secondly, there is no provision in the act that when the subject matter of the suit includes subject matter of the arbitration agreement as well as other disputes, the matter is required to be referred to arbitration. there is also no provision for splitting the cause or parties and referring the subject matter of the suit to the arbitrators. 14. thirdly, there is no provision as to what is required to be done in a case where some parties to the suit are not parties to c/fa/588/2018 judgment the arbitration agreement. as against this, under section 24 of the arbitration act, 1940, some of the parties to a suit could apply that the matters in difference between them be referred to arbitration and the court may refer the same to arbitration provided that the same can be separated from the rest of the subject matter of the suit. section also provided that the suit would continue so far as it related to parties who have not joined in such application. 15. the relevant language used in section 8 is \"in a matter which is the subject matter of an arbitration agreement\", court is required to refer the parties to arbitration. therefore, the suit should be in respect of 'a matter' which the parties have agreed to refer and which comes within the ambit of arbitration agreement. where, however, a suit is commenced ­ \"as to a matter\" which lies outside the arbitration agreement and is also between some of the parties who are not parties to the arbitration agreement, there is no question of application of section 8. the words 'a matter' indicates entire subject matter of the suit should be subject to arbitration agreement. 16. the next question which requires consideration is even if there is no provision for partly referring the dispute to arbitration, whether such a course is possible under section 8 of the act? in our view, it would be difficult to give an interpretation to section 8 under which bifurcation of the cause of action that is to say the subject matter of the suit or in some cases bifurcation of the suit between parties who are parties to the arbitration agreement and others is possible. this would be laying down a totally new procedure not contemplated under the act. if bifurcation of the subject matter of a suit was contemplated, the legislature would have used appropriate language to permit such a course. since there is no such indication in the language, it follows that bifurcation of the subject matter of an action brought before a judicial authority is not allowed. 17. secondly, such bifurcation of suit in two parts, one to be decided by the arbitral tribunal and other to be decided by the civil court would inevitably delay the proceedings. the whole purpose of speedy disposal of dispute and decreasing the cost of litigation would be frustrated by such procedure. it would also increase the cost of litigation and harassment to the parties and on occasions there is possibility of conflicting judgments and orders by two different forums.\" [8.2] in the case of s.n. prasad (supra), the hon'ble supreme court has observed and held that reference to arbitration under section 8 can be only with respect to parties to arbitration and not c/fa/588/2018 judgment the non­parties. at this stage it is required to be noted that in the case before the hon'ble supreme court a non­party to the arbitration agreement was impleaded as a respondent in the arbitration proceedings and the award was passed against non­ party to the arbitration agreement and thereafter the hon'ble supreme court quashed and set aside the award passed by the arbitrator which was passed against the non­party to the arbitration agreement by observing that there was no arbitration agreement between the parties, impleadment of the appellant in that case (non­party to the arbitration agreement) as a respondent in the arbitration proceedings and the award against such third party in such arbitration cannot be sustained. a similar view has been taken by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of essar oil ltd. vs. hindustan shipyard ltd. reported in (2015) 10 scc 642 and in the case of kantilal ambalal patel & ors. vs. jalaram land developers & ors. reported in 2014 (1) glr 331. [8.3] following the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of sukanya holdings (p) ltd. (supra) as well as the subsequent decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of m/s. sundaram finance ltd. and anr. (supra) and other decisions of the hon'ble supreme court on the point, in the similar set of facts and circumstances, the division bench of this court in the case of amin associates (supra) has referred the matter to the arbitrator by observing that considering the reliefs sought / prayed in the suit which as such are are against non­party to the arbitration agreement also, it will not be proper to bifurcate the dispute between the parties to the arbitration agreement and non­ parties to the arbitration agreement and thereafter the division bench of this court in the aforesaid decision has confirmed the order passed by the learned commercial court rejecting application c/fa/588/2018 judgment under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996 and not referring the dispute / parties to the suit for arbitration. [8.4] applying the law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in the aforesaid decisions and the decision of this court in the case of amin associates (supra) to the facts of the case on hand and the averments in the plaint, pleadings on the cause of action and the reliefs prayed in the suit, which are against the parties to the arbitration agreement as well as non­parties to the arbitration agreement, it is required to be considered whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the learned commercial court has committed any error in rejecting section 8 application and not referring the parties / dispute in the suit for arbitration? [8.5] in the present case as observed herein above there are license agreements containing the arbitration clause, executed between the plaintiff and the original defendant no.1 on one hand. admittedly, the original defendant nos.2 to 5 are not party to the arbitration agreement. there is a tripartite agreement between the original plaintiff, original defendant no.1 and the original defendant no.2 (bank of baroda) under which the plaintiff and the original defendant no.2 have prayed the reliefs. it is an admitted position that in the tripartite agreement between the original plaintiff, original defendant no.1 and the original defendant no.2 (bank of baroda), there does not exist any arbitration agreement. under the tripartite agreement the original defendant no.1 has placed the title deeds and the said tripartite agreement as such can be said to be an independent agreement and under the said tripartite agreement there is a mortgage by deposit of title deeds in respect of immovables and hypothecation of movables. it appears that the said tripartite agreement was executed while sanctioning a corporate loan of rs.500 lakh in favour of the original plaintiff and c/fa/588/2018 judgment the charge and mortgage has been created in favour of bank of baroda original defendant no.2. it appears that during the pendency and subsistence of the aforesaid mortgage and as alleged by the original plaintiff surreptitiously and in breach of the injunction granted by this court as well as the undertaking before the industrial tribunal, the original defendant no.1 has sold some of the properties (mortgaged properties) in favour of original defendant nos.3 to 5. in light of the above broad facts and averments in the plaint, pleadings on the cause of action and the reliefs sought are required to be considered. [8.6] in the plaint in commercial civil suit no.90/2017, the plaintiff has sought the relief against the following defendants: 1. gujarat composite limited 2. bank of baroda 3. real home corporation a partnership firm 4. m/s. raj corporation (confirming party) partnership firm 5. rjd buildcon ltd. the suit is filed for recovery of legitimate dues, cancellation of sale deed and for permanent injunction. in the suit the plaintiff has prayed for the following reliefs. \"(a) this hon'ble court may be pleased to direct the defendant no.1 to pay to the plaintiff herein a sum of rs.32.66 crores with interest @ 14% per annum from the date of suit till realization herein under this decree and any further orders to be passed by this hon'ble court; (b) this hon'ble court may be pleased to hold and declare that the deeds of conveyance dated 23rd january, 2015 registered vide registration no.742 and 750, executed by defendant no.1 in favour of defendant nos.3 and 5, as null and void; c/fa/588/2018 judgment (c) this hon'ble court may be pleased to permanently restrain the defendant nos.1, 3, 4 and 5 or their agent, executors or administrators from disturbing or obstruction the plaintiff's occupation possession of the suit property till the plaintiff claim made in para (a) and (b) above is fully discharged; (d) this hon'ble court may be pleased to direct the defendant no.2 bank not to release original title papers and other relevant documents in favour of defendant nos.1, 3 and/or 4; (e) this hon'ble court may be pleased to hold and declare that the conveyance deed dated 23rd january, 2015 entered into between the defendant no.1 and defendant no.3 to 5 as null and void; (f) this hon'ble court may be pleased to direct the defendant no.2 to take over all the current assets of the plaintiff pertaining to or in connection with the operation of a.c. sheet and cement manufacturing unit under license agreement at their book value and make payment to the plaintiff for the current assets available at the time of handing over of the possession, if required;\" [8.7] necessary pleadings in the plaint with respect to cause of action are as under: 1. the cause of action has arisen when the defendant no.1, behind the back of the plaintiff, entered into conveyance deed with defendant no.3 and defendant no.5. 2. even the original title deeds and other documents partially pertaining to the suit property are in the custody of defendant no.2 bank and by suppressing the fact that the plaintiff has absolute right over the suit property qua possession, the defendant no.1 has entered into conveyance deed with defendant no.3 and defendant no.5 stating that suit property is free from any encumbrance and/or mortgage. c/fa/588/2018 judgment 3. that the cause of action for filing the suit has arisen because the defendant no.3 and defendant no.5 made an application to mutate the entry in the revenue record in regard to the deed of conveyance. as the plaintiff is legitimately in possession of the suit property by virtue of license agreement, supplementary agreement, tripartite and amended tripartite agreement, it vehemently opposed the said entry and ultimately the authority concerned rejected the application of the defendant no.3 and defendant no.5 for mutation of entry in regard to conveyance deed. thus the mutation entry with regard to mortgage of the suit property with defendant no.2 bank still exists and the defendant no.2 bank has not removed / revoked the said mortgage. 4. that though the plaintiff is in possession of the suit property by virtue of license agreement, supplementary agreement, tripartite agreement and amended tripartite agreement, the defendant no.1; behind the back of the plaintiff, entered into conveyance deed with defendant no.3 and defendant no.5. 5. the defendant no.1 even did not part with the sale consideration with the plaintiff which it has received from defendant no.3 and defendant no.5 for conveying the suit property to defendant no.3 and defendant no.5. 6. that the cause of action for filing the suit has arisen also as defendant no.1 had defaulted in repayment to punjab national bank and hence was not in a position to get any loan whatsoever in its own capacity from any financial institution, and as it was in need of financial assistance, defendant no.1 requested the plaintiff for financial help, because of which plaintiff obtained corporate loan of rs.05.00 crores on its name from defendant no.2 and advanced the same to defendant no.1. c/fa/588/2018 judgment 7. even during the currency of the license agreement, plaintiff has paid other amounts also for and on behalf of the defendant no.1 towards wages to the workers, revenue taxes, electricity bills, excise duty, etc. 8. the cause of action has arisen because in lieu of all these financial help from plaintiff, defendant no.1 entered into tripartite agreement and subsequently amended tripartite agreement with plaintiff and defendant no.2 bank, whereby defendant no.1 mortgaged the suit property with defendant no.2 bank and stood as guarantor towards the corporate loan which was obtained by plaintiff in its name to help out the defendant no.1, wherein it has been specifically agreed by defendant no.1 that unless all and full legitimate dues of the plaintiff has been paid up, plaintiff shall enjoy the possession of the suit property. 9. that the cause of action for filing of the suit has arisen also because the plaintiff has to recover rs.32.66 crores from the defendant no.1 towards corporate loan and other amount, which the plaintiff has advanced to the defendant no.1. [8.8] considering the above and the reliefs prayed / sought in the suit, it can be said that the prayer in terms of para 33(a) can be said to be against the original defendant no.1 who is a party to the arbitration agreement contained in the license agreement. prayer in terms of paras 33(b), 33(c) and 33(e) can be said to be against the original defendant no.1 and original defendant nos.3 to 5. original defendant nos.3 to 5 are not party to the arbitration agreement and as such they are third parties who have alleged to have purchased the properties from the original defendant no.1 during the subsistence of the license agreement as well as they have purchased the said property surreptitiously. the prayer in terms of paras c/fa/588/2018 judgment 33(d) and 33(f) can be said to be against the original defendant no.2 bank of baroda who admittedly is not a party to the arbitration agreement. all these reliefs are interconnected and the reliefs sought in the plaint are on the basis of multiple cause of actions and multiple reliefs against the defendants and it is not possible to bifurcate the dispute in the suit between the plaintiff and the original defendant no.1 (parties to the arbitration agreement) and the original plaintiff and the original defendant nos.2 to 5 (non­parties to the arbitration agreement). therefore, applying the law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of sukanya holdings (p) ltd. (supra) and other decisions referred to herein above, it cannot be said that the learned commercial court has committed any error in rejecting section 8 application and refusing to refer the matter / dispute in the suit for arbitration. [8.9] now, so far as the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 referred to herein above are concerned, on considering the said decisions, we are of the opinion that none of the decisions shall be applicable to the facts of the case on hand. [8.10] now, so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of m/s. srivenkateswara constructions & ors. (supra) by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 is concerned, on considering the said decision we are of the opinion that the said decision shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand. in the case before the hon'ble supreme court the reliefs claimed in the suit were found to be flowing from a single cause of action. dispute in the suit was between the plaintiff contractor against the first defendant railways, both of whom were parties to the arbitration agreement. c/fa/588/2018 judgment on facts the hon'ble supreme court found that the relief sought against the original defendant no.2 (non­party to the arbitration agreement) was wholly unnecessary having regard to the gist of the plaint. on facts it was observed by the hon'ble supreme court that prayer (b) sought against the original defendant no.2 non­party to the arbitration agreement was really not an independent one. the plaintiffs also did not separately valued the said relief though a decree for declaration was asked in favour of all the plaintiffs as regards enforceability of the bank guarantee. under the circumstances, on facts, the said decision shall not be of any assistance to the original defendant no.1. [8.11] now, so far as the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of afcons infrastructure ltd. (supra) relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 is concerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that there cannot be any dispute to the proposition of law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court on the need of the day to exercise powers under section 89 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. however, at the same time in the said decision the hon'ble supreme court has specifically observed that if there is no agreement between the parties for reference to arbitration, the court cannot refer the matter to arbitration under section 89 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. in the said decision it is further observed that a court has no power, authority or jurisdiction to refer unwilling party to arbitration, if there is no arbitration agreement. under the circumstances, the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of the afcons constructions ltd. (supra) shall not be of any assistance to the original defendant no.1 in the facts and circumstances of the case. similarly, the decision of the learned single judge of the c/fa/588/2018 judgment bombay high court in the case of a.b.k. dubhash and others (supra) relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 also shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand. in the said case on facts it was observed by the bombay high court that one of the party to the arbitration agreement wanted to frustrate the purpose of the whole arbitration agreement by joining some third person / party to the suit and by overlooking the basic facts and agreement between the parties. in the present case as observed herein above as such it cannot be said that the original defendant nos.2 to 5 who are non­party to the arbitration agreement are joined in the suit to frustrate the whole purpose of arbitration agreement. [8.12] similarly, the decision of the delhi high court in the case of wpil (supra) also shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand. in the case before the delhi high court on facts it was found by the delhi high court that non­parties to the two sets of arbitration agreements are neither necessary, nor proper for the adjudication of disputes. in the case before the delhi high court the plaintiff failed to show how the defendants who were non­ parties to the arbitration agreement had any concern or connection with the dispute relating to termination of contract or the dispute with respect to alleged breach of the terms of the project agreement. on facts it was held that there was no dispute between the plaintiff and non­parties to the arbitration agreement. on the contrary in para 24 the delhi high court has specifically observed that the observations of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of sukanya holdings (p) ltd. (supra) suggests that the suit claims cannot be bifurcated / split up into arbitrable and non­arbitrable disputes. it is further observed that the said conclusion is not only logical but also in tune with the law that a plaint cannot be partly c/fa/588/2018 judgment rejected. [8.13] considering the facts and circumstances of the case narrated herein above and the law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of sukanya holdings pvt. ltd. (supra) and other decisions referred to herein above, it cannot be said that the learned commercial court has committed any error in rejecting the application under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996 and refusing to refer the dispute / matter for arbitration. on facts it is not proper, advisable and/or possible to bifurcate the disputes viz. arbitrable and non­arbitrable. we are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned commercial court while rejecting the application under section 8 of the arbitration act, 1996. [9.0] in view of the above and for the reasons stated above, both these first appeals fail and the same deserve to be dismissed and are, accordingly, dismissed. however, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs. sd/­ (m.r. shah, j.) sd/­ (a.y. kogje, j.) ajay**"
