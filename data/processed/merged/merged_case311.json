KOGJE Date : 18/07/2018 C.A.V. JUDGMENT (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE M.R. SHAH)\n1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order passed by the learned Judge, Commercial Court, Rajkot, dated 30.03.2018/ 07.04.2018, passed below Ex.1 in Commercial Execution Petition No.12/2017 by which the learned Judge has overruled the preliminary objection raised by the judgment-debtor that the said execution petition before the Commercial Court shall not be maintainable and/or that the Commercial Court, Rajkot, shall not have any jurisdiction to adjudicate the said execution petition and the objection that only the Commercial Division of the High Court shall have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the execution petition and consequently holding that the Commercial Court, Rajkot, shall have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the said commercial execution petition, the original respondent - a judgment- debtor, has preferred the present First Appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Court, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of the High Courts Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Commercial Courts Act, 2015\").\n2. The facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as under:\n2.1 It is not in dispute that in an international arbitration between the appellant herein and the original applicant, being ICC Case No.18836/CYK, an award has been passed against the appellant herein. At this stage, it is required to be noted that the said international arbitration proceedings were pursuant to Article 4(2) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration in force as from 01.01.2012. It appears that in its request for arbitration, the original claimant proposed that the language of the arbitration be in English and that there should be a sole arbitrator. That by a letter dated 25.07.2012, the Secretariat of the ICC International Court of Arbitration sent a request for arbitration to the original respondent. The said proposed arbitration proceedings were opposed by the appellant - original respondent. It appears that thereafter, after two to three extensions, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce decided to submit the matter to a sole arbitrator pursuant to Article 12(2). That thereafter, upon the proposal of the Hong Kong Group, the Court at its session on 11.12.2012, appointed one Mr.Peter Scott Caldwell, Hong Kong, to act as a sole arbitrator. \nThat thereafter, the sole arbitrator declared his award on 31.07.2014 and partly allowed the claim as mentioned in the operative portion of the award, in favour of the respondent herein - original claimant. \n2.2 It appears that thereafter, the respondent herein - original claimant filed the execution petition, being Execution Application No.166/2015 in the Court of learned Additional District Court at Gandhidham. \n2.3 That the applicants of Civil Application No.1/2018 Axis Bank Limited and UCO Bank jointly submitted the application before the learned executing Court, i.e. the learned Additional District Court at Gandhidham, in whose Court the said execution application was filed, inter alia praying for transfer of the execution petition. It was the case on behalf of the decree-holder that as the award under execution is a domestic arbitral award for more than specified value, the execution petition is required to be transferred to the Commercial Court. However, the learned Additional District Judge, Gandhidham - Kutchh, was of the opinion that in view of the decision of this Court in M/s.OCI Corporation v. Kandla Export Corporation & Ors. - Misc. Civil Application (For Transfer) No.2969/2016 dated 11.11.2016 which is now reported in 2016 SCC OnLine Guj 5981 in which it was held for execution application of arbitration award of more than specified value if it is award of international l arbitration, then Commercial Division would have jurisdiction, the learned Additional District Judge, Gandhidham - Kutchh, by order dated 01.02.2017, returned the execution petition to the decree- holder for presenting it before the appropriate Court. 2.4 That thereafter, the original decree-holder filed the present execution petition before the Commercial Court, Rajkot, being Commercial Execution Petition No.12/2017. That the appellant-herein - judgment-debtor raised an objection that the Commercial Court, Rajkot, does not have any jurisdiction to adjudicate the said petition and that only the Commercial Division of the High Court shall have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the execution petition. Heavy reliance was placed upon the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation v. Kandla Export Corporation & Ors. - Misc. Civil Application (For Transfer) No.2969/2016 dated 11.11.2016 reported in 2017(1) GLH 383 : 2016 SCC OnLine Guj 5981 [hereinafter referred to as \"M/s.OCI Corporation (I)\"]. Reliance was also placed upon the subsequent decision of this Court in the case of Kandla Export Corporation & Anr. v. OCI Corporation & Anr. dated 28.09.2017 in First Appeal No.3096/2017 and other allied appeals which came to be confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court vide its decision dated 07.02.2018 in Civil Appeal Nos.1661-1663/2018 reported in 2018 SCC OnLine SC 170. However, by impugned order, the learned Judge, Commercial Court, Rajkot, has refused to follow the binding decision of this Court in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation (I) (supra) on the ground that in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation (I) (supra) before this Court it was a case of foreign award and in the present case, the award declared by the learned sole arbitrator is a domestic award. At this stage, it is required to be noted that as such, there are two decisions of this Court in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation, one in Misc. Civil Application (For Transfer) No.2969/2016 dated 11.11.2016 i.e. M/s.OCI Corporation-I, which would have direct bearing on the issue involved in the present proceedings, and another, dated 28.09.2017 in First Appeal No.3096/2017 and allied matters which was arising out of the order passed by the Commercial Division of the High Court holding that the said foreign award sought to be executed is enforceable. Both will be discussed hereinafter. Therefore, by impugned order, the learned Commercial Court, Rajkot, has overruled the objection raised by the appellant herein - judgment-debtor and has held that the Commercial Court, Rajkot, shall have jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the said execution petition. 2.5 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order passed by the learned Judge, Commercial Court, Rajkot, overruling the objection raised by the appellant herein on the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Rajkot, to entertain and adjudicate the said execution petition, and holding that for the execution of the award, the Commercial Court, Rajkot, shall have jurisdiction, the original applicant - original judgment-debtor has preferred the present appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n3. Shri Hardik Modh, learned advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant herein - original applicant who has raised an objection - original judgment-debtor and Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate, has appeared with learned advocate Shri Udit Mendiratta, on behalf of the respondent herein. Shri Tarak Damani, learned advocate, has appeared on behalf of the applicant in Civil Application No.1/2018 and Shri Dhaval D. Vyas, learned advocate, has appeared on behalf of the applicant of Civil Application No.2/2018. \n4. Shri Hardik Modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant - original applicant - original judgment- debtor - objector, has vehemently submitted that the learned Judge has materially erred in overruling the objection raised by the appellant on the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Rajkot, to entertain and adjudicate the execution petition to execute the award in case of international arbitration and has materially erred in holding that the Commercial Court, Rajkot, shall have the jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the execution petition to execute the award sought to be executed which was arising out of the international arbitration. 4.1 It is vehemently submitted by Shri Modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant - original judgment-debtor that as such, the learned Judge has not properly appreciated and/or considered and/or has not considered at all the entire / whole decision of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation (I) (supra). \n4.2 It is vehemently submitted by Shri Modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant - original judgment-debtor that as such, the decision of this Court in the case of Kandla Export Corporation & Anr. v. OCI Corporation & Anr. dated 28.09.2017 in First Appeal No.3096/2017 [hereinafter referred to as \"M/s.OCI Corporation -II\"] as such would not have any bearing on the jurisdiction aspect and/or jurisdiction of the Commercial Court. 4.3 It is submitted by Shri Modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant - original judgment- debtor that the controversy in M/s.OCI Corporation -I (supra) and M/s.OCI Corporation - II (supra) were different and arising out of different proceedings / orders and as such, the learned Judge, Commercial Court, Rajkot, has not at all noticed the difference in the decisions in M/s.OCI Corporation-I (supra) and M/s.OCI Corporation - II (supra). \n4.4 It is vehemently submitted by Shri Modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant - original judgment-debtor that as such, in the present case, the decision of the Division Bench of this Court dated 11.11.2016 in Misc. Civil Application (For Transfer) No.2969/2016 i.e. decision in M/s.OCI Corporation -I shall be applicable with full force. It is vehemently submitted by Shri Modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant - original judgment-debtor, that in M/s.OCI Corporation - I (supra), the Division bench of this Court has specifically observed and held that in case of an international arbitration, an execution petition to execute the award in connection with international arbitration shall be before the Commercial Division of the High Court only. It is submitted that without considering the entire facts and findings as a whole, the learned Judge has unnecessarily tried to justify facts and has erred in observing and holding that the decision in M/s.OCI Corporation -I (supra) and/or the decision in M/s.OCI Corporation -II (supra) which came to be confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court vide judgment and order dated 07.02.2018 in Civil Appeal Nos.1661-1663/2018 shall not be applicable as in the aforesaid case, the award was a foreign award and in the present case the award is a domestic award. 4.5 It is further submitted by Shri Modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant - original judgment-debtor that the learned Judge has unnecessarily drawn a distinction between the domestic award and foreign award, without further appreciating the fact that as such even the domestic award was also with respect to the international arbitration as defined under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. It is submitted that in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation - I (supra), the Division Bench of this Court has, in conclusion, specifically observed and held that where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, all the applications or the appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration Act shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such commercial division has been constituted in the High Court. It is submitted that despite the above, the learned Judge has materially erred in not following the said binding decision of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation - I (supra). 4.6 It is vehemently submitted by Shri Modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant - original judgment-debtor that even some of the observations made by the learned Judge that the observations made by the High Court and/or the order passed by the High Court shall not be considered as a statute, are absolutely unwarranted and more particularly are made without properly appreciating and/or understanding the ratio of the judgment of this Court in M/s.OCI Corporation - I (supra). \nMaking above submissions and relying upon the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation - I (supra), it is requested to allow the present appeal and quash and set aside the impugned order and it is requested to hold that the Commercial Court, Rajkot, would have no jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the execution petition to execute the award arising out of the international arbitration and that a Commercial Division of the High Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the said execution petition.\n5. Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the respondent herein - original judgment-creditor - original claimant.\n5.1 Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent herein - original judgment-creditor - original claimant has raised a preliminary objection on the maintainability of the present appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, against the impugned order passed by the learned Commercial Court. \nIn support of his above submission, Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate, has heavily relied upon the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Smt.Sushila Singhania & Ors v. Bharat Hari Singhania & Ors. dated 29.03.2017 in Commercial Appeal No.4/2016 - 2017 SCC OnLine Bom 360 (Paragraphs 55, 70, 71, 100, and 101). 5.2 It is vehemently submitted by Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent - original judgment-creditor - original claimant that against the impugned order passed by learned Commercial Court, appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, shall not be maintainable as the impugned order is not appealable under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. it is further submitted by Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate that even otherwise, as the arbitration was much prior to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, and therefore, as per Section 26 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, the amended Act shall not be applicable and therefore, the definition of `Court' contained in Section 2(e) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (Amendment) Act, 2015, shall not be applicable. It is submitted that therefore, the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, shall not be applicable retrospectively and shall not apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced prior to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, and therefore, the Commercial Division of this High Court shall not have jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the execution petition to execute the award arising out of the arbitration proceedings commenced prior to Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015.\nIn support of his above submission, Shri Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate, has relied upon the recent decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Board of Control for Cricket in India v. Kochi Cricket Pvt. Ltd. and etc. dated 15.03.2015 in Civil Appeal Nos.2879-2880/2018 reported in 2018 SCC OnLine 232.\n5.3 Now so far as the distinction drawn by the learned Judge that in the present case as the award was the domestic award and in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation -I (supra), it was a foreign award and therefore, the decision of this Court in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation - I (supra) shall not be applicable in the present case, Shri Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the original claimant - original applicant has initially tried to support the same. However, he is not disputing that the arbitration before the learned sole arbitrator was an international arbitration and the award declared by the learned sole arbitrator was in connection with the international arbitration. \n6. Shri Tarak Damani and Shri Dhaval D. Vyas, learned advocates appearing on behalf of the respective applicants in Civil Applications have supported the appellant herein and relying upon the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation - I (supra), it is submitted that the Commercial Court, Rajkot, shall not have any jurisdiction to entertain/ adjudicate the execution petition in connection with international arbitration and only the Commercial Division of the High Court shall have the jurisdiction. \n7. In rejoinder and to the objection raised by Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent on maintainability of the present appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 against the impugned order passed by the learned Judge, Commercial Court, Rajkot, Shri Modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant - judgment-debtor has submitted that as such, considering the first part of sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, present appeal under Section 13 of the Act shall be maintainable. He has submitted and requested that in case this Court comes to a conclusion that the present appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, against the impugned order passed by the learned Judge, Commercial Court, Rajkot, shall not be maintainable, the present appeal be converted into a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, which otherwise, is as per the recent decision of this Court dated 07.05.2018 in the case of State of Gujarat v. Union of India - Special Civil Application No.737/2018.\n8. Heard learned counsel for the respective parties at length. At the outset, it is required to be noted that the present appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, has been preferred by the appellant herein the judgment- debtor challenging the impugned order passed by the learned Commercial Court, Rajkot, overruling the objection raised by the appellant herein on the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Rajkot, to decide and adjudicate the execution petition filed before it. \n9. A preliminary objection is raised by Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent herein - original judgment-creditor on the maintainability of the present appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, against the impugned order passed by the learned Commercial Court, Rajkot, overruling and/or setting aside the objection on the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Rajkot, to entertain and adjudicate the said execution petition. \n9.1 Heavy reliance has been placed by Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent on Section 13(1) and the proviso to the said Section of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. It is submitted that against the final decision/ judgment of the Commercial Court or the Commercial Division of the High Court, appeal shall be maintainable to the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court. It is also submitted by Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent that even under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, considering proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 13, an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by the Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 only. \n9.2 Having heard learned counsel for the respective parties and considering sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent herein is right in raising the objection on the maintainability of the present appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, against the impugned order passed by the learned Judge, Commercial Court. As such, the said issue does not seem to be now res-integra in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kandla Export Corporation & Anr. v. OCI Corporation & Anr. dated 07.02.2018 in Civil Appeal Nos.1661-1663/2018 reported in 2018 SCC OnLine SC 170. A somewhat similar submission was made before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, fell for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and while interpreting and/or considering sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Paragraphs 15 to 17 has observed and held as under:- \n\"15. Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, with which we are immediately concerned in these appeals, is in two parts. The main provision is, as has been correctly submitted by Shri Giri, a provision which provides for appeals from judgments, orders and decrees of the Commercial Division of the High Court. To this main provision, an exception is carved out by the proviso. The primary purpose of a proviso is to qualify the generality of the main part by providing an exception, which has been set out with great felicity in CIT v. Indo-Mercantile Bank Ltd., 1959 Supp (2) SCR 256 at 266-267, thus:\n\"The proper function of a proviso is that it qualifies the generality of the main enactment by providing an exception and taking out as it were, from the main enactment, a portion which, but for the proviso would fall within the main enactment. Ordinarily it is foreign to the proper function of a proviso to read it as providing something by way of an addendum or dealing with a subject which is foreign to the main enactment. It is a fundamental rule of construction that a proviso must be considered with relation to the principal matter to which it stands as a proviso. Therefore it is to be construed harmoniously with the main enactment. (Per Das, C.J. in Abdul Jabar Butt v. State of Jammu & Kashmir [(1957) SCR 51, 59]). Bhagwati, J., in Ram Narain Sons Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax [(1955) 2 SCR 483, 493] said:\nIt is a cardinal rule of interpretation that a proviso to a particular provision of a statute only embraces the field which is covered by the main provision. It carves out an exception to the main provision to which it has been enacted as a proviso and to no other.\" \nLord Macmillan in Madras & Southern Maharatta Railway Co. v. Bezwada Municipality [(1944) LR 71 IA 113, 122] laid down the sphere of a proviso as follows:\n\"The proper function of a proviso is to except and deal with a case which would otherwise fall within the general language of the main enactment, and its effect is confined to that case. Where, as in the present case, the language of the main enactment is clear and unambiguous, a proviso can have no repercussion on the interpretation of the main enactment, so as to exclude from it by implication what clearly falls within its express terms.\" \nThe territory of a proviso therefore is to carve out an exception to the main enactment and exclude something which otherwise would have been within the section. It has to operate in the same field and if the language of the main enactment is clear it cannot be used for the purpose of interpreting the main enactment or to exclude by implication what the enactment clearly says unless the words of the proviso are such that that is its necessary effect. (Vide also Corporation of City of Toronto v.\nAttorney-General for Canada [(1946) AC 32, 37] .)\" \n16. The proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by the Commercial Division of the High Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure Code, 1908, and Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. It will at once be noticed that orders that are not specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the CPC would, therefore, not be appealable, and appeals that are mentioned in Section 37 of the Arbitration Act alone are appeals that can be made to the Commercial Appellate Division of a High Court. \n17. Thus, an order which refers parties to arbitration under Section 8, not being appealable under Section 37(1)(a), would not be appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. Similarly, an appeal rejecting a plea referred to in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 16 of the Arbitration Act would equally not be appealable under Section 37(2)(a) and, therefore, under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act.\" \n9.3 Applying the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid decision to the facts of the case on hand and considering sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, we are of the opinion that against the final judgment and/or decision of the Commercial Court or the Commercial Division of the High Court only, appeal shall be maintainable before the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court. However, an appeal shall also lie from such orders passed by the Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Therefore, the submission on behalf of Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate on behalf of the respondent that an appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, shall lie only from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is not acceptable. As observed and held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, is in two parts, one is with respect to providing appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court against the final decision / judgment or order of the Commercial Court or the Commercial Division of the High Court and the second part is with respect to providing appeal from such orders passed by Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. However, at the same time, Shri Trivedi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent is justified in raising the objection on the maintainability of the present appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 against the impugned order passed by the learned Commercial Court, Rajkot, overruling and /or setting aside the objection raised by the appellant herein on the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Rajkot, to entertain and adjudicate the execution petition. \n10. In view of the above discussion, it is observed and held that the present appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, against the impugned order passed by the learned Commercial Court, Rajkot, shall not be maintainable. However, considering the request made by Shri Modh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant and considering the fact that the issue with respect to the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Rajkot, would be a pure question of law and it is with respect to the jurisdiction, as held by the Division Bench of this Court in State of Gujarat v. Union of India (supra), a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India shall be maintainable and therefore, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant is permitted to convert the present First Appeal into a Writ Petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Registry is directed to register the present First Appeal as Special Civil Application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India by giving a separate, new number accordingly. \n11. Now so far as the challenge to the impugned order on merits is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that as such, the issue involved in the present petition with respect to the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Rajkot, to decide and adjudicate the said execution petition is now no more res-integra in view of the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation -I (supra). In the aforesaid decision, in Paragraph-63, the Division Bench of this Court has specifically observed and held as under:-\n\"63. The sum and substance of the above discussion would be, (1) Where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, all the applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the Commercial division where such Commercial Division has been constituted in the High Court i.e. in the present case High Court of Gujarat. \n(2) Where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute but not of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, considering the provisions of Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 the same shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the concerned High Court. \n(3) Where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is other than international arbitration, all the applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 shall be filed in and heard, decided and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial Court has been constituted.\" \nTherefore, the learned Judge, Commercial Court, Rajkot, has unnecessarily distinguished the decision of this Court in the case of M/s.OCI Corporation -I (supra) and thereby has erred in not following the said binding decision of this Court. The decision of this Court in M/s.OCI Corporation -I (supra) which is reported to be confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, specifically lays down that if the award is in connection with the international arbitration, execution petition shall be maintainable before the Commercial Division of the High Court alone. At this stage, it is required to be noted that as such, the applicability of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and/or applicability of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, cannot be disputed as the respondent herein - original applicant itself has preferred the execution petition before the Commercial Court under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. In the aforesaid decision in M/s.OCI Corporation - I (supra), after considering the Scheme of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and the object and purpose of the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and the Scheme of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, it is specifically observed and held that against any decision and/or order where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, all the applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such Commercial Division has been constituted in the High Court i.e. in the present case High Court of Gujarat. It is not in dispute that in the present case, the subject-matter of arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and the arbitration is an international commercial arbitration. Even when the award is a domestic award as the venue might have been in India, the arbitration would still be an international commercial arbitration. Under the circumstances, the impugned order passed by the learned Judge, Commercial Court, Rajkot, overruling / setting aside the objections raised by the appellant herein on the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Rajkot, to entertain and adjudicate the execution petition with respect to the international commercial arbitration and the order passed by the learned Commercial Court that the said execution petition shall be maintainable before the Commercial Court, Rajkot, cannot be sustained and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside. It is, accordingly quashed and set aside. The Commercial Court, Rajkot, is hereby directed to return the said execution petition to the original applicant - original claimant to present it before the Commercial Division of this Court immediately and thereafter, the original claimant - original applicant to file the execution petition before the Commercial Division of this Court and if filed within a period of four weeks from the return of the execution petition to present it before the Commercial Division of this Court, the same be considered in accordance with law and on merits at the earliest. \nRule is made absolute accordingly to the aforesaid extent. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs. \nIn view of the disposal of writ petition, respective Civil Applications stand disposed of. \nsd/-\n(M.R.

(xi) if licensee wants to terminate the agreement prematurely then licensee shall give 9 months' notice and pay rs.50 lakhs as liquidate damages.\" 4. there were notices and reply between the parties on termination of leave and licence. 5. ultimately, the dispute between the parties reached to the court of civil judge, senior division at rahata. the respondent/original plaintiff filed special civil suit no.126/2019 against the appellant/original defendant for possession of the suit premises, settlement of accounts, compensation, mesne profit and recovery of an amount of rs.16,09,11,584/-. the respondent had sought various interim reliefs in the said suit including appointment of receiver. 6. the appellant raised legal objection about maintainability of the suit by filing an application vide exh.23 before the civil court. the contention of the appellant was that, in view of nature of dispute between the parties, the suit lies before the commercial court under the commercial courts act, 2015. the learned civil judge, after hearing both the sides and after taking into consideration the legal position was pleased to allow the said application exh.23 on 22.10.2019 and suit came to be transferred to the commercial comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 court/district judge at kopargaon, which has jurisdiction to decide the suit under the commercial courts act, 2015. 7. in commercial suit no.02/2019, respondent/original plaintiff moved an application for interim mandatory injunction vide exh.77. it was resisted by the appellant/original defendant. the commercial court was pleased to allow the prayer of the respondent/original plaintiff and directed the appellant/ defendant to handover the possession of the suit premises to respondent/original plaintiff in terms of leave and licence agreement, within one month from the date of deposit of rs.2 crore in the court by the appellant/original defendant. 8. we have perused the impugned orders passed below exh.77 and exh.57 by the commercial court dated 8.12.2020 and 5.12.2020, respectively, copy of leave and licence agreement and other documents and papers relied upon by both the sides. 9. we have heard mr sanket kulkarni, learned advocate for the appellant/original plaintiff and mr v.d. salunke, learned advocate for the respondent/original defendant at length. we have also perused the written notes of arguments submitted by both the learned advocates. 10. in commercial appeal no.1 of 2021, the appellant/original defendant is challenging the order of rejection of temporary injunction, passed below exh.57 dated 5.12.2020, whereas in commercial appeal no.2 of 2021, appellant/defendant is challenging the order of interim mandatory injunction passed below exh.77, by the commercial court in commercial suit no.02/2019 vide order dated 8.12.2020. comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 11. in the above background, the appellant/original defendant is before us who seeks relief of setting aside the above referred both the orders passed by the commercial court. 12. before going into the arena of dispute, let us have a glance on the admitted factual scenario. factual scenario 13. the respondent/original plaintiff is an owner of the suit premises, wherein hotel is being run by the appellant/original defendant. the respondent/original plaintiff has given its suit premises/hotel premises to the present appellant/defendant by way of registered leave and licence agreement dated 30.12.2015. the conditions incorporated in the leave and licence agreement are admitted. it is not in dispute that the defendant has spent an amount of rs.4.7 crore towards renovation of suit premises. the monthly rent of the suit premises was fixed at rs.14,25,000/inclusive of service tax with increase of 6% per year. 14. it is not in dispute that leave and licence period was from 30.12.2015 to 31.12.2019 (49) months. submissions of advocate for appellant 15. mr sanket kulkarni, learned advocate for the appellant/original defendant vehemently submitted that the issue of jurisdiction raised before the trial court plays important role. he submitted that in view of nature of dispute between the parties, which is of commercial nature, the suit lies before the commercial court and accordingly, the appellant/original defendant has raised objection and the civil court has transferred the suit to commercial court for its adjudication. comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 16. mr kulkarni, learned advocate for the appellant/original defendant invited our attention to section 11 of the commercial courts act, 2015. the commercial court has no jurisdiction to decide any suit, application or proceedings relating to any commercial dispute in respect of which the jurisdiction of the civil court is either expressly or impliedly barred under any other law for the time being in force. he submitted that in view of section 47 of the maharashtra rent control act, 1999, the civil court has no jurisdiction. no injunction can be granted by any court or authority. he submitted that the competent authority under section 49 of the maharashtra rent control act, 1999 appointed under the act shall be deemed to be public servant and under section 51 of the act, it is deemed to be a civil court. in view of section 47 and 33 of the maharashtra rent control act, 1999, the jurisdiction of civil court is barred. the commercial court even does not get any jurisdiction in the matter. the orders passed by the commercial court below exh.77 and 57 are bad in law and liable to be quashed and set aside. mr kulkarni, learned advocate for the appellant has placed his reliance in case of royal orchid hotels ltd. vs. rock realty pvt. ltd., civil revision application (stamp) no.15282 of 2019, decided on 25.6.2019 by the learned single judge at principal seat and mahadev p kambekar (d) tr. lrs., vs. shree krishna woolen mills pvt. ltd., civil appeal nos. 57535754 of 2011 decided on 31.1.2019 by the apex court. 17. mr kulkarni submitted that cause of action arose for the suit when the original defendant alleged to have made default in payment of licence fees. the cause of action had arisen in april 2016 and the plaintiff filed suit in the year 2019, almost after three years and, therefore, the original plaintiff is not entitled to get the equitable relief of injunction in view of section 41 of the specific relief act, 1963. comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 18. mr kulkarni invited our attention to the impugned order at exh.77 and submitted that the learned commercial court was pleased to grant interim mandatory injunction. the relief granted by the trial court is nothing but granting final relief. what is remained for final adjudication of the suit. according to mr kulkarni, the interim mandatory injunction is to be granted only to restore the status quo. mr kulkarni has placed his reliance in case of dorab cawasji warden vs. coomi sorab warden & ors. reported in air 1990 867 and kishore kumar and ors., vs. parveen kumar singh, reported in air 2006 sc 1474. 19. mr kulkarni submitted that if there are any triable issues, then relief of interim mandatory injunction is not permissible. he submitted that there are number of triable issues involved in the suit, which require leading of evidence, cross-examination. the issue of settlement of accounts is also involved. 20. mr kulkarni submitted that the trial court has committed an error in granting final relief of possession at interim stage when the issues are yet to be framed and the evidence is yet to be adduced. he submitted that the impugned order of interim mandatory injunction is bad in law and to support his argument, relied upon the decision in case of metro marins & anr. vs. bonus watch co. pvt. ltd. & ors., reported in (2004) 7 scc 478. 21. according to mr kulkarni, section 12-a of the commercial courts act, 2015 is mandatory which provides pre-institution mediation. in the present case, no exercise was made to refer the dispute to the mediation before filing of suit and it is breach of section 12-a of the commercial act, 2015. the suit is defective. comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 22. in conclusion, mr kulkarni, learned advocate for the appellant/original defendant strenuously argued that the impugned orders passed by the commercial court are bad in law and liable to be quashed and set aside. submissions of advocate for respondent 23. on the other hand, mr v.d. salunke, learned advocate for the respondent/original plaintiff submitted that appellant/original defendant had raised objection about maintainability of the suit before the civil court and at the instance of appellant, the suit came to be transferred to the commercial court and converted the suit into commercial suit. both the parties have accepted the order passed on merits and appeared before the commercial court and contested the suit. now, the appellant cannot raise any kind of objection regarding jurisdiction of the commercial court. 24. mr salunke, learned advocate for respondent/original plaintiff submitted that the commercial suit is very much maintainable in view of nature of dispute between the parties. the objection is without any merit. 25. mr salunke further submitted that second ground regarding maintainability of the suit for non-compliance of section 12-a of the commercial act, 2015 is raised for the first time before this court. the objection is unsustainable in law, particularly, at this stage in appeal when it was not raised before the trial court. he submitted that the said ground deemed to have been waived by the appellant/original defendant and as such, cannot be raised at appellate stage. he submitted that provisions of section 12-a of the commercial act, 2015 are not mandatory, however, those are directory. mr salunke placed reliance in support of his submissions on the following citations : comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 i) ganga taro vazirani vs. deepak raheja (summons for judgment no.45 of 2019 in comm. summary suit no.972 of 2019 decided on 16.2.2021) at principal seat at bombay; ii) sathyam wood industries vs. adoniss (p) ltd., and anr. (c.r.p. (md) no.804 of 2019 decided on 10.6.2019) of madras high court; and iii) gsd constructions pvt. ltd., vs. balaji febtech engineering pvt. ltd.,( m.a. no.4081/2019 decided on 7.8.2019) of high court of madhya pradesh at indore. 26. according to mr salunke, the objection regarding jurisdiction of the commercial court raised by the appellant is concerned, the same is untenable since it was not raised before the trial court. he submitted that admittedly, the appellant is a private limited company having share capital of more than rs.2 crore and as such, the objection is devoid of merits. 27. so far as relief of granting interim mandatory injunction is concerned, mr salunke vehemently submitted that leave and licence agreement period is expired long back. the appellant is in occupation of suit premises illegally and earning huge money. out of sixty months, the appellant has paid rent hardly for three to four months and rs.16 crore are due. in such circumstances, the commercial court has rightly granted the relief of interim mandatory injunction against the appellant. 28. to buttress the argument, mr salunke has placed his reliance on the following citations : i) deoraj vs. state of maharashtra and ors., reported in (2004) 4 scc 697; comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 ii) sanjeev pillai vs. venu kunnapalli (faq no.191/2019 decided on 11.12.2019) of kerala high court; iii) saregama india limited vs. balaji motion pictures limited & ors., (cs (com) 492/2019 decided on 13.9.2019) of delhi high court iv) kirtibhai vs. raghuram (appeal from order no.262 of 2007 decided on 20.1.2010) of gujarat high court 29. so far as ground of limitation is concerned, according to mr salunke, the objection is misconstrued. the suit is not for mandatory injunction to calculate point of limitation. as such, suit is very well within the limitation and not barred by law of limitation. he submitted that equity also lies in favour of respondent/original plaintiff in view of facts of the case on hand. 30. we have considered the arguments advanced by the learned advocates for the respective parties. grounds of appeal i) maintainability of suit; ii) jurisdiction; iii) non-compliance of section 12-a of the commercial courts act; iv) grant of interim mandatory injunction at interim stage; v) relief of mandatory injunction barred by limitation 31. first we shall deal with the issue of jurisdiction of the commercial court. it is an admitted position that respondent/original plaintiff has initially filed the suit against the appellant/defendant before the civil judge, senior division at rahata. the appellant/defendant raised objection about maintainability of the suit before the civil court in view of nature of dispute between the parties. the appellant/original defendant moved an application comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 raising the issue of maintainability of the suit and after hearing both the sides and on merits, the civil court has recorded finding that the lis between the parties must be entertained by the commercial court and not by the civil court. at the instance of appellant, the suit came to be transferred to commercial court. the order passed by the civil court about nonmaintainability of the suit before it was accepted by both the sides and reached finality. none of the parties challenged that order before the appropriate court. 32. again, the appellant/original defendant is raising objection about jurisdiction of the commercial court contending that competent authority under the maharashtra rent control act, 1999 alone has jurisdiction to entertain the dispute. the commercial court has no jurisdiction to entertain the dispute on hand. we do not find any merit in the argument and point of objection raised by the appellant's side. 33. admittedly, the appellant/original defendant is a private limited company having share capital of more than rs.2 crore. in view of section 3 of the maharashtra rent control act, 1999, when the share capital of a company exceeds rs.1 crore or more, the provisions of the maharashtra rent control act, 1999 would not come in picture, meaning thereby the dispute may not be governed by the maharashtra rent control act, 1999 as argued by mr sanket kulkarni, learned advocate for the appellant, through competent authority in view of section 49 of the maharashtra rent control act, 1999. the nature of dispute between the parties, as discussed hereinbefore and in view of terms and conditions incorporated in the leave and licence agreement, it is very much clear that it is a commercial dispute between the parties, as defined under section 2 (c) (i) & (vii) of the commercial court, 2015. comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 34. having regard to the above reasons and in view of legal position discussed in earlier paras, we do not find any merit on the point of maintainability of the suit as well as jurisdiction. the suit is rightly maintainable before the commercial court. the commercial court is empowered to adjudicate the lis between the parties when the court under the maharashtra rent control act, 1999 has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. we are unable to accept the argument advanced by mr sanket kulkarni, learned advocate for the appellant/original defendant. 35. now coming to the point of non-compliance of section 12-a of the commercial courts act, 2015. section 12-a of the commercial courts act 2015 provides that when a suit which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief under the commercial courts act, shall not be instituted unless the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of pre-institution mediation in accordance with such manner and procedure as may be prescribed by rules made by the central government. meaning thereby, the dispute must be referred to the pre-institution mediation center for settlement before knocking the doors of the commercial court. first of all, the ground of non-compliance of section 12-a of the commercial courts act was not raised before the trial court. moreover, in view of recent decision of this court in summons for judgment no.45 of 2019 in commercial summary suit no. 972 of 2019, decided by the single judge at principal seat on 16.2.2021, it is ruled that provisions of section 12-a of the commercial courts act, 2015 are directory and not mandatory. same view has been taken in case of sathyam wood industries vs. adoniss (p) ltd., and anr. by the madras high court as well as gsd constructions pvt. ltd., vs. balaji febtech engineering pvt. ltd. (supra) by the madhya pradesh high court. the culcutta high court in case of terai overseas private limited & ors. vs. kejriwal sugar comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 agencies private limited & ors. in c.s. no.78 of 2020 decided on 3.9.2020 and in case of m/s amit motorcycles pvt. ltd., vs. m/s axis bank ltd., in i.a. no.ga 3 of 2019 in cs 217 of 2018, decided on 15.12.2020 has held that section 12-a of the commercial courts act, 2015 is mandatory. 36. moreover, the matter has travelled further. the objection of the matter not referred to mediation is raised for the first time in present appeals after the applications filed by plaintiff and defendant are decided. the defendant filed counter claim and also application for temporary injunction. the defendant on merits got the application decided but did not raise objection of matter to be referred for mediation. having regard to the above legal position, it cannot be said that suit is bad for non-compliance of section 12-a of the commercial courts act, 2015. moreover, it would be too late in a day now to refer the lis to the mediation center for adjudication when both the parties fighting with strong arms and legal tools. 37. so far as point of limitation is concerned, on perusing the pleadings of both the sides and documents on record, it is evident that the respondent/original plaintiff has filed the suit against the appellant/original defendant for possession of the suit premises. the suit is not for mandatory injunction. as such, article 113 of the limitation act, 1963 has no application in view of facts and circumstances of case on hand. it is difficult to accept the argument advanced by mr kulkarni that suit is barred by limitation in view of section 113 of the limitation act, 1963. 38. now coming to the main ground regarding grant of relief of interim mandatory injunction in favour of respondent/original plaintiff, both the sides have canvassed their arguments on this aspect by placing reliance on the citations. comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 39. it is well settled legal position that in view of provisions of order xxxix, rule 1 and 2 of the code of civil procedure read with section 39 of the specific relief act, the court is empowered to grant relief of interim mandatory injunction. the civil court has inherent power to issue interim injunction when it considers it absolutely necessary to meet the ends of justice to do so. it is while exercising such inherent powers that the court in exceptional circumstances of the case has jurisdiction to grant such relief. the inherent power which is vested in the court is to maintain the status quo as of the date of the suit till the disposal of the suit. it is not to disturb the status quo as of the date of the suit. when the suit is one for possession, normally, interim mandatory injunction cannot be issued pending the final decision of the suit. in case of metro marins & anr. vs. bonus watch co. pvt. ltd. & ors. (supra), it is held by the hon'ble apex court that the final relief cannot be granted at interim stage when the suit itself is for eviction and possession of the property. grant of mandatory injunction is not correct. 40. if the relief of interim mandatory injunction is allowed to continue, then what would remain in the suit to adjudicate between the parties. the issues are yet to be framed. the parties are yet to adduce the evidence. according to their pleadings, they will cross-examine their respective witnesses according to their legal stand. admittedly, on the date of the suit, appellant/original defendant is in possession of the suit premises. there are triable issues involved including settlement of accounts. if these peculiar facts of the case on hand are considered, certainly, it is not a fit case to grant relief of interim mandatory injunction. the trial court seems to have granted interim mandatory injunction in a casual manner without taking into consideration the consequences of it. the impugned order of granting interim mandatory injunction is certainly defective in the eyes of law. having comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 regard to the facts of the case on hand, it cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. 41. it is true that leave and licence period was for 49 months, i.e. from 30.12.2015 to 31.12.2019. the licence period is over. it seems that the appellant/original defendant seems to have paid licence fees only for three months and from march 2016, not paid the licence fees though total dues according to the plaintiff is more than rs.16 crore, as claimed by the respondent/plaintiff in pleadings. on one hand, the appellant/original defendant is using the said premises for running his hotel business and earning profit. on the other hand, the respondent/original plaintiff is deprived of getting his legitimate licence fees though he is entitled for the same. equities will have to be adjusted. defendant cannot be allowed to enjoy possession of such a huge property free. defendant is required to be put to terms. 42. as per the terms and conditions of the leave and licence agreement, the appellant/original defendant has spent an amount of rs.4.70 crore towards renovation of hotel. the monthly rent was agreed at rs.14,25,000/inclusive of service tax with increase of 6% every year. it was further agreed between the parties that an amount of rs.9,10,000/per month shall be deducted towards renovation out of licence fees of rs.14,25,000/per month and an amount of rs.5,15,000/would be paid to the respondent/plaintiff towards licence fees. further it is admitted position that leave and licence period between the parties was for 49 months from 1.12.2015 to 31.12.2019. as per the memorandum of understanding between the parties dated 7.11.2013 and in view of declaration-cum-undertaking dated 14.12.2015, the respondent/original plaintiff has paid rs.1,20,00,000/to the appellant/original defendant for renovation of hotel in advance which is to be comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 adjusted in the licence fees. therefore, it is clear that out of renovation expenses of rs.4.70 crore, an amount of rs.1,20,00,000/is already paid by the respondent/original plaintiff to the appellant/original defendant and remaining balance amount of rs.3,50,00,000/was remained to be recovered from the respondent/original plaintiff. as agreed between the parties, rs.9,10,000/per month would be adjusted to recover remaining balance amount of renovation expenses. if we calculate the said amount of rs.9,10,000/per month towards payment of renovation expenses, the total comes to (rs.9,10,000 x 36 = rs.3,27,60,000/-). thus, renovation expenses seems to have been recovered by the appellant/original defendant. the respondent/original plaintiff is entitled to get full licence fees i.e. rs.14,25,000/per month after satisfying renovation expenses. thus, respondent/original plaintiff would be entitled to get rs.14,25,000/per month (+) 6% increase per year for atleast 24 months and after necessary calculation that figure comes to rs.3,42,00,000/without increase of 6% per annum in rent/licence fees. having regard to the above calculation, the arrears against the appellant/original defendant seems to be approximately more than rs.4 crore. by taking into this aspect and to make the justice we thought it proper to issue certain directions in t his behalf in the final order. 43. having regard to the nature of dispute and in order to protect the interest of both the parties, we are of the considered view that impugned order of granting interim mandatory injunction is liable to be modified. at the same time, rights of the respondent/original plaintiff need to be protected by issuing certain directions to the appellant/original defendant subject to final decision in the suit, which will take care of legitimate rights of respondent/original plaintiff. with this, we conclude and proceed to pass the following order : comm.apeal 1 & 2 2021 order (i) the impugned order below exh.77 in commercial suit no.2/2019 dated 8.12.2020, passed by the commercial court at kopargaon is modified. (ii) the appellant/original defendant shall deposit an amount of rs.4 crores within six weeks from the date of this order in the trial court and continue to pay regular licence fees at the rate of rs.14,25,000/per month till final decision of the commercial suit. (iii) the respondent/original plaintiff is entitled to withdraw the amount deposited by the appellant/original defendant in the trial court. (iv) in case the appellant/original defendant fails to comply the abovesaid clauses of the order of this court, the order of the commercial court/trial court passed below exh.77 in commercial suit no.02/2019 dated 8.12.2020 would be operative and the respondent/original plaintiff is at liberty to take up execution proceeding and legal recourse accordingly. (v) the respondent/original plaintiff has already put the law in motion against the appellant/original defendant for possession of the suit property/suit premises, there is no force in the apprehension raised by the appellant/original defendant. as such, there is no need to pass any order on exh.57 and exh. 57 shall stand simply filed. 44. in view of above terms, both the commercial appeals stand disposed of. 45. in view of disposal of commercial appeals, civil applications also stand disposed of. no order as to costs.
