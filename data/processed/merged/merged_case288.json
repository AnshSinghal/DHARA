The petitioners have preferred this revision petition for setting aside the impugned order dated 21.10.2022 passed by the Additional District Judge-cum-Presiding Officer, Exclusive Commercial Court at Gurugram, exercising jurisdiction under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n1 of 20 [2]. The petitioners have alleged that the impugned order is totally non-speaking and has resulted in wrong exercise of power in contradiction to the provisions under Section 36(2) and Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The impugned order has arisen from an application filed by the respondent under Section 34 of the Act, whereby the respondent has challenged the interim award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal in C.I.S. Arb/116/2021 titled Fia Technology Services Pvt. Ltd.Vs. Sameer Kumar Mathur. In the proceedings before the Commercial Court, the respondent has also filed an application under Section 36(2) of the Act for stay of interim award. The impugned order has been passed on the stay application, whereby the Commercial Court has granted an unconditional stay of the interim award without assigning any reason. \n[3]. The Commercial Court vide order dated 15.09.2021 had directed the arbitral proceedings be kept in abeyance during the pendency of the petition under Section 34 of the Act. The aforesaid order dated 15.09.2021 passed by the Additional District Judge-cum-Presiding Officer, Exclusive Commercial Court at Gurugram was challenged by the petitioners in Cr No.4003 of 2022 and the same was disposed of vide order dated 12.10.2022 with the following observations:-\n2 of 20 \"At this stage, without meaning anything on the merits of the case, it would be just and appropriate to direct the Additional District Judge-cum-Presiding Judge, Exclusive Commercial Court at Gurugram to decide the application under Section 36 of the Act finally in accordance with law. \nNeedless to say that an endeavour shall be made to decide the application under Section 36 of the Act in view of consensus arrived at between the parties on the date fixed or soon thereafter, preferably within a week in case of any impediment. \nThis Court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case. The Court shall dispose of the application without being influenced by any statement of fact recorded hereinabove. \nIn view of the order passed above, all other applications are disposed of as such.\"\n[4]. Evidently, an interim award was passed by the arbitral Tribunal on 12.06.2021. \n[5]. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners submitted that the interim award in respect of determination of issues has attained finality, for which, the respondent has already filed objection petition under Section 34 of the Act. Only issue of valuation has to be decided by the arbitral Tribunal and the same cannot be stayed by the Court by ordering the arbitral proceedings to be kept in abeyance. The challenge in the petition under Section 34 of the Act filed by the respondent is 3 of 20 that the interim arbitral award is patently illegal as the arbitral Tribunal has read into the Share Holders Agreement (Sha) non- compete obligation where none exists, while acknowledging that the Sha does not contain such obligations and that such obligations are not enforceable and therefore, the award is patently illegal and perverse. Learned Senior Counsel referred to the conclusions drawn by the arbitral Tribunal in para Nos.85 and 89 of the award. \n[6]. During the proceedings before the arbitral Tribunal, the petitioners had alleged that the respondent was removed from the post of Ceo as the Board of Directors of the claimant- Company had lost confidence in him due to his acts which in the wisdom of the Board  of Directors were clearly against \"prudent business norms\". In para No.31 of the State of Claim (SOC), following acts of the respondent were set out:-\n\"(a) Several compliance related violations were committed during the tenure of the Respondent. \n(b) Under the tenure of the Respondent, the Claimant Company encountered problem in having unmatched balance in the Yes Bank settlement account. The settlement account has to be reconciled on daily basis, so that no fraud goes undetected and no liability is cast upon the Company vis-a-vis the agents/Customer Service providers (CSPs). The Respondent was called upon repeatedly to resolve this flaw in the system, so that the Claimant Company 4 of 20 does not fall into a situation where it has to pay out a huge amount of money. But the Respondent did not act to resolve the situation, even on the requests/concerns of Claimant No.2. In this regard, the Claimant No.2 even wrote an email dated September 03,2014 to the Respondent. \n(c) Wife of the Respondent was shown as an employee in the Claimant Company and received a salary of Rs.10 lacs per annum for more than 2 years. However, she never worked for the Claimant Company and did not even have an official email id.\n\"Hence, money from the Claimant no.1 was drawn unjustly\". Furthermore, incorrect pan no. detail was provided by the Respondent for his wife. This resulted in rejection of the TDS return of the Claimant Company. Notices were issued by the Revenue to the Claimant Company every quarter requiring it to rectify the defect in the return. Though the Respondent was fully aware of this, he took no steps to rectify it. The said problem arose every quarter. This was done purposely by the Respondent, so that his wife's income was not disclosed in the individual income tax returns, as can be seen for two years where he was not claiming the Form 16 from the Claimant Company. \n(d). The Respondent resorted to creating factitious and forged appointment letter for himself, specifying his salary as Rs.1 crore p.a.\" \n[7]. The respondent resigned as Director of the claimant- Company on 02.09.2015, but even before his resignation, the 5 of 20 respondent has joined ROINET. The petitioners have also alleged the following additional allegations:-\n. \n\" The Respondent clandestinely incorporated ROINET through its proxies before the incorporation of Claimant Company. \n The Respondent has provided list of banks who were clients of Respondent no.1 to ROINET.  Respondent has used same format of Claimant No. 1, its websites CSP, Data Manager etc.  Respondent represented to the Banks dealing with Claimant Company that he has started a new venture. \n Respondent attempted to take away the business of Claimant No.1. \n The Respondent acted to cause loss to the Claimant by spreading disparaging remarks to the associate banks, their officials, employees, franchisees, business associates, beneficiaries and customer of Claimant Company. \n The Respondent went to the extent of spreading misinformation that the Claimant Company was closing its business. \n The Respondent attempted to sabotage the business 6 of 20 of Claimant Company by threatening its employees. The Respondent instigated certain channel partners and CSPs of Claimant No.1 to make abusive and threatening calls at odd hours to the Claimant No.2.  The Respondent resorted to forgery by creating fictitious and forged appointment letters for himself with a view to cause loss to the Claimant Company.  The Respondent informed the bank that he is buying out Claimant Company.\n The Respondent has caused loss to the business of Claimant Company.\n Respondent started personally meeting officials of the banks working with the Claimant Company to transfer the mandate of Claimant Company to ROINET.\" \n[8]. With the aforesaid allegations, the petitioners raised the claims before the arbitral Tribunal on the ground that the respondent has ceased to be a shareholder in terms of Shareholders Agreement dated 24.03.2014 and the respondent be directed to hand over the shares of the claimants. Following prayers were made:-\n\"a. hold that the Respondent has ceased to be a Shareholder in terms of the Shareholders Agreement dated 24.03.2014 and direct the Respondent to hand 7 of 20 over shares to the Claimants. \nPrayers (b) to (d) are in alternative to prayer (a). b. Direct the Respondent not to act in violation of the terms of Article 9.1 of the Shareholders Agreement dated 24.03.2014;\nc. Direct the Respondent not to act in violation of the terms of Article 14.1 of the Shareholders Agreement dated 24.03.2014;\nd. Direct the Respondent not to act in violation of the terms of Article 14.2 of the Shareholders Agreement dated 24.03.2014;\ne. Restrain the Respondent from acting in any manner, which adversely affects interest of the Claimant Nos.1, 2 and 3;\nf. Restrain the Respondent from helping ROI Net Solution Pvt. Ltd. having its Registered Office at House No.15, (Old-6) Kh. No.272/237 GF Gali No 2, Block A-2, Himgiri Enclave, Village Makandpur Burari, New Delhi-110084, in any manner;\ng. Restrain the Respondent from accepting or acting on any position in ROINET Solutions Pvt. Ltd. having its Registered Office at House No 15. (Old -6) Kh.

Direct the Respondent to immediately stop instigating the threatening calls to the current employees of the Claimant No.1. Also direct the Respondent to instruct his associates to refrain from making such calls to the employees of the Claimant 8 of 20 No.1;\ni. Restrain the Respondent from instigating Channel partners and CSPS of the Claimant No.1 from making abusive and threatening calls at odd hours to the Claimant No.2.

Direct the Respondent to unconditionally surrender his 6% shareholding which is part of the Employee Stock Option pool;\nn. Any other or further relief, as this Hon'ble Tribunal may deem fit, may be passed in favour of the Claimants and against the Respondent.\" \n[9]. The respondent set up his case before the arbitral Tribunal on various grounds and also set up counter claims before the Tribunal to the following effect:-\n\"1. An amount of Rs.1,35,73,667/- towards pending dues during his tenure as Chief Executive Officer of FIA Technologies together with interest @ 18% p.a. for the entire period of delay and default.\n2. An amount of Rs.1 crore towards loss of livelihood for the period November 2014 till October 9 of 20 2015 together with interest @ 18% p.a. from the date of filing of the Claim till the date of receipt of the payment from FIA technology.\n3. An amount of Rs.5 crore together with interest @ 18% p.a. from Claimant no.1, Claimant 2 and Claimant no.3 towards loss of reputation, goodwill, mental agony and harassment caused by them.\n4. Claim for pendent-lite and future interest at the @ 18% per annum on the claim amounts. \n5. Costs of the Arbitral proceedings.\n6. Declare the dilution of shares, if any, as illegal, that has taken place de hors the Shareholder Agreement.\" \n[10]. The respondent has also alleged that the respondent and claimant No.2 were contemporaries at MIT, USA where they were studying for the MBA. There they were working on a project regarding use of technologies in eradicating the challenges of financial inclusion globally. Both decided to roll this project in India after completion of the MBA. The respondent came to India in July, 2011 and started getting in touch with the Banks to evaluate the potential of such a project. Claimant No.2 on the basis of the feedback given by the respondent decided to explore the investment sources for the company. She received assurance of the funding from one of her friends in USA i.e. claimant No.3. However, no funding was received by the claimant-Company from claimant No.3. On 10 of 20 27.03.2012, the respondent with his wife Reema Mathur incorporated claimant-Company under the Companies Act. In September, 2012, the claimant-Company acquired its first contract with the State Bank of India. The field operations were started in the month of November, 2012. The respondent had served in various firms and some of the employees in those firms contacted the respondent for career opportunity in the claimant-Company. The high potential individuals were inducted in the claimant-Company. The respondent's experience of Indian market was of 18 years and the claimant-Company was able to develop a partner base of 120 distributors and 4000 plus retail point Districts in 25 States nationally. The respondent has alleged various grounds in his defence, besides setting up a counter claim to his credit. He has also taken a stand regarding ROINET Solutions and Traverses of the respondent in reply to the amended SOC. \n[11]. Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent by referring to Clauses 9.1 and 9.2 of the Shareholders Agreement dated 24.03.2014 submitted that the aforesaid clauses do not contain non-competitive clause. \n[12]. This Court while passing the order dated 12.10.2022 in CR No.4003 of 2022 has also noted the contentions of the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that the interim award 11 of 20 in respect of determination of issues decided vide the interim award has attained finality, for which, the respondent has already filed objections under Section 34 of the Act. Only issue of valuation has to be decided by the arbitral Tribunal and the impugned order dated 21.10.2022 is in utter disregard to the mandatory provisions of Section 36(2) and Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. This Court while parting with the order, directed the Additional District Judge-cum- Presiding Judge, Exclusive Commercial Court at Gurugram to decide the application under Section 36 of the Act finally in accordance with law. The order was passed on the basis of consensus arrived at between the parties that the application under Section 36 of the Act shall be decided on the date fixed or soon thereafter. While passing the order, this Court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case and the application under Section 36 of the Act was to be decided by the Additional District Judge-cum-Presiding Judge without being influenced by any statement of fact recorded in the order dated 12.10.2022. \n[13]. Perusal of the impugned order would show that the Court while passing the order has observed that the petition under Section 34 of the Act is required to be decided on merits on various grounds of challenge made by the respondent. If stay 12 of 20 granted on 15.09.2021 is vacated, the arbitral Tribunal will proceed to pass award upon undertaking exercise of valuation of shares and resultantly, the petition under Section 34 of the Act shall be rendered infructuous. In a way, the Court has observed that the decision of the petition under Section 34 of Act is intrinsically mixed up with the issue of valuation and it would be imperative to look into the legality of the impugned award and there shall be stay against the operation of the interim award dated 12.06.2021 till decision of the objection petition under Section 34 of the Act. \n[14]. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners submitted that the impugned order has been passed in utter disregard to the provisions of Section 36(2)(3) of the Act. The filing of objection petition under Section 34 of the Act shall not by itself render that award unenforceable, unless the Court grants an order of the operation of the stay of the arbitral award in accordance with the provisions of sub Section 3 on a separate application made for that purpose. In the event of filing such an application under sub Section 2 of the Act for stay of operation of the arbitral award, the Court may subject to such conditions as it may deem feet, grant stay for operation of such award for the reasons to be recorded in writing. For grant of stay in the case of an arbitral award for payment of money, the Court is to 13 of 20 have due regard to the provisions for grant of stay in a money decree under the provisions of the CPC. The power under sub Section 36(3) of the Act to grant stay of an award is coupled with the duty to impose conditions which could include the condition of securing the award by deposit in Court, of the amount of the award. However, the Court may not impose condition for stay, if it deems appropriate not to do so. The power of Court to grant unconditional stay of an award is not unfettered, however, the same is subject to the condition in the second proviso i.e. the Court is satisfied that a prima facie case is made out that- (i) the arbitration agreement or contract which is the basis of the award; or (ii) the making of the award, was induced or effected by fraud or corruption. [15]. Once an application under Section 36(2) of the Act is filed for stay of operation of the arbitral award, the Court may subject to such conditions as it may deem fit, grant stay of the operation of such award, for reasons to be recorded in writing. The Court is empowered to impose such conditions as it might deem fit and may grant stay of operation of the award subject to furnishing of security covering entire amount of the award including interest. The proviso to Section 36(3) of the Act makes it clear that while considering an application for grant of stay in the case of an arbitral award for payment of money, due regard 14 of 20 to be given to the provisions for grant of stay of a money decree under the provisions of the CPC. The proviso to Section 36(3) of the Act further stipulates that where the Court is satisfied that a prima facie case is made out that (a) the arbitration agreement or contract which is the basis of the award or, (b) the making of the award was induced or effected by fraud or corruption, it shall stay the award unconditionally pending disposal of the challenge under Section 34 of the Award. \n[16]. On the strength of Pam Developments Private Limited Vs. State of West Bengal, (2019) 8 SCC 112, Sepco Electric Power Construction Corporation Vs. Power Mech Projects Ltd., 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1243 and Board of Control for Cricket in India Vs. Kochi Cricket Private Limited and others, (2018) 6 SCC 287, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners submitted that a differential treatment to the Government in certain cases may not be so applicable while considering a case against the Government under the Arbitration Act. There is no requirement under the Arbitration Act for a notice to be given to the Government before invoking arbitration proceeding against the Government. Similarly, Section 36 of the Act does not provide for any special treatment to the Government while dealing with the grant of stay in an application under proceedings of Section 34 of the Act. Section 15 of 20 26 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 postulates that nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced, in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the Principal Act, before the commencement of this Act unless the parties otherwise agree but this Act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of this Act. Bare reading of Section 26 of the (Amendment) Act, 2015 would make it clear that if in all cases where petition under Section 34 of the Act is filed after the commencement of the Amendment Act and an application for stay having been made under Section 36 of the Act therein, will be governed by Section 34 of the Act as amended and Section 36 of the Act as substituted. But if the petition under Section 34 of the Act is filed before commencement of Amendment Act, then the meaning attached to Section 26 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 would have the meaning as held in BCCI's case (supra) and Civil Appeal No.3972 of 2019 (arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.1550 of 2018) titled Bharat Broadband Network Limited Vs. United Telecoms Limited decided on 16.04.2019. \n[17]. On the strength of the aforesaid precedents, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners submitted that the impugned 16 of 20 order is totally non-speaking and is liable to be set aside. [18]. Per contra, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent with reference to the stand of the respondent submitted that the conduct of the petitioner even after passing of the order dated 12.10.2022 can be deprecated. The case was fixed for 14.10.2022 before the Additional District Judge-cum- Presiding Judge, Exclusive Commercial Court at Gurugram for arguments. The copy of order dated 12.10.2022 passed by this Court was placed before the Court. Learned counsel for the respondent was ready to argue the petition under Section 34 of the Act and he made a prayer for hearing the arguments on the main petition under Section 34 of the Act itself. However, learned counsel for the present petitioners submitted that the arguments on the application under Section 36 of the Act will not take much time and therefore, in compliance of the order of the High Court, arguments on the said application be heard. The case was adjourned to 17.10.2022 for arguments and it was observed that the counsel for the parties may if desire address arguments on the main petition under Section 34 of the Act, which will also cover the points concerning Section 36 of the Act. \n[19]. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the petitioners were not interested in arguing the main petition and 17 of 20 ultimately vide the impugned order dated 21.10.2022, the application under Section 36 of the Act was allowed and the case was fixed for arguments on the main petition. During course of arguments, learned counsel for the respondent showed willingness of the respondent to address arguments on the main petition on any date to be fixed by this Court. Learned Senior Counsel has also raised objection as regards the maintainability of the present revision petition on the strength of Section 8 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 and State of Gujarat Vs. Union of India in R/Special Civil Application No.737 of 2018 decided on 07.05.2018, M/s Harpreet Singh Chhabra and Four others Vs. Mrs. Suneet Kaur Sahney and Eight others, 2019(1) ArbiLR 127, Surya Dev Rai Vs. Ram Chander Rai and others, 2003(6) SCC 675, Black Diamond Trackparst Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Black Diamond Motors Pvt. Ltd., 2021(87) PTC 480, Delhi High Court and Pari Agro Exports Vs. Soufflet Alimentaire and another, (2020) 4 RCR (Civil) 377.\n[ 20 ] . After considering the rival submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties, I find that the impugned order has not been passed in compliance of law laid down in Sepco Electric Power Construction Corporation case (supra). Vide 18 of 20 Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act No.3 of 2021 in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, in Section 36, in sub Section (3), after the proviso, the following provisions have been added w.e.f. 23.10.2015:-\n\"Provided further that where the Court is satisfied that a prima facie case is made out that- (a) the arbitration agreement or contract which is the basis of the award; or (b) the making of the award, was induced or effected by fraud or corruption, it shall stay the award unconditionally pending disposal of the challenge under Section 34 of the Award.\" \n[21]. Perusal of the impugned order would show that the same is wanting on legal parameters and the same is not even in consonance with the order passed by this Court on 12.10.2022 in CR No.4003 of 2022.\n[22]. In view of facts and attending circumstances of the case, I deem it appropriate to set aside the impugned order dated 21.10.2022 and directed the Additional District Judge- cum-Presiding Judge, Exclusive Commercial Court at Gurugram to revisit the issue and pass appropriate order in accordance with law. However, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent has also pointed out number of interlocutory orders to indicate 19 of 20 that the Court was also inclined to hear the main arguments under Section 34 of the Act and the petitioners have not come forward to address arguments despite number of adjournments. [23]. In view of the aforesaid, the Additional District Judge- cum-Presiding Judge, Exclusive Commercial Court at Gurugram would also be at liberty to fix some date for arguments in the main petition under Section 34 of the Act and decide the same at the earliest after deciding the application under Section 36(2) of the Act. \n[24].

(2) whether the revision/reduction of rates by the respondent is illegal and unsustainable ? (3) whether the slabs fixed for the transactions have to be proportionately increased with the increase in the number of centers ? (4) whether the claimants are entitled to all or any of the reliefs claimed ? 6. on considering the oral and documentary evidence, the learned arbitrator passed a preliminary award holding the issue nos.1 and 3 against the claimants and issue nos.2 and 4 in favour of claimants. 7. in brief, the findings of arbitrator in his preliminary award are as under: pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch issue no.1: \"accordingly, i hold on issue no.1 that the effective dates as determined by the respondent in proceedings dated 01.10.2007 are in accordance with the terms of the contract agreements and they are correct. it, therefore, follows that the contract period of all the claimants have already expired long ago and the respondent is at liberty to finalize the arrangements for further contracts. the interim order granted earlier for maintaining status quo is discharged.\" issue no.2: \"i hold on issue no.2 that the claimants are entitled to be paid at the contract rates for all categories of transactions till 01.03.2008 and thereafter at the revised rates for the entire period for which the claimants rendered service. however, with regard to electricity bills, in view of the orders passed by the government in g.o.rt.no.205, dated 30.06.2009, i am of the view that it is just and proper to direct payment at the rate of 5/per transaction to the claimants from 01.03.2008 onwards.\" issue no.3: \"arbitrator held that in the absence of a specific provision in the agreement and in the absence of mutual agreement between the parties only the transaction slab as indicated in the agreement alone to be binding.\" pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch issue no.4: \"for determining the differential amounts if any, to which the claimants are legitimately entitled in the light of findings recorded above, both parties are directed to file calculation memos with full details within four weeks from today.\" 8. learned arbitrator has also awarded interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date on which amount was due till date of payment. 9. against the preliminary award of the arbitrator on issues 2 and 4, mee-seva preferred o.p.no.1122 of 2012 under section 34 of the act, 1996 in the civil court, later transferred to commercial court and renumbered as c.o.p.no.124 of 2016. 10. the learned arbitrator passed two separate final awards quantifying the amount by transco and directing to determine bsnl transaction amounts due and to pay the dues with interest at 12% per annum from the due date till the date of payment. 11. against the final award of the arbitrator, mee-seva preferred o.p.no.1121 of 2012 under section 34 of the act, 1996 before civil court, later transferred to the commercial court and renumbered as c.o.p.no.119 of 2016. 12. on issue no.2, the commercial court held that arbitrator erred in applying revision of rates at 5/per transaction w.e.f. 01.03.2008. pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch it amounted to applying the revision retrospectively, whereas government order dated 30.06.2009 was prospective only. the commercial court accordingly modified the decision of the arbitrator. on issue no.4, the commercial court modified the rate of interest from 12% per annum to 6% per annum. 13. this triggered the present batch of appeals by the claimants, the mee-seva of state of telangana and mee-seva of the state of andhra pradesh. 14. learned counsel for claimants made following submissions: (a) the remedy under section 34 is not an appeal against the award. parameters to consider the award are limited to the aspects provided in section 34. the court in exercise of jurisdiction under section 34 can either affirm or set aside the award, but has no competence to modify the award; (b) the commercial court erred in holding the entitlement to levy 5/per transaction as prospective from the date of issue of g.o.rt.no.205, dated 30.06.2009; (c) the commercial court grossly erred in reducing the rate of interest from 12% to 6% per annum; (d) according to learned counsel, the award of learned arbitrator commends acceptance in toto. pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch 15. learned special counsel for state of andhra pradesh sri goverdhan reddy submitted as under: (a) he would submit that the g.o.rt.no.205 dt.30.06.2009 has no application to the existing contractors. it is applicable to fresh contracts. on electricity bills conclusions recorded by the learned arbitrator are contrary to his findings on issue no.2. as can be seen from paragraphs 8 and 9 of the preliminary award, all findings are in favour of mee-seva. thus, the conclusion of arbitrator is perverse; (b) he would submit that there cannot be two awards in the same arbitral proceedings, more so, like preliminary award and final award. as can be seen from section 32 of the act, once an award is passed by the arbitrator, he becomes functus officio and he is no more competent to deal with any aspect of a dispute inter-parties; (c) he would further submit that against preliminary award, o.ps., were filed. as per section 34 of the act as it stood at the relevant point of time, once o.ps are filed, it is a deemed stay and, therefore, the arbitrator could not have passed final award after institution of o.ps. though the fact of filing o.ps., was informed to the learned arbitrator, he passed final award. it is a patently illegal course adopted by the arbitrator. (d) according to learned counsel, article 3.1 of the contract specifies the rates per transaction. according to article 3.2.1 the rates pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch specified are liable to be reviewed at the end of three years which may lead to reduction of transaction cost on due review on various parameters set out therein. the letter dated 31.03.2007 shows that the technology partners consented to collect 2/per transaction instead of 5/from 01.04.2007. however, later the issue was reviewed and 5/per transaction was continued upto 01.03.2008; (e) he would submit that the term of contract with technology partners came to an end between the years 2008 to 2009 on various dates respectively. that being so, by way of interim order, the learned arbitrator extended the contract. such course adopted by the arbitrator is in excess of jurisdiction. by virtue of interim order, the contract continued far beyond the period envisaged in the contract; (f) learned counsel fairly submits that in an application under section 34, commercial court cannot modify the award. however, as the award is vitiated on several counts, having regard to the findings arrived at, the commercial court ought to have remanded to the arbitrator for passing fresh award. 16. learned government pleader for arbitration state of telangana submitted that entire arbitration proceedings are vitiated on several counts as submitted by the learned special counsel for government of andhra pradesh. pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch 17. in reply, learned counsel for claimants submitted that in a section 34 application re-appreciation of evidence is not permissible. learned counsel justified passing two awards. according to learned counsel, at the stage of passing award in the first instance the calculations of amounts due were not submitted by parties. therefore, learned arbitrator directed the parties to submit actual amounts due and on receiving the details, he passed final award. it is within the competence of the arbitrator to make assessment of amounts due to the claimants and to award interest. therefore, merely because the award was split and two separate awards are passed do not vitiate the awards on that ground. 18. having regard to the issue involved in these cases, all the counsel have submitted that in the event of the court holding that the matter should go back to the stage of commencement of arbitral proceedings, a new arbitrator may be appointed. 19. following issues arise for consideration: (1) whether the arbitrator is competent to pass preliminary award and final award ? (2) whether in applications filed under section 34, can the commercial court modify the awards of the arbitrator ? (3) whether the findings recorded and conclusions arrived at by the arbitrator on issues 2 and 4 are legal and valid ? (4) what relief ? pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch issue no.1: 20. to consider this issue, it is necessary to look into the definition of 'arbitral award' and the provisions in sections 171, 322, and 333 of the act, 1996. section 2(1)(c)4 has not specifically defined what is meant to be an arbitral award but holds that 'arbitral award' includes interim award. interim award is referable to section 17. section 17 vests power in the arbitrator to pass orders as interim measures pending conclusion of arbitral proceedings in various aspects mentioned in section 17. section 32 deals with termination of s.17. interim measures ordered by arbitral tribunal.-(1) a party may, during the arbitral proceedings apply to the arbitral tribunal-(i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely: -(a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement; (b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration; (c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken, or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence; (d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver; (e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the arbitral tribunal to be just and convenient, and the arbitral tribunal shall have the same power for making orders, as the court has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it. (2) subject to any orders passed in an appeal under section 37, any order issued by the arbitral tribunal under this section shall be deemed to be an order of the court for all purposes and shall be enforceable under the code of civil procedure,1908 (5 of 1908), in the same manner as if it were an order of the court. s.32. termination of proceedings.--(1) the arbitral proceedings shall be terminated by the final arbitral award or by an order of the arbitral tribunal under sub-section (2). (2) the arbitral tribunal shall issue an order for the termination of the arbitral proceedings where -(a) the claimant withdraws his claim, unless the respondent objects to the order and the arbitral tribunal recognizes a legitimate interest on his part in obtaining a final settlement of the dispute, (b) the parties agree on the termination of the proceedings, or (c) the arbitral tribunal finds that the continuation of the proceedings has for any other reason become unnecessary or impossible. (3) subject to section 33 and sub-section (4) of section 34, the mandate of the arbitral tribunal shall terminate with the termination of the arbitral proceedings. s.33. correction and interpretation of award; additional award.--(1) within thirty days from the receipt of the arbitral award, unless another period of time has been agreed upon by the parties-(a) a party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to correct any computation errors, any clerical or typographical errors or any other errors of a similar nature occurring in the award; (b) if so agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to give an interpretation of a specific point or part of the award. (2) if the arbitral tribunal considers the request made under sub-section (1) to be justified, it shall make the correction or give the interpretation within thirty days from the receipt of the request and the interpretation shall form part of the arbitral award. (3) the arbitral tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1), on its own initiative, within thirty days from the date of the arbitral award. (4) unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party with notice to the other party, may request, within thirty days from the receipt of the arbitral award, the arbitral tribunal to make an additional arbitral award as to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the arbitral award. (5) if the arbitral tribunal considers the request made under sub-section (4) to be justified, it shall make the additional arbitral award within sixty days from the receipt of such request. (6) the arbitral tribunal may extend, if necessary, the period of time within which it shall make a correction, give an interpretation or make an additional arbitral award under sub-section (2) or sub-section (5). (7) section 31 shall apply to a correction or interpretation of the arbitral award or to an additional arbitral award made under this section. s.2. definitions:(1) in this part, unless the context otherwise requires,(a)&(b) xxx (c) 'arbitral award' includes an interim award; pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch proceedings. according to this section, the arbitral proceedings should be terminated by the final arbitral award or by an order of the arbitral tribunal under sub-section (2). this section does not envisage passing of more than one award and passing of preliminary award and final award, unlike civil court passing preliminary decree and final decree in a suit. 21. section 33 deals with 'correction' and 'interpretation of award'. according to this provision, within 30 days from the date of receipt of arbitral award, a party can request the arbitral tribunal to correct any computation errors, any clerical or typographical errors or other errors of similar nature occurring in the award. the provision also enables a party to request the arbitrator 'to give an interpretation' of a specific point or part of the award. if the arbitral tribunal accepts the request made under sub-section (1), it should make corrections or to give interpretation. the arbitral tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1) on its own initiative. interpretation or correction made shall form part of the arbitral award. 22. it is permissible to pass such additional award, party to the dispute may make a request within 30 days of the award to pass additional arbitral award. however, both parties should agree for such a course, and it should be confined to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings, but omitted from arbitral award. if the arbitral tribunal agrees with such application, it can pass additional arbitral award. from the provision of the act, the scheme is very clear that it does not pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch envisage passing of preliminary award and final award and it is apparent that only one award can be passed by the arbitrator. an additional arbitral award can be passed only in case where claim presented in the arbitral proceedings was omitted from the arbitral award. 23. from the reading of sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 33, it is also apparent that the arbitrator should resort to computation of entitlement before the award is passed and include in the award. if there are any errors in computation, a party to the dispute can file an application and on filing such application, if errors are noticed the errors can be corrected. the arbitrator can suo-motu correct any clerical errors, but nothing more. the scheme also makes it clear that once an award is passed by the arbitrator, he becomes functus officio except in the contingencies mentioned in section 33 noted above. that being so, splitting the award and passing preliminary and final awards by the arbitrator is vitiated on this ground. issue no.2: 24. section 345 vests right in a party to a dispute to challenge the award passed by the arbitrator before the civil court or before the s.34. application for setting aside arbitral award.--(1) recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3). (2) an arbitral award may be set aside by the court only if-(a) the party making the application establishes on the basis of the record of the arbitral tribunal that-(i) a party was under some incapacity, or (ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or (iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration: provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch commercial court. the civil court/commercial court can either allow the application setting aside the award or dismiss the application or set aside the award and remand it to the arbitrator for fresh consideration, but cannot alter or modify the award passed by the arbitrator. 25.1. in the project director, national highways nos.45e and 220, national highways authority of india vs. m.hakeem and others6, the hon'ble supreme court held as under: \"16. what is important to note is that, far from section 34 being in the nature of an appellate provision, it provides only for setting aside awards on very limited grounds, such grounds being contained in sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 34. secondly, as the marginal note of section 34 indicates, \"recourse\" to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-sections (2) and (3). \"recourse\" is defined by p. ramanatha aiyar's advanced law lexicon (3rd edn.) as the enforcement or method of enforcing a right. where the right is itself truncated, enforcement of such truncated right can also be only limited in nature. what is clear from a reading of the said provisions is that, given the limited grounds of challenge under sub-sections (2) and (3), an application can only be made to set aside an award. this becomes even clearer when we see sub-section (4) under which, on receipt of an application under sub-section (1) of section 34, the court may adjourn the section 34 proceedings and give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or take such action as will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. here again, it is important to note that it is the opinion of the arbitral tribunal which counts in order to eliminate the grounds for setting aside the award, which may be indicated by the court hearing the section 34 application. xxx contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or (v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this part from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this part; or (b) the court finds that-(i) the subjectmatter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force, or (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of india. explanation 1.--for the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the public policy of india, only if,-(i) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81; or (ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law; or (iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice. explanation 2. --for the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute. (2a) an arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the court, if the court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the award: provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence. (3) an application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal: provided that if the court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter. (4) on receipt of an application under sub-section (1), the court may, where it is appropriate and it is so requested by a party, adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of arbitral tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. (5) an application under this section shall be filed by a party only after issuing a prior notice to the other party and such application shall be accompanied by an affidavit by the applicant endorsing compliance with the said requirement. (6) an application under this section shall be disposed of expeditiously, and in any event, within a period of one year from the date on which the notice referred to in sub-section (5) is served upon the other party. (2021) 9 scc 1 pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch 42. it can therefore be said that this question has now been settled finally by at least 3 decisions [mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181] , [kinnari mullick v. ghanshyam das damani, (2018) 11 scc 328 : (2018) 5 scc (civ) 106] , [dakshin haryana bijli vitran nigam ltd. v. navigant technologies (p) ltd., (2021) 7 scc 657] of this court. even otherwise, to state that the judicial trend appears to favour an interpretation that would read into section 34 a power to modify, revise or vary the award would be to ignore the previous law contained in the 1940 act; as also to ignore the fact that the 1996 act was enacted based on the uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration, 1985 which, as has been pointed out in redfern and hunter on international arbitration, makes it clear that, given the limited judicial interference on extremely limited grounds not dealing with the merits of an award, the \"limited remedy\" under section 34 is coterminous with the \"limited right\", namely, either to set aside an award or remand the matter under the circumstances mentioned in section 34 of the arbitration act, 1996. xxxx 48. quite obviously if one were to include the power to modify an award in section 34, one would be crossing the lakshman rekha and doing what, according to the justice of a case, ought to be done. in interpreting a statutory provision, a judge must put himself in the shoes of parliament and then ask whether parliament intended this result. parliament very clearly intended that no power of modification of an award exists in section 34 of the arbitration act, 1996. it is only for parliament to amend the aforesaid provision in the light of the experience of the courts in the working of the arbitration act, 1996, and bring it in line with other legislations the world over.\" 25.2. the division bench of this court in ragya bee and others vs. p.s.r. constructions and others7, held as under: \"22. the scope of power of civil court under section 34 is no more res-integra, in view of the decision of hon'ble supreme court in mcdermott international inc vs burn standard company limited8. in the said decision and the decisions that followed, the hon'ble supreme court held that in a petition under section 34 of the act, 1996, the court cannot correct errors of arbitrator. it can only quash the award. paragraphs 51 and 52 of mcdermott international inc read as under: \"52. the 1996 act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness. intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. the court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. it can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. so, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it.\" (emphasis supplied) 23. the decision of hon'ble supreme court in m.hakeem (supra) puts the issue beyond pale of doubt. it is affirmation of statement of law that stood the test of times. on review of precedent decisions, hon'ble supreme court held that section 34 of the act, 1996 cannot be held to include within it a power to modify the award. .\" 25.3. in delhi airport metro express pvt. ltd. vs. delhi metro rail corporation ltd., hon'ble court held as under: \"28. this court has in several other judgments interpreted section 34 of the 1996 act to stress on the restraint to be shown by courts while examining the validity of the arbitral awards. the limited grounds available to courts for annulment of arbitral awards are well known to legally trained minds. however, the difficulty arises in applying the wellestablished principles for interference to the facts of each case that come up before the 2022 (3) ald 151 (2006) 11 scc 181 (2022) 1 scc 131 pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch courts. there is a disturbing tendency of courts setting aside arbitral awards, after dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases to come to a conclusion that the award needs intervention and thereafter, dubbing the award to be vitiated by either perversity or patent illegality, apart from the other grounds available for annulment of the award. this approach would lead to corrosion of the object of the 1996 act and the endeavours made to preserve this object, which is minimal judicial interference with arbitral awards. that apart, several judicial pronouncements of this court would become a dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by categorizing them as perverse or patently illegal without appreciating the contours of the said expressions. 29. patent illegality should be illegality which goes to the root of the matter. in other words, every error of law committed by the arbitral tribunal would not fall within the expression \"patent illegality\". likewise, erroneous application of law cannot be categorised as patent illegality. in addition, contravention of law not linked to public policy or public interest is beyond the scope of the expression \"patent illegality\". what is prohibited is for courts to reappreciate evidence to conclude that the award suffers from patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, as courts do not sit in appeal against the arbitral award. the permissible grounds for interference with a domestic award under section 34(2-a) on the ground of patent illegality is when the arbitrator takes a view which is not even a possible one, or interprets a clause in the contract in such a manner which no fair-minded or reasonable person would, or if the arbitrator commits an error of jurisdiction by wandering outside the contract and dealing with matters not allotted to them. an arbitral award stating no reasons for its findings would make itself susceptible to challenge on this account. the conclusions of the arbitrator which are based on no evidence or have been arrived at by ignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. also, consideration of documents which are not supplied to the other party is a facet of perversity falling within the expression \"patent illegality\". \" 26. having regard to the provision in section 34 and the law governing the field, the court below grossly erred in modifying the award. 27. as per then provision in section 34, once application is filed under section 34, it would be amounting to deemed stay against the award passed by the arbitrator. the application under section 34 was filed challenging the preliminary award before the final award was passed by the arbitrator and this fact was informed to the arbitrator. though arbitrator took note of the filing of op, he proceeds to pass final award. the final award passed by the arbitrator is in clear violation of the statutory mandate and, therefore, nonest in the eye of law. pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch 28. in the preliminary award, the arbitrator has not quantified the amounts claimed by the claimants and payable by the respondents. thus, excluding the final award, preliminary award is incomplete. in view of the statutory mandate of section 34 as obtained then, the arbitrator could not have passed final award after op was filed under section 34 of the act challenging the preliminary award. 29. cumulatively, we have noticed that the decision of the arbitrator to split the award into two awards and passing preliminary award and final award is ex facie illegal and in the application filed under section 34 the commercial court modifying the award is without competence and jurisdiction and, therefore, both are vitiated. these aspects go to the root of the matter. in view of the above conclusion arrived at by us, we restrain from deciding the issue no.3 and leave it open. issue no.4. to what relief : 30. as the award of the arbitrator and the decision of the commercial court in application filed under section 34 are not sustainable the comcas are allowed. however, as the dispute requires resolution, we deem it proper to remit the matter to the arbitral tribunal. as both parties are in agreement for referring the matter to a new arbitrator, we are inclined to accept the request of learned counsel to appoint sri justice vilas v.afzulpurkar, retired judge of this court, as sole arbitrator. the parties are directed to place all the pleadings and documents forming part of arbitral pnr,j & dr.grr,j com ca no.33 of 2018 & batch proceedings before the earlier arbitrator with hon'ble sri justice vilas v.afzulpurkar. as the issue is very old, we request hon'ble sri justice vilas v.afzulpurkar to conclude the arbitral proceedings expeditiously, preferably within a period of 16 weeks from the date of submission of all the documents by both parties. the parties are directed to prepare compilation and submit all the documents to the hon'ble sri justice vilas v.afzulpurkar within four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order. it is made clear that there is no expression of opinion on merits. pending miscellaneous petitions if any shall stand closed. _______________________
