JUSTICE N.V.ANJARIA) By preferring the present Appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 1996 read with Section 13 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015, read with Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the appellant seeks to call in question order dated 13th October, 2021 passed by the Commercial Court, Bhuj-Kutch, partially allowing application of respondent herein, under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. \n1.1 As per the impugned order, the Commercial Court directed the appellant herein-original opponent No.1 to deposit in the Court the amount of performance bank guarantees pertaining to Purchase Order Nos.1, 2, and 3 invoked by it. The direction regarding investment of the amount and further direction permitting the arbitral tribunal to pass any further interim measures in respect of the deposit after the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, were also passed. \n2. Before hearing of this First Appeal, the parties filed the relevant pleadings and documents on record, about the contents of which they were ad idem. In that light and in view of learned advocates for both the sides stating that the pleadings were complete and no further pleadings were to be added or supplemented, and that they argued the appeal finally, with consent and request of the parties, the appeal was accordingly heard finally. \n3. Shorn off unnecessary details, the relevant C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 facts involved in the dispute are inter alia that respondent herein is a company engaged in manufacturing of domestic power cables. The appellant company awarded the contract through the tender process to the respondent. The contract work was in the nature of providing complete design, engineering, manufacturing, testing, supply, supervision of erection and commissioning of power cables approximately 478 km. long in the project. \n3.1 Seven Purchase Orders came to be issued under the contract. The details of these Purchase Orders are-(i) PO No.SIL/PROJ/PO/1419000195, dated 0rd July, 2019; (ii) PO No.SIL/PROJ/PO/1419000198, dated 03rd July, 2019; (iii) PO No.SIL/PROJ/PO/1419000201, dated 03rd July, 2019; (iv) PO No.SIL/PROJ/PO/1419000571 (CPPII) & 1419000572 (Grinding Unit), dated 25th November, 2019; (v) PO No.SIL/PROJ/PO/1419000571 (CPPII) & 1419000572 (Grinding Unit), dated 25th November, 2019; (vi) PO No.SIL/PROJ/PO/1419000733, dated 24th January, 2020 and (vii) PO No.SIL/PROJ/PO/1419000732, dated 24th January, 2020. Out of the said seven Purchase Orders, for the subject matter dispute, the Purchase Orders sanctioned at (i), (ii) and (iii) above stand relevant. \n3.1.1 In each of the three Purchase Orders which are subject matter herein, Clause 4 dealing with terms of payment is identically worded, reading thus. \nC/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 \"04. Payment Terms 1. 10% of basis contract value shall be released as an advance against furnishing of order acceptance & Advance Bank Guarantee valid till completion of supply with one month period for any claim of equivalent amount. \n2. 80% contract value with 100% GST shall be released 30 days from the date of receipt of materials at site along with submission of original dispatch documents. \n3. 10% contract value shall be released after commissioning against submission of original performance bank guarantee (which shall be valid for 12 months from the date of commissioning or 18 months from the date of last supply whichever is earlier) or 60 days from the date of receipt of Last Consignment at site whichever is earlier.\" \n3.1.2 The respondent agreed to provide performance bank guarantees as stipulated under the terms of contract, upon the appellant releasing the last tranche of 10% of payment to the respondent commissioning the work. The three performance bank guarantees in connection with three Purchase Orders were given-(i) bearing No.03007BGK20000036 dated 20th February, 2020 for Rs.52,81,445/-, (ii) bearing No.03007BGK20000009 dated 30th January, 2020 for Rs.21,05,395/- and (iii) bearing No.03007BGK20000053 dated 17th March, 2020 for Rs.05,72,150/-, respectively. The three bank guarantees were totaling Rs.79,58,990/-. \n3.1.3 Under the aforementioned Purchase Orders, material worth Rs.13,10,30,559.52 was supplied. The payment to the tune of Rs.11,80,07,653.63 was made by the appellant. The balance outstanding of Rs.01,30,22,906/- has not been paid by the appellant. The non-payment of the said amount was on account of C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 the dispute between the parties about the quality of the cables supplied. \n3.2 According to the case of the appellant herein, upon commissioning of cables, power failure occurred on 10th April, 2021 at the generation plant of the appellant and that it was due to inferior quality of the cables. The request of the appellant to remedy the situation, it was stated, was not attended to by the respondent and respondent did not visit the site. It is the case that appellant had to incur huge loss to the tune of more than Rs.21.00 crores. Reminder letters to the respondent failed to receive any response. \n3.3 On the other hand, as per the respondent's case, the appellant was required to make payment of Rs.01,30,22,906/- simultaneously as per the payment terms in clause 4. The said outstanding amount was demanded by addressing emails dated 26th March, 2020, 25th May, 2020, 26th May, 2020 and 05th June, 2020, but in vain. It is stated that as per email dated 06 th June, 2020, the Director of the appellant company at last admitted that they were committed to fulfill the payment obligation. It is the case of the respondent that no dispute was raised at that juncture about the quality of the cables and even in correspondence afterwards. \n3.3.1 It is the case of the respondent that further emails were exchanged as the payment was not forthcoming. In email dated 21st July, 2020 issued by C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 Assistant Manager (Sales) of the appellant company, liability of payment was again accepted and it was further requested that the respondent should continue to supply the cables as per the Purchase Orders. As per the case of the respondent, at that time non- payment of the amount was justified on the ground of currency of pandemic and financial set back. \n3.3.2 It was stated that despite outstanding amount becoming Rs.01.50 crores, appellant had released payment of Rs.09.21 lakhs only. Telephonic conversation of the representatives of the parties recorded in email dated 23rd November, 2020 wherein, submits the respondent, the appellant agreed to make balance of payment in the first week of December, 2020. \n3.3.3 It is the say of the respondent that in further email exchanged, the appellant again stated that payment will be cleared and schedule of payment will be given, but schedule of payment was not provided, much less the payment made. The commitment was not honoured and the conduct of the appellant was evasive, stated the respondent herein. A notice dated 13th July, 2021 was required to be issued by the respondent on account of non-response on behalf of the appellant asking the appellant to make payment of the outstanding amount, failing which, it was stated, that the proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code would be initiated. \n3.3.4 It is the further case of the respondent C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 that in a reactionary step, the appellant invoked all seven performance bank guarantees without any prior intimation by letter dated 21st July, 2021. The proceedings under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act came to be filed by the respondent in the Bhuj Commercial Court in respect of three bank guarantees in question and for the remaining bank guarantees, before the Commercial Court at Ahmedabad. \n3.4 The dispute about the quality of cables supplied by the respondent has the origin in the say of the appellant that on 10th April, 2021 when the cables were commissioned, there was power failure at the generation plant. Notice dated 11th June, 2021 was issued by the appellant claiming quality dispute in respect of the cables. It is stated by the respondent that it replied the said letter by communication dated 19th June, 2021 elaborated denying all allegations about inferior quality of cables. It was further stated that an inspection report of M/s.Bureau Veritas had confirmed that cables were free from any manufacturing defect. By letter dated 13th July, 2021, as sated above, respondent demanded outstanding dues of Rs.01,30,22,906/- and thereafter the appellant proceeded to invoke the bank guarantees in respect of all Purchase Orders. \n3.5 The arbitration clause was contained in Article 15 is similarly worded in all Purchase Orders. On 22nd July, 2021 appellant issued notice invoking arbitration for adjudication of disputes including about the loss claimed to have been C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 suffered. As the performance bank guarantees were invoked, respondent filed application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Arbitration Act, 1996'). The application was filed on 23rd July, 2021. \n3.6 By filing application under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, respondent prayed for interim measures seeking following relief. \n(a) Pending commencement of the arbitration proceedings until their conclusion and until enforcement of the arbitral award, the Court may restrain respondent No.1 and its agents, officers etc. from invoking and/or encashing the three bank guarantees, In the alternative, it was prayed, (aa) Court may restrain respondent No.2 Bank, its agents and officers from making payment to respondent No.1-appellant herein under the said bank guarantee,\n(b) Court may direct respondent No.1-appellant herein, its agents and officers, to pay and deposit in the Court the entire amount received from the Bank under the said bank guarantees, Alternatively it was prayed, (bb) The Court may pass order directing respondent No.1-appellant herein, its agents and officers to furnish appropriate security to the C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 applicant or to the Court to secure the entire amount received under the bank guarantees. \n3.7 Partially allowing the application, the Commercial Court passed the following operative directions as interim protective measures. \n\"1. The application is hereby PARTIALLY ALLOWED. \n2. Opponent No.01 SANGHI INDUSTRIES LIMITED hereby directed to deposit the amount of performance Bank Guarantees pertaining to P.O No.01, 02 and 03 invoked and realized from Opponent No.02 Bank, in this Court for ninety days or up to appointment of arbitral tribunal whichever is earlier. \n3. Upon deposit of such amount, Nazir Shri, of this court shall secure the amount in Nationalized Bank for the same period in term deposit in the nationalized Bank having account of this court. \n4. Concern Arbitral Tribunal may order any further interim measures regarding deposit of amount of Performance Bank Guarantee as per the provision of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act after commencement or during the continuance of arbitral proceedings.\"\n4. Assailing the order passed by the Commercial Court and questioning its legality and justification, vehement submissions were raised by learned senior advocate Mr.K.S. Nanavati with learned advocate Mr.Kunal Vyas for Nanavati Associates for the appellant. Taking the Court through the contents of the bank guarantees, it was submitted that the bank guarantees were unconditional and irrevocable under which the Bank had undertaken and guaranteed to pay to the appellant the money without protest or demand. It was submitted relying on the decision in Vinitec Electronics Private Limited v. HCL Infosystems C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 Limited [(2008) 1 SCC 544] that no injunction could be granted against invocation of unconditional bank guarantee except in the cases of fraud or irreparable injury. \n4.1 It was submitted that therefore the appellant was within its right to entitled to invoke the bank guarantees. It was submitted further that the appellant was entitled to invoke the bank guarantees for any loss or damages suffered by it and such encashment had even taken place. It was also submitted that prayer for seeking injunction was rendered infructuous as the bank guarantees were invoked. It was sought to be contended that contract was one though different Purchase Orders were issued and each Purchase Order cannot be treated as separate contract. \n4.1.1 Learned senior advocate by referring to certain averments in the application under Section 9 of the respondent submitted that those averments suggested that the respondent prayed for interim measures from the Court under Section 9(ii)(b) of the Arbitration Act, 1996. It was submitted that the impugned order has been passed on the purported ground that amount is required to be secured. In this regard it was submitted that principles governing Order XXXVIII Rule 5, Code of Civil Procedure are applicable. \n4.1.2 Decision of the Supreme Court in Roman Tech & Process Engg. Co. v. M/s.Solanki Traders [(2008) 2 SCC 302] and other decisions on the point were relied C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 on to submit that the object of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 is to prevent any defendant from defeating the realisation of the decree or award that may be ultimately passed in favour of the plaintiff and further that there should be a reasonable chance of a decree being passed. It was submitted that the power should be exercised sparingly. \n4.1.3 Asserting again that the powers were exercised by the Commercial Court under clause (b) only of Section 9(ii) of the Act, learned senior advocate for the appellant next submitted that there were no averments in the application by the respondent herein that the defendant was defeating or realisation of the possible decree or obstructing the execution of the award in any manner which was essential requirement. According to learned senior advocate, the powers are exercised by the Court under Section 9(ii)(b) for securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration, for which all the aforesaid principles underlying Order XXXVIII Rule 5, CPC were required to be applied. \n4.1.4 Vociferous submissions were made by learned senior advocate for the appellant that in the present case while passing directions under Section 9 as per the impugned order, the Commercial Court has treated the dispute as amount in dispute in arbitration, consequentially the exercise of powers fell under Clause 9(ii)(b). It was contended that amount of bank guarantee is an \"amount in dispute in arbitration\", furthering submission that principles under Order C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 XXXIX Rule 5, CPC are not considered. When the parameters under the said Order have not been satisfied, exercise of powers under Section 9(ii)(b) of the Arbitration Act by the Commercial Court could not be said to be in accordance with law, he submitted. \n4.1.5 It was next submitted on the basis of the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in Essar Oil Limited v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. [2015(3) GLH 28] that since the exercise of powers would be analogous to powers under Order XXXVIII Rule 5, CPC, the criteria would be the conduct of the party that property is likely to be disposed of by the party to defeat the future decree or awards. It was submitted that such situation being absent in the present case, Section 9(ii)(b) of the Act could not have been resorted to by the Commercial Court. \n4.1.6 It was then submitted that in passing the impugned order, the Commercial Court has adverted to Clause 9(i)(d) and/or 9(i)(e) of the Act which is untenable in law, for, the relief could not have been considered except under 9(i)(b) to be guided by the above principles. It was submitted that Section 9(ii)\n(e) is in the nature of residuary and residury powers can be exercised only when the relief does not fall within any of the specific powers available to the Court. Learned senior advocate proceeded to rely on decision in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Roshan Sing [(2008) 2 SCC 488, paras-7 & 8]. \n4.1.7 It was next submitted that the Commercial C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 Court not only erroneously adverted to exercise powers seeking an aid of Section 9(ii)(e), in giving impugned directions, the Court also failed to construe in proper perspective the term \"just and convenient\". This submission was sought to be buttressed by referring to decision of the Orissa High Court in Sanatan Barik v. Purna Chandra Barik [AIR 2003 Orissa 127].\n4.1.8 Learned senior advocate for the appellant relied on decision of the Supreme Court in Arvind Constructions Co. (P) Limited v. Kalinga Mining Corporation [(2007) 6 SCC 798] to submit that the powers under Section 9 are required to be exercised on the lines of well recognised principles applicable to exercise of general power to grant interim injunction under Order XXXIX, CPC and the Specific Relief Act. He also highlighted the proposition from the said decision that when a power is conferred under a specific statute and is conferred on an ordinary court of law, without laying down special conditions for exercise of that power, general rules of procedure would apply. \n4.1.9 Learned senior advocate further submitted that as held in Adhunik Steels Limited v. Orissa Manganese and Minerals Private Limited [(2007) 7 SCC 125], principles analogous to exercise of powers under Order XXXIX, CPC are required to be borne in mind by the courts while exercising powers under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 for passing interim measures. It was sought to be submitted that C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 the said principles have been disregarded and the nature of directions issued in the impugned order do not conform to those principles. Accordingly it was submitted that general rules that govern the court while considering the grant of interim injunction at the threshold are attracted even while dealing with an application under Section 9 of the Act. \n4.2 On the other hand, learned advocate for the respondent raised these submissions- (a) Impugned order is passed under Section 9(ii)\n(d) and 9(ii)(e) of the Act which makes available to the Court ample powers to pass interim injunction and to balance the equities between the parties. Section 9(ii)(e) confers wide discretionary powers to pass interim measures. In the facts of the case, discretion has been rightly exercised. \n(b) Section 9 is similar to Section 94, CPC which is the provision for supplementary proceedings. Clauses (a) to (e) of Section 94, CPC closely resemble the clauses (a) to (e) in Section 9 and that the Court has rightly exercised the analogous powers. \n(c) The order impugned cannot be strictly said to be an order of security but of the nature balancing the equities of the parties, the power having been exercised under Section 9(ii)(e) of the Arbitration Act, 1996. Therefore, the contention that provision of Order XXXVIII Rule 5, CPC have to be applied as guiding principles, has no legal basis; \nC/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 (d) The purported dispute with regard to the quality of cables relates to only one Purchase Order, that is Purchase Order No.2, still however the appellant encashed all the seven bank guarantees under seven Purchase Orders, three of which is subject matter of present proceedings. This is evident from email dated 10th April, 2021 wherein cables mentioned were part of only said single Purchase Order No.2. \n(e) The claim of the appellant that the wires were faulty and it suffered damages to the tune of Rs.21,31,77,628/- is baseless and afterthought. In any case, such unliquidated damages are the claims which are required to be proved before the arbitral tribunal. \n4.3 Learned senior advocate for the respondent also placed reliance on Adhunik Steels Limited (supra) to submit that therein it was opined by the Supreme Court that \"it would not be correct to say that the power under Section 9 of the Act is totally independent of the well known principles governing the grant of an interim injunction that generally govern the courts in this connection.\". Observations of the Supreme Court in Tanushree Basu v. Ishani Prasad Basu [(2008) 4 SCC 791] were pressed into service, \"It is now well-settled principle of law that Order 39 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) is not the sole repository of the power of the court to grant injunction. Section 151 of the Code confers power upon the court to grant injunction if the matter is not covered by Rules 1 and 2 of the C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 Order 39 of the Code.\" (Para 16) 4.3.1 In Adhunik Steels Limited (supra) the Supreme Court had relied on the paragraph from International Commercial Arbitration in UNCITRAL Model Law Jurisdictions by Dr.Peter Binder to be thus highlighting the scope of the phrase \"just and convenient\" which also occur in Section 9(ii)(e).\n\"It is true that Section 9 of the Act speaks of the court by way of an interim measure passing an order for protection, for the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods, which are the subject matter of the arbitration agreement and such interim measure of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient. The grant of an interim prohibitory injunction or an interim mandatory injunction are governed by well known rules and it is difficult to imagine that the legislature while enacting Section 9 of the Act intended to make a provision which was de hors the accepted principles that governed the grant of an interim injunction. Same is the position regarding the appointment of a receiver since the Section itself brings in, the concept of 'just and convenient' while speaking of passing any interim measure of protection. The concluding words of the Section, \"and the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose and in relation to any proceedings before it\" also suggest that the normal rules that govern the court in the grant of interim orders is not sought to be jettisoned by the provision. Moreover, when a party is given a right to approach an ordinary court of the country without providing a special procedure or a special set of rules in that behalf, the ordinary rules followed by that court would govern the exercise of power conferred by the Act. On that basis also, it is not possible to keep out the concept of balance of convenience, prima facie case, irreparable injury and the concept of just and convenient while passing interim measures under Section 9 of the Act.\" (Para 11) 4.3.2 Responding to the submission of the appellant that in passing the impugned order the Commercial Court exercised powers distancing itself from principles underlying Order XXXIX, and de hors C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 the common law principles, decision in Manohar Lal Chopra v. Rai Bahadur Rao Raja Seth Hiralal [AIR 1962 SC 527] was pressed into service by learned senior advocate for the respondent to submit that the Court can issue interim injunction under the circumstances which may not be covered by Order XXXIX, if the Court is of the opinion that interest of justice require issuance of directions of the nature. \n4.4 It transpires that the contract material namely cables, were supplied by the respondent herein to the appellant under seven different Purchase Orders. Seven different performance guarantees were executed in light of condition No.4 of the contract. Admittedly, seven corresponding bank guarantees were sought to be invoked by the appellant of which three bank guarantees are subject matter herein, pursuant to the dispute relating to the quality of cables under one Purchase Order above and all of them have been encashed. The issue raised on behalf of the respondent herein that invoking all bank guarantees was hardly justified, and the said aspect was sought to be countered by the appellant by submitting that whether invocation was cross contractual, cannot be gone into at this stage and would have to be a subject matter of adjudication by the arbitral tribunal and according to appellant it was one composite contract. The description of cables in respect of which inferior quality is alleged which is likely to become a dispute before the arbitral tribunal, however was shown to be covered under one Purchase Order. Be as it may. \nC/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 5. The facts of the case and the dispute emerging therefrom have been attentively noticed by us. The elaborate submissions made by learned counsels for the parties especially on the aspect as to under which clause of Section 9(ii) of the Arbitration Act the powers have been exercised have also been considered by us. \n5.1 Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 providing for interim measures which may be applied by a party before the Court, reads as under. \nSection 9: Interim measures, etc., by Court (1) A party may, before, or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36, apply to a Court- (i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely:-\n(a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement;\n(b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration;\n(c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence;\n(d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver;\n(e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the Court to be just and convenient, and the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it.\n(2) Where, before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, a court passes ... ... ...\n(3) Once the arbitral tribunal has been constituted, the court shall not entertain ... ... ... \n5.2 As we gather the contours of the controversy, it could be viewed that the likely range of disputes to be adjudicated by the arbitral tribunal, for which steps are already made afoot by the parties, would include the entitlement of the appellant to invoke the bank guarantees, the payability of the unpaid amount in the context of condition No.4 of the contract in particular and the dispute between the parties arising under the contract in general in the context of the allegation of the appellant that the cables supplied under one Purchase Order or of inferior quality. Therefore, the amount encashed qua the bank guarantees could be said to be within the corners of arbitration dispute. \n5.3 Noticeably when the Commercial Court took up to decide application under Section 9 of the Act, the situation obtained was that three performance bank guarantees in question were already encashed on 23rd C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 July, 2021. Though application under Section 9 appears to have been filed simultaneously before the date of invocation, when it came for hearing before the Commercial Court on 26th July, 2021, there was no question for the Court to consider to pass restraint order against invocation as the bank guarantees were invoked. The Court therefore adverted to the alternative prayer. The Court directed that the amount of bank guarantees encashed by the appellant shall be deposited in the Court, to be invested in a nationalized bank in fixed deposit, to be further subject to the modification orders which may be considered expedient by the arbitral tribunal which would be constituted for resolution of the disputes of above nature under the contract. \n5.4 The crux consideration in order to judge the legality and justification of the impugned order has to be as to whether the powers under Section 9 are properly exercised and the directions fall within the ambit and object of the provision. Section 9 of the Arbitration Act aims at providing interim protective measures to a party in relation to the arbitration. \n5.5 Though interim measures contemplated in Section 9 are classified in different categories represented by clauses (a) to (e), reading as a whole, and reading with the legislative purpose of the provisions, it is intended to protect the interest of the parties, would be in the arbitration by bringing out a balancing situation. The balancing of rights may be achieved by applying simultaneously C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 one or more sub-clause under Section 9(ii). It is a whole Section which operates for enabling the Court to provide protective measures of the parties to the arbitration. \n5.6 The scope of powers which the Court may exercise under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 could be discerned from several judicial pronouncements, few of which have been referred to hereinabove. Measures contemplated under Section 9 are for \"interim measure of protection\". As held by the Supreme Court in Adhunik Steels Limited (supra) though the provisions and principles of Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2, CPC cannot be said to be applicable stricto sensu, the analogous principles will have to be put into play while exercising powers for granting interim measures and the principles underlying other provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, may have also their own play in passing the order under Section 9 by the Court under various clauses to secure the ultimate purpose of preserving and protecting the rights of the parties, who would seek resolution of their disputes in the arbitral proceedings.\n5.6.1 In granting the protective measures under Section 9 of the Act, in addition to the principles which govern the grant of injunction, also germane would be the other relevant provisions in the Civil Procedure Code such as Section 94 or Section 151. The clauses in Section 9(ii) of the Act, as could be noticed, have similarity with clauses (a) to (e) of C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 Section 94, CPC. There operates conceptual similarity and analogousness in Section 94, CPC and in Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, especially clauses (d) and (e).\n5.6.2 In Manohar Lal Chopra (supra), Supreme Court stated that the Court can issue interim injunction in relation to circumstances which may not be strictly covered under Order XXXIX observing thus, \"... ... ... the Courts have inherent jurisdiction to issue temporary injunctions in circumstances which are not covered by the provisions of Order 39 CPC. There is no such expression in Section 94 which expressly prohibits the issue of a temporary injunction in circumstances not covered by Order 39 or by any rules made under the Code. It is well- settled that the provisions of the Code are not exhaustive for the simple reason that the Legislature is incapable of contemplating all the possible circumstances which may arise in future litigation and consequently for providing the procedure for them. The effect of the expression 'if it is so prescribed' is only this that when the rules prescribe the circumstances in which the temporary injunction can be issued, ordinarily the Court is not to use its inherent powers to make the necessary orders in the interests of justice, but is merely to see whether the circumstances of the case bring it within the prescribed rule. ... ... ...\" \n(Para 18) 5.7 Pausing here, with such comprehension of the provision of Section 9, the reasons supplied by the Commercial Court may be referred to. Partially allowing the application, the Commercial Court recorded as under. \n\".... 10% amount of agreed purchase order has yet not been paid to the applicant by Opponent Co. Additionally aforementioned performance bank guarantees provided by the applicant has also been realized. ... ... ...\" \n5.7.1 Stating about the aspect of balance of C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 convenience, thus was stated. \n\"... ... ... the applicant has till date invested huge a sum and supplied 100% cables as per the specification of purchase orders. That fact has also not been opposed by the respondent. Though there is grievance of opponent Co of inferior quality of cable which caused losses and damages, but till such dispute adjudicated by the arbitral tribunal, meantime amount of performance Bank guarantees required to be secured. Therefore, the balance of convenience is also lies in favor of the applicant and if the applicant is not protected at this stage then applicant would suffer irreparable loss and injury.\" \n5.7.2 The aspect is noticed by the Commercial Court that 10% amount of the agreed Purchase Orders is not paid to the applicant-respondent herein. It is observed that respondent has supplied complete material of cables under the Purchase Orders as per the specifications which is not opposed by the appellant herein. It is reasoned that inferior quality of the cables is a dispute to be adjudicated by the arbitral tribunal and during such time the amount of performance bank guarantee is required to be secured. \n5.7.3 The reasoning supplied by the Commercial Court cannot be excepted for the material aspects it noted. However as it is stated that the \"amount of performance bank guarantees required to be secured\", learned senior advocate for the appellant harped on those words namely \"required to be secured\" and submitted that the Tribunal exercised powers under Section 9(ii)(b) and therefore, the Court could not have invoked Section 9(ii)(e). There is no substance in this submission. \nC/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 5.8 It is true that in a way the entitlement of the amount which would be the subject matter of arbitral dispute is protected, however when the event of invocation of bank guarantees had already occurred and while passing the impugned order, the Court directed the appellant to deposit the encashed amount in the Court and further directed investment of the amount in a fixed deposit in a nationalized bank, to be subjected to further orders which may be passed by the arbitral tribunal which may be constituted, these directions have to be seen basically falling under clause (e) of Section 9(ii).\n5.8.1 In the facts and circumstances of the case obtaining and having regard to the nature of directions issued in the impugned order, the Tribunal exercised powers under Section 9(ii)(e) of the Act. It is possible to view that the directions are 'referable' to clause (b) of Section 9(ii) but in the totality of facts, the impugned directions are traceable in the powers under clause (e). They properly fall under clause (e) of Section 9(ii) of the Act. \n5.8.2 Having regard to the nature of dispute and the developments taken place between the parties, the Court below considered it to be \"just and convenient\"\nto pass the interim measure of the protection of the kind and nature passed. The amount which will be invested is potent to become an amount in dispute in arbitration. A protective direction for such amount can be said to have been passed by the Commercial C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 Court invoking Section 9(ii)(e) of the Act further. \n5.8.3 In Simplex Infrastructures Ltd. v. National Highways Authority of India [2011 SCC Online Del 207] the Delhi High Court succinctly observed that under the erstwhile jural regime, postulated in Section 41 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, the dictates of justice and convenience as conceptualised by the Court was not envisioned. It can be said that in Section 9(ii)\n(e) of the 1996 Act, the Courts are invested with wide powers to do justice in passing the interim exercise which may, in the discretion in the Court, are just and convenient in the facts of the case to bring about equitable position amongst the parties going to arbitration for their disputes. \n5.9 The consideration of equity is a prime consideration, as also in exercise of powers under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2, CPC, while considering the prayer for injunction in a civil suit. As the injunction is equitable relief, the measures which are provided or directed by the Court exercising powers under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act would also be intended to secure equity in relation to the rights of the parties are determined in the arbitration. \n5.9.1 In Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, as noticed above, it is clause (e) of Section 9(ii) cover all measures which are just and convenient to be applied. Ensuring equity between the parties to the arbitration would be a measure, indeed falling C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 within this sub-clause. It is discretionary power confers on the Court while deciding the application under Section 9 to order equitable interim measures. \n5.9.2 The amount of bank guarantees already encashed is directed to be kept separate by way of deposit before the Court to be invested in the Bank. Undoubtedly, it ensures and secures a balance in the to-be-adjudicated rights of the parties in the impending arbitration proceedings. The order could be said to be a judicial discretion exercised in a manner eminently just, proper and legal. \n5.9.3 In the facts and circumstances of the case, the impugned directions are a blend of powers exercised. The order can be said to be a harmony struck between Section 9(ii)(b) and 9(ii)(e) of the Act, although for all purposes, the Commercial Court has invoked Section 9(ii)(e). The order would fundamentally fall within the scope and ambit of clause (e) of Section 9(ii) of the Act. For, essentially, the order is an equitable order ensuring equity between the parties in their lis. It is a prime principle applied under Order XXXIX, CPC while granting injunction that equity is achieved. The analogous powers are exercised by the Court which are entirely justified under Section 9(ii)(e). When equities are balanced, protection of rights is best secured. \n6. When we do not find any material irregularity on part of the Commercial Court in passing the impugned order and the discretion is C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 exercised having due regard to the totality of facts operating, the following observations of the Apex Court in Wonder Limited v. Antox India P. Limited [1990 (supp.) SCC 727] also guide us. \n\"The appeals before the Division Bench were against the exercise of discretion by the Single Judge. In such appeals, the Appellate Court will not interfere with the exercise of discretion of the court of first instance and substitute its own discretion except where the discretion has been shown to have been exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously or perversely or where the court had ignored the settled principles of law regulating grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. An appeal against exercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate Court will not reassess the material and seek to reach a conclusion different from the one reached by the court below if the one reached by the court was reasonably possible on the material. The appellate court would normally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had considered the matter at the trial stage it would have come to a contrary conclusion. If the discretion has been exercised by the Trial Court reasonably and in a judicial manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a different view may not justify interference with the trial court's exercise of discretion.\" (Para 14) 6.1 The facts of the case operating as above and the kind and the nature of the impugned order passed by the Commercial Court, we do not think that on any count, the order books any error. No interference is warranted. \n7. The appeal is meritless and is accordingly dismissed. Consequentially, the Civil Application is disposed of. \nAs the appeal is dismissed, the direction in the impugned order regarding deposit of the amount C/FA/3253/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 11/02/2022 shall stand modified and the time to comply with by depositing the amount in the Court is extended by nine weeks. \n(N.V.ANJARIA, J) (SANDEEP N.

returnable forthwith. by consent, heard both the sides for final disposal. 2) arbitration appeal no. 5/2016 is filed by the contractor, at whose instance arbitrator was appointed by this court under section 11 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the act' for short). the other appeal is filed by the employer, which is state government, corporation. arbitrator had allowed all the claims of the contractor and this decision was challenged by filing misc. application (rje) no. 77/2011 by the employer in the court of principal district judge, (hereinafter referred to as 'p.d.j.' for arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 short) parbhani under the act. by the decision dated 31.12.2015, the proceeding filed under section 34 of the act by the employer is partly allowed and the award given in respect of few claims is set aside. in view of these circumstances, both the sides have challenged the decision given by the district court, parbhani. 3) for deciding the challenges raised by both the sides in the appeals, the nature of work and also the history of previous arbitration proceedings in respect of the same work needs to be mentioned. 4) the work of majalgaon right bank canal was a part of jaikwaid project. this project was in respect of construction of dam on river godavari at paithan, district aurangabad and at various places, the canals were to be constructed. tender notice of the work of majalgaon right bank canal from k.m. 72 to 87 and k.m. 88 to 99, which included earthwork (excluding earthwork at k.m. 78 to 87) lining structure, tunnel at k.m. 90 and enroute reservoir at k.m. 91 was published by the corporation. the work was allotted to the appellant from arbitration appeal no. 5/2016. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 5) the cost of the work as per the tender was rs.700.84 lakh. the work order was issued on 20.1.1990 and the period of work was fixed as 36 months from the date of work order. from time to time, the contractor applied for extension of the period and extensions were granted by the employer. the total extension of 47 months was granted, which expired in december 1996. prior to that the contractor abandoned the remaining work. initially pre-final bill was prepared and it was finalised on 14.3.1998. the amount mentioned in the final bill was accepted by the contractor without raising any protest. 6) during the execution of the work, the contractor had raised disputes as provided by general conditions of contract (hereinafter referred to as 'g.c.c.' for short) and particularly, as per the clause no. 56. these disputes were raised in the year 1995. on most of the disputes, the incharge engineer gave the decision and it was communicated to the contractor on 15.7.1995. 7) the contractor was not satisfied with the decision arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 given by the incharge chief engineer and he referred the dispute to board of arbitrators which was constituted as per clause no. 57 of the g.c.c. as per the agreement, the board was expected to deliver reasoned award. the contractor made claims under eleven heads before board of arbitrators and all the claims were contested by the employer. in all 13 claims were made by the contractor before the department, but he prosecuted 11 claims before the board of arbitrators. it is the case of contractor that the decision on claim nos. 12 and 13 was likely to be taken departmentally as per the terms and conditions of the contract and so, he had preferred not to take decision on these claims from board of arbitrators. the board of arbitrators gave award in respect of 11 claims on 27.5.1998. 8) the reference was made to board of arbitrators as per the procedure given in the agreement between the parties and the provisions of indian arbitration act, 1940 were applicable. the award was filed as per the old provisions in the court and rule was made by the court on the award. the award and the decision of the court have become final. the award of amount of rs.2,61,14,396/was given in favour of the contractor and the cost of rs. 1,21,721/was also awarded in arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 favour of the contractor. this amount was deposited in the court when the employer failed in appeal which was filed in this court to challenge the award. the appeal was dismissed on 8.7.1999. 9) no decision was given by the chief executive engineer on the aforesaid two claims which were made with the department and which were not prosecuted before the board of arbitrators by the contractor. by the letter dated 6.2.2002, first time the contractor informed to the department that he wanted to refer the dispute to arbitrator. prior to that, the incharge executive engineer and superintending engineer had rejected these claims also. 10) the contractor then gave the name of his nominee for constitution of board of arbitrators by letter dated 21.3.2002. the employer did not give the name of it's nominee who was to work as the second arbitrator. in the letter dated 21.3.2002 itself, the contractor had informed to the employer that if the employer does not appoint arbitrator, the arbitrator appointed by the contractor will work as the sole arbitrator. as per the procedure given in clause 57 of the agreement, g.c.c., the contractor had already requested the chairman of the arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 central water commission (c.w.c.) to see that the board of arbitrators is constituted. however, by the letter dated 25.3.2002, the contractor informed to the chairman that his letter dated 8.2.2002 made in aforesaid regard be ignored and action should not be taken by the chairman for constitution of the board of arbitrators. then the contractor filed a proceeding in the high court bearing no. 5/2002 for appointment of arbitrator under the provision of section 11 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. due to the aforesaid correspondence made by the contractor, the chairman of c.w.c. did not take further action. 11) the chairman of c.w.c. was not made party in the proceeding filed under section 11 of the act in the high court. this application was opposed by the employer by contending that the high court had no power and the board of arbitrators needs to be constituted as per the agreement. this court appointed retired justice shri. a.s. bhate as the sole arbitrator by the order dated 10.7.2003. the employer filed review application by contending that it was necessary to create the board of arbitrators as per the provisions of agreement and the sole arbitrator appointed by the high court cannot get arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 jurisdiction to decide the dispute. in the review application, the high court again asked the parties to supply three names by each of them. in the meantime, retried justice shri. bhate informed to the high court that he was not willing to work as sole arbitrator. this court then made appointment of one retired district judge shri. r.g. karmarkar as the sole arbitrator. the employer had objection to appointment of arbitrator under section 11 of the act, but he did not raise objection to the name of shri. karmarkar. it is the case of employer that it had not given consent for appointment of sole arbitrator and only objection was not taken to the name suggested by the high court. after making of the appointment of shri. karmarkar, as there was mention of consent of the employer in the order, application was moved by the employer for making correction and to remove that mention. the high court did not accept that contention. the application filed for correction was rejected by the high court on 4.3.2004. the order of appointment of shri. karmarkar dated 9.10.2003 and the order dated 4.3.2004 were challenged by the employer in the apex court by filing special leave to appeal. 12) the hon'ble apex court granted stay to the orders of arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 hon'ble high court on 14.3.2005. before that date, shri. karmarkar had started the proceeding. the claim statement was filed and the written statement was also filed by the employer. the employer took the defence that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction and he was not competent as his appointment was not as per the agreement. other objection was taken that the claims were barred by the principle of res-judicata and they were time barred. on merits also, the claims raised before the sole arbitrator were opposed. 13) due to stay granted by the apex court, the proceeding before shri. karmarkar remained stayed from 14.3.2005 to 28.11.2007. on 28.11.2007, the apex court disposed of the special leave to appeal with observations that the point of jurisdiction can be decided by the arbitrator himself in view of the position of law prevailing at that time. shri. karmarkar then expressed his enability to act as an arbitrator. prior to that, in the year 2004, he had passed order on objection of jurisdiction taken by the employer. the names of retired justice shri. s.c. malte and retired justice shri. s.g. mutalik were suggested by high court this time. the employer contended that such persons cannot be appointed as arbitrator arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 in view of the agreement made by the parties. this court then appointed shri. mutalik as the sole arbitrator. before shri. mutalik also, the employer took aforesaid defences and objections. the request was made to decide the point of jurisdiction first, but shri. mutalik, arbitrator expressed that this point will be decided along with the dispute. shri. mutalik fixed his fees as rs.1,00,000/for reading the papers and rs.70,000/per meeting. the order with regard to aforesaid charges and fees was also challenged by the employer, but the employer did not succeed. 14) the learned arbitrator has allowed all the claims of the contractor (7 +1 claims). it is held by the learned arbitrator that there is no bar of principle of res-judicata to the claims. though issue was framed on the point of limitation and it was clubbed with the issue of res-judicata, the award delivered by the learned arbitrator does not show that he had touched this point. the learned arbitrator has held that in view of the order made by this court under section 11 of the act, he has jurisdiction. the learned arbitrator has held that the contractor is entitled to recover the amount of rs. 11,24,60,651/with interest at the rate of 16% p.a. and has held that the interest arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 will be payable up to the period ending on 30.9.2003 and then the interest will be payable from 4.2.2004 the date of filing of the claims on the awarded amount then till the date of realisation. the cost of rs.10,00,000/was imposed by the learned arbitrator on the employer. this award was delivered on 3.4.2011. 15) in the decision given by the learned p.d.j., parbhani in application (rje) no. 77/2011, the learned p.d.j. has set aside the award of arbitrator in respect of claim nos. 2 [2a and 2b], 3, 4 and 5. the award in respect of claim nos. 1 and 6 is confirmed by the p.d.j. the claim no. 7 was in respect of interest and so, it can be said that interest is allowed in respect of the claim nos. 1 and 6. the learned p.d.j. has held that the claim nos. 2a, 2b, 4 and 5 cannot be allowed as they are hit by the principle of res-judicata. the learned p.d.j. held that claim no. 4 was time barred. the claim no. 3 is set aside by holding that there is virtually no evidence and there is no justification in awarding this claim when the award was required to be reasoned award. 16) in the present matter, in view of the contentions arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 made and the arguments advanced, following points need to be decided. (i) whether the present matters need to be decided by commercial appellate division constituted under the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high court act, 2015 ? (ii) whether the learned arbitrator shri. mutalik, retired judge of this court was competent in view of the agreement ? (iii) whether claim nos. 1, 2, 3 & 6 could have been considered by the arbitral tribunal in view of the terms and conditions of the contract ? (iv) whether the aforesaid claims [2a, 2b, 4 and 5] are hit by the principle of res-judicata ? (v) whether claim nos. 1, 4 & 6 are time barred? (vi) whether claim no. 3 was substantiated ? (vii) whether the award delivered by the learned arbitrator and the decision given by the learned p.d.j. need to be interfered with in the appeals ? point no. 1 :effect of the provisions of the commercial courts, arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 commercial division and commercial appellate division of high court act, 2015 on the jurisdiction of this court : 17) the learned counsel for contractor submitted that for aurangabad bench of this court, commercial appellate division of high court is created under the aforesaid enactment and so, the present matters need to be placed before the said court. for ascertaining as to whether this court has jurisdiction, this court has seen the scheme of the aforesaid special enactment carefully. it is true that the dispute of the present matters falls under the definition of 'commercial dispute' given under section 2(c) and the value of the dispute is more than rs. 28 crore. 18) aurangabad bench of bombay high court has no ordinary original civil jurisdiction and so, there is no commercial division of the high court at aurangabad bench. commercial appellate division for aurangabad bench came to be constituted under the aforesaid act with effect from 30.6.2016. the present proceeding was filed on 31.3.2016. the proceeding under section 34 of the act was decided by the learned p.d.j., parbhani on 31.12.2016 as \"court\" under the act. this is because first arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 time by government notification dated 30.6.2016, the government constituted commercial court at district levels including for district parbhani and high court under letter dated 14.7.2016 appointed the judges of district court as commercial courts. from the record, it can be said that for parbhani district and other districts, the commercial court actually started functioning for district places on 16.7.2016. the aforesaid special enactment was published by notification in official gazette on 31.12.2015, but the courts were constituted subsequently and the proceeding under section 34 was decided by the learned p.d.j. as the \"court\" under section 34 of the act on 31.12.2015. 19) the matters which are required to be decided by commercial appellate division are mentioned in section 13 of the aforesaid special enactment and the provision runs as under :\"13. appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions.(1) any person aggrieved by the decision of the commercial court or commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 order, as the case may be: provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1906 (5 of 1908) as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996). (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\" 20) section 3 of this special enactment shows that the state government is expected to constitute the commercial courts by notification. it is required to be published in official gazette and that was done on 30.6.2016. on the date of decision of the matter filed under section 34 of the act, commercial court was not in existence and similarly, commercial appellate division was also not in existence when the present appeals were filed in this court. the provision of section 15 takes care of the pending matters and this provision shows that only the matters which are filed or were filed under section 34 of the act and which were still pending can be arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 transferred under the provision of section 15 and they are required to be transferred either to commercial court or commercial division. neither in section 15 nor in any other provision of the special enactment, there is provision for transferring the appeals, which are filed against the decisions given by the courts as mentioned in section 34 of the act to commercial appellate division of this court. in view of this position of law, it needs to be held that present appeals need to be decided by this court as appeals filed under section 37 of the act and not by commercial appellate division of the high court. so, the point is answered accordingly. 21) on the aforesaid point, the learned counsel for contractor placed reliance on the observations made by commercial appellate division of this court at principal seat in judgment of commercial appeal no. 7 of 2016 [hubtown limited vs. idbi trusteeship service limited] decided on 24.10.2016. this court has carefully gone through the facts of this case and observations made by the commercial appellate division. the facts were totally different and the order made by the commercial division in summons for judgment was taken in appeal before the commercial appellate division. it was held arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 that appeal filed under section 13 of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015 was tenable and the order of learned single judge of commercial division in summons for judgment was set aside. the maintainability of commercial appeal was in question, but as the order of commercial division was taken in appeal such decision was given. thus, the observations made in this case are of no use to the contractor in the present matter. point no. 2 compentency of the arbitrator :22) to ascertain, whether the retired judge of the high court shri. mutalik could have been appointed as arbitrator under section 11 of the act, the provision of section 11 (relevant portion) needs to be considered first. the relevant portions are section 11(1) to 11(6), 11(8) of the act and they run as under :\"11. appointment of arbitrators. -(1) a person of any nationality may be an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. (2) subject to sub-section (6), the parties are free to agree on a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators. (3) failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (2), in an arbitration with three arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 arbitrators, each party shall appoint one arbitrator, and the two appointed arbitrators shall appoint the third arbitrator who shall act as the presiding arbitrator. (4) if the appointment procedure in subsection (3) applies and(a) a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days from the receipt of a request to do so from the other party; of (b) the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty days from the date of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the chief justice or any person or institution designated by him. (5) failing any agreement referred to in sub-section(2), in an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties fail to agree on the arbitrator within thirty days from receipt of a request by one party from the other party to so agree the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the chief justice or any person or institution designated by him. (6) where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties, (a) a party fails to act as required under that procedure; or (b) the parties, or the two appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an agreement expected of them under that procedure; or arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 (c) a person, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to him or it under that procedure, a party may request the chief justice or any person or institution designated by him to take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment. (7) . (8) the chief justice or the person or institution designated by him, in appointing an arbitrator, shall have due regard to(a) any qualifications required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties; and (b) other considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator.\" 23) in the present matters, the application under section 11 of the act was filed in the year 2002 and the appointment of retired judge of this court was made first time in the proceeding on 10.7.2003. the subsequent appointments of sole arbitrator mentioned above were made only to replace the first sole arbitrator appointed by this court. this decision was taken up to supreme court by filing special leave petition by the employer. the apex court referred the case of m/s. s.b.p & co. vs. m/s. patel engineering ltd. and anr. [air 2006 supreme arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 court 450] and held that it will be open to raise the challenge to jurisdiction of arbitrator appointed by high court before the arbitrator himself as provided in the act. in the case of s.b.p. & co. cited supra also, the apex court had made it clear that if the applications filed under section 11 of the act were already decided, it is to be presumed that in those cases, the appointments were made as per the ratio of previous case of apex court reported as m/s. konkan railway corporation ltd. and anr. vs. m/s. rani construction p. ltd. [air 2002 supreme court 778]. as the contrary view was taken in the case of s.b.p. & co., cited supra, the apex court made it clear in the case of s.b.p. & co. itself that in the matters in which arbitrators were already appointed as per the case of konkan railway corporation cited supra, in those cases all objections with regard to jurisdiction of the arbitrator need to be decided under section 16 of the act. this position of law needs to be kept in mind while applying the provisions of section 11(1) to 11(6) of the act to the present matters. thus, the point of competency of the arbitrator is open in the present matter. in view of the provision of section 16 (6) of the act read with provision of section 34 (2) (v) of the act, this point could have been considered by the arbitrator and also the district court. in arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 the appeal, this point can be again considered. 24) if the provisions of section 11(2) and 11(6) of the act are read together, they show that if there is agreement over the procedure for appointment of arbitration and the procedure provides other means for securing the appointment, the power under section 11(6) of the act cannot be used. 25) the provision of section 11(2) of the act shows that this provision is subject to the provision of section 11(6) of the act and so, if there is already agreement on procedure, there cannot be new agreement on procedure by the parties to appoint the arbitrator. similarly, if there is agreement on procedure available, the provisions of sections 11 (3), 11 (4), 11 (5) cannot be used as those provisions are to take care of the situation where there is no agreement on the procedure to appoint arbitrator. it needs to be kept in mind that in section 11(6) of the act, there are two parts. the first part relates to the lacuna in the procedure agreed. due to such lacuna, if even after following the procedure the arbitrator cannot be appointed, then the court can take necessary measures as mentioned in those provisions of law to see that arbitrator is appointed. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 however, the second part relates to the situation where there is the procedure, and due to the failure on the part of the one or more parties or due to other situation mentioned in clauses (b) (c) of section 11(6) of the act, the arbitrator is not appointed, but there is the procedure to take care of such situation and by following that procedure the arbitrator can be appointed. in the present matters, procedure mentioned in second part of section 11(6) of the act was available. 26) clause no. 57 of the g.c.c. between the parties reads as under :\"57. arbitration : (1) all disputes or differences in respect of which the decision, if any, of the engineer or employer has not become final and binding as aforesaid, shall on the initiative of either party in dispute be referred to the adjudication of three arbitrators. one arbitrator is to be nominated by the employer, one by the contractor and the third by the president of the international chamber of commerce, in the case of foreign contractors and chairman, central water commission in the case of local contractors. if either of the parties fail to appoint its arbitrator within sixty days after receipt of notice for the appointment of an arbitrator then the president of the international chamber of arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 commerce or the chairman, central water commission as the case may be, shall appoint an arbitrator. a certified copy of the appointment made by the 'president'/'chairman' shall be furnished to both parties. (2) the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of conciliation and arbitration of the international chamber of commerce, paris in the case of foreign contractors and provisions of indian arbitration act 1940 or any statutory modifications thereof in the case of local contractors and shall be held in either case at such place and time in india as the arbitrators may determine. the decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties and the expenses of the arbitrators shall be paid as may be determined by the arbitrators. (3) the said arbitrator/s shall have full power to open up, revise and review any decision, opinion, direction, certificate or valuation by the engineer, neither party shall be limited in the proceedings before such arbitrator/s to the evidence or arguments put before the engineer for the purpose of obtaining his said decision. no decision given by the engineer in accordance with the foregoing provisions shall disqualify him from being called as a witness and giving evidence before the arbitrator/s on any matter whatsoever relevant to the dispute or difference referred to the arbitrator/s as aforesaid. the reference to arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 arbitration may proceed notwithstanding that the works shall not then be or be alleged to be complete provided always that the obligations of the employer, the engineer and the contractor shall not be altered by reason of the arbitration being conducted during the progress of the works. (4) performance under the contract shall, if reasonably possible, continue during the arbitration proceedings and payments due to the contractor by the employer shall bot be withheld, unless they are the subject matter of the arbitration proceedings. (5) all awards shall be in writing and in case of claims equivalent to rupees one hundred thousand or more, such awards shall state reason for the amounts awarded. (6) neither party is entitled to bring a claim to arbitration if its arbitrator has not been appointed by thirty days after the expiration of the maintenance period. (7) the term 'indian contractor' shall include indian firm or group of indian firms and joint venture consortia eligible for price preference as domestic tenderer.\" clause no. 57 (1) shows that the authority mentioned in the clause viz. the chairman of c.w.c. was having power to appoint the sole arbitrator if both or either party had failed to nominate arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 the arbitrator as provided in first part of this clause. in the first arbitral proceeding, both the sides had appointed their nominees and the third arbitrator was appointed by chairman of c.w.c. thus, in the present matter also, it was possible to use this procedure. infact reference was already made to the chairman of c.w.c. and the matter was pending before the chairman for consideration. it is the contractor, who had written to the chairman of c.w.c. to inform that he was not interested in getting the arbitrator appointed as per this clause as he wanted to move high court under section 11 of the act. this fact of the present matter and the position of law already quoted are sufficient to hold that retired justice shri. mutalik could not have been appointed as arbitrator under section 11 by this court. both the learned arbitrator and the court under section 34 of the act have committed error in holding that retired justice shri. mutalik was appointed as per the provisions made in law. this single ground is sufficient to set aside the entire award delivered by the learned arbitrator. so, the point no. 2 is answered accordingly. 27) on the aforesaid point, the learned counsel for employer placed reliance on the observations made by the arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 supreme court in the case reported as 2016 (4) mh.l.j. 101 [huawei technologies company ltd. vs. sterlite technologies ltd.]. in this case, the apex court has considered the provisions of section 11 and 15 (2) of the act and has laid down that the term 'rules' mentioned in section 15 (2) relates to the provisions made in the agreement for appointment of arbitrator. it is laid down that on every occasion including for occasion of filling vacancy of arbitrator, the rules in that regard need to be followed. there cannot be dispute over this proposition and this court has quoted the relevant portion of the agreement mentioned in the procedure for appointment of arbitrator. 28) the learned counsel for respondent/contractor placed reliance on the observations made by the supreme court in civil appeal no. 6275/2014 [north eastern railway & ors. vs. tripple engineering works] decided on 13.8.2014. in this case and also in the case reported as 2013 (2) arb.l.r. 105 (sc) [m/s. deep trading company vs. m/s. indian oil corporation and ors.], the apex court has discussed the provision of section 11 and has laid down that when one party forfeited right to appoint his nominee for arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 constitution of arbitral tribunal, it is not open to the said party to say that the arbitrator cannot be appointed under section 11 of the act. the facts of the two reported cases show that due to failure of one party to nominate his arbitrator, it was not possible to constitute the arbitral tribunal. in view of that circumstance, the apex court laid down that the provision of section 11 can be used. the facts of the present matter are totally different and this court has already observed that even after failure of one or both the parties, the arbitrator could have been appointed by the agency mentioned in the agreement. in the present matter, the contractor avoided to get constituted the tribunal from the said agency, the chairman of c.w.c. the relevant portion of section 11 of the act is also discussed in this regard and so, the observations made by the apex court in these two cases are of no use to the contractor. point no. 3 :29) under this point, this court is discussing all the remaining points like point of limitation, point of res-judicata, point of excepted matters and to some extent the merits of the claim. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 30) the relevant facts of the dispute between the parties are already quoted and they show that while before december 1996, the contractor had abandoned the work, though the period for execution of work was expected by the department till december 1996. in the year 1995, only 13 claims were raised by the contractor before the employer as per the procedure given in clause 56 of g.c.c. out of the said 13 claims, the contractor preferred to get decision from board of arbitrators on 11 claims. as per the record, pre-final bill was prepared on 30.6.1996 and then the final bill was prepared and singed on 14.3.1998. in view of the aforesaid facts, it can be said that no more work was expected when pre-final bill and final bill were signed by the parties. these bills were accepted by the contractor without raising any protest. these circumstances need to be kept in mind while deciding the point of limitation, and the point of res-judicata. in spite of these circumstances, the contractor raised new claims which were five in numbers before the second arbitrator. it can be said that there is no record with the contractor in respect of these new five claims to show that they were made under the procedure given under the agreement and particularly, clause no. 56 of the agreement. the award prepared by the learned arbitrator in the present arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 matter shows that the learned arbitrator considered one way correspondence allegedly made by the contractor with the department for presuming that these new claims were raised and they were pending with the department. it is already observed that only 13 claims were raised as per the procedure and the contractor had preferred to take final decision on two claims departmentally and he had filed claims statement in respect of remaining 11 claims before the board of arbitrators (first arbitration). the award delivered by the learned arbitrator in the present matter shows that there was virtually non application of mind and the learned arbitrator virtually accepted all the contentions made by the contractor as they were without considering the effect of the principle of res-judicata, limitation and also the presence or absence of the material with regard to actual work done. there are many points, on the basis of which it can be said that the arbitrator had not considered the basic concepts like res-judicata and for instance issue no. 6a can be quoted in that regard. \"6a] does the claimant prove that he is entitled to for payment of interest @ 16% p.a. from 1302-1993 to 15-7-1995 on all sums awarded under the award dated 27-05-1998 ?\" fortunately, in the reasoning other point is considered and decided. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 31) the provision with regard to the procedure to raise the claims and to make reference to arbitration can be found in clause nos. 56 and 57 of g.c.c. clause no. 57 is already quoted. clause no. 56 runs as under :\"56. settlement of disputes :if any dispute or difference of any kind whatsoever shall arise between the engineer or employer and the contractor in connection with, or arising out of the contract, or the execution of the works, whether during the progress of the works or after their completion and whether or after the termination, abandonment or breach of the contract, it shall, in the first place, be referred to and settled by the engineer-in-charge who shall, within a period of thirty days after being requested by the contractor to do so give written notice of his decision to the contractor. upon receipt of the written notice on decision of the engineer the contractor shall promptly proceed without delay to comply with such notice for decision. if the engineer-in-charge fails to give notice of his decision in writing within a period of thirty days after being requested, or if the contractor is dissatisfied with the notice of decision of the engineer-in-charge the contractor may within thirty days after receiving notice of decision arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 appeal to the superintending engineer, who shall afford an opportunity to the contractor to be heard and to offer evidence in support of his appeal. the superintending engineer shall give notice of his decision within a period of thirty days after the contractor has given the said evidence in support of his appeal. subject to arbitration, as hereinafter provided, such decision of the superintending engineer in respect of every matter so referred shall be final and binding upon the contractor and shall forthwith be given effect to by the contractor, who shall proceed with the execution of the works with all due diligence whether he requires arbitration, as hereinafter provided, or not. if the superintending engineer has given written notice of his decision to the contractor and no claim to arbitration has been communicated to him by the contractor within a period of thirty days from receipt of such notice, the said decision shall remain final and binding upon the contractor. if the superintending engineer shall fail to give notice of his decision as aforesaid within a period of thirty days after being requested as aforesaid, or if the contractor be dissatisfied with any such decision, then and in any such case the contractor within thirty-days after receiving notice of such decision, or within thirty days after the expiration of the first-named period of thirty days, as the case may be, appeal to chief engineer who shall afford an opportunity arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 to the contractor to be heard and to offer evidence in support of his appeal. the chief engineer shall give decision within a period of thirty days after the contractor has given evidence in support of his appeal. if the contractor is dissatisfied with this decision, the contractor within a period of thirty days from receipt of decision shall indicate his intention to refer the dispute to arbitration, failing which the said decision shall be final and conclusive.\" in view of the wording of clause no. 56, it was necessary for the contractor to presume that his two claims, out of aforesaid 13 claims, were not accepted by the department. this presumption is necessary as for every stage, the period is fixed in clause no. 56. if he had taken the matter up to chief engineer and the decisions were given against him by the incharge engineer and superintending engineer, then after expiry of period of 30 days from raising the grievance before the chief engineer, it was necessary for the contractor to presume that the department was not accepting the remaining two claims. it can be said that the contractor took the risk by presuming that he will be getting the remaining two claims settled departmentally and the contractor did not stake claims under the two heads before the board of arbitrators. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 32) it is already observed that so far as the remaining five claims are concerned from the present matter, they were not prosecuted as per the procedure given in clause no. 56 and so, it can be said that these claims were never raised during the execution of the work. even if it is presumed that in the year 1995, the contractor had made correspondence with regard to new claims, in that case also the contractor ought to have prosecuted the matter under clause no. 56 of g.c.c. thus, it needs to be inferred that the cause of action had already arisen at the end of year 1995 in respect of the new claims also. 33) clause 57 (6) of g.c.c. shows that matter needs to be referred to arbitration within 30 days after expiration of the maintenance period. clause 5 of g.c.c. provides for maintenance and defect liability period. this period was 180 days from the certified date of completion. it is already observed that contractor had abandoned the work and there was no question of issuing certificate of completion. the record shows that the contractor never attempted to obtain completion certificate to get absolved himself from the liability mentioned in clause 5 of g.c.c. if the work was not completed, then it can be arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 said that the period mentioned in clause 5 can be counted from the date of final bill. as final bill was signed by the contractor without protest on 14.3.1998, the period of limitation started to run after expiry of 180 days from 14.3.1998. 34) the amendment to section 28 of the contract act, which made agreement void if the agreement was limiting the limitation period provided by general law came in to force with effect from 8.1.1997. in view of clause no. 5 of g.c.c. if it is presumed that benefit of amended provision of the contract act needs to be given to the contractor, in that case also, the period of limitation started to run after completion of 180 days from 14.3.1998. if this amendment is not made applicable, then the period had started to run as provided in clause 56 of g.c.c. thus, even if the best possible case for the contractor is accepted, he ought to have raised the dispute within three years from 14.9.1998 (14.3.1998 + 180 days). 35) for all the claims decided in the present matter, it can be said that the contractor took steps first time in the year 2002 by filing proceeding under section 11 of the act. he filed the claim before arbitrator appointed by this court in the year arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 2003. due to these circumstances, this court has no hesitation to hold that all the claims decided by the learned arbitrator in the present matter were time barred. 36) so far as the point of res-judicata is concerned, following points need to be kept in mind. not only the principle of res-judicata, but the principle of constructive res-judicata also needs to be used in such matters. the contention of waiver was made at all the stages for the employer. (i) the board of arbitrators came to be constituted on 17.1.1996 and it had given direction to both the sides to file statement of claims. (ii) the first meeting of board of arbitrators was held on 4.11.1996 and on that date, the decision was taken as to which claims will be decided. thus, it was open to the contractor to file the claims decided in the present matter before the board of arbitrators also. in spite of these circumstances, the contractor preferred not to file the claims before the board of arbitrators in the first arbitration. 37) the board of arbitrators had given award on arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 following claims :(i) revised rates for work executed after the original scheduled period viz. for the work executed after 20.1.1993. the new rate was fixed by the board of arbitrators as per the contract formula accepted in the agreement by the parties viz. as per the price indices as on 20.1.1993. this additional amount was given as compensation for delay caused for execution of the work. (ii) revised rates for extra items exceeding 30% of the work over the tender quantities. the revised rates were given in respect of this work done also even prior to 20.1.1993. similarly, under this head the revised rate was given in respect of work done after 20.1.1993. (iii) damages on account of recovery of amount as security deposit from running bills and interest at the rate of 16% p.a. is given on such amount. thus, the claim of compensation in respect of retension of money by the department during the work period was placed before the board of arbitrators for consideration. the board of arbitrators could have considered the present arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 claim of getting interest on amount of bank guarantee for the period starting from 20.1.1993. but, this point was not raised. (iv) the payment of rs.1.5 per bag cement was awarded as the difference of rate as there was contract to supply cement in jute bags to the contractor by the employer and the cement was supplied in polythene bags. (v) interest on all the amount due and demanded in claims at the rate of 16% p.a. from the date of occurrence till the date of realisation. the board of arbitrators has awarded interest on the amount which was due to the contractor prior to 10.7.1995 and also on the amount which became payable on 15.7.1995. these dates are with regard to the demands made by the contractor under clause 56 of g.c.c. similarly past and pendente-lite interest with reference to the date 4.11.1996, the date of first hearing of the board of arbitrators is granted at the rate of 16% p.a. further, the order was made by board of arbitrators that if the amount was not paid within two months from the date of the award delivered by the board of arbitrators, the arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 department was liable to pay the interest at the rate of 18% p.a. this item again shows that it was open to the contractor to claim interest in respect of all the amounts which were due to him, according to him, before the board of arbitrators. 38) the board of arbitrators had rejected the following claims made by the contractor :(i) loss of over heads and profits due to delay. this was done as revised rate was given for entire work done after 20.1.1993 by the board of arbitrators. (ii) the compensation for extra lead charges for cut spoils disposed of at the distant location. this claim was rejected with reference to clauses of g.c.c. and special terms and conditions of the contract. (iii) the extra rate for hard rock excavation in canal section. this claim was rejected as the contractor failed to prove that there was any such agreement. under this item, the present claim of control blasting could have been considered and it can be said that it needs to be presumed that such claim was considered. (iv) compensation for idle machinery and idle labour arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 charges due to stoppage of work for the same period. this claim was rejected as the contractor failed to prove that at any time, his labour and machinery remained idle and so, on merit it was rejected. (v) payment of rehandling charges for casing material of k.m. 90 spoils used for embankment of entire reservoir. this claim was rejected on the basis of the material available and terms and conditions of the contract. (vi) extra item of every overcuts of hard rock at k.m. 89 and 90 beyond normal pay line and also back filling of the same. this is also rejected on merits and it can be said that present item and control blasting could have been raised under this claim also by the contractor. 39) aforesaid circumstances show that all the so called extra items except the two claims which were specifically withdrawn by the contractor were placed before the board of arbitrators, first arbitration. the following were the two items which were specifically withdrawn by the contractor. (i) hard rock excavation involving controlled arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 blasting. it was the case of contractor that radius was changed due to geography and existence of the structures in the vicinity. on this point also, it needs to be observed that as per the terms and conditions of contract, it was necessary for the contractor to visit the site and make assessment, estimate before quoting rate. these things ought to have been inspected by the contractor. the learned arbitrator in the present matter has not considered this aspect of the matter. the board of arbitrators had considered this aspect. (ii) extra quarrying and transport charges for stone and metals for concrete work and also for work of filling. it is the case of contractor that useful stones were not available along with canal line and he was required to bring that material from the other place, k.m. 91. the work was to be done from k.m. 72 to 87 and 88 to 99. here only it needs to be observed that the learned arbitrator has not touched the record of sites already informed by the employer. the learned arbitrator has decided this point only on the basis of quantities used in the work and it is presumed that these quantities were brought from distant place when arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 no material whatsoever was produced by the contractor to show that this material was in fact brought from distant place. 40) the discussion already made and the material show that the work of controlled blasting was executed in the year 1994-95. it is already observed that it was necessary for the contractor to presume that the department was not accepting this claim as extra item and so, it was necessary for the contractor to refer this claim to arbitration. this opportunity was there to the contractor when the board of arbitrators was constituted, but he preferred to virtually withdrawn the claim. same can be said in respect of the other claim, extra item of stone and metals. 41) before the learned arbitrator from the present matter, the contractor had made in all 7 claims which included the aforesaid two claims. the department took the defence that already revised rate was given to the contractor by the board of arbitrators in the past and the new claims were not raised before the arbitrator. it was submitted for the employer that the agreement did not provide for separate or additional charges arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 even in respect of the controlled blasting. the defence was taken that there was no prior approval of incharge engineer with regard to controlled blasting. as already observed, like point of res-judicata, the point of limitation was also there. 42) so far as the item of controlled blasting is concerned, the attention of the learned arbitrator was drawn to the clause 2.16 of second volume of agreement. this clause provides for execution of hard rock chiseling/control blasting. it is the case of employer that the tender rates were fixed after preparing estimates on the basis of survey done by the department and the contractor had accepted the rate and so, it was not open to him to claim additional rate or as extra item. the attention of the learned arbitrator was drawn to clause no. 2.16.2 of the second volume showing that when the control blasting was not permissible in the zone of 100 meters directly below transmission line, the contractor ought to have resorted to pneumatic rock breakers or chiseling. in view of this clause, it was necessary for the contractor to first take permission of the employer if he wanted to do the control blasting under transmission lines. it is not the case of contractor that such permission was granted by the employer to him. for this reason arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 also, nothing could have been given by the learned arbitrator under this head to the contractor. it can be said that it was not agreed item. even when arbitral tribunal has held that permission was not granted by the employer, the claim is allowed by the arbitrator. 43) so far as the claim no. 2 which was withdrawn by the contractor in the past when the board of arbitrators was constituted is concerned viz. the claim of extra quarrying and transport of stones/metals, the attention of the learned arbitrator was drawn to clause no. 20 of g.c.c. and clause no. 5.6 of the special terms and conditions of the contract. the sites where quarries could have been taken were already informed and it was made clear that if the material available at those quarries was not sufficient, the contractor was to make his own arrangement at own cost of such material. the clauses show that the contractor was expected to spend for construction of road also for transport of such material. even if the case of contractor that he was required to collect the material at k.m. 91 could have been considered by ignoring the aforesaid clauses of agreement, then also it was necessary for the contractor to substantiate that claim. the award delivered by the arbitrator arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 shows that he did not refer to the drawings and maps annexed with the tender record showing the quarries. the learned arbitrator did not ask the contractor to produce the record which is ordinarily created like payment of royalty in respect of such material to the revenue department. surprisingly, the learned arbitrator has granted the claim by presuming that the quantities actually used was required for work and so, the contractor must have transported this quantity from the place which he has contended. the contractor himself has admitted that some material was available at the other quarries which were not that away from the site of work, but the contractor has not given the exact quantity of the material recovered from those sites by producing record of royalty and other record. these circumstances show that most casual approach was shown by the learned arbitrator and even when there was no material to substantiate the claim, the learned arbitrator has granted the claim and so award on such claim cannot sustain in law. the arbitral tribunal has not referred clause no. 5.7 of the special terms and conditions. thus, there was no material with the contractor to substantiate the claim under this head and the contractor had virtually failed to substantiate this claim and the court has rightly set aside the claim under this head. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 44) the decision of the learned arbitrator of granting claims under issue no. 3a, 3b, 4a and 4b viz. revised rates for entire quantities of work executed after 20.1.1993 and for quantities which were less than 70% of the tender quantity show that there was virtually non application of mind. it is already mentioned that the board of arbitrators had given revised rates to the contractor by presuming that delay was caused to the employer, but the learned arbitrator has again given compensation under this head. even if, the board of arbitrators had not given such compensation, in that case also, the decision of the board of arbitrators had become final on that point as this point was raised before the board of arbitrators and so, there was bar of principle of res-judicata for granting these claims. from this angle, the learned arbitrator has not considered these claims. thus, the award on such claims cannot sustain in law. 45) the claim in respect of excess price allegedly paid by the contractor for sand mentioned in issue nos. 5a and 5b is similar to the claim in respect of other material like rubble, arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 metal etc. it was the responsibility of the contractor as per the clause 20 of g.c.c. and clause 5.6 of special terms and conditions of the contract to procure the sand. this aspect of the agreement is not at all considered by the learned arbitrator and compensation is granted under this head. such award cannot sustain in law. 46) the claim in respect of interest under issue no. 6a viz. interest on bank guarantee could not have been awarded by the arbitrator. clause no. 10.3 of the special terms and conditions of the contract shows that it was necessary for the contractor to keep such bank guarantee with the employer during the period of execution of work. as per this clause, bank guarantee was to remain with the employer and it was to be released only after completion of the work and settlement of the account. thus, the learned arbitrator has committed grave error in awarding interest on the bank guarantee in the present matter. if issue nos. 6a, 6b and 7 are read, which were framed by the learned arbitrator, it can be said that the learned arbitrator had not applied mind even for framing the issues. for these reasons, the award on claims under this head needs to be set aside. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 47) issue no. 12 framed by the learned arbitrator was about entitlement of the contractor to get compensation, revision of rates and specific relief at the same time. as already observed, claims were considered by the board of arbitrators and decision was given by the board of arbitrators on this point. this point appears to be separately considered by the learned arbitrator and it can be said that it was not necessary for the learned arbitrator to decide this issue in view of the decision given by the board of arbitrators. this issue could not have been considered separately as it had connection with other claims. 48) the decision given under section 34 of the act by the learned p.d.j., parbhani shows that the award in respect of claim nos. 2 to 5 is set aside and for the reasons given by the 'court' and by this court, it is not possible to interfere in the said decision of the p.d.j. the p.d.j. has however confirmed the award given on claim nos. 1 and 6. but the award given in respect of those claims also cannot sustain in law in view of the discussion already made. 49) the learned counsel for employer placed reliance on arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 the observations made by the apex court in the case reported as 2016 (8) scale 779 [union of india and anr. vs. indusind bank ltd. and anr.]. this case is on the interpretation of provision of section 28 of the contract act as amended in the year 1997. the apex court has laid down that the provision has prospective effect. this court has quoted the relevant terms and conditions of the agreement and the best possible case for contractor is considered. in spite of such consideration, this court has come to the conclusion that it is not possible to hold that the contractor took action for enforcement of his so called right within prescribed period of three years from the date of cause of action. thus, even if the observations made in this case are ignored in view of the terms and conditions of the contract, the contractor cannot succeed in the matter. however, there cannot be dispute over the proposition made by the hon'ble apex court in this matter. 50) on the point of interest claimed on the bank guarantee amount, the learned counsel for employer placed reliance on the observations made by the apex court in the case reported as 2016 (3) mh.l.j. 1 [union of india vs. bright power projects (india) pvt. ltd. in the case decided by three arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 hon'ble judges of the apex court, it is made clear that when there is agreement that no interest would be awarded to the contractor, the arbitral tribunal cannot award interest. the apex court has referred the provision of section 31 (7)(a) of the act, which runs as under :\"31(7)(a) unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and in so far as an arbitral award is for the payment of money, the arbitral tribunal may include in the sum for which the award is made interest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, on the whole or any part of the money, for the whole or any part of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made.\" 51) the facts of the reported case show that there was the claim in respect of interest on security deposit, earnest money and also on other amount, but in view of the agreement that no interest would be payable, the apex court held that arbitral tribunal could not have awarded interest. on the other hand, the learned counsel for respondent placed reliance on the observations made by the apex court in the case reported as air 1985 sc 607 [hyderabad municipal corporation vs. m. krishnaswami mudaliar]. in this case decided by two hon'ble judges of the apex court, the work was abandoned and arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 in view of the claim made by the contractor under the interest act, in that case, the apex court held that granting of interest was possible. the facts were different and further, there is the case cited supra viz. 2016 (3) mh.l.j. 1 [union of india vs. bright power projects (india) pvt. ltd. decided by the three judges of the honble apex court showing that arbitrator is not expected to give award which will be against the terms and conditions of the agreement. in the present matter, relevant facts are considered by this court and relevant portion of the agreement is already quoted and so, the finding is given that the contractor is not entitled to get interest on the bank guarantee. 52) the learned counsel for respondent placed reliance on the observations made by the apex court in the cases reported as 2014 (4) arb.lr 307 (sc) [associate builders vs. delhi development authority] and 2014 (4) arb.lr 1 (sc) [swan gold mining ltd. vs. hindustan copper ltd.]. the apex court has laid down that ordinarily when view expressed by the arbitrator on facts is possible view, the decision of the arbitrator given on factual aspect cannot be disturbed by the court. however, the observations show that such award needs to be based on evidence given to substantiate arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 the claim and it should be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract and it should not be against the law. there cannot be dispute over the proposition. only to that extent, this court has considered the challenge against the award. 53) in view of the aforesaid discussion made by this court, this court holds that point nos. (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) need to be answered against the contractor and they are answered accordingly. 54) so, this court holds that the proceeding filed by the department, employer needs to be allowed and entire award of the learned arbitrator needs to be set aside. similarly, the decision given by the learned p.d.j. of conforming the award in respect of claim nos. 1 and 6 needs to be set aside. in the result, following order :order (i) arbitration appeal no. 6/2016 of the employer is allowed. the entire award delivered by the learned arbitrator is hereby set aside and the claims stand rejected. the decision given by the learned p.d.j., parbhani in proceeding filed under arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 section 34 of the act, by which award in respect of claim no. 1 and 6 is confirmed, is also set aside and the entire proceeding filed under section 34 of the act by the employer stands allowed. (ii) arbitration appeal no. 5/2016 of the contractor stands dismissed. (iii) civil applications filed in both the matters are disposed of. (iv) parties to bear their own cost throughout.
