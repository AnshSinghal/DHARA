Before dealing with the applications individually it would be\nappropriate to first set out the facts in the plaint. Plaintiff Bharat Heavy\nElectricals Limited (in short 'Bhel') has filed the present suit impleading\nElectricity Generation Incorporation (in short 'Egi') having its office at\nAnkara, Turkey as defendant No.1, AKBank T.A.S. (in short 'AKBank') at\nIstanbul, Turkey as defendant No.2 and Bank of Baroda (in short 'BoB')\n\n\n\nCs(Comm) 190/2017                                                      Page 1 of 27\n having its branch office at Sansad Mark, New Delhi as defendant No.3. The\nthree main prayers in the suit besides the costs are:\n      \"(a) Pass a decree of declaration, declaring that the alleged\n           invocation of the Performance Bank Guarantee bearing\n           No.0834INC15CG00075 for an amount of Eur Eur\n           3,831,589.69 i.e. Inr 28,35,37,637.06 valid till 1 st July,\n           2024 by Defendant No.1 to Defendant No.2 and\n           consequently of the Counter Guarantee of Defendant\n           No.3 to Defendant No.2 bearing No. 2158Fgper000215\n           is fraudulent and hence void; and\n      (b) pass a decree of permanent injunction restraining\n           Defendant No.3 from making any payment whatsoever to\n           Defendant No.2 in terms of the fraudulent invocation by\n           Defendant No.1 of the Performance Bank Guarantee in\n           turn invoking the Counter Guarantee baring number\n           2158Fgper000215 dated 20th April, 2015 for an amount\n           of Eur 3,831,589.69 i.e. Inr 28,35,37,637.06; and\n      (c) pass a decree of permanent injunction restraining\n           Defendant No.2 from making any payment whatsoever to\n           Defendant No.1 in terms of the fraudulent invocation\n           dated 21st April, 2015 by Defendant No.1 of the\n           Performance       Bank     Guarantee          baring   No.\n           0834Inc15Cg00075 for an amount of Eur 3,831,589.69\n           i.e. Inr 28,35,37,637.06 valid till 1st July, 2024\"\n\n2.    Claim of Bhel is that it is a public sector undertaking of the\nGovernment of India and Egi is a State owned company duly incorporated\nunder the laws of Turkey engaged in the business of power generation and\ntransmission having its office at Ankara, Turkey. AKBank is a privately\nowned commercial bank in Adana and is a banking company carrying on\nbanking activities at Istanbul, Turkey. BoB is yet another International State\nBanking and financial service company with its headquarter at Vadodara,\nGujarat and its branch office at Sansad Marg, New Delhi.\n\n\n\n\nCs(Comm) 190/2017                                                        Page 2 of 27 \n 3.     Egi issued a contract for rehabilitation of eight units of Keban\nHydroelectric Power Plant for which Bhel was engaged as a contractor.\nOn 21st April, 2015 a contract to this effect was entered into between Bhel\nand Egi valued at Euro 63,859,828.24 (Eur Sixty Three Million Eight Fifty\nNine Thousand Eight and Twenty Four Cents only) approximately Inr\n472,56,27,289.76 (Rupees four hundred seventy two crores fifty six lakhs\ntwenty seven thousand two hundred eighty nine and seventy six paise only).\n4.     As per Article 11 of the contract between Bhel and Egi a\nPerformance Bank Guarantee had to be furnished. Accordingly, Bhel got\nissued a Counter Guarantee in favour of AKBank bearing No.\n2158Fgper000215 dated 20th April, 2015 for an amount of Eur\n3,831,589.69 that is Inr 28,35,37,637.06 valid till 16th July, 2024 through\nBoB.\n5.     On the basis of the Counter Guarantee AKBank issued a Performance\nBank Guarantee to Egi bearing No. 0834Inc15Cg00075 for an amount of\nEur 3,831,589.69 i.e. Inr 28,35,37,637.06 valid till 1st July, 2024 in favour\nof Egi. The relevant terms of Performance Bank Guarantee read as under:\n        \"Performance Bond to Elektrik Uretim A.S. Genel Mudurlugu\n        (Euas) date as the firm Messers Bharat Heavy Electricals\n        Limited being the contractor has entered into engagement\n        Keban Hesin 8 Sekiz Unitesinin Rehabilitasyonu as a result of\n        the tender concluded by your administration and since\n        Akbank T.A.S. Guarantees the amount of Eur 3,831,589.69\n        being the value of the performance bond which has to be\n        submitted by the said contractor in order to comply with the\n        provisions of law No. 4734 and 4735 and the tender\n        documents and agreement, we the undersigned as the\n        authorized signatory officials and deputies of Akbank T.A.S.\n        hereby guarantee and declare in the name and for account of\n        Akbank T.A.S. that in case the contractor fails to fulfil his\n\n\n\nCs(Comm) 190/2017                                                       Page 3 of 27\n        contractual obligations in whole or in part in accordance with\n       the aforesaid laws and tender documents and agreement the\n       aforesaid amount shall be paid to your administration upon\n       your first written demand, immediately and without delay in\n       cash and in full, together with the legal interest to accrue for\n       the days elapsing from the date of demand to that of payment,\n       without it being necessary to apply for a notice of protest,\n       obtaining a court order and the consent of the aforesaid\n       contractor and regardless of any dispute that may arise\n       between the aforesaid contractor and your administration and\n       regardless the consequences and legal effects thereof this\n       guarantee will remain valid until 01.07.2024 and will be null\n       and void if no written claim is received by us until said date.\n       In the event of indemnification under this performance bond,\n       the sum of performance bond shall be paid to you in Euro. \n       This guarantee has been issued on the basis of the counter\n       guarantee No. 2158Fgper000215 dated 20 April 2015 given\n       by Bank of Baroda Cfs Branch 16, Parliament Street New\n       Delhi in the amount of Eur 3,831,589.69.\"\n                                                  [Emphasis supplied] \n\n6.    Bhel was informed by BoB that Egi has terminated the contract of\nBhel for renovation and modernisation of Keban Hydroelectric Power\nPlant, Turkey citing the following contractual condition:\n      \"Clause: 26.1. The Contracting Entity shall terminate the\n      Contract in the following cases:\n      If the Contractor does not perform the Contract in accordance\n      with the provisions of the tender document and the Contract or\n      complete the work in time, and if the same situation continues in\n      spite of the written notice of the Contracting Entity for a period\n      specified in this Contract with regard to the application of the\n      delay penalty at the rate stipulated in the Article of the Contract\n      concerning delay penalties\"\n\n7.    Bhel claims that the contract termination letter dated 7 th March,\n2017 is in complete contravention to Article 20 of Law 4735 applicable to\n\n\n\nCs(Comm) 190/2017                                                           Page 4 of 27\n the contract between Bhel and Egi which described the circumstances\nunder which contract can be terminated as under:\n      \"In case the contractor fails to perform its obligations in\n      compliance with provisions of the contract and tender\n      documents or fails to complete works within the period as\n      prescribed, and such state of affairs continues to persist despite\n      contracting entity's warning clearly stating reasons for warning\n      and offering at least 20 days advance notice, with penalty for\n      delay to apply on the basis of the ratio as stated in the tender\n      document. In case it is determined that the contractor has\n      engaged in deeds or behaviours outlawed as stated in Article\n      25.\n\n8.    Bhel claims that though the contract termination letter dated 7th\nMarch, 2017 refers to two notices dated 13 th December, 2016 and 10th\nFebruary, 2017 however, Bhel never received any such written\nletter/notices and thus the termination of contract is completely unjust\nmaking the invocation of Performance Bank Guarantee invalid and hence\nvoid. It is claimed that though the contract between Bhel and Egi was\nsigned on 21st April, 2015 however, effective date of contract was 7th March,\n2016 and the delay of more than ten months was at the end of Egi. Further\ntill date 15% advance payment as per the contract was not released to Bhel\nby Egi. Despite Bhel performing its part of the contract and was waiting\nfor the response after the meeting dated 8th to 10th November, 2016 between\nBhel and Egi, on 9th March, 2017 Bhel received an email from BoB that\nEgi had invoked Performance Bank Guarantee based on the aforesaid\nillegal termination and thus the amount of Counter Guarantee had to be\ncredited to AKBank. It is for this unjust and illegal termination of the\ncontract and since the Performance Bank Guarantee had been fraudulently\n\n\n\n\nCs(Comm) 190/2017                                                          Page 5 of 27\n invoked, the plaintiff i.e. Bhel filed the present suit seeking declaration\nand permanent injunction from encashment of Performance Bank Guarantee\nand Counter Guarantee.\n9 .    In the plaint Bhel has repeatedly stated that jurisdiction of the\nCounter Bank Guarantee being conferred on the Commercial Court at \nLondon , it is impossible for the plaintiff to approach the said jurisdiction at\nsuch short notice. It is also stated that the act of Egi was a clear case of\nfraud and mala fide exercise, hence Bhel was approaching this Court for\nthe prayers as noted above. \n10.   The suit came up before this Court on 10th March, 2017 when this\nCourt in I.A. No. 3842/2017 under Order Xxxix Rule 1 and 2 Cpc passed\nan ex-parte ad-interim injunction restraining BoB from making any payment\nin terms of Performance Bank Guarantee bearing No. 0834Inc15Cg00075\nfor an amount of Eur 3,831,589.69 i.e. 28,35,37,637.06 and Counter\nGuarantee bearing No. 2158Fgper000215 for an amount of Eur\n3,831,589.69, i.e. 28,35,37,637.06 till the next date, which interim order is\ncontinuing till date.\n11.   Defendants were served however, only defendant Nos. 2 and 3, that\nis, AKBank and BoB entered appearance and written statement has been\nfiled by BoB. Further two applications, that is, I.A. No. 5090/2017 under\nOrder Vii Rule 10 and 11 Cpc and I.A. No. 7263/2017 under Order Xxxix\nRule 4 read with Order Vii Rule 10 and 11 Cpc have been filed by\ndefendant No. 2/AKBank and defendant No.3/BoB respectively. Thus the\nthree applications, that is, I.A. Nos. 3182/2017 (under Order Xxxix Rule 1\nand 2 Cpc), 5090/2017 (under Order Vii Rule 10 and 11 by Defendant No.\n2) and 7263/2017 (under Order Xxxix Rule 4 Cpc r/w Order Vii Rule 10\n\n\n\nCs(Comm) 190/2017                                                        Page 6 of 27\n and 11 by Defendant No.3) were heard together. After arguments were\naddressed by learned counsel for AKBank and BoB on their applications,\nBhel filed an application under Order Vi Rule 17 Cpc being I.A. No.\n10152/2017 seeking to amend partly paragraph-25 and whole of paragraph-\n31 of the plaint seeking to withdraw certain averments in relation to the\njurisdiction of the Counter Bank Guarantee being with the Commercial\nCourt at London which application was dismissed by this Court vide order\ndated 5th September, 2017. Hence arguments were addressed by Bhel in\nresponse however, during the course of arguments learned Senior Counsel\nfor Bhel repeatedly relied upon an omnibus agreement between Bhel and\nBoB which was not a part of documents filed along with the plaint nor are\nthere any pleadings in this respect in the plaint.\n12.   Before dealing with the issue of injunction it would be appropriate to\nfirst deal with the issue of territorial jurisdiction as raised by the two\ndefendants, that is, AKBank and BoB in I.A. Nos. 5090/2017 and\n7263/2017. \n13.   Challenging the territorial jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the\npresent suit, learned counsel for AKBank vehemently contends that Article\n37 of the Contract between Bhel and Egi provided that Ankara Courts are\nresponsible for the settlement of dispute arising from the implementation of\nthe contract however, in relation to the Counter Guarantee between AKBank\nand BoB it is specifically stated that the Counter Guarantee is governed by\nEnglish law and the place of jurisdiction is Commercial Court at London.\nThus the exclusive jurisdiction being vested with the Commercial Court at\nLondon this Court has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\n\n\n\n\nCs(Comm) 190/2017                                                          Page 7 of 27 \n 14.   Learned counsel for AKBank further submits that the fact that\nexclusive jurisdiction vests in the Commercial Courts at London for\nadjudication of the Counter Bank Guarantee is repeatedly admitted by\nBhel in its pleading in the plaint and the contention now raised before the\nCourt that interpretation of a document is a question of law is contrary to the\nfurther admission in replies to I.A. Nos. 5090/2017 and 7263/2017 filed by\nBhel stating that the same was a question of fact.          Relying upon the\ndecisions reported as 1974 (1) Scc 242 Nagindas Ramdas vs. Dalpatram\nIchharam @ Brijram & Ors. and 1998 (2) Scc 70 Itc Limited vs. Debt\nRecovery Appellate Tribunal & Ors. it is contended that the admissions are\nthe best proof of facts and Bhel cannot wriggle out of its admission made\nin the plaint and replies to I.A. No. 5090/2012 under Order Vii Rule 10 and\n11 Cpc and 7263/2017 under Order Xxxix Rule 4 Cpc read with Order\nVii Rule 10 and 11 Cpc.\n15.   It is contended that besides the clause of exclusive place of\njurisdiction/territorial jurisdiction with Commercial Courts at London, the\nCounter Guarantee is a contract between AKBank and BoB and AKBank\nneither resides at Delhi nor carries on business or profession within the\njurisdiction of this Court thus no part of cause of action having arisen in\nDelhi, mere issuance of Counter Bank Guarantee by BoB is not sufficient to\nconfer jurisdiction to this Court. Further in the main contract Bhel and\nEgi agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of Courts at Ankara, Turkey. \nFurthermore the amount in terms of the Counter Guarantee issued by BoB to\nAKBank is to be paid outside the jurisdiction of this Court. Reliance is\nplaced on the decision reported as 1996 (3) Scc 443 South East Asia\nShipping Co. Ltd. vs. Nav Bharat Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. and the\n\n\n\nCs(Comm) 190/2017                                                        Page 8 of 27\n decision of the Division Bench of this Court reported as 2016 Scc OnLine\nDel 2485 : (2016) 157 Drj 71 Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network\nOperator vs. Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited which judgment has attained\nfinality as Slp (Civil) No. 13913/2016 has been dismissed by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court vide order dated 5th August, 2017. \n16.   It is further contended that even assuming, though not admitting that\nthis Court has territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit for part of cause of\naction arising at Delhi, dehors the admission of Bhel in view of the\nexclusive jurisdiction vested in the Commercial Court at London and Bank\nGuarantee being an independent contract, this Court will not entertain the\npresent suit . \n17.   Countering arguments of learned counsel for AKBank duly adopted\nby learned counsel for BoB on the issues relating to territorial jurisdiction,\nlearned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Bhel, submitted six\narguments. Firstly, that the relationship between plaintiff Bhel and BoB\nwas governed by an omnibus agreement and the said contract having been\nentered into at Delhi, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit. \nSecondly, since part of cause of action arose in Delhi as the Counter Bank\nGuarantee was issued in Delhi, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the\nsuit. Thirdly the word 'only' is conspicuously missing from the\njurisdictional clause and hence the Commercial Court at London is not\nvested with the exclusive jurisdiction, the contract being a standard form\ncontract and since part of cause of action has taken place in Delhi, this Court\nhas territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit. Fourthly, Egi terminated the\ncontract without any work having been done though the delay was totally\ndue to Egi, thus Egi has played fraud and walked away with encashing the\n\n\n\nCs(Comm) 190/2017                                                           Page 9 of 27\n performance guarantee without fulfilling the conditions required for\nencashment of Performance Bank Guarantee. Hence equity demands and\nsince part of cause of action has arisen in Delhi, the suit filed by Bhel be\nentertained and not rejected on the ground of territorial jurisdiction. Fifthly,\nit is submitted that the reliance of learned counsel for AKBank on the\ndecision reported as 2003 (4) Scc 341 Modi Entertainment Network & Anr.\nvs. Wsg Cricket Pte Ltd. is misconceived for the reason the present is not\nan anti suit injunction but a suit that seeks injunction from invocation of the\nCounter Bank Guarantee. It is further submitted that in Modi Entertainment\n(supra) the Hon'ble Supreme Court relied upon the decision reported as\n1969 (2) Weekly Law Reports 1073 Owners of Cargo lately Laden on\nBoard the Ship or Vessel Eleftheria vs. The Eleftheria (Owners) which\ndescribed the strong and compelling reasons which though mentioned in\nModi Entertainment (supra) but were not explained and the present case\nbeing one of strong and compelling reasons this suit be not returned or\nrejected at the threshold. Sixthly, since the present suit is against Egi,\nAKBank and BoB together as defendants and the three defendants are not\ngoverned by a single contract but different contracts , further plaintiff cannot\nsue BoB either at Ankara or in London nor enforce a decree against BoB\neither at Ankara or London, the same being a meaningless exercise when\nboth Bhel and BoB are situated at Delhi, this Court has territorial\njurisdiction to entertain the present suit. \n18.   Before referring to the rival contentions of the parties it would be\nappropriate to note terms of Counter Bank Guarantee, the invocation\nwhereof is sought to be injuncted by the present suit as the Performance\nBank Guarantee has already been invoked:\n\n\n\nCs(Comm) 190/2017                                                        Page 10 of 27\n        \" Tn Mr. Serdar Keskin Manager Intl Division \n       And Guarantees Dept.

Supreme Court while dealing with the issue of territorial jurisdiction in relation to the bank guarantee in South East Asia (Supra) held:\n\n\n\n\nCS(COMM) 190/2017                                                    Page 13 of 27         3. It is settled law that cause of action consists of bundle of        facts which give cause to enforce the legal injury for redress in        a court of law. The cause of action means, therefore, every        fact, which if traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff        to prove in order to support his right to a judgment of the        court. In other words, it is a bundle of facts, which taken with        the law applicable to them, gives the plaintiff a right to claim        relief against the defendant. It must include some act done by        the defendant since in the absence of such an act no cause of        action would possibly accrue or would arise. In view of the        admitted position that contract was executed in Bombay, i.e.,\n       within the jurisdiction of the High Court of Bombay,\n       performance of the contract was also to be done within the        jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court; merely because bank        guarantee was executed at Delhi and transmitted for        performance to Bombay, it does not constitute a cause of        action to give rise to the respondent to lay the suit on the original side of the Delhi High Court. The contention that the Division Bench was right in its finding and that since the bank guarantee was executed and liability was enforced from the bank at Delhi, the Court got jurisdiction, cannot be sustained. \n20. Dealing with this issue of territorial jurisdiction in case of invocation of bank guarantee in Hellenic Electricity (supra) this Court held:\n\"12. The principle of law that a bank guarantee is an independent contract between the issuing bank and the beneficiary and has no concern with the main contract between the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the bank guarantee has been issued, with reference to territorial jurisdiction of a Court, has to be understood in the context of jurisdiction with reference to the mother contract. The independence of a contract for guarantee simply means that the dispute concerning the bank guarantee has to be resolved in terms of the bank guarantee i.e. the bank guarantee is the complete contract between the bank issuing the guarantee and the beneficiary. But since the bank guarantee flows out of the mother contract the jurisdictional issue has to be resolved in the context of the cause of action arising under the contract for the reason a guarantee is invocable, though in terms of the guarantee, but in relation to the main contract. To wit. Instant guarantee is a performance guarantee. The performance of the contract by the plaintiff has to be in terms of the contract. The bank guarantee simply states that a demand by the beneficiary, alleging non-performance, would require the bank to pay under the bank guarantee. \n13. In the decision reported as (1996) 3 SCC 443 South East Asia Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Nav Bharat Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. noting that the contract between the parties was executed at Bombay and had to be performed at Bombay, it was held that merely because the bank guarantee was executed by a bank at Delhi in terms of the mother contract would not constitute a cause of action at Delhi to a lay a suit to injunct the bank from paying under the guarantee and to restrain the beneficiary from enforcing the right under the guarantee. Concerning jurisdiction under the Consumer Protection Act, in the decision reported as (1999) 8 SCC 357 Union Bank of India v. Seppo Rally OY the Supreme Court held that the consumer fora at the place where the office of the party at whose instance the bank guarantee was furnished would have no jurisdiction to entertain a complaint concerning the bank guarantee furnished by the branch of the bank from the place where the office of the party concerned was situated.\n14. ...\n15. Whether the contract was validly assigned or not and whether defendant No. 2 could enforce the bank guarantee in its favour notwithstanding beneficiary being defendant No. 1 is a matter of substance and has no concern with the issue of territorial jurisdiction. It is a dispute concerning the contract and suffice would it state that whether it is a dispute concerning the contract or relating to a contract or arising out of a contract would make no difference on the issue of territorial jurisdiction. Territorial jurisdiction has to be determined with reference to a cause of action arising under a contract and if there is an exclusive jurisdiction clause vesting jurisdiction in one Court and ousting jurisdiction in others, the same has to be respected. \n16. As we have noted hereinabove, apart from the exclusive jurisdiction clause vesting jurisdiction in the Courts of Athens, no part of cause of action concerning the contract arose in Delhi or for that matter in India. Entire cause of action was in Athens. As held above, issuance of the bank guarantee from Delhi is not a part of the cause of action and territorial jurisdiction cannot be determined with reference to the said fact. \n17. We terminate by holding that the impugned order is contrary to the principles of law and our reasons for disagreement have been noted above. \n[Emphasis supplied] \n21. First and second contentions of learned Senior Counsel for BHEL can be dealt together. Contention that the relationship between BHEL and BoB was governed by an omnibus agreement, the said contract having been entered into at Delhi as the Counter Bank Guarantee was issued in Delhi, therefore, since part of cause of action arose in Delhi this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit is bereft of any pleadings in the plaint on this count or any documents filed by BHEL. Even otherwise as noted in the South East Asia and Hellenic Electricity (Supra) issuance of Bank Guarantee at Delhi, or that BHEL and BoB were bound by an omnibus agreement would not be sufficient to vest territorial jurisdiction on this Court to entertain the suit. Further the prayers in the suit are declaration and permanent injunction qua the Performance Bank Guarantee and the Counter Guarantee, both guarantees specify Courts where jurisdiction is vested. BHEL does not claim any relief in the suit based on the omnibus agreement between BHEL and BoB. The plea regarding the jurisdiction of this Court based on the omnibus agreement is required to be rejected also on the ground that a Bank Guarantee is an independent contract and the existence or non-existence of the underlined contract is irrelevant to a Bank Guarantee. \n22. Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision reported as 2003 (7) SCC 410 National Highways Authority of India vs. Ganga Enterprises held as under:\n\"It is settled law that a contract of guarantee is a complete and separate contract by itself. The law regarding enforcement of an \"on demand bank guarantee\" is very clear. If the enforcement is in terms of the guarantee, then Courts must not interfere with the enforcement of bank guarantee. The Court can only interfere if the invocation is against terms of the guarantee or if there is any fraud. Courts cannot restrain invocation of an \"on demand guarantee\" in accordance with its terms by looking at terms of the underlying contract. The existence or non-existence of an underlying contract become irrelevant when the invocation is in terms of the bank guarantee. The bank guarantee stipulated that if the bid was withdrawn within 120 days or if the performance security was not given or if an Agreement was not signed, the guarantee could be enforced. The bank guarantee was enforced because the bid was withdrawn within 120 days. Therefore, it could not be said that the invocation of the bank guarantee was against the terms of the bank guarantee. If it was in terms of the bank guarantee, one fails to understand as to how the High Court could say that the guarantee could not have been invoked. If the guarantee was rightly invoked, there was no question of directing refund as has been done by the High Court.\" \n23. In respect of the third contention of learned counsel for BHEL that as the word 'only' is conspicuously missing from the jurisdictional clause in the Counter Bank Guarantee, Commercial Court at London is not vested with the exclusive jurisdiction. This contention of learned Senior Counsel deserves to be rejected in view of the decision reported as 1989 (2) SCC 163 A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. vs. A.P. Agencies, Salem wherein it was held:\n21. From the foregoing decisions it can be reasonably deduced that where such an ouster clause occurs, it is pertinent to see whether there is ouster of jurisdiction of other Courts. When the clause is clear, unambiguous and specific accepted notions of contract would bind the parties and unless the absence of ad idem can be shown, the other Courts should avoid exercising jurisdiction, As regards construction of the ouster clause when words like 'alone', 'only, 'exclusive' and the like have been used there may be no difficulty. Even without such words in appropriate cases the maxim 'expressio unius est exclusio alterius' expression of one is the exclusion of another may be applied. What is an appropriate case shall depend on the facts of the case. In such a case mention of one thing may imply exclusion of another. When certain jurisdiction is specified in a contract an intention to exclude all others from its operation may in such cases be inferred. It has therefore to be properly construed. \n24. Further the Supreme Court in the decision reported as 2013 (9) SCC 32 Swastik Gases Pvt. Ltd. vs. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. held:\n32. For answer to the above question, we have to see the effect of the jurisdiction clause in the agreement which provides that the agreement shall be subject to jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata. It is a fact that whilst providing for jurisdiction clause in the agreement the words like 'alone', 'only', 'exclusive' or 'exclusive jurisdiction' have not been used but this, in our view, is not decisive and does not make any material difference. The intention of the parties-by having Clause 18 in the agreement - is clear and unambiguous that the courts at Kolkata shall have jurisdiction which means that the courts at Kolkata alone shall have jurisdiction. It is so because for construction of jurisdiction clause, like Clause 18 in the agreement, the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius comes into play as there is nothing to indicate to the contrary. This legal maxim means that expression of one is the exclusion of another. By making a provision that the agreement is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata, the parties have impliedly excluded the jurisdiction of other courts. Where the contract specifies the jurisdiction of the courts at a particular place and such courts have jurisdiction to deal with the matter, we think that an inference may be drawn that parties intended to exclude all other courts. \nA clause like this is not hit by Section 23 of the Contract Act at all. Such clause is neither forbidden by law nor it is against the public policy. It does not offend Section 28 of the Contract Act in any manner. \n32. The above view finds support from the decisions of this Court in Hakam Singh v. Gammon (India) Ltd., (1971) 1 SCC 286, A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v. A.P. Agencies, Salem, (1989) 2 SCC 163, R.S.D.V. Finance Co. Pvt. Ltd. v. Shree Vallabh Glass Works Ltd., (1993) 2 SCC 130, Angile Insulations v. Davy Ashmore India Ltd. and Anr., (1995) 4 SCC 153, Shriram City Union Finance Corporation Limited v. Rama Mishra, (2002) 9 SCC 613, Hanil Era Textiles Ltd. v. Puromatic Filters (P) Ltd. MANU / SC/0348/2004 : (2004) 4 SCC 671 and Balaji Coke Industry Private Limited v. Maa Bhagwati Coke Gujarat Private Limited (2009) 9 SCC 403 . \" \n25. The fourth contention of learned Senior Counsel for BHEL that equity demands and that since part of cause of action has taken place at Delhi, the suit filed by BHEL be entertained and not rejected on the ground of territorial jurisdiction for the reason that EGI played a fraud and walked away with encashing the Performance Bank Guarantee without fulfilling the conditions required therein for encashment of Performance Bank Guarantee though not required to be considered by this Court at this stage for the reason it will be for the Court which has territorial jurisdiction to decide whether the encashment of the Bank Guarantee was vitiated with fraud or not however, it would be apposite to note the following decisions of the Supreme Court. In the decision reported as AIR 1996 SC 2268: 1996 (5) SCC 34 Hindustan Steel Works Construction Ltd. vs. Tarapore & Co. it was observed:\n\"We are, therefore, of the opinion that the correct position of law is that commitment of banks must be honoured free from interference by the courts and it is only in exceptional cases, that is to say, in case of fraud or in a case where irretrievable injustice would be done if bank guarantee is allowed to be encashed, the court should interfere. In this case fraud has not been pleaded and the relief for injunction was sought by the contractor/Respondent No. 1 on the ground that special equities or the special circumstances of the case required it. The special circumstances and/or special equities which have been pleaded in this case are that there is a serious dispute on the question as to who has committed breach of the contract, that the contractor has a counter claim against the appellant, that the disputes between the parties have been referred to the arbitrators and that no amount can be said to be due and payable by the contractor to the appellant till the arbitrators declare their award. In our opinion, these factors are not sufficient to make this case an exceptional case justifying interference by restraining the appellant from enforcing the bank guarantees. The High Court was, therefore, not right in restraining the appellant from enforcing the bank guarantees.\" \n26. In 1997 (1) SCC 568 U.P. State Sugar Corporation vs. Sumac International Ltd. the Hon'ble Supreme Court also noted:\n\"12. The law relating to invocation of such bank guarantees is by now well settled. When in the course of commercial dealings an unconditional bank guarantee is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. The bank giving such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. The very purpose of giving such a bank guarantee would otherwise be defeated. The Courts should, therefore, be slow in granting an injunction to restrain the realization of such a bank guarantee. The Courts have carved out only two exceptions. A fraud in connection with such a bank guarantee would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee. Hence if there is such a fraud of which the beneficiary seeks to take advantage, he can be restrained from doing so. The second exception relates to cases where allowing the encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned. Since in most cases payment of money under such a bank guarantee would adversely affect the bank and its customer at whose instance the guarantee is given, the harm or injustice contemplated under this head must be of such an exceptional and irretrievable nature as would override the terms of the guarantee and the adverse effect of such an injunction on commercial dealings in the country. The two grounds are not necessarily connected, though both may co- exist in some cases. \n...... \n14. On the question of irretrievable injury which is the second exception to the rule against granting of injunctions when unconditional bank guarantees are sought to be realised the Court said in the above case that the irretrievable injury must be of the kind which was the subject-matter of the decision in the Itek Corporation case (566 Fed Supp. 1210) (supra). In that case an exporter in the U.S.A. entered into an agreement with the Imperial Government of Iran and sought an order terminating its liability on stand by letters of credit issued by an American Bank in favour of an Iranian Bank as part of the contract. The relief was sought on account of the situation created after the Iranian revolution when the American Government cancelled the export licences in relation to Iran and the Iranian Government had forcibly taken 52 American citizens as hostages. The U.S. Government had blocked all Iranian assets under the jurisdiction of United States and had cancelled the export contract. The Court upheld the contention of the exporter that any claim for damages against the purchaser if decreed by the American Courts would not be executable in Iran under these circumstances and realisation of the bank guarantee/letters of credit would cause irreparable harm to the Plaintiff. This contention was upheld. To avail of this exception, therefore, exceptional circumstances which make it impossible for the guarantor to reimburse himself if he ultimately succeeds, will have to be decisively established. Clearly, a mere apprehension that the other party will not be able to pay, is not enough. In the Itek case (supra) there was a certainty on this issue. Secondly, there was good reason, in that case for the Court to be prima facie satisfied that the guarantors i.e. the bank and its customer would be found entitled to receive the amount paid under the guarantee. \n15. Our attention was invited to a number of decisions on this issue -- among them, to Larsen & Toubro Ltd. v.\nMaharashtra State Electricity Board (1995) 6 SCC 68 and Hindustan Steel Workers Construction Ltd. v. G.S. Atwal & Co. (Engineers) Pvt. Ltd. (1995) 6 SCC 76 as also to National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd. v. Flowmore Pvt. Ltd. (1995) 4 SCC 515. The latest decision is in the case of State of Maharashtra v. National Construction Company, Bombay (1996) 1 SCC 735 where this Court has summed up the position by stating:\n\"The rule is well established that a bank issuing a guarantee is not concerned with the underlying contract between the parties to the contract. The duty of the bank under a performance guarantee is created by the documents itself. Once the documents are in order the bank giving the guarantee must honour the same and make payment ordinarily unless there is an allegation of fraud or the like. The Courts will not interfere directly or indirectly to withhold payment, otherwise trust in commerce internal and international would be irreparably damaged. But that does not mean that the parties to the underlying contract cannot settle the disputes with respect to allegations of breach by resorting to litigation or arbitration as stipulated in the contract. The remedy arising ex contractu is not burred and the cause of action for the same is independent of enforcement of the guarantee.\"\n27. Relying upon the decision in Eleftheria (supra) learned Senior Counsel for BHEL advanced his fifth and sixth submissions that there are strong and compelling reasons for this Court to entertain the present suit, the essence of jurisdictional laws in Indian Courts being that the payments had already been made by AKBank to EGI under the Performance Bank Guarantee, the lis in the present suit is between BHEL and BoB which both parties are situated in the jurisdiction of this Court and even if a decree is granted in favour of BHEL and against BoB it will have to be executed in Delhi and the Commercial Court at London has no connect with any of the parties before the Court. \n28. In Eleftheria (supra) the Court summarized the principles in relation to the territorial jurisdiction as under:\n\"The principles established by the authorities can, I think, be summarized as follows: (1) Where plaintiffs sue in England in breach of an agreement to refer disputes to a foreign court, and defendants apply for a stay , the English court, assuming the claim to be otherwise within its jurisdiction, is not bound to grant a stay but has a discretion whether to do so or not. (2) The discretion should be exercised by granting a stay unless strong cause for not doing so is shown. (3) The burden of proving such strong cause is on plaintiffs. (4)In exercising its discretion the court should take into account all the circumstances of the particular case. (5) In particular, but without prejudice to (4) the following matters, where they arise, may properly be regarded: -(A) In what country the evidence on the issues of fact is situated, or more readily available, and the effect of that on the relative convenience and expense of trial as between the English and foreign courts. \n(b) Whether the law of the foreign court applies and, if so, whether it differs from English law in any material respects.\n(c) With what country either party is connected, and how closely. (d) Whether defendants genuinely desire trial in the foreign country, or are only seeking procedural advantages. \n(e) Whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in the foreign court because they would: (i) be deprived of security for that claim; (ii) be unable to enforce any judgment obtained; (iii) be faced with a time-bar not applicable in England; or (iv) for political, racial, religious or other reasons be unlikely to get a fair trial.\n29. Even as noted in the points of arguments on behalf of BHEL though under Indian law territorial jurisdiction cannot be conferred on a Court where it does not exist however, the parties may agree to vest jurisdiction in a foreign Court being a neutral venue. In Modi Entertainment (supra) the Hon'ble Supreme Court held:\n\"11. In regard to jurisdiction of courts under the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) over a subject-matter one or more courts may have jurisdiction to deal with it having regard to the location of immovable property, place of residence or work of a defendant or place where cause of action has arisen. Where only one Court has jurisdiction it is said to have exclusive jurisdiction; where more courts than one have jurisdiction over a subject-matter, they are called courts of available or natural jurisdiction. The growing global commercial activities gave rise to the practice of the parties to a contract agreeing beforehand to approach for resolution of their disputes thereunder, to either any of the available courts of natural jurisdiction and thereby create an exclusive or non-exclusive jurisdiction in one of the available forums or to have the disputes resolved by a foreign court of their choice as a neutral forum according to the law applicable to that court. It is a well-settled principle that by agreement the parties cannot confer jurisdiction, where none exists, on a court to which CPC applies, but this principle does not apply when the parties agree to submit to the exclusive or non-exclusive jurisdiction of a foreign court; indeed in such cases the English Courts do permit invoking their jurisdiction. Thus, it is clear that the parties to a contract may agree to have their disputes resolved by a Foreign Court termed as a 'neutral court' or 'court of choice' creating exclusive or non-exclusive jurisdiction in it.\"\n30. From the decisions noted above, it is settled that if the cause of action has taken place in India and the Indian law applies, the parties cannot choose to vest territorial jurisdiction to try the suit in a Court which does not have the jurisdiction though they may agree to vest exclusive jurisdiction in one of such Court having jurisdiction, however, where one party is not subject to the law of India, the parties may vest jurisdiction outside the country in a neutral forum as has been done in the present case. The cause of action in the present case does not arise by virtue of the omnibus agreement between BHEL and BoB as there is no prayer in respect of the omnibus agreement to be enforced or violation thereof alleged but of the Counter Guarantee and the Performance Bank Guarantee which both vest jurisdiction in Courts outside India. It is in this light that the circumstances noted in Eleftheria (supra) have to be looked into i.e. the evidence on issues of fact situated in or more readily available, the effect of relative convenience and expense of trial, the law applicable, with which country either party is connected, whether defendant genuinely desires trial or is only seeking procedural advantage or whether the plaintiff is prejudiced by suing in a foreign court or deprived of the security of his claim or unable to enforce any judgment obtained etc. As per the pleadings in the plaint, the plea taken by BHEL is not of expense or procedure or the law of England being different or that conditions are such that BHEL cannot proceed against the parties at London but is paucity of time which is not one of the grounds recognized. Even if this Court accepts that paucity of time is one of the grounds, time can be granted to BHEL to approach the Court of competent jurisdiction. Claim of BHEL being not based on the omnibus agreement but on the basis of Performance Bank Guarantee and Counter Guarantee, conditions as noted in Eleftheria (supra) are not applicable to the present case and hence the contentions raised in terms of fifth and sixth submissions also deserve to be rejected.\n31. Even though learned counsel for AKBank harps on the admissions made by BHEL in the plaint that the Commercial Court at London has the exclusive jurisdiction to try the suit and the present suit was filed only because of paucity of time for BHEL to approach the Court of competent jurisdiction, dehors the admission of BHEL this Court finds that it has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the present suit, for it is well settled that contract of Bank Guarantee is an independent contract and merely because the same was issued at the place within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and that the word 'only' is missing from the Counter Bank Guarantee clause, the same would not vest this Court with the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the plaint.\n32. Consequently, the plaint is directed to be returned to be filed in the Court of competent jurisdiction however, since there is an ad-interim order in favour of BHEL since 10th March, 2017 and it would take some time for BHEL to approach the Court of competent jurisdiction the interim order dated 10th March, 2017 is extended for a further period of 45 days so that BHEL can approach the Court of competent jurisdiction. CS(COMM) 190/2017 is accordingly disposed of directing the plaint to be returned with liberty as noted above. \n33. I.A. No. 3182/2017 is dismissed and I.A. Nos. 5090/2017 and 7263/2017 are disposed of. \n34. I.A. No. 9057/2017 under Order VIII Rule 1 CPC by defendant No.2 seeking extension of time in filing written statement is disposed of as infructuous. The date of 2nd November, 2017 fixed before the learned Joint Registrar is cancelled. \n(MUKTA GUPTA) JUDGE SEPTEMBER 19, 2017 'vn'",

to thrash out the underlying truth in every dispute. therefore, the court should take a lenient view when an application is made for production of the documents under subrule (3).\" 2. this case, i may observe, is a textbook example of the manner in which the provisions of the cpc and article 227 of the constitution of india are being twisted out of shape, to capitalize on what, at the highest, was an inadvertent error on the part of the plaintiff while naming the proprietor of the defendant proprietorship firm in the memo of parties in the suit instituted by the plaintiff against the defendant. the dispute, in precis 3. in substance, the dispute may be crystallized thus. 4. cs(comm) 46/2020 was instituted by the respondent, as the plaintiff, against \"m/s. raj power projects, a proprietorship firm c/o mr. tarun sehgal\". 5. the written statement, filed by way of response to the plaint, was admittedly filed not by tarun sehgal but by amit aggarwal, the actual proprietor of m/s. raj power projects (hereinafter, \"rpp\"). 6. the respondent, as plaintiff, thereupon filed an amended memo of parties, replacing the defendant with \"amit bansal @ amit aggarwal, proprietor of m/s. raj power project\". by order dated 9 th march 2021, the amended memo of parties was permitted to be taken on record. 7. the respondent, thereafter, moved an application under order vi rule 17 of the cpc, along with an amended plaint, seeking only to amend the para 3 of the plaint, by replacing, as the defendant, \"amit bansal @ amit aggarwal, proprietor of m/s. raj power project\", in place of \"m/s. raj power projects, a proprietorship firm c/o mr. tarun sehgal\". no other change was sought. the respondent did not seek to make any change in the body of the plaint. 8. the said application was allowed by the learned district judge (commercial courts) (\"the learned commercial court\") vide order dated 29th july 2022. 9. said order is sought to be challenged, by the petitioner amit bansal, by means of the present petition instituted under article 227 of the constitution of india. 10. i have heard, at length, mr mohit kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner. 11. mr. mohit kumar does not seek to contend that, apart from the replacement, in the memo of parties accompanying the plaint, of the designation of the defendant as above, essentially replacing amit bansal in place of tarun sehgal as the proprietor of rpp, there is any change in the averments in the plaint or in any other part thereof. nonetheless, he has painstakingly sought to contend that even though the written statement filed by his client amit bansal acknowledged the fact that amit bansal was indeed the proprietor of rpp, the respondent ought not to have been permitted to replace the name of the proprietor in the memo of parties. in other words, what mr. mohit kumar would seek to contend is that, as rpp was impleaded through tarun sehgal as its proprietor, the petitioner was not entitled, at any later point of time, to correct the error and implead amit bansal as proprietor of rpp in place of tarun sehgal. 12. it is unfortunate that such a contention has been raised. while the cpc does provide a veritable armoury of procedural provisions on the basis of which a suit could be contested, its provisions are not intended to enable either party to take unfair advantage of an inadvertent error committed by the other, of the nature involved in the present petition. what mr mohit kumar would seek to contend is that the entire suit of the respondent should be thrown out at the threshold, merely because the proprietor of the defendant-proprietorship was wrongly named as tarun sehgal instead of amit bansal, and that the respondent should be completely denied an opportunity of correcting the error. 13. it is even more unfortunate that article 227 of the constitution of india has been invoked in aid of such a plea and nearly an hour of court time has been expended in attempting to convince the court that the petitioner ought not to have been permitted to implead the correct proprietor amit bansal in place of tarun sehgal. facts 14. given the limited nature of controversy, it is not necessary to enter into the specifics of the dispute raised by the respondent in his plaint, and a brief recital would suffice. 15. the plaint was in the nature of a money suit, claiming recovery, from rpp, of ₹ 27,08,912/along with interest @ 24% per annum with effect from 30th september 2015. according to the recitals in the plaint, in response to a purchase order dated 24 th august 2015, placed on the respondent by m/s. srs real infrastructure limited (hereinafter, \"srs\"), dg sets, control panels, and like goods were supplied by the respondent. according to the agreement between the respondent and srs, rpp was to raise invoices, against the goods supplied by the respondent to srs and payment was required to be released against such invoices by srs to rpp. rpp was, thereafter, required to release the said payments to the respondent. 16. according to the assertions in the plaint, in terms of the aforesaid agreement, goods worth ₹ 28,80,000/were supplied by the respondent and two invoices dated 19th november 2015, of ₹ 14,40,000/each, were raised by rpp on srs in that regard. the goods functioned satisfactorily and no complaint was raised by any party. rpp was, therefore, required to release, to the respondent, ₹ 27,08,912/-. 17. as the said amount had not been released, the respondent, as already noted hereinbefore, instituted the aforesaid suit against rpp under order xxxvii of the cpc. summons of the suit were served by the learned commercial court on amit bansal, the petitioner in the present petition, as he was the actual proprietor of rpp. 18. in the written statement filed by the petitioner amit bansal in response to the said summons, while initially observing that the respondent had not impleaded the petitioner but had instead filed the suit \"against some raj power projects through its sole proprietor tarun sehgal\", the assertions in the plaint, were, nonetheless answered on merits purportedly \"to avoid any complexity and as per law\". it is not necessary to enter into the assertions on merits in the written statement filed by the petitioner in response to the plaint. 19. the memo of parties filed with the suit read thus: \"memo of parties m/s. c & s himoinsa pvt. ltd, through· its authorized representative having its office at:222, okhla industrial estate, phase iii, new delhi-110020 .plaintiff versus raj power projects a proprietorship firm, c/o mr. tarun sehgal, having its office at: 203, laxmi nagar, delhi 110025 . defendant\" 20. purportedly, on the ground that the petitioner had come to know from the written statement filed by the petitioner that it was the petitioner, and not tarun sehgal, who was the proprietor of rpp, the petitioner filed an amended memo of parties in cs(comm) 47/2020, which read as under: \"amended memo of parties m/s csh power himoinsa private limited through its authorized representative having its office at:222, okhla industrial estate phase iii, new delhi -110020 .plainitff versus amit bansal @ amit agarwal proprietor of m/s raj power projects . having office at :52, agarwal chernber l, main vikas marg, shakarpur, new delhi110092. also at:1/50, lalita park, laxmi nagar, new delhi110092 .defendant\" 21. by order dated 9th march 2021, the learned commercial court allowed the aforesaid amended memo of parties to be taken on record. the order read thus: \"09.3.2021 present:shri manas tripathi ld. counsel for plaintiff. none for defendant. amended memo of parties filed by the plaintiff as per the objection placed by the defendant on the last date, making shri amit bansal/aggarwal as the defendant/proprietor of m/s raj power projects. copy retained. ws has already been filed by said shri amit bansal. further time sought for filing replication. allowed and last opportunity granted subject to furnishing advance copy to ld. counsel for defendant. put up for framing of issues and case management hearing on 03.05.2021.\" 22. on 23rd october 2021, an objection was raised, by the petitioner, to the effect that the suit instituted by the respondent did not seek any relief against him, as the person sued was tarun sehgal and not the petitioner. the learned commercial court observed, in this regard, as under: \"ld. counsel for the defendant submits that no relief has been sought against him in the suit since the suit was filed against tarun sehgal showing him as proprietor of the defendant firm whereas the proprietor of the firm is shri amit bansal @ amit aggarwal. it is to be noted that vide order dated 09.03.2021, the amendment sought in the name of the proprietor was allowed and shri amit bansal was substituted as the proprietor of the defendant firm. ws has already been filed on his behalf. hence, this objection if any, shall be taken/considered at an appropriate stage. ld. counsel for the defendant submits that he do not intend to file any affidavit of admission/denial of documents. it will ensue result as per the law.\" 23. the respondent, thereafter, moved an application on or around 13th april 2022, under order vi rule 17 of the cpc, seeking to amend the plaint. the only amendment sought in the said application was the substitution, of the defendant in the plaint, earlier sued as tarun sehgal with the name of the petitioner, i.e. amit bansal. para 6 of the application filed by the respondent under order vi rule 17 of the cpc reads thus: \"6. by way of the present application for amendment of the plaint, the plaintiff prays for substitution of the name of mr. amit bansal @ sh. amit agganval in place of mr. tarun sehgal in paragraph no. 3 of the plaint.\" no other change was proposed in the plaint. 24. the aforesaid application stands allowed by the learned commercial court vide impugned order dated 29th july 2022. 25. the petitioner, opposing the application filed by the respondent before the learned commercial court, sought to dispute the assertion of the respondent that the respondent had come to learn that amit bansal was the proprietor of rpp consequent on the written statement filed by way of response to the suit. it was sought to contend that the respondent was aware, ab initio, that the proprietor of rpp was indeed amit bansal and not tarun sehgal. certain documents, including emails exchanged between the parties, were sought to be relied upon, in that regard. the learned commercial court has not accepted this contention as raised by the petitioner, while opposing the application of the respondent under order vi rule 17 of the cpc. 26. the petitioner also sought to contend that, by the proposed amendment cause of action in the suit was being materially altered. on this aspect, the learned commercial court has observed thus, in para 5.1 of the impugned order dated 29th july 2022: \"5.1 the other objection that the amendment sought would change the nature of the suit, embellish the alleged cause of action or change the relief against a person impleaded in the original suit are not justified and tenable. the nature of the suit would remain the same, i.e. for recovery of an unpaid amount, the facts would remain the same and even the name of the defendant firm would remain the same. the present application was filed on 13.4.2022 after the objection raised by the firm were disposed of.\" 27. thereafter, paras 5.2 and 5.3 of the impugned order dated 29th july 2022 read thus: \"5.2 it is not disputed that transactions did took place between the plaintiff company and m/s raj power projects. the only dispute is regarding the name of the proprietor. since a proprietorship firm is not a legal entity, the suit has to be filed in the name of its proprietor. the error, as aforesaid, could have been rectified by this court suo moto. reference can be made to the provisions of order 1 rule (2) cpc which are reproduced as under: \"the court may at any stage of the proceedings, either upon or without the application of either party, and on such terms as may appear to the court to be just, order that the name of any parties improperly joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, be struck out and that the name of any person who ought to have been joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, or whose presence before the court maybe necessary in order to enable the court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all question involved in the suit, be added.\" 5.3 it is, thus, clear from the above provision that any person whose name has been wrongly or improperly joined can be struck off by the court and similarly, the name of the person who ought to have been joined can be added even without application.\" 28. reasoning thus, the learned commercial court has allowed the respondent's application and has permitted the replacement of tarun sehgal, as proprietor of rpp, named in the original memo of parties, with amit bansal, i.e. the present petitioner. 29. this position has been carried, by the petitioner to this court in the present proceedings under article 227 of the constitution of india. submissions 30. mr. mohit kumar contended that the application for amendment had been moved after trial had commenced, as he sought to place reliance, for the said purpose, on the judgment of the supreme court in kailash v. nanhku2 and ajendraprasadji n. pande v. swami keshavprakeshdasji n. 3 he drew my attention, in this context, the order dated 1st december 2021, passed by the learned commercial courts which reads thus: \"01.12.2021 present: proxy for ld. counsel for the plaintiff ms. meenakshi gupta proxy counsel for the defendant affidavit of admission-denial of documents filed on behalf of the plaintiff. copy supplied. pleadings are complete. from the pleadings of the parties, following issues are hereby framed: (2005) 4 scc 480 (2006) 12 scc 1 issues: 1) whether the plaintiff is entitled for a decree against the defendant in the sum of rs.27,08,912/alongwith interest, if any and if yes, at what rate and for which period? opp 2) whether the suit is bad for non-joinder and mis-joinder of parties? opd 3) whether this court has no territorial jurisdiction to try and decide the present suit?opd 4) whether there was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendant? opd 5) relief. no other issue arises or is pressed for. let list of witnesses alongwith their affidavit be filed within three weeks by both the parties after exchanging copies. put up for case management hearing on 20.1.2022.\" 31. according to mr. mohit kumar, with the passing of the aforesaid order dated 1st december 2021, the trial had commenced. in this context, mr. mohit kumar also placed reliance on order xv a of the cpc as amended by the commercial courts act, 2015, which deals with \"case management hearing\". he has drawn especial attention to clause (d) of order xv a rule 2 of the cpc, which read thus: \"2. orders to be passes in a case management hearing. in a case management hearing, after hearing the parties, and once it finds that there are issues of fact and law which require to be tried, the court may pass an order (a) framing the issues between the parties in accordance with order xiv of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) after examining pleadings, documents and documents produced before it, and on examination conducted by the court under rule 2 of order x, if required; (b) listing witnesses to be examined by the parties; (c) fixing the date by which affidavit of evidence to be filed by parties; (d) fixing the dates on which evidence of the witnesses of the parties to be recorded; (e) fixing the date by which written arguments are to be filed before the court by the parties; (f) fixing the date on which oral arguments are to be heard by the court; and (g) setting time limits for parties and their advocates to address oral arguments.\" 32. trial having, thus, according to mr. mohit kumar, already commenced when the application for amendment under order vi rule 17 of the cpc was filed by the respondent, the prayer for amendment could not be granted unless the respondent was able to establish that despite due diligence, the details sought to be incorporated by amendment could not have been pleaded at the time when the suit was filed, under the proviso to order vi rule 17. inasmuch as the respondent was aware even at the time of filing of the suit that the proprietor of rpp was amit bansal and not tarun sehgal, mr. mohit kumar would seek to submit that, by application of the proviso to order vi rule 17 of the cpc, the amendment sought had necessarily to be refused, rather than granted. 33. mr. mohit kumar has further submitted that a proprietorship has no independent existence in law. a proprietorship, he submits, is merely a name by which the proprietor is granted colour of business. he submits that, therefore, by substituting tarun sehgal, as the proprietor of rpp, with amit bansal, i.e. the present petitioner, effectively an entirely new suit, against amit bansal, had been filed. this, submits mr. mohit kumar, amounts to a complete alteration of the cause of action, inasmuch as, in the original plaint, there was no cause of action pleaded against the petitioner amit bansal. even on the ground that an amendment cannot seek materially to alter the cause of action pleaded in the plaint, mr. mohit kumar would seek to submit that the learned commercial court ought to have refused the prayer for amendment. 34. juxtaposed with this submission, mr. mohit kumar has also sought to contend that amendment could not have been allowed, as the suit would be time barred against amit bansal on the date when the application for amendment was filed. a time barred plaint, he submits, it is well known, cannot be sought to be introduced by amendment. 35. mr. mohit kumar has advanced, as his final ground to attack the impugned order, the fact that the title of the suit, as contained in the body of the plaint, read \"m/s c&s himoinsa pvt ltd v. raj power projects\", without mentioning the name of the proprietor. he submits that, as thus filed, the suit was itself liable to be dismissed, as the proprietorship could not be sued without save and except in the name of its proprietor. he seeks to discountenance the fact that the suit was accompanied by a memo of parties, in which the name of the proprietor tarun sehgal, as the respondent claimed to have believed at that time had indeed been mentioned, submitting that the memo of parties was not the part of the body of the plaint and that the cpc required the correct parties to be represented in the title of the suit in the body of the plaint. analysis 36. having heard mr. mohit kumar and examined the material on record, i am convinced that this petition is not only completely devoid of merit, but is an overt attempt to protract proceedings in the suit. 37. the facts speak for themselves. the only amendment that the respondent had sought to carry out was in the name of the proprietor of the defendant firm, in the memo of parties appended thereto. the defendant firm had, originally, in the memo of parties filed with the suit, been represented as \"raj power projects through tarun sehgal\". the written statement, in response to the suit was, admittedly filed by amit bansal as the proprietor of rpp. amit bansal is, admittedly, the proprietor of rpp. the petitioner merely sought, therefore, to substitute, in place of tarun sehgal, amit bansal, as the proprietor of rpp, in the memo of parties. 38. it cannot be said even by the farthest stretch of imagination that, thereby, there was any alteration, far less material alteration, in the plaint or in the cause of action, facts or grounds urged therein. the plaint remained a suit for recovery against rpp. as the proprietor of rpp had wrongly been named, in the memo of parties, as tarun sehgal, instead of amit bansal, the error was sought to be rectified. that was all. 39. it is ex facie absurd to contend that, thereby, the respondent was instituting a new suit against amit bansal, which was, by then, barred by time. 40. the submission of mr. mohit kumar that, by the amendment, the plaint was materially altered, is, therefore, rejected outright. 41. the submission of mr. mohit kumar, in this regard, that there was a change in the cause of action in the suit as the original suit did not sue the petitioner amit bansal, but instead sued tarun sehgal, has also merely to be urged to be rejected. the defendant in the suit was rpp. rpp was, admittedly, a proprietorship concern. its proprietor was again, admittedly, amit bansal, the present petitioner. again, admittedly, the suit had sued rpp, as the defendant in the suit. it is not as though the plaintiff was seeking to substitute rpp with a new defendant. the only change that the plaintiff had sought to effect was in the identified of the proprietor of the defendant proprietorship firm as amit bansal instead of tarun sehgal. that amit bansal was indeed the proprietor of the defendant firm rpp is not in dispute. 42. this court is completely befuddled, in the circumstances, at the submission of mr. mohit kumar that the amendment sought materially to alter the cause of action in the plaint or sought to substitute the earlier existing cause of action with a new cause of action. 43. for the same reason, it cannot be said that the amendment proposed was introducing a cause of action which was barred by time. at the cost of repetition, rpp was sued earlier and rpp itself continues to be sued even now. the mere correction in the name of the rpp in the memo of parties can hardly be said to have resulted in the suit being barred by time. 44. on the scope of order vi rule 17 of the cpc, the judgments of the supreme court are legion, the most recent decision being rendered on 1st september 2022 by a bench of two hon'ble judges of the supreme court in lic v. sanjeev builders pvt. ltd.4 paras 19 to 33 of the said decision merit reproduction, thus: \"19. it is well settled that the court must be extremely liberal in granting the prayer for amendment, if the court is of the view that if such amendment is not allowed, a party, who has prayed for such an amendment, shall suffer irreparable loss and injury. it is also equally well settled that there is no absolute rule that in every case where a relief is barred because of limitation, amendment should not be allowed. it is always open to the court to allow an amendment if it is of the view that allowing of an amendment shall really sub-serve the ultimate cause of justice and avoid further litigation. in l.j. leach & co. ltd. v. jardine skinner & co.5, , this court at paragraph 16 of the said decision observed as follows: 2022 scc online sc 1128 air 1957 sc 357 16. it is no doubt true that courts would, as a rule, decline to allow amendments, if a fresh suit on the amended claim would be barred by limitation on the date of the application. but that is a factor to be taken into account in exercise of the discretion as to whether amendment should be ordered, and does not affect the power of the court to order it, if that is required in the interest of justice.\" 20. again in t.n. alloy foundry co. ltd. v. t.n. electricity board,6 this court observed as follows: \"2. .the law as regards permitting amendment to the plaint, is well settled. in l.j. leach and co. ltd. v. jardine skinner and co.5 it was held that the court would as a rule decline to allow amendments, if a fresh suit on the amended claim would be barred by limitation on the date of the application. but that is a factor to be taken into account in exercise of the discretion as to whether amendment should be ordered, and does not affect the power of the court to order it. 3. it is not disputed that the appellate court has a coextensive power of the trial court. we find that the discretion exercised by the high court in rejecting the plaint was in conformity with law.\" 21. so far as the answer to the specific plea that the claim of damages is barred by limitation and cannot be permitted at this stage is concerned, it becomes necessary to examine the various judicial pronouncements of this court. the principles governing an amendment which may be permitted even after the expiry of the statutory period of limitation were laid down by the privy council in its judgment in charan das v. amir khan7. in this case, the privy council laid down the principles thus: (2004) 3 scc 392 air 1921 pc 50 \".that there was full power to make the amendment cannot be disputed, and though such a power should not as a rule be exercised where its effect is to take away from a defendant a legal right which has accrued to him by lapse of time, yet there are cases : see for example mohummud zahoor ali v. rutta koe, where such considerations are outweighed by the special circumstances of the case, and their lordships are not prepared to differ from the judicial commissioner in thinking that the present case is one.\" 22. it would be useful to also notice the observations of this court in, pirgonda hongonda patil v. kalgonda shidgonda patil8, wherein this court considered an objection to the amendment on the ground that the same amounted to a new case and a new cause of action. in this case, this court laid down the principles which would govern the exercise of discretion as to whether the court ought to permit an amendment of the pleadings or not. this court approved the observations of batchelor, j., in the case of kisandas rupchand v. rachappa vithoba shilwant 9, when he laid down the principles thus: \"10. .\"all amendments ought to be allowed which satisfy the two conditions (a) of not working injustice to the other side, and (b) of being necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties . but i refrain from citing further authorities, as, in my opinion, they all lay down precisely the same doctrine. that doctrine, as i understand it, is that amendments should be refused only where the other party cannot be placed in the same position as if the pleading had been originally correct, but the amendment would cause him an injury which could not be compensated in costs. it is merely a particular case of this general rule that where a plaintiff seeks to amend by setting up a fresh claim in respect of a cause of action which since the institution of the suit had become barred by limitation, the amendment must 1957 scr 595 ilr (1909) 33 bom 644 be refused; to allow it would be to cause the defendant an injury which could not be compensated in costs by depriving him of a good defence to the claim. the ultimate test therefore still remains the same : can the amendment be allowed without injustice to the other side, or can it not?\".\" 23. this court has repeatedly held that the power to allow an amendment is undoubtedly wide and may be appropriately exercised at any stage in the interests of justice, notwithstanding the law of limitation. in this behalf, in ganga bai v. vijay kumar10, this court held thus: \"22. .the power to allow an amendment is undoubtedly wide and may at any stage be appropriately exercised in the interest of justice, the law of limitation notwithstanding. but the exercise of such far-reaching discretionary powers is governed by judicial considerations and wider the discretion, greater ought to be the care and circumspection on the part of the court.\" 24. again in ganesh trading co. v. moji ram11, , this court laid down the principles thus: \"4. it is clear from the foregoing summary of the main rules of pleadings that provisions for the amendment of pleadings, subject to such terms as to costs and giving of all parties concerned necessary opportunities to meet exact situations resulting from amendments, are intended for promoting the ends of justice and not for defeating them. even if a party or its counsel is inefficient in setting out its case initially the shortcoming can certainly be removed generally by appropriate steps taken by a party which must no doubt pay costs for the inconvenience or expense caused to the other side from its omissions. the error is not incapable of being rectified so long as remedial steps do not unjustifiably injure rights accrued.\" (1974) 2 scc 393 (1978) 2 scc 91 25. the principles applicable to the amendments of the plaint are equally applicable to the amendments of the written statements. the courts are more generous in allowing the amendment of the written statement as question of prejudice is less likely to operate in that event. the defendant has a right to take alternative plea in defense which, however, is subject to an exception that by the proposed amendment other side should not be subjected to injustice and that any admission made in favor of the plaintiff is not withdrawn. all amendments of the pleadings should be allowed which are necessary for determination of the real controversies in the suit provided the proposed amendment does not alter or substitute a new cause of action on the basis of which the original lis was raised or defense taken. inconsistent and contradictory allegations in negation to the admitted position of facts or mutually destructive allegations of facts should not be allowed to be incorporated by means of amendment to the pleadings. the proposed amendment should not cause such prejudice to the other side which cannot be compensated by costs. no amendment should be allowed which amounts to or relates in defeating a legal right accruing to the opposite party on account of lapse of time. the delay in filing the application for amendment of the pleadings should be properly compensated by costs and error or mistake which, if not fraudulent, should not be made a ground for rejecting the application for amendment of plaint or written statement. (see south konkan distilleries v. prabhakar gajanan naik12) 26. but undoubtedly, every case and every application for amendment has to be tested in the applicable facts and circumstances of the case. as the proposed amendment of the pleadings amounts to only a different or an additional approach to the same facts, this court has repeatedly laid down the principle that such an amendment would be allowed even after the expiry of statutory period of limitation. 27. in this behalf, in a.k. gupta & sons ltd. v. damodar valley corporation13, this court held thus: (2008) 14 scc 632 air 1967 sc 96 : (1966) 1 scr 796 \"7. .a new case or a new cause of action particularly when a suit on the new case or cause of action is barred: weldon v. neale14. but it is also well recognised that where the amendment does not constitute the addition of a new cause of action or raise a different case, but amounts to no more than a different or additional approach to the same facts, the amendment will be allowed even after the expiry of the statutory period of limitation:.\" 28. in case entitled, g. nagamma v. siromanamma15, this court considered the proposed amendment of the plaint and noticing that neither the cause of action would change nor the relief would be materially affected, allowed the same. this court in this case noticed that in the plaintiff's suit for specific performance, the plaintiff was entitled to plead even inconsistent pleas and that in the present case, the plaintiffs were seeking only the alternative reliefs. it appears that the plaintiffs had filed a suit for specific performance of an agreement of re-conveyance. by the application under order vi rule 17 of the cpc for amendment of the plaint, the appellants were pleading that the transactions of execution of the sale deed and obtaining a document for re-conveyance were single transactions viz. mortgage by conditional sale. they also wanted to incorporate an alternative relief to redeem the mortgage. at the end of the prayer, the plaintiff sought alternatively to grant of a decree for redemption of the mortgage. this amendment was permitted by this court. 29. in pankaja v. yellappa (dead) by lrs.16, this court held that it was in the discretion of the court to allow an application under order vi rule 17 of the cpc seeking amendment of the plaint even where the relief sought to be added by amendment was allegedly barred by limitation. the court noticed that there was no absolute rule that the amendment in such a case should not be allowed. it was pointed out that the court's discretion in this regard depends on the facts and circumstances of the case and has to be exercised on a judicial evaluation thereof. it would be [[l.r.] 19 q.b. 394 (1996) 2 scc 25 (2004) 6 scc 415 apposite to notice the observations of this court in this pronouncement in extenso. the principles were laid down by this court thus: \"12. so far as the court's jurisdiction to allow an amendment of pleadings is concerned, there can be no two opinions that the same is wide enough to permit amendments even in cases where there has been substantial delay in filing such amendment applications. this court in numerous cases has held that the dominant purpose of allowing the amendment is to minimise the litigation, therefore, if the facts of the case so permit, it is always open to the court to allow applications in spite of the delay and laches in moving such amendment application. 13. but the question for our consideration is whether in cases where the delay has extinguished the right of the party by virtue of expiry of the period of limitation prescribed in law, can the court in the exercise of its discretion take away the right accrued to another party by allowing such belated amendments. 14. the law in this regard is also quite clear and consistent that there is no absolute rule that in every case where a relief is barred because of limitation an amendment should not be allowed. discretion in such cases depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. the jurisdiction to allow or not allow an amendment being discretionary, the same will have to be exercised on a judicious evaluation of the facts and circumstances in which the amendment is sought. if the granting of an amendment really subserves the ultimate cause of justice and avoids further litigation the same should be allowed. there can be no straitjacket formula for allowing or disallowing an amendment of pleadings. each case depends on the factual background of that case. ***** 16. this view of this court has, since, been followed by a three-judge bench of this court in the case of t.n. alloy foundry co. ltd. v. t.n. electricity board6 . therefore, an application for amendment of the pleading should not be disallowed merely because it is opposed on the ground that the same is barred by limitation, on the contrary, application will have to be considered bearing in mind the discretion that is vested with the court in allowing or disallowing such amendment in the interest of justice. ***** 18. we think that the course adopted by this court in ragu thilak d. john case17 applies appropriately to the facts of this case. the courts below have proceeded on an assumption that the amendment sought for by the appellants is ipso facto barred by the law of limitation and amounts to introduction of different relief than what the plaintiff had asked for in the original plaint. we do not agree with the courts below that the amendment sought for by the plaintiff introduces a different relief so as to bar the grant of prayer for amendment, necessary factual basis has already been laid down in the plaint in regard to the title which, of course, was denied by the respondent in his written statement which will be an issue to be decided in a trial. therefore, in the facts of this case, it will be incorrect to come to the conclusion that by the amendment the plaintiff will be introducing a different relief.\" 30. from the above, therefore, one of the cardinal principles of law in allowing or rejecting an application for amendment of the pleading is that the courts generally, as a rule, decline to allow amendments, if a fresh suit on the amended claim would be barred by limitation on the date of filing of the application. but that would be a factor to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion as to whether the amendment should be ordered, and does not affect the power of the court to order it, if that is required in the interest of justice. ragu thilak d. john v. s. rayappan, (2001) 2 scc 4 31. in ragu thilak d. john v. s. rayappan17, this court also observed that where the amendment was barred by time or not, was a disputed question of fact and, therefore, that prayer for amendment could not be rejected and in that circumstances the issue of limitation can be made an issue in the suit itself like the one made by the high court in the case on hand. 32. in a decision in vishwambhar v. laxminarayan (dead) through lrs18., this court held that the amendment though properly made cannot relate back to the date of filing of the suit, but to the date of filing of the application. 33. again, in vineet kumar v. mangal sain wadhera19, this court held that if a prayer for amendment merely adds to the facts already on record, the amendment would be allowed even after the statutory period of limitation.\" (emphasis supplied) 45. prior thereto, the scope of order vi rule 17 of the cpc has been underscored by the supreme court in the following passages from b.k. narayana pillai v. parameshwaran pillai 20 and rajesh kumar aggarwal v. k.k. modi21, b.k. narayana pillai20 \"3. the purpose and object of order 6 rule 17 cpc is to allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just. the power to allow the amendment is wide and can be exercised at any stage of the proceedings in the interests of justice on the basis of guidelines laid down by various high courts and this court. it is true that the amendment cannot be claimed as a matter of (2001) 6 scc 163 (1984) 3 scc 352 : air 1985 sc 817 (2000) 1 supreme court cases 712 (2006) 4 scc 385 right and under all circumstances. but it is equally true that the courts while deciding such prayers should not adopt a hypertechnical approach. liberal approach should be the general rule particularly in cases where the other side can be compensated with the costs. technicalities of law should not be permitted to hamper the courts in the administration of justice between the parties. amendments are allowed in the pleadings to avoid uncalled-for multiplicity of litigation. 4. this court in a.k. gupta & sons ltd. v. damodar valley corpn.13 held: \"the general rule, no doubt, is that a party is not allowed by amendment to setup a new case or a new cause of action particularly when a suit on new case or cause of action is barred: weldon v. neal14. but it is also well recognised that where the amendment does not constitute the addition of a new cause of action or raise a different case, but amounts to no more than a different or additional approach to the same facts, the amendment will be allowed even after the expiry of the statutory period of limitation: see charan das v. amir khan7 and l.j. leach and co .ltd. v. jardine skinner and co.5 the principal reasons that have led to the rule last mentioned are, first, that the object of courts and rules of procedure is to decide the rights of the parties and not to punish them for their mistakes (cropper v. smith22) and secondly, that a party is strictly not entitled to rely on the statute of limitation when what is sought to be brought in by the amendment can be said in substance to be already in the pleading sought to be amended (kisandas rupchand v rachappa vithoba shilwant9 approved in pirgonda hongonda patil v. kalgonda shidgonda patil8). the expression „cause of action‟ in the present context does not mean „every fact which it is material to be proved to entitle the plaintiff to succeed‟ as was said in [l.r.] 26 ch.d. 700 cooke v. gill23 in a different context, for if it were so, no material fact could ever be amended or added and, of course, no one would want to change or add an immaterial allegation by amendment. that expression for the present purpose only means, a new claim made on a new basis constituted by new facts. such a view was taken in robinson v. unicos property corpn. ltd.24 and it seems to us to be the only possible view to take. any other view would make the rule futile. the words „new case‟ have been understood to mean „new set of ideas‟: dornan v. j.w. ellis and co. ltd25. this also seems to us to be a reasonable view to take. no amendment will be allowed to introduce a new set of ideas to the prejudice of any right acquired by any party by lapse of time.\" again in ganga bai v. vijay kumar10 this court held: (scc p. 399, para 22) \"the power to allow an amendment is undoubtedly wide and may at any stage be appropriately exercised in the interest of justice, the law of limitation not withstanding. but the exercise of such far-reaching discretionary powers is governed by judicial considerations and wider the discretion, greater ought to be the care and circumspection on the part of the court.\" in ganesh trading co. v. moji ram11 it was held: (scc p. 93, para 4) \"4. it is clear from the foregoing summary of the main rules of pleadings that provisions for the amendment of pleadings, subject to such terms as to costs and giving of all parties concerned necessary opportunities to meet exact situations resulting from amendments, are intended for promoting the ends of justice and no for defeating them. even if a party or its counsel is inefficient in setting out its case initially the [l.r.] 8 c.p. 107 (1962) 2 all er 24 (1962) 1 all er 303 shortcoming can certainly be removed generally by appropriate steps taken by a party which must no doubt pay costs for the inconvenience or expense caused to the other side from its omissions. the error is not incapable of being rectified so long as remedial steps do not unjustifiably injure rights accrued.\" (emphasis supplied) rajesh kumar aggarwal20 \"15. the object of the rule is that the courts should try the merits of the case that come before them and should, consequently, allow all amendments that may be necessary for determining the real question in controversy between the parties provided it does not cause injustice or prejudice to the other side. 16. order 6 rule 17 consists of two parts. whereas the first part is discretionary(may) and leaves it to the court to order amendment of pleading. the second part is imperative (shall) and enjoins the court to allow all amendments which are necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties. 17. in our view, since the cause of action arose during the pendency of the suit proposed amendment ought to have been granted because the basic structure of the suit has not changed and that there was merely change in the nature of relief claimed. we fail to understand if it is permissible for the appellants to file an independent suit, why the same relief which could be prayed for in the new suit cannot be permitted to be incorporated in the pending suit. 18. as discussed above, the real controversy test is the basic or cardinal test and itis the primary duty of the court to decide whether such an amendment is necessary to decide the real dispute between the parties. if it is, the amendment will be allowed; if it is not, the amendment will be refused. on the contrary, the learned judges of the high court without deciding whether such an amendment is necessary have expressed certain opinions and entered into a discussion on merits of the amendment. in cases like this, the court should also take notice of subsequent events in order to shorten the litigation, to preserve and safeguard the rights of both parties and to subserve the ends of justice. it is settled by a catena of decisions of this court that the rule of amendment is essentially a rule of justice, equity and good conscience and the power of amendment should be exercised in the larger interest of doing full and complete justice to the parties before the court. 19. while considering whether an application for amendment should or should not be allowed, the court should not go into the correctness or falsity of the case in the amendment. likewise, it should not record a finding on the merits of the amendment and the merits of the amendment sought to be incorporated by way of amendment are not to be adjudged at the stage of allowing the prayer for amendment. this cardinal principle has not been followed by the high court in the instant case.\" the takeaway 46. it would be appropriate, as the issue arises in case after case, to distil, from the above decisions, the defining principles governing exercise of jurisdiction under order vi rule 17 of the cpc (where the prayer for amendment is made prior to commencement of trial): (i) ordinarily, the court is required to be liberal while dealing with a prayer for amendment. prayers for amendment of written statements are required to be treated even more liberally than prayers for amendment of plaints. (ii) where the court finds that declining the prayer for amendment would result in the applicant suffering irreparable loss or injury, the amendment should be allowed. qua the opposite party who opposes the amendment, the court is required to examine whether the amendment would result in irreversible injustice; else, it should be allowed. (iii) there is no absolute bar to allowing an amendment which introduces a cause of action which is, by then, barred by time. while, ordinarily, such an amendment would be refused, the matter ultimately rests with the discretion of the court and, if the amendment is found necessary in the interests of justice, it would be allowed. the fact that the amendment introduces a relief which, by then, is barred by time is, therefore, merely a consideration to be borne in mind by the court. (iv) the ultimate consideration has to be subserving of the cause of justice and avoiding multiplicity of litigation. (v) all amendments are mandatorily required to be allowed which (a) do not work injustice to the other side, and (b) are necessary for determining the real questions in controversy between the parties. it must be remembered, in this context, that courts are ultimately required to adjudicate on the merits of the cases that come before them. (vi) if an amendment is sought to correct an inefficiency in originally stating the case, it should be allowed. such an error should be permitted to be rectified by amendment, so long it is not fraudulent, and the remedial steps taken in that regard do not unjustifiably injure accrued rights. (vii) all amendments which are necessary to determine the real issue in controversy in the suit, should be allowed. (viii) amendments which alter or substitute the cause of action originally pleaded should not be allowed. (ix) amendments which seek to negate admissions of fact, or which are mutually destructive therewith, should not be allowed. on the other hand, inconsistent pleas and alternative reliefs can be permitted to be introduced by amendment. (x) an amendment which does not set up a new case, or introduce a new cause of action, but merely amounts to incorporating a different or additional approach to the same facts, should be allowed, even after expiry of limitation. (xi) the expression \"cause of action\", in this context, does not mean \"every fact which it is material to prove to entitle the plaintiff to succeed\", which is its normally understood connotation. it only means a new claim made on a new basis constituting new facts. the word \"new case\" has to be understood as meaning \"new set of ideas\". (xii) an amendment which seeks to introduce an additional relief, the factual basis for which already exists in the plaint as originally filed, should be allowed. (xiii) an amendment which merely adds to the facts already pleaded should be allowed. (xiv) courts should not adopt a hypertechnical approach while dealing with prayers for amendment of pleadings. technicalities of law should not be allowed to hamper administration of justice. (xv) in this context, the court should bear in mind the fact that its objective should be adjudicating and deciding on the competing and conflicting rights of parties, and not punishing parties for their mistakes. (xvi) if a new cause of action arises during the pendency of a suit, and the plaintiff would be entitled to file a fresh suit based thereon, the plaintiff should be allowed to amend the existing suit and introduce the claim by amendment. events subsequent to the filing of the suit have, therefore, also to be borne in mind by the court. (xvii) the court examining a plea of amendment is not concerned with the correctness, falsity, or merits of the case that the amendment seeks to set up. the court should not, therefore, record any findings on the merits of the amendment, or the stand that is sought to be canvassed thereby. 47. there is no difference, whatsoever, in the body of the plaint as originally filed or as it exists today. the only change made, at the cost of repetition yet again, is in the name of the proprietor of the petitioner proprietorship as it finds place in the memo of parties. 48. apart from the fact that the amendment does not result in introducing a claim which is barred by time, even on that aspect, as laid down by the supreme court, the law now advocates a very liberal approach. though it is hardly necessary to enter into that aspect in the context of the dispute in the present case, where the aspect of limitation is arguable, the supreme court has held that even a claim which appears to be time barred can be introduced by way of amendment. having said that, in the present case, no such occasion arises, as the only change that was sought, was to correct the name of proprietor of the defendant proprietorship firm in the memo of parties in the plaint. 49. mr. mohit kumar also sought to contend that the present case attracts the proviso to order vi rule 17 of the cpc, in which context, he relied, as already noted, on kailash2 and ajendraprasadji n. pande3. 50. kailash2 was a case which involved filing of a written statement in election proceedings. para 13 of the decision merely notes that, \"in a civil suit, the trial begins when issues are framed and the case is set down for recording of evidence. read in the context of the dispute in kailash2, it is clear that the said observation is, at the highest, obiter dicta. the law, no doubt, recognizes that even obiter dicta of the supreme court is binding on all courts hierarchically below the supreme court. ajendraprasadji n. pande3, rendered by a bench of two hon'ble judges of the supreme court, has merely reproduced the aforesaid observation in kailash2. 51. the actual legal position regarding commencement of trial, visà-vis the proviso to order vi rule 17 of the cpc, stands clarified by the following passages from mohinder kumar mehra v. roop rani mehra26: \"17. although order 6 rule 17 permits amendment in the pleadings \"at any stage of the proceedings\", but a limitation has been engrafted by means of proviso to the effect that no application for amendment shall be allowed after the trial is commenced. reserving the court's jurisdiction to order for permitting the party to amend pleading on being satisfied that in spite of due diligence the parties could not have raised the matter before the commencement of trial. in a suit when trial commences? order 18 cpc deals with \"hearing of the suit and examination of witnesses\". issues are framed under order 14. at the first hearing of the suit, the court after reading the plaint and written statement and after examination under rule (2018) 2 scc 132 1 of order 14 is to frame issues. order 15 deals with \"disposal of the suit at the first hearing\", when it appears that the parties are not in issue of any question of law or a fact. after issues are framed and case is fixed for hearing and the party having right to begin is to produce his evidence, the trial of suit commences. 18. this court in vidyabai v. padmalatha27, held that filing of an affidavit in lieu of examination-in-chief of the witnesses amounts to commencement of proceedings. in para 11 of the judgment, the following has been held: (scc p. 413) \"11. from the order passed by the learned trial judge, it is evident that the respondents had not been able to fulfil the said precondition. the question, therefore, which arises for consideration is as to whether the trial had commenced or not. in our opinion, it did. the date on which the issues are framed is the date of first hearing. provisions of the code of civil procedure envisage taking of various steps at different stages of the proceeding. filing of an affidavit in lieu of examination-in-chief of the witness, in our opinion, would amount to \"commencement of proceeding\".\" 19. coming to the facts of the present case, it is clear from the record that issues were framed on 17-5-2010 and case was fixed for recording of evidence of the plaintiff on 10-8-2010. the plaintiff did not produce the evidence and took adjournment and in the meantime filed an application under order vi rule 16 or 17 on 17-1-2011. thereafter the court on 26-7-2011 has granted four weeks' time as the last opportunity to file the examination-in-chief. it is useful to quote para 4 of the order, which is to the following effect: \"4. in view of the above, it is directed as follows: (i) having regard to the delay which has ensued, subject to the plaintiff paying costs of rs. 5000, each to the contesting defendants 1 and 5 within a period of one week, the plaintiff is permitted four weeks' time as (2009) 2 scc 409 a last opportunity to file the examination-in-chief of his witnesses on affidavit. (ii) the matter shall be listed before the joint registrar for recording of plaintiff's evidence on 29-82011. (iii) the case shall be listed before the court for direction on 18-1-2012. (iv) needless to say in case ia no. 1001 of 2011 is allowed, appropriate orders for evidence of the plaintiff would be made.\" 20. thus, technically trial commenced when the date was fixed for leading evidence by the plaintiff but actually the amendment application was filed before the evidence was led by the plaintiff. the parties led evidence after the amendment application was filed. in this context, it is necessary to notice the order of the high court dated 14-2-2014, which records that evidence of both the parties have been concluded. most important fact to be noticed in the order is that the court recorded the statement of the plaintiff's counsel that parties have led evidence in view of the amendment sought in the plaint. the order dated 14-2-2014 is to the following effect: \"the evidence of both the parties has been concluded. the matter has been listed for final disposal. the learned counsel for the plaintiff has pointed out the order dated 26-7-2011 wherein observation was made that in case ia no. 1001 of 2011 under order vi rule 17 cpc for amendment of the plaint is allowed, appropriate order for evidence of the plaintiff would be made. as a matter of fact, the plaintiff's counsel stated that the parties have also led evidence in view of amendment sought in the plaint and the same covered in the evidence produced by the parties. the defendants, however, alleged that the said amendment was unnecessary and was opposed by the defendants and issue involved in the said circumstances be considered at the time of final hearing of suit as defendant 1 is more than 85 year old lady, the suit itself be decided. list this matter in the category of short cause on 22-52014.\" ***** 22. the proviso to order 6 rule 17 cpc prohibited entertainment of amendment application after commencement of the trial with the object and purpose that once parties proceed with the leading of evidence, no new pleading be permitted to be introduced. the present is a case where actually before parties could lead evidence, the amendment application has been filed and from the order dated 14-22014, it is clear that the plaintiff's case is that parties have led evidence even on the amended pleadings and the plaintiff's case was that in view of the fact that the parties led evidence on amended pleadings, the allowing of the amendment was a mere formality. the defendant in no manner can be said to be prejudiced by the amendments since the plaintiff led his evidence on amended pleadings also as claimed by him.\" (emphasis supplied) 52. the position in law as enunciated in the afore extracted passages from mohinder kumar mehra26 is interesting. the supreme court noted, clearly and with no equivocation whatsoever, that, in vidyabai27, it had been held that \"filing of an affidavit in view of examination-in-chief of the witnesses amounts to commencement of proceedings\". (though the supreme court has used the phrase \"commencement of proceedings\", one may regard the supreme court as having meant \"commencement of trial\", as the enunciation was with relation to the proviso to order vi rule 17 of the cpc.) having thus noted the position in law, as enunciated in vidyabai27 regarding commencement of trial, the supreme court went on to observe, with respect to the facts before it, that \"technically trial commenced when the date was fixed for leading evidence\". there appears, therefore, to be some discordance between vidyabai27 and mohinder kumar mehra26 with respect to the date when the trial could be said to commence, as vidyabai27 held that trial commenced on the date when the affidavit in evidence was filed, whereas mohinder kumar mehra26 held that, \"technically\", trial commenced when a date was fixed for leading evidence. however, this slight discordance, if any, need not concern us as, even in mohinder kumar mehra26, the supreme court held that the application for amendment, filed before evidence was actually led by the plaintiff, would not be hit by the proviso to order vi rule 17 of the cpc. the relevant date for applying the proviso to order vi rule 17 would, as per mohinder kumar mehra26, therefore, be the date when the plaintiff led evidence. 53. the first step in leading of evidence is either production of the witness for examination or, at the very least, filing of the affidavit-inevidence of the witness by the party who is required, by the court, to lead evidence in the first instance; generally, the plaintiff. whether one applies vidyabai27, therefore, or mohinder kumar mehra26, the trial could not be stated to have commenced, for the purpose of applicability of the proviso to order vi rule 17 of the cpc, before the affidavit-in-evidence of the plaintiff is filed even if, prior thereto, the court has directed filing of affidavit-in-evidence by a particular date. 54. even if one were to go by the observations in kailash2, on which mr. mohit kumar seeks to place reliance, the judgment cannot, in my opinion, be of any assistance to his client. what the supreme court has said in kailash, as reiterated in ajendraprasadji n. pande3, is that, \"in a civil suit, the trial begins when issues are framed and the case is set down for recording of evidence\". admittedly, the suit from which the present proceedings have emanated is a commercial suit. it is, therefore, governed by the commercial courts act, 2015. the order dated 1st december 2021, whereby issues were framed, directed that the case be set up for case management hearing on 20 th january 2022. case management hearing, in commercial suits is, as mr. mohit kumar correctly submits, governed by order xv(a) of the cpc as amended by the commercial courts act. order xv(a) rule 2 of the cpc clearly states that in a case management hearing, after hearing the parties, and once it finds that there are issues of fact and law which require to be tried, the court may pass an order fixing the dates on which the evidence of the witnesses of the parties is to be recorded. that exercise, mr. mohit kumar, candidly acknowledges, is yet to take place. no date of hearing on which evidence of witnesses is to be recorded, has been fixed by the learned commercial court under order xv(a) rule 2(d) of the cpc as amended by the commercial courts act. 55. that being so, even going by the observations in kailash2, on which mr. mohit kumar places reliance, the case having not been set down for recording of evidence till the date when the application under order vi rule 17 of the cpc came to be filed by the respondent, it cannot be said that trial had begun. 56. the submission of mr. mohit kumar, that the fact of the present case attracted the proviso to order vi rule 17 of the cpc is, therefore, rejected. conclusion 57. there is, therefore, no reason whatsoever for this court to interfere with the impugned order which merely allows the prayer of the respondent to substitute the petitioner amit bansal in place of tarun sehgal, as the proprietor of the defendant firm rpp, in the memo of parties accompanying the suit filed by the respondent. indeed, the amendment allowed was so innocuous that the court need hardly enter into the issue of whether, while filing the suit the petitioner was actually aware that amit bansal, and not tarun sehgal, was the proprietor of rpp. as the learned commercial court has correctly held, there was no reason for the petitioner to implead a wrong proprietor. at the highest, it could be treated as an inadvertent or, perhaps, even a negligent omission which, given the fact that proviso to order vi rule 17 of the cpc is not applicable and given the expansive scope of order vi rule 17 of the cpc as adumbrated by the supreme court in the decisions cited hereinabove, could not act as a factor inhibiting the prayer, of the respondent, for being permitted to amend the memo of parties. 58. the impugned order does not, therefore, call for interference, least of all under article 227 of the constitution of india. 59. this petition is manifestly vexatious. a simple prayer for correction of the name of the proprietor in the memo of parties accompanying the suit filed by the respondent was not only strenuously opposed, but has thereafter been carried to this court by means of the present petition. 60. accordingly, this petition is dismissed with costs of ₹ 50,000/-, to be paid by the petitioner by way of a crossed cheque favouring the delhi high court legal services committee, to be deposited with the registry of this court within a period of four weeks from today. 61. miscellaneous applications are also disposed of. c.hari shankar, j september 14, 2022 r.bararia"
