JUSTICE N.V.ANJARIA) The present appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read with Section 10(2) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, is directed against order dated 27.10.2021 below Exhibit 37 in Commercial Civil Miscellaneous Application No.445 of 2021 passed by learned Judge Commercial Court, City Civil Court, Ahmedabad, whereby Court allowed the application filed by respondent herein and restrained the appellant from encashing the bank guarantee till the third adjournment in the arbitral proceedings. \n2. Learned counsels for the parties stated at the conclusion of the hearing that they argued the appeal finally. The parties through their respective advocates relied on paper book containing the relevant documents which were on record of the court below and that they were ad-idem in respect of contents of such documents. \n3. Application seeking interim measures came to be filed under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter mentioned as 'the Arbitration Act') by the applicant- (respondent herein - Godrej Industries Limited - the parties are hereinafter referred to as per their original status as 'the applicant' and 'respondent' respectively) stating that it was desirous of procuring supply 3.8 MW RTC Power for its unit located at Village Kanerao, Taluka Valia, Bharuch, from respondent No.1 - the appellant herein, who was engaged in the business of generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, and who has its 2x150 MW thermal power plant C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 located at Bhadreshwar, Mundra- Kachchh. The supply was agreed on the basis of Long Term Open Access for period of twelve years and one month. Initially Memorandum of Understanding dated 16.2.2016 and thereafter power supply agreement dated 30.3.2016 were executed. \n3.1 The bank guarantee dated 28.10.2016 was given by the respondent herein as required under the agreement, for Rs.3,26,67,840/- valid upto 31.8.2028. The applicant in its application stated that it terminated power supply agreement on 31.7.2021, because the respondent was unable to supply the power to the applicant since 6.6.2021, thereby committing breach of the agreement. It was stated that the respondent was asked to release the bank guarantee but it was not done and it was apprehended that despite termination of the Power Supply Agreement, the respondent No.1 may illegally encash the bank guarantee. \n3.1.1 The applicant based its act of terminating the agreement by resorting to the Amendment No.1 in sub clause 3.2 of Clause No.3 of the agreement claiming that it gave right to terminate the agreement after four years and one month. The applicant claimed that on account of such termination there would be no liability upon the applicant from the GETCO, that the applicant had cleared all the dues against the invoices raised by the respondent for the power supplied, and that there were no pending invoices when the termination notice dated 27.1.2021 was served. \n3.1.2 The applicant communicated its intention to C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 terminate the power supply agreement with effect from 31.7.2021 by issuing notice dated 27.1.2021. The appellant herein however responded saying that the agreement was for Long Term Open Access Supply and was valid till 28.7.2028. According to the appellant herein, the applicant would remain liable to pay the exit charges and other liabilities under the power supply agreement and the Uninterrupted GERC Open Access Regulations, 2011. \n3.1.3 The applicant further stated that despite e-mail dated 31.7.2021 asking the appellant to return the bank guarantee, the respondent did not respond, hence the respondent approached the commercial court at City Civil Court, Ahmedabad seeking injunction against the encashment of bank guarantee. The commercial court passed order dated 27.10.2021 and restrained the appellant herein from encashing the bank guarantee. \n3.2 In the reply filed by the respondent, it was inter alia submitted that the application was based on misinterpretation of the Clauses of power supply agreement; that the applicant issued notice under Section 11 of the Act only on 3.9.2021 which was after three weeks from date of grant of ex-parte interim relief in its favour. It was stated that as the applicant had desired to procure 3.8 MW, it was allotted desired quantum of power under the Long Term Open Access for a period of twelve years and one month and that the power supply commenced from 27.7.2016. \n3.2.1 It was stated that in furtherance, applicant issued C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 authorization letter dated 26.7.2016 addressed to the Chief Engineer, State Load Dispatch Centre, Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation (GETCO) authorizing the respondent- appellant herein for entire co-ordination and scheduling with the load dispatch centre. It was stated that both the applicant and respondent No.1 were aware that the approval of Long Term Open Access to use the Intra State Transmission System or Distribution System can only be for twelve years and that about the said fact was within the know of the applicant since inception. \n3.2.2 It was contended that there was wrongful invocation of sub clause 3.2 of the agreement, and that the termination was provided in Clause 7, which could be invoked upon satisfaction of the conditions mentioned therein. It was contended that the termination notice was in contravention to the Clauses of the agreement and also in breach of the Long Term Open Access Regulations, 2011. It was further contended that Clause No.3.2 fell under the head 'Consideration,' which was amended. It was submitted that only in the case where the dispute was to be in relation to 'Consideration', Clause No.3.2 could be applied. \n3.2.3 It was the further say of the respondent that e-mail dated 18.11.2021 of the applicant revealed its real intention behind the termination notice, in which it was conveyed by the applicant that it had started its own bio-mass based captive power plant for generation of electricity. The respondent cautioned the applicant by e-mail dated 6.3.2021 about consequences of wrongful termination, stating further that the demand notice dated 7.7.2021 which was issued, was justified. \nC/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 3.3 Having noticed rival case in Application under Section 9, it would be Power Supply Agreement between the parties maybe looked at. The 'bank guarantee' is defined in Clause 2(v) to have its meaning ascribed in Clause 4.5.1; the additional bank guarantee was also defined in Clause (i). 'Contracted capacity' as per clause 2(xiii) is the quantum of power and energy the member consumer has agreed to consume from the generator on firm basis as specified in Clause 2.1 of the agreement. The definition of monthly bill was in Clause (xxxi), means a bill raised by the generator- the appellant herein for the contracted capacity as per the tariff outlined in Schedule A in respect of each billing period. \n3.3.1 Clause 2 is the 'terms of allotment of power' in which Clause 2.1 is about 'contracted capacity' to the the capacity which the consumer would purchase and consume during the term, for the tariff prescribed in the schedule in the agreement. As per Clause 2.8 the member consumer shall pay the capacity schedule by the generator irrespective of quantum of consumption by member consumer unless the generator fails to generate the power capacity as agreed in the power supply agreement. It was provided further that the member consumer shall pay for the Contracted Capacity scheduled by the generator, irrespective of the quantum of consumption by the Member Consumer provided however that the member consumer shall not be liable to pay under this Agreement in the event the generator fails to schedule the Contracted Capacity in consonance with the terms of this Agreement. It was provided that for the purpose of raising Monthly Bills and Supplementary C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 Bills by the generator, the Contracted Capacity shall be treated as consumed by the Member Consumer irrespective of the fact that actual consumption by the Member Consumer is less than the Contracted Capacity. \n3.3.2 Clause 3 and the group of Sub clauses are about 'consideration'. It is provided in Clause 3.1 that the member consumer shall pay the generator for the contracted capacity at the tariff determined as per Clause 3 and explained further in Schedule A. Sub clause 3.2 of the agreement came to be amended to the extent that the respondent can terminate the agreement after availing supply of power under long term open access for at least four years and one month from the commencement of power supply. \n3.3.3 By seeking to invoke amended Sub clause 3.2, the termination of the power supply agreement by the respondent was acted upon and sought to be justified, whereas as asserted by other side, the termination Clause in the agreement was Clause 7. In wake of bone of contention in this regard between the parties it will be worthwhile to extract amended Sub clause 3.2.\n\"1. Amendment in Sub clause (3.2) to Clause no. 3 of the Agreement -- Consideration The tariff per unit shall be computed as follows:\nthe prevailing Relevant Discom Tariff or Dakshin Vij. Company Limited minus Rs.0.60/kWh as illustrated in the schedule A. The tariff will be linked to the relevant DISCOM tariff. In case of any decrease in the cross subsidy surcharge or additional surcharge or increase in relevant discom tariff provided by the statutory authority C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 or GERC, such decrease or increase which had been made effective on or after 1st June 2016, will be upfront accounted to the member consumer maximum up to Rs. 1.22/kWh. \nThe Cost of Renewable Purchase Obligation will be in the scope of Member Consumer. In case the net discount to Member Consumer goes below Rs.0.50/kWh due to cost of Renewable purchase Obligation, Generator will give additional discount of maximum Rs.0.08/kWh to Member Consumer for period upto 30th September 2016 provided minimum effective discount for Member Consumer net off Renewable Purchase Obligation at any point of time will be Rs.0.40/kWh , GENERATOR & Member Consumer has right to terminate the Power Supply Agreement on or after availing long term open access supply for atleast 4 years and 1 month from the date of commencement of supply under long term access by giving a prior notice of atleast 1 year as per the Open Access Regulations. There will be no liability on Member Consumer from GETCO on account of termination after 4 years 1 month provided the Member Consumer will clear all its due against the invoice raised by GENERATOR for power supplied upto the termination of agreement before serving such termination notice to Generator. \nGENERATOR & Member Consumer agree that neither party can terminate the agreement until completion of 4 years and 1 month from the date of commencement of power supply except for the terms os per Clause 9 of this Agreement. \nSave and except the Member Consumer's right to terminate under the amendment to Clause 7.3 hereinbelow, in case of Member Consumer terminates the Agreement before availing power under the Long term access of 4 years and 1 month, Member Consumer will be liable to pay out but not limited to all the statutory or C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 transmission charges in accordance with Open Access Regulations to Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation Limited, or Gujarat State Load Dispatch Centre in addition to any due payment against the invoice raised by GENERATOR till the termination of agreement, if any.\" \n3.3.4 Clause 7 is about 'term and termination' which is as under. \n\"7. Term and Termination 7.1 This Agreement shall become effective upon its execution and shall be in force for a period of 12 years and 1 Month from the Date of Commencement of Supply (\"Term\"), unless mutually extended by the Parties in writing.\n7.2 The GENERATOR may terminate this Agreement at any time during the Term, on any one or more of the following grounds attributable to the Member Consumer and the determination by the GENERATOR of the occurrence of such grounds shall be final and binding and conclusive, that is to say the Member Consumer:\n(a) Fails to purchase/draw/consume the Contracted Capacity partially or fully during a Billing Period subject to the Member Consumer's right of deviation to the extent of 10% in terms of this Agreement;\n(b) Defaults in paying any Monthly Bill and/or Supplementary Bill within the Due Date for payment;\n(c) Commits any breach of this Agreement;\n(d) Commits any default whereby the C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 Bulk Power Transmission Agreement is adversely affected/terminated;\n(e) Commits any action or due to the Member Consumer's omission, whether in negligence or otherwise, the evacuation of Power from the Delivery Point to the Member Consumer's facility is hindered or is stopped;\n(f) Commits any act, deeds, things or matters which in any event have adverse implication on the GENERATOR;\n(g) Commits any breach of Electricity Act, the Electricity Rules, Wheeling Agreement and any regulations, guidelines, rules, notifications and orders issued by Government of India or Government of Gujarat or the GUVNL or GUVNL's Subsidiaries or GETCO or SLOC and/or by any Competent Authority, including a breach of the shareholding to consumption of power ratio laid down in Electricity Rules for captive consumers.\n(h) Repudiates the Agreement or otherwise evidences an intention not to be bound by the Agreement;\n(i) Ceases to carry on its business;\n(j) In the event (a) the Member Consumer becomes voluntarily or involuntarily the subject of any bankruptcy or insolvency or winding up proceedings... \n(k) Transfers or attempts to transfer the Equity Shares... \n(l) Is subjected to change in control, in terms of the Articles of Association of C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 the GENERATOR;\n(m) Undergoes any merger, demerger, amalgamation...\" \n3.3.5 Sub-clause 7.6 is important, quoted in para 3.4.2 hereinafter, it provides for payment of transmission charges by the member consumer upon termination of the agreement by the member consumer. Such transmission charges are payable under the Gujarat -Electricity Regulatory Commission's Order and Regulation. \n3.3.6 Sub clause 4.5 is about 'payment security'. The bank guarantee is contemplated in this Sub clause, which is as under. \n\"4.5 Payment Security Bank Guarantee :\n4.5.1 The Member Consumer shall on the Effective Date of this Agreement or not later than 15 (fifteen) days prior to the date of Commencement of Supply furnish to GENERATOR on irrevocable and unconditional bank guarantee. In a form and substance acceptable to the Generator, for an amount equal to 60 days energy bill as per the Tariff payable for the Contracted Capacity, from any Indian bank acceptable to the GENERATOR (\"Bank Guarantee\".) 3.3.7 Sub-clause 4.5.2 is about furnishing additional bank guarantee, Sub-clauses 4.5.3 and 4.5.4 are also extracted. \n4.5.3 The GENERATOR shall be entitled to invoke the Bank Guarantee, Including such Additional Bank C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 Guarantee (if applicable), in part or in full, In accordance with provisions of this Agreement. In particular, if the Member Consumer fails to pay any Monthly Bill or Supplementary Bill or parts thereof within the Due Date, then notwithstanding any Bill Dispute Notice (as defined in Clause 4.6.2 below), the GENERATOR can invoke the Bank Guarantee and the Additional Bank Guarantee for an amount equal to such Monthly Bill and/or Supplementary Bill or parts thereof, along with interest, if any, in accordance with Clause 4.2 above. \n4.5.4 The Bank Guarantee including such Additional Bank Guarantee (if applicable) shall be valid during the Term of this Agreement, with an additional claim period of thirty (30) days thereafter. \"\n3.3.8 Clause 5 mentions 'obligations and undertaking of the member consumer'. They relate to consumption of entire quantum of power, to secure that its facilities do not consume less power, to make payment for contracted capacity in each billing period, to pay bills and taxes and to pay all levies to Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited, GETCO and various charges relating to captive power arrangement proposed in the agreement. Clause 6 is about 'obligations and undertaking of generator'. \n3.3.9 Clause 12 in the agreement is the 'arbitration Clause'. Sub clause 12.2 says that 'All disputes and differences between the parties arising out or in connection with this agreement ('Disputes') shall first be tried to be settled through C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 mutual negations.' As per Sub clause 12.3, 'in the event that any Dispute could not be resolved between the Parties pursuant to Clause 12.2 then such Dispute shall be referred to arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to a sole arbitrator to be appointed mutually by the Parties.' What is to be noticed is that the disputes which may be referred to the arbitrator are Clause 'arising out of' or in 'connection with this agreement.' 3.4 The respondent terminated the agreement taking shelter of amended Clause 3.2 of the agreement sending notice dated 27.1.2021 which was to take effect from 31.7.2021. While terminating the agreement, the stand of the respondent was revealed in its e-mail dated 18.11.2020 whereby the appellant was informed that, 'From:Mayank Naikmayank.naik@godrejinds.com Sent: 18 November 2020 14:30 To: Sumit Kumar- BEFL Cc: Jitendra Agarwal Subject: Godrej power requirement from open access up to April-2021 I would like to inform you that we are going for our own bio-mass based captive power plant and it will be ready by April, 2021. So from May, 2021 onwards we will not require power from our medium term open access. \nConsider this mail as formal intimation for the same and suggest us forward procedure to exit from our PPA from May-2021. \nC/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 We are expecting 100% power availability and the same business relation for your end till April-2021. \nHowever Our plant is going under huge expansion and by end of year 2021 we may require power from open access. \nPlease keep it in your consideration. In case of any doubt please feel free to contact me. \nRegards, Mayank Naik Manager- Electrical Godrej Industries Limited.\n9099036823.\" \n3.4.1 Subsequent to the above email and the notice of termination, further communication dated 25.6.2021 was addressed wherein the respondent reiterated its intention and decision for termination of the agreement, further stating that the requirement of completion of minimum duration of four years and one month was fulfilled. As against this, the appellant's case has been that the termination of the contract would be governed by Clause 7 in the agreement, and that Clause 3.2 of which the recourse is taken by the respondent was under the head 'consideration' to apply in relation to the dispute touching the consideration. It is the say of the appellant that the power supply agreement was for long term access which was prematurely terminated by the respondent giving rise to payment liabilities and obligations on the respondent arising out of such termination. \nC/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 3.4.2 According to the appellant, as per Sub clause 7.6 of the agreement, respondent is liable to pay statutory transmission charges to the appellant at the rates prevailing since the termination of the agreement was effected for the reasons attributable to respondent No.1. Sub clause 7.6 reads as under. \n\"Clause 7.6- It is expressly agreed between the Generator and the Member Consumer that in the event of termination of this Agreement by the Member Consumer or any reason attributable to member consumer then member consumer shall only be liable to pay the statutory transmission charges to the Generator at the rates prevailing then during the termination this Agreement as per Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission Order No.3 of 2011 dated 01.06.2011 (Terms and Conditions of Intra State Open Access) regulation 2011 as amended from time to time.\" \n3.5 The bank guarantee in question is reproduced hereinafter in para 5.2 Learned senior Mr.Navin Pahwa assisted by learned advocate Ms.Saumitra Chaturvedi advocate for the appellant raised the following submissions. (i) Bank guarantee is an independent and separate contract between the bank and the beneficiary. (ii) Bank is always obliged to owner the bank guarantee like the instant one which is unconditional and irrevocable. (iii) The contract of bank guarantee is not qualified by the provisions of the underlying contract. (iv) Recitals in the preamble of the bank guarantee do not control the operative part of the bank guarantee. (v) The exceptions for grant of order of injunction namely fraud and irretrievable injustice, do not arise in the facts of the case. \nC/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 4.1 In order to buttress his proposition, he relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Ansal Engineering Projects Limited Vs. Tehri Hydro Development Corporation Limited [(1996) 5 SCC 450]. He further relied in U.P. Cooperation Federation Limited Vs. Singh Consultants and Private Limited [(1988) 1 SCC 174] as also in Hindustan Construction Company Limited Vs. State of Bihar [(1999) 8 SCC 446]. Learned senior advocate for the appellant emphasized following observations from Ansal Engineering Projects Limited (supra), the Supreme Court observed and held as under. \n\"It is settled law that bank guarantee is an independent and distinct contract between the bank and the beneficiary and is not qualified by the underlying transaction and the validity of the primary contract between the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given and the beneficiary...\" (para 4) 4.1.1 Learned advocate for the appellant submitted that commercial court was not justified in concluding that there was irretrievable injury. He submitted that such conclusion was drawn by referring to order passed by the National Law Tribunal, Chennai in petition filed by the bank under Insolvency and Bank Bankruptcy Code. It was submitted that not only that it was an interim order, in appeal filed by the appellant before the NCLT, New Delhi challenging the final order in respect of the petition filed by the another bank, the NCLT observed that the appellant was solvent company and further that the said judgment was confirmed by the Supreme Court on 14.12.2020 passed in Civil Appeal No.3565 of 2020. It was also submitted C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 that the commercial court failed to apply the real purport of exception of irretrievable injustice. \n4.2 On the other hand, learned senior advocate Mr.Devang Nanavati for Nanavati & Nanavati with learned advocate Ms.Prachiti Shah for the respondent raised the following contentions to support the impugned order. \n(i) The Bank Guarantee was furnished in lieu of Payment Security as provided in Clause 4.5.1 of the agreement. Clause 4.5.1 read with Clause4.5.3 shows that the Bank Guarantee was given for an amount equivalent to 60 days energy bill and it is only upon failure to make payment towards such monthly or supplementary energy bill that the Appellant would be entitled to invoke the Bank Guarantee.\n( ii) Bank Guarantee was conditional to the extent that it could be invoked only in relation to non-payment of monthly or supplementary energy bill. Once a bill is raised and remains unpaid after the due date, then notwithstanding any dispute, the Bank Guarantee was unconditional only in such an event. In the present case, there was no pending energy bill. \n(iii) There was no occasion for the appellant to invoke or seek encashment of the Bank Guarantee under the Power Supply Agreement. On the contrary, it is the appellant who has failed to supply power due to its financial difficulties, thereby committing material breach of the Power Supply Agreement which is evident from the e-mail correspondence dated 05.06.2021 and the Unit Outage Details shown in the website of GETCO. \nC/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 (iv) The respondent was drawing power for the notice period. However, as stated above, the appellant failed to supply power till date. \n(v) On perusal of the Notice dated 07.07.2021 the appellant has made a demand of Rs, 18,34,45,737.26 /- towards alleged Transmission charges and Rs.20,95,50,240/- towards alleged compensation liability. The respondent denies the alleges claim. It is pertinent to note that the alleged claim is in the nature of unliquidated damages which has not yet been adjudicated and crystallized. This amount is not an energy bill nor is it raised against any energy supplied as per the terms of the contract. \n(vi) The alleged claim of the appellant would be a subject matter of arbitration which has already been initiated by the respondent by filing IAAP No. 192 of 2021 before the High Court of Gujarat. \n(vii) Without prejudice to what is stated above and, in the alternative, it was submitted that this is a case, wherein the respondent have approached the Commercial Court under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, before the appellants have invoked the Bank Guarantee. It is an accepted position of law that the Bank Guarantees an independent contract and the bank is not bound by the terms of the parent agreement, however the appellant and the respondent are bound by the terms and conditions specified in the Power Supply Agreement. \n4.2.1 Learned senior advocate for the respondent, referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in Standard Chartered Bank Vs. Heavy Engineering Corporation Limited [(2020) 13 SCC 574] to submit that there are three exceptions namely, C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 fraud, irretrievable injustice and special equities on the basis of which injunction against the encashment of bank guarantee can be granted. Learned senior advocate submitted that there is possibility of irretrievable injustice to the respondent if the injunction is not confirmed. He referred to the proceedings of National Company Law Tribunal, he further referred to annual report for the year 2019-20 of the appellant as also auction notice published by the State Bank of India in order to support his plea that the respondent may not be able to recover the money even if he succeeds arbitral tribunal. According to learned senior advocate special equities also exists in favour of the respondent as the power supply agreement was terminated as per amended agreement and the claims raised by the appellant were false claims of unliquidated damages. \n4.2.2 Learned senior advocate relied on decision of the Supreme Court in H.M. Kamaluddin Ansari Vs. Union of India [(1983) 4 SCC 417], Raman Iron Foundry [(1973) 3 SCC 231] to submit about the aspect of unliquidated damages. He then relied on Madras High Court judgment in M/s. Geodesic Techinics Private Limited Vs. Larsen & Tubro Limited being OA No.240 of 2018. A Delhi High Court judgment in Hindustan Construction Company Vs. National Hydro Electric Power [(2020) SCC Online Delhi 1214]. He lastly referred to Section 9 and submitted that the object of the interim measure is to see that the no parties sufferes prejudice during the arbitral resolution process. \n5. From the above conspectus of the facts and contentions, it emerges inter alia that the agreement was for long term power supply valid upto 2028. Termination Clause No.7 in its Sub C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 clause 7.2 provided in (a) to (m) the grounds of termination. The respondent by stating that it had acquired its own bio-mass captive plant, and invoking sub clause 3.2 of the agreement prematurely terminated the agreement giving rise to disputes about the obligations and liabilities arising thereby under the terms of agreement about payment of the transmission charges under the Regulations of 2011. \n5.1 The long terms open access is defined in the regulations as the right to use intra state transmission system or distribution system for a period exceeding twelve years but not exceeding twenty-five years. The Regulations provide further that the customer who relinquishes the procurement of long term open access without applying one year prior in advance for such relinquishment is bound to pay transmission charges for the stranded transmission capacity. \n5.1.1 In the present case, as was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the respondent No.1 customer has authorized the appellant to pay the transmission charges on its behalf which were paid by the appellant on monthly basis to the GETCO. Thus in the sphere of disputes between the parties, it is the issue of the premature termination of contract and the liability of payment of transmission charges etc. arising thereby. \n5.1.2 Following aspects of facts and events in the controversy stand deserve to be noticed. \n(i) Respondent No.1 addressed e-mail dated 18.11.2020 stating that it has prepared its own captive power plant and therefore would not require power from respondent No.1, to submit that it was a formal intimation for the exit of the agreement. \nC/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 (ii) By e-mail dated 11.12.2020 the respondent No.1 was intimated by the appellant that if it chooses to walk away from the agreement, it will have to pay exit charges under the terms and conditions of the agreement, and also as per the provisions of Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and condition of Intra State Open Access) Regulations, 2011.\n(iii) Respondent No.1 terminated the agreement by notice dated 27.1.2021 which was to take effect from 31.7.2021. \n(iv) By e-mail dated 26.4.2021 the respondent No.1 did not dispute liabilities about which it was intimated by the appellant but only requested for calculation. \n(v) After virtual meeting held between the parties on 14.5.2021, respondent No.1 addressed e-mail dated 21.5.2021 claiming additional discount under Clause 3.3. This letter was addressed only after a meeting which was for the first time. \n(vi) Respondent terminate the agreement by notice dated 27.1.2021, thereafter the appellant addressed e-mail dated 2.8.2021 demanding the amounts by letter dated 7.7.2021 to be paid on or before 4.8.2021. \n(vii) It is the stand of the appellant that the respondent is liable to pay Rs.18,34,45,737.26/- towards statutory transmission charges for the remaining period of remaining long term open access. The respondent is also required to pay Rs.20,95,50,240/- towards compensation liability due to non offtake of power on account of early termination of the agreement. \nC/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 5.2 Now the bank guarantee in question may be considered. The bank guarantee in its contents reads as under. \n\"(BANK GUARANTEE) OUR GTEE REF NO. :240GT01163020004 BG AMOUNT : Rs.3,26,67,840/- (Rupees Three Crores Twenty Six Lakhs Sixty Seven Thousand Eight Hundred and Forty Only) ISSUE DATE : 28-OCT-2016 EXPIRY DATE : 31-AUG-2028 CLAIM DATE :30-NOV-2028 To, OPGS POWER GUJARAT PVT.LTD 6 SARDAR PATEL ROAD, GUINDY, CHENNAI- 600032. \nIn consideration of M/s.

We the Bank further agree that the Beneficiary shall be the sole judge to decide whether the Principal has committed any breach of terms & conditions of said Contract and that the decision of the Beneficiary shall be final & binding as to factum of breach and amount(s) payable by the Bank. However, C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 our liability under this guarantee shall be restricted to an amount not exceeding Rs. 3,26,67,840/(Rupees Three Crores Twenty Six Lakh Sixty Seven Thousand Eight Hundred and Forty Only). \nWe, the bank further agree that the guarantee herein contained shall be effective upon its issue and shall remain in full force and effect until the obligations of the Principal under or by virtue of the said Contract have been fully discharged to the satisfaction of the Beneficiary and the latter's claims satisfied or discharged or till the Beneficiary certifies that the terms and conditions of the said Contract have been fully and properly carried out by the said Principal and accordingly discharges the guarantee.

The money will be payable upon beneficiary's first written demand. In the third place it is contemplated that money becomes payable to the beneficiary under the bank guarantee once the beneficiary states in the written demand or such authenticated message that the amount is 'due by ways of loss or damage caused or would be caused to or suffered by the beneficiary.' Therefore the loss and damage which may have been suffered in presenti, as well as the loss or damage which would be caused or suffered, that is the loss or damage in futuro both are covered. Fourthly, which is important, such loss or damage may have been suffered by reason of 'any breach' by the principle 'of any of the terms or conditions contained in the said contract'. The fifth aspect mentioned is that the beneficiary will be the sole judge to decide whether the principal has committed any breach of terms and conditions of the contract and that the finality is attached to such decision of the beneficiary. \n5.2.2 Thus the bank guarantee clearly provides that the encashment thereof to the beneficiary will be permitted in the event of any breach arising out of any of the terms or conditions of the contract of the power supply. Thus, though the words in C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 particular is mentioned to mention about non-payment of monthly bill, the reading of the bank guarantee as a whole leave no manner of doubt that it confers unconditional right on the beneficiary to get the amount secured thereby on the score of breach of any conditions of power supply agreement, not delimited non payment of the monthly bill or supplementary bill. \n5.3 Having noticed the contents and recitals in the bank guarantee as above, the principles initiated by the courts relating to grant of injunction against the encashment of bank guarantee may be surveyed. \n5.4 The Supreme Court in Hindustan Construction Company Limited Vs. State of Bihar and Other [(1999) 8 SCC 436], stating that the bank guarantee represents an independent contract between the bank and the beneficiary, emphasized that the terms of the bank guarantee are extremely material. It was stated, \"What is important, therefore, is that the Bank Guarantee should be in unequivocal terms, unconditional and recite that the amount would be paid without demur or objection and irrespective of any dispute that might have cropped up or might have been pending between the beneficiary under the Bank Guarantee or the person on whose behalf the Guarantee was furnished.\" (para 9) 5.4.1 In Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited Vs. SBI Overseas Branch, Mumbai [(2000) 6 SCC 385], the principle was reiterated by the Supreme Court that when the C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 bank guarantee is unconditional the encashment thereof would not depend upon the adjudication, observing, \"Encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee does not depend upon the adjudication of disputes. Also no distinction can also be made between bank guarantee for due performance of a work contract and a guarantee given towards security deposit for a contract or any other kind of guarantee. Where the beneficiary shall be the sole judge on the question of breach of primary contract the bank shall pay the amount covered by the guarantee on demand without a demur. In the absence of a plea of fraud, guarantee had to be given effect to.\" (para 7) 5.4.2 In Vinitec Electronics Private Limited Vs. HCL Infosystems Limited [(2008) 1 SCC 544], the Apex Court after stating in para 22 that the recitals in the preamble in the deed of guarantee do not control the operative part of the deed, it was further observed again that the beneficiary is entitled to realise such unconditional bank guarantee irrespective of any pending disputes. \n5.4.3 Reiterating the principle that the bank guarantee is an separate contract between the guarantor bank and person entitled to benefit thereof who is the guarantee- recipient, Gujarat Maritime Board Vs. Larson and Toubro Infrastructure Development Projects Limited [(2016) 10 SCC 46]. The Supreme Court observed in para 11, inter alia that the bank guarantee contract is not qualified by the main contract on performance of obligations. \n\"It is contended on behalf of the first respondent that the invocation of Bank Guarantee depends on the cancellation of the contract and once the C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 cancellation of the contract is not justified, the invocation of Bank Guarantee also is not justified. We are afraid that the contention cannot be appreciated. The bank guarantee is a separate contact and is not qualified by the contract on performance of the obligations. No doubt, in terms of the bank guarantee also, the invocation is only against a breach of the conditions in the LoI. But between the appellant and the bank, it has been stipulated that the decision of the appellant as to the breach shall be absolute and binding on the bank.\" (para 11) 5.4.4 The principles regarding the principles for grant or refusal to grant of injunction to restrain enforcement of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit were summarized in Himadri Chemical Industries Limited Vs. Coal Tar Refining Company [(2007) 8 SCC 110], \"We find that the following principles should be noted in the matter of injunction to restrain the encashment of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit: \n(i) While dealing with an application for injunction in the course of commercial dealings, and when an unconditional bank guarantee or letter of credit is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realise such a bank guarantee or a letter of credit in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes relating to the terms of the contract. \n(ii) The bank giving such guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. \n(iii) The courts should be slow in granting an order of injunction to restrain the realisation of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit. \nC/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 (iv) Since a bank guarantee or a letter of credit is an independent and a separate contract and is absolute in nature, the existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of bank guarantees or letters of credit. \n(v) Fraud of an egregious nature which would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee or letter of credit and the beneficiary seeks to take advantage of the situation.\n(vi) Allowing encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee or a letter of credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned.\" \n(para 12) 5.4.5 In Vinitec Electronics Private Limited Vs. HCL Infosystems Limited [(2008) 1 SCC 544], it was observed again that the beneficiary is entitled to realise such unconditional bank guarantee irrespective of any pending disputes. It was stated that the bank is always obliged to honour its guarantee as long as it is unconditional and the dispute between the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the bank gas given the guarantee is immaterial.\n5.4.6 The decision of Culcutta High Court in Hindustan Paper Corporation Limited Vs. Keneilhouse Angami [(1990) 68 Company Cases 361], is also lucid in highlighting the working of law in respect of enforcement of bank guarantee by the beneficiary against the bank. It was explained thus (para 12), \"...A bank guarantee may be furnished in terms of a particular contract between two parties. In terms of the C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 conditions of the contract, a bank guarantee may be provided by a bank in favour of one of the parties to the original contract (hereinafter called \"the beneficiary\"). As to the question of enforcement of the bank guarantee by the beneficiary against the bank, the rights and liabilities are to be governed by the bank guarantee itself and not by the terms and conditions of the original contract. The bank guarantee itself is a contract separate from the original contract pursuant to which the bank guarantee is furnished. The bank is not a party to the original contract. \nSimilarly, the party at whose instance the bank guarantee is furnished pursuant to the agreement, is not a party to the bank guarantee. \n5.4.7 The High Court proceeded to observe. \n\"The bank guarantee is to be enforced if it complies with the terms and conditions of the bank guarantee itself and not when there is any default or breach of the terms and conditions of the main contract. If the condition for payment under the bank guarantee is fulfilled, then such payment is to be made to the beneficiary though ultimately it may be open to the party at whose instance the bank guarantee was furnished to file a suit for damages against the other parties to the contract. It is open to such parties also to file any suit against the bank for recovery of any amount, if any, if the bank has acted contrary to the transaction between the bank and such other parties. That is no ground for holding that the original contract is to be treated as part of the guarantee or that the arbitration agreement in the C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 original contract can be incorporated in the bank guarantee.\" \n5.5 It is manifested from the contents of the bank guarantee analyzed in para 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 above is unconditional. It is unequivocal in its terms. It is It is made payable on demur, which aspect makes it unconditional. Analysing the contents, the bank guarantee is not dependent upon the terms of the power supply agreement. In eye of law, as noticed above it is an independent contract between the bank and the beneficiary. The terms of the primary contract has nothing to do with the bank guarantee when by itself constitutes and guarantees unconditional payment on demand by the beneficiary. \n5.5.1 As the principle is already noticed, the terms of the agreement cannot be read into the bank guarantee which is independent and separate contract like one on hand. Therefore, the contention on part of the respondent that Clause 4.2 and 4.5.3 falls flat. The bank guarantee cannot be read by incorporating them, for, the obligations under the bank guarantee are independent and they operate between the bank and beneficiary. Even otherwise, for the sake of going with the submission of the respondent on that count that the bank guarantee is given for a purpose of monthly bill only, it does not follow even from the clauses. The word used in Clause 4.5.3 is in particular, which does not suggest exclusivity and does not discard the other terms and conditions and the disputes which may arises between the parties. It does not make the bank guarantee conditional. The language of the bank guarantee is clear. In that view the bank guarantee cannot be construed as was wanted by learned senior advocate. \nC/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 6. Three exceptions or the circumstances are carved out under which the injunction can be granted against the encashment of the bank guarantee. They are fraud by the beneficiary, irretrievable injustice and third existence of special equities. Proceeding to notice them through the eye of decisions of the Apex Court. \n6.1 The Apex Court in U.P. Federation Limited (supra) referred to with approval the following observations from English decision in R.D. Harbottle (Mercantile) Limited vs. National Westminister Bank Limited [(1977) 2 All ER 862], \"...since demands for payments had been made by the buyers under the guarantees and the plaintiffs had not established that the demands were fraudulent or other special circumstances, there were no ground for continuing injunction\".\n6.1.1 The Supreme Court further observed and held, \"In order to restrain the operation either of irrevocable letter of credit or of confirmed letter of credit or of bank guarantee, there should be serious dispute and there should be good prima facie case of fraud and special equities in the form of preventing irretrievable injustice between the parties, the very purpose of bank guarantees would be negatived and the fabric of trading operation will get jeopardised.\" \n6.2 In Vinitec Electronics Private Limited (supra), following was stated, \"In BSES Limited (Now Reliance Energy Ltd.) vs. Fenner India Ltd. And anr. this court held :\nC/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 There are, however, two exceptions to this Rule. The first is when there is a clear fraud of which the Bank has notice and a fraud of the beneficiary from which it seeks to benefit. The fraud must be of an egregious nature as to vitiate the entire underlying transaction. The second exception to the general rule of non- intervention is when there are special equities in favour of injunction, such as when irretrievable injury or irretrievable injustice would occur if such an injunction were not granted.\" \n6.2.1 In Svenska Handelsbanken Vs. Indian Charge Chrome [(1994) 1 SCC 502], the contention advanced was in respect of liquidated damages and it was submitted that the respondent had to prove liquidated damages quantified the same before invoking the guarantee. It was contended that the invocation of the bank guarantee relating to advance and liquidated damages was after the expiry of period. Saying that no case was made out relating to fraud or irretrievable injustice, the court held that the appellant would be able to claim relief before arbitration by way of damages or amount wrongly recovered and that the irretrievable injustice could not be said to exists. The Supreme Court stated, \"...in case of confirmed bank guarantee/irrevocable letters of credit it cannot be interfered with unless there is fraud and irretrievable injustice involved in the case and fraud has to be as established fraud. There should be prima facie case of fraud and special equities in the form of preventing irretrievable injustice between the parties. Mere irretrievable injustice without prima facie case of established fraud is of no consequence in C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 restraining the encashment of bank guarantee. Only in the event of fraud or irretrievable injustice the court would be entitled to interfere in a transaction involving a bank guarantee and under no other circumstances.\" \n(para 6) 6.3 In Hindustan Construction Company Limited Vs. State of Bihar and Other [(1999) 8 SCC 436] wherein the Supreme Court once again considered the contract of bank guarantee, nature and purpose thereof and the consideration as to when it is encashable and when the court can grant injunction against invocation of the bank guarantee. The Supreme Court observed that the courts are be reluctant in granting injunction against invocation of bank guarantee except in cases of established fraud or where irretrievable injury was likely to be caused to the guarantor. \n6.3.1 In Hindustan Construction Company (supra) case the terms of the bank guarantee suggested that it was a guarantee against the mobilization advanced and could not be said to be unconditional. In the facts of the case the injunction against encashment was held to be justified. The court however in terms observed, as in the instant case also, that when the bank guarantee recites that the amount would be paid 'without demur' and irrespective of any dispute that might have cropped up, or might have been subsisting between the beneficiary on one hand and the person furnishing the bank guarantee, both the parties would bound by in terms of bank guarantee since it is an independent contract. \n6.4 The Supreme Court in Hindustan Steel Works Construction Limited Vs. Tarapor and Company [(1996) 5 C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 SCC 34] and reiterated the above principles to observe further, \"...in the absence of a plea relating to fraud, much less of a finding thereto, we find that the court could not have stated that the defence raised by the respondent Bank on the grounds set forth earlier is sufficient to hold that unconditional leave should be granted to defend the suit. In the arbitration proceedings that were pending it was certainly open to the parties concerned to adduce proper evidence and establish as to what are the liquidated damages that are payable and if any excess amount had been paid, the same would be recovered.\" (para 8) 6.5 In Standard Chartered Bank Vs. Heavy Engineering Corporation Limited [(2020) 13 SCC 574], the Supreme Court analyzed various decisions, to propose the same dictum that \"The dispute between the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the bank has given the guarantee is immaterial and is of no consequence. There are, however, exceptions to this Rule when there is a clear case of fraud, irretrievable injustice or special equities. The Court ordinarily should not interfere with the invocation or encashment of the bank guarantee so long as the invocation is in terms of the bank guarantee.\" (para 23) 6.6 In Ansal Engineering Project Limited (supra), the Supreme Court observed, that strong evidence is required to establish the exceptions, C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 \"Unless fraud or special equity exists, is pleaded and prima facie established by strong evidence as a triable issue, the beneficiary cannot be restrained from encashing the bank guarantee even if dispute between the beneficiary and the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given by the bank, had arisen in performance of the contract or execution of the works undertaken in furtherance thereof.\" \n(para 4) 6.6.1 It was further observed, \".....The court exercising its power cannot interfere with enforcement of bank guarantee/letters of credit except only in cases where fraud or special equity is prima facie made out in the case as triable issue by strong evidence so as to prevent irretrievable injustice to the parties.\"\n(emphasis supplied) (para 5) 6.7 In U.P. State Sugar Corporation vs. Sumac International Ltd.[(1997) 1 SCC 568], the Apex Court explained thus, \"A fraud in connection with such a bank guarantee would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee. Hence if there is such a fraud of which the beneficiary seeks to take advantage, he can be restrained from doing so. 6.7.1 About second exception, it was observed inter alia that the harm should be of 'irretrievable' nature, \"The second exception relates to cases where allowing the encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned. Since in most cases payment of C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 money under such a bank guarantee would adversely affect the bank and its customer at whose instance the guarantee is given, the harm or injustice contemplated under this head must be of such an exceptional and irretrievable nature as would over ride the terms of the guarantee and the adverse effect of such an injunction on commercial dealings in the country. The two grounds are not necessarily connected, though both may coexist in some cases. (para 12) 6.8 In Mahatama Gandhi Sahakra Sakkare Karkhane vs. National Heavy Engg. Coop. Ltd and Anr.[(2007) 6 SCC 470] , this court observed:\n\"The person in whose favour the guarantee is furnished by the bank cannot be prevented by way of an injunction from enforcing the guarantee on the pretext that the condition for enforcing the bank guarantee in terms of the agreement entered between the parties has not been fulfilled. Such a course is impermissible. The seller cannot raise the dispute of whatsoever nature and prevent the purchaser from enforcing the bank guarantee by way of injunction except on the ground of fraud and irretrievable injury. \n(para 22) 6.8.1. It was further observed, What is relevant are the terms incorporated in the guarantee executed by the bank. On careful analysis of the terms and conditions of the guarantee in the present case, it is found that the guarantee is an unconditional one. The respondent, therefore, cannot be allowed to raise any dispute and prevent the appellant from encashing the bank guarantee. The mere fact that the bank guarantee refers to the principle agreement without referring to any specific C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 Clause in the preamble of the deed of guarantee does not make the guarantee furnished by the bank to be a conditional one.\"\n[Emphasis supplied] (para 28)\n7. The next question therefore would be needed to be considered is whether the present case falls in any of the above exceptions. \n7.1 There is no element of fraud muchless erigeron fraud, by the appellant- beneficiary in seeking to encash the bank guarantee. This aspect is entirely ruled out. The fraud not only has to be pleaded with specific facts, but should be established as well. The fraud must be of egregious nature. \n7.2 The second exception namely, irretrievable injustice is also the circumstance absent in the facts of the case. Merely because the National Law Company Tribunal has passed an order in the insolvency proceedings which is interim order. Fluctuating figures in the books of account and balance sheet, or isolated financial event cannot be the yardstick. It cannot be readily concluded on such counts that it brings into picture irretrievable injustice, nor it could be said that the it would not be possible or it will disable to recover its dues, so as to suffer irreparable injustice. In the facts of the present case no circumstance suggests that if the arbitrator rules in favour of the respondent, it would become paper order or that the respondent would not be able to recover the money to suffer irretrievable injustice. The commercial court below has misdirected itself in recording its findings in this score. \nC/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 7.2.1 As to what would constitute irretrievable injury, the Supreme Court in U.P.State Sugar Corporation (supra) elaborated as to the kind and nature of irretrievable injury or injustice, \"On the question of irretrievable injury which is the second exception to the rule against granting of injunctions when unconditional bank guarantees are sought to be realised the court said in the above case that the irretrievable injury must be of the kind which was the subject-matter of the decision in the Itek Corporation case (supra). In that case an exporter in the U.S.A. entered into an agreement with the Imperial Government of Iran and sought an order terminating its liability on stand by letters of credit issued by an American bank in favour of an Iranian Bank as part of the contract. The relief was sought on account of the situation created after the Iranian revolution when the American Government cancelled the export licences in relation to Iran and the Iranian Government had forcibly taken 52 American citizens as hostages. The U.S. Government had blocked all Iranian assets under the jurisdiction of United States and had cancelled the export contract. The court upheld the contention of the exporter that any claim for damages against the purchaser if decreed by the American Courts would not be executable in Iran under these circumstances and relisation of the bank guarantee/Letters of credit would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiff. This contention was upheld. (para 14) 7.2.2 It was explained, \"To avail of this exception, therefore, exceptional circumstances which make it impossible for the guarantor to reimburse himself if the ultimately succeeds, will have to be decisively established. Clearly, a mere apprehension that the other party will not be able to pay, is not enough.\" (para 14) C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 7.2.3 Mere apprehension that the person would suffer irreparable injury in future if bank guarantee is allowed to be encashed is not enough. Possibility is also no consideration. This must be 'decisively' established on facts. The word 'established suggests that the factum in that regard is almost proved. The concept of irretrievable injury or injustice to be applied while granting injunction against the invocation and encashment of bank guarantee, is undoubtedly much greater in degree and quite higher in its pedestal, than the idea of irreparable injury to be considered while granting injunction under Order XXXIX Rule 1, 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. \n7.3 Third consideration or exception is special equities. The consideration of irretrievable injury and the consideration special equities may inform each other. Whenever the irretrievable injury is established, it may create special equity to permit the encashment of the bank guarantee. The irretrievable injury in that way becomes special equity. What is to be emphasised is that the fraud should be egregious and demonstrably arise, the irretrievable injury should be decisively established. In the same way, the special equities should conclusively arise. \n8. The Commercial Court framed two issues, firstly the injunction may be granted against the appellant, whereas the second issue was whether the injunction may be granted against the bank. The second issue was answered in negative, still however, the first issue was decided against the appellant and the injunction was granted. Manifestly, the Commercial Court below erred to contradict itself to answer the issue No.2 in the C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 negative and yet to grant the injunction against the appellant not permitting the encashment of bank guarantee.\n8.1 In U.P. Cooperation Federation Limited (supra), the Supreme Court stated, in the similar set of circumstances that what is not permissible directly, cannot be done indirectly. \n\"In the instant case, the learned Judge has proceeded on the basis that the this was not an injunction sought against the bank but this was sought against the appellant. But the net effect of injunction is to restrain the bank from performing bank guarantee. That cannot be done. One cannot do indirectly what is one is not free to do directly.\" \n9. In view of the above, the injunction against the bank guarantee could not have been granted. Any of the exceptional grounds namely fraud, irretrievable injustice or special equities do not arise in the facts of the case. \n10. In Adhunik Steels Limited Vs. Orissa Manganese and Minerals (P) Ltd.[(2007) 7 SCC 125], the Supreme Court has held that the principles governing the grant of injuction under Order XXXIX, Rule 1, 2 of Code of Civil Procedure, namely prima facie case, balance of convenience, and irreparable injury would apply to be the considerations for exercising powers under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act in passing interim measures. In this case, none of these ingrediants are satisfied. \n10.1 At the same time, the interim injunction under the Order XXXIX, CPC is an equitable relief. Similarly primary object of the court exercising powers under Section 9 of the Act, is to ensure that until the arbitration proceedings are over, the rights between the parties to dispute are balanced and equities between them are preserved and maintained. Neither party C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 should suffer any kind of prejudice while before the arbitrator. Both sides should be put to and enjoy a kind of equilibrium while contesting their case before the arbitral tribunal, till the arbitral tribunal finally decides on their disputes. \n10.2 For the forgoing discussion, the impugned order whereby the commercial court below granted injunction against invocation of the bank guarantee by the appellant books a clear error in law. The same deserves to be set aside. \n10.3 Resultantly, impugned order dated 27.10.2021 below Exhibit 37 passed by the Commercial Court, City Civil Court, Ahmedabad in Commercial Civil Miscellaneous No.445 of 2021 is hereby set aside. \n10.4 However, the interest of justice would be sub-served that the amount that will be encashed by the appellant upon invocation of bank guarantee shall be deposited before the commercial court, City Civil Court concerned by the appellant, and the commercial court shall invest the amount of the encashed bank guarantee in cumulative fixed deposit in a nationalized bank initially for a period of six months to be renewed and continued until arbitrator finally decides the disputes between the parties. It is so directed. \n11. The appeal is allowed in the said terms. \n(N.V.ANJARIA, J) (SAMIR J. DAVE,J) FURTHER ORDER At this stage, learned advocate Ms.Prachiti Shah for the C/FA/4066/2021 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022 respondent requested that the aforesaid order and directions may be stayed for the some time to enable the respondent No.1 to approach the higher forum. The request was objected to by learned senior advocate Mr.Navin Pahwa for the appellant. \nIn view of what is held and what is directed in the judgment, the request is not acceded to and is rejected.\n(N.V.ANJARIA, J) (SAMIR J.

(2) what is the interplay of section 12a and section 15 of the commercial courts act, 2015 in a suit involving a commercial dispute within the meaning of section 2(1)(c) of the act of 2015 filed in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of a high court subsequent to the date of notification of the specified value ? (3) in view of the provisions of section 12a of the commercial courts act, 2015 can a suit of the specified value involving a commercial dispute within the meaning of the act of 2015 be transferred to the commercial division of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of this hon'ble court? (4) if the answer to the preceding issue is in the affirmative then what are the procedure and the modalities for the transfer? (5) can a suit filed in the commercial division of the high court be transferred to the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court on finding that the suit does not involve a commercial dispute within the meaning of the act of 2015 ? (6) if the answer to the preceding issue is in the affirmative then what would be the procedure and modality for the same. (7) how should proceedings under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 be dealt with in respect of the previous issues? 4. learned senior advocate appearing for the first defendant in cs no. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, provisions of section 12a of the act of 2015 are mandatory. he has relied upon section 12a of the act of 2015 and submitted that, the plaintiff approaching the commercial division of a court in respect of a commercial dispute is mandatorily required to undertake pre-institution mediation. only in the event, the plaintiff has claimed that, the plaintiff requires urgent reliefs, the plaintiff need not undertake a pre-institution mediation. in such circumstances, the plaintiff has to obtain leave of the court under section 12a of the act of 2015, so as not to undertake a pre-institution mediation and then the suit can be instituted. in the present case, there is no pleading in the plaint that there is any urgency. the plaintiff has not claimed in the plaint that, pre-institution mediation is not required. the plaintiff has not pleaded anything with regard to section 12a of the act of 2015 in the plaint. 5. learned senior advocate appearing for the first defendant in cs no. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, the word 'shall' used in sub-section (1) of section 12(a) is mandatory in nature. according to him, the scheme by the act of 2015 has a requirement for expeditious disposal of a commercial dispute. in order to attain expeditious disposal of a commercial dispute the legislature has thought it appropriate that, the plaintiff approaching a commercial division of a court undertakes a preinstitution mediation in order to have expeditious resolution of the commercial dispute acceptable to all parties concerned. therefore, the word 'shall' as used in sub-section (1) of section 12a of the act of 2015 should not be read to mean that it is directory. 6. learned senior advocate appearing for the first defendant in cs no. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, the authority for the purpose of preinstitution mediation was notified on july 3, 2018. the said authority and the district authority constituted under the legal services act, 1987 has been designated as the authority concerned to undertake a preinstitution mediation. 7. learned senior advocate appearing for the first defendant in cs no. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, since the plaintiff did not obtain leave under section 12a of the act of 2015 and since, the plaintiff never applied for any urgent relief, the plaint of the instant suit should be rejected. 8. learned advocate appearing for the plaintiff in cs no. 213 of 2018 has submitted that there are two previous applications pending between the parties in the suit. one of such application is at the behest of the first defendant being ga no. 1106 of 2019 seeking extension of time to file written statement. the other application is that of the plaintiff being ga no. 1179 of 2019, under chapter xiiia of the original side rules. according to him, the first defendant having accepted the jurisdiction of the hon'ble court and having participated in the suit, cannot be permitted to rake up the issue of lack of jurisdiction. moreover, the plaintiff has obtained leave under clause 12 of the letters patents act, 1865 to institute the instant suit. 9. learned advocate appearing for the plaintiff in cs no. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, on a meaningful reading of section 12a of the act of 2015 along with the objects and purpose of such act, the provisions of section 12a of the act of 2015 can be said to be directory in nature. according to him, provisions of section 12a of the act of 2015 are not a part of the substantive law. such provisions cannot be read so as to nonsuit a plaintiff who otherwise has a legal and valid claim. a person should not ordinarily be denied the opportunity of participating in the process of justice dispensation unless compelled by express and specific language of the statute. according to him, section 12a has not prescribed a consequence of failure to comply, therefore, such provision should always be read to be directory. moreover, no equity or right is created in favour of any defendant in a suit filed in the commercial division under the provisions of section 12a of the act of 2015. therefore, section 12a of the act of 2015 should be held to be directory. according to him, the act of 2015 is more in the nature of procedural law and hence should not be read in such a manner so as to create a complete embargo on a person approaching a court of law. 10. in support of the contention that, the word 'shall' used in section 12a of the act of 2015 can be read as directory, learned advocate appearing for the plaintiff in cs no. 213 of 2018 has relied upon 2007 volume 6 supreme court cases page 420 (r.n. jadi & brothers & ors. v. subhash chandra), 2008 volume 11 supreme court cases page 769 (zolba v. keshao & ors.), all india reporter 1957 supreme court

projects pvt. ltd.), 2018 volume 9 supreme court cases page 472 (state of bihar & ors. v. bihar rajya bhumi vikas bank samiti). 11. referring to section 12a of the act of 2015, learned advocate for the plaintiff in cs no. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, unlike the provisions of section 80 of the code of civil procedure, 1908, section 12a of the act of 2015 does not provide that leave has to be obtained from the court. he has contrasted the provisions of section 80 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 with that of section 12a of the act of 2015 and submitted that, section 12a of the act of 2015 not expressly providing for leave to be obtained and significantly not providing for the consequence of the failure to obtain leave under section 12a of the act of 2015, assuming that such leave is required to be obtained, then the only possible inference is that the provisions of section 12a is not mandatory. no leave under section 12a of the act of 2015 is required when a plaintiff did not undertake a pre-institution mediation and that non-obtaining of such leave is not fatal to the suit instituted. 12. in reply, learned senior advocate appearing for the first defendant in cs no. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, the provisions of section 12a of the act of 2015 are mandatory. he has submitted that, the central government has designated the authority for the purpose of preinstitution mediation by the notification dated july 3, 2018. the intention of the act of 2015 is to expedite resolution of disputes. such resolution need not be through courts. the act of 2015 has created an opportunity to the parties to settle their disputes by way of mediation prior to approaching the court. 13. learned senior advocate appearing for the first defendant in cs no. 213 of 2018 has submitted that, the provisions of commercial courts (pre-institution mediation and settlement) rules, 2018 and particularly rule 3(1) thereof do not dilute the mandatory nature of section 12a of the act of 2015. the word 'may' used in the rules of 2018 governs the manner in which an application to the designated authority can be made. an application can be made either online or by post or by hand. the word 'may' used in rule 3 of the rules of 2018 cannot be construed to mean that a party may apply for pre-institution mediation. in any event, rules framed under a statute cannot override the statute. in support of such contentions, he has relied upon 1984 volume 2 supreme court cases page 50 (babaji kondaji garad v. nasik merchants co-operative bank ltd. nasik). 14. in support of the contention that, the provisions of section 12a of the act of 2015 is mandatory and that compliance thereof are required for a valid institution of a suit learned senior advocate appearing for the first defendant in cs no. 213 of 2018 has relied upon 2011 scc online 4325 (cal.) (port blair v. airport authority of india), 2012 volume 13 supreme court cases page 538 (chaluvegowda v. state) and 1970 volume 3 supreme court cases page 716 (gangappa gurupadappa guwad v. rachawwa). 15. in cs no.136 of 2020, the defendant no. 1 has applied for rejection of the plaint and stay of proceedings of the suit. 16. learned advocate appearing for the defendant no. 1 has submitted that, the disputes involved in cs no. 136 of 2020 cannot be said to be commercial disputes within the meaning of section 2 (1) (c) of the act of 2015. he has referred to the pleadings of the plaint. he has drawn the attention of the court to the prayers of the plaint. he has submitted that, the specified value under the act of 2015 is now at rupees 3 lakhs. the suit has been filed in the year 2021, when the specified value for commercial suits stood at rupees 3 lakhs. he has referred to the agreement between the parties as relied upon by the plaintiff in the suit. according to him, the suit property has been used exclusively for commercial purposes and therefore the suit is in respect of a dispute which is a commercial dispute within the meaning of the act of 2015. he has relied upon 2019 scc online sc 1311 (ambalal sarabhai enterprises ltd versus k s infraspace llp and another) in support of the contention that, the present suit is a suit involving a commercial dispute within the meaning of the act of 2015. 17. learned advocate appearing for the defendant no. 1 in cs no.136 of 2020 has submitted that, on return of a plaint under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure 1908 and on the returned plaint being presented before the competent court, such date of presentation is the date of commencement of the fresh suit. the latter suit cannot be considered as a continuation of the earlier suit. in support of such contentions, he has relied upon 2014 volume 1 supreme court cases 648 (oil and natural gas corporation versus modern construction and company). 18. relying upon all india reporter 1963 supreme court 424 (amar nath dogra versus union of india) and all india reporter 1984 supreme court 1043 (behari chowdhary and another versus state of bihar and others) learned advocate appearing for the defendant no. 1 in cs no.136 of 2020 has submitted that, the provisions of section 12a of the act of 2015 are mandatory. section 12a is akin to section 80 of the code of civil procedure 1908. according to him, a suit which does not satisfy the terms of section 12a of the act of 2015 is liable to be dismissed. 19. learned senior advocate appearing for the plaintiff in cs no.136 of 2020 has submitted that, the application under order vii rule 11 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 made by the defendant no. 1 is not maintainable. he has relied upon ambalal sarabhai (supra) and all india reporter 2016 delhi 186 (soni dave versus translation industries expositions private limited) in support of the contentions that, unless it is pleaded in the plaint, that the property with respect to which the suit has been filed is used exclusively in trade and commerce, it cannot be kept in the commercial division by labelling it as a commercial dispute. he has contended that, the question as to whether the dispute arises out of an agreement relating to an immovable property used exclusively in trade and commerce is a mixed question of fact and law and cannot be decided on a demurrer. 20. referring to section 15 of the act of 2015, learned senior advocate appearing for the plaintiff in cs no.136 of 2020 has submitted that, the court should exercise its jurisdiction thereunder in order to transfer the suit to the commercial division. according to him, unlike section 31 of the recovery of debts due to banks and bankruptcy act, 1993 section 15 of the act of 2015 has not used the word 'pending prior'. according to him, section 15 of the act of 2015 has application on all suits pending and is not restricted to suits pending prior to the act coming into force. suits that have been filed both before and after the act of 2015 coming into force should be transferred by using section 15 of the act of 2015. he has relied upon 2016 scc online bom 9019 (hubtown ltd. versus idbi trusteeship services ltd.) in support of such contentions. he has submitted that, although section 12 a of the act of 2015 has been introduced after the judgement of hubtown (supra) then also, the interpretation given thereunder should be applied. 21. learned advocate appearing for the parties have drawn the attention of the court to the judgement and order dated february 22, 2021 passed in c.o. no. 1678 of 2020 (m/s dhanbad fuels ltd versus union of india and others) and submitted that, on a transfer of a suit from the regular court to the commercial division, such a suit can be registered but not admitted till such time, the rigours of section 12 a of the act of 2015 have been complied with. 22. learned senior advocate for the petitioner appearing in ia ga no. 1 of 2020 in ap no. 25 of 2016 has submitted that, there is interportability of suits and proceedings between the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court and the commercial division. according to him, irrespective of whether a suit is a regular suit or a commercial suit, a suit is filed before the hon'ble high court at calcutta and is under the high court's ordinary original civil jurisdiction. according to him a filing in a commercial division of a high court is done in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the court. in terms of section 2(1)(d) read with section 4 of the act of 2015, such a suit is then heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the hon'ble court. therefore, if a suit is incorrectly filed as a civil suit before the regular bench, the recourse is to transfer such suit to the commercial division. according to him, such a transfer is akin to a transfer from a bench not having a determination to the bench conferred with such determination by the chief justice. since it is a transfer intra court, the principles relating to order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 does not apply. once a court exercises powers, under section 15 of the act of 2015 and transfers the suit to the commercial division the provisions under section 15(3) of the act of 2015 become applicable and the commercial division will ensure that all procedures that were not completed at the time of transfer are completed in relation to the suit. in addition to other procedural compliances such as those relates to the statement of truth, the compliance will also relate to section 12a of the act of 2015. until such procedural requirements are completed with, the suit will be deemed to have been filed but not instituted and no further steps can be taken in the suit until such procedures are completed. 23. learned senior advocate appearing for the petitioner in ia ga no. 1 of 2020 in ap no 25 of 2016 has submitted that, the court should take into account that the dismissal of a suit on the ground that it has been filed in a civil court and not as a commercial suit will be harsh and imply loss of court fees. innocent clients may be unfairly penalized solely due to errors on the part of the lawyers. according to him, section 12a of the act of 2015 is applicable only to institutions of suits and is not applicable to arbitration application. 24. as the statement of objects and reasons of the act of 2015 has stated, the act of 2015 came into being to provide a mechanism for speedy disposal of high-value commercial disputes. according to the government high-value commercial disputes involve complex facts and questions of law. therefore, the government has felt the need to provide for an independent mechanism for their early resolution. early resolution of commercial dispute has been conceived to create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive legal system of the country. the act of 2015 has been brought about to accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the indian justice delivery system and repose the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation. 25. the act of 2015 has been divided into eight chapters. chapter iiia has been inserted to the act of 2015 with retrospective effect from may 3, 2018. this chapter contains section 12a. in the facts of the present case, the court has not been called upon to deal with the retrospective effect of section 12a of the act of 2015. section 12a of the act of 2015 is as follows:\"12a. pre-institution mediation and settlement--(1) a suit, which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief under this act, shall not be instituted unless the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of preinstitution mediation in accordance with such manner and procedure as may be prescribed by rules made by the central government. (2) the central government may, by notification, authorise the authorities constituted under the legal services authorities act, 1987 (39 of 1987), for the purposes of pre-institution mediation. (3) notwithstanding anything contained in the legal services authorities act, 1987 (39 of 1987), the authority authorised by the central government under sub-section (2) shall complete the process of mediation within a period of three months from the date of application made by the plaintiff under sub-section (1).\" 26. in addition to the provisions of section 12a of the act of 2015, the provisions of section 15 and section 21 of the act of 2015 have to be taken note of while deciding the crimes involved. sections 15 and 21 of the act of 2015 are as follows:\"15. transfer of pending cases.-(1) all suits and applications, including applications under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of specified value pending in a high court where a commercial division has been constituted, shall be transferred to the commercial division. (2) all suits and applications, including applications under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of specified value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a commercial court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such commercial court: provided that no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the court prior to the constitution of the commercial division or the commercial court shall be transferred either under sub-section (1) or subsection (2). (3) where any suit or application, including an application under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of specified value shall stand transferred to the commercial division or commercial court under subsection (1) or sub-section(2), the provisions of this act shall apply to those procedures that were not complete at the time of transfer.

(supra), while considering the provisions of section 45(3) of the calcutta municipal act, 1923, the calcutta high court has expressed the view that the question whether a particular provision is imperative or directory is complex. there cannot be a hard and fast rule of general application. however, there are three fundamental tests which are often applied. 30. the supreme court in hari vishnu kamath (supra) has considered provisions of article 329(b) of the constitution. it has observed that, an enactment in form mandatory might in substance be directory. the use of the word 'shall' does not conclude the matter. however, the true intention of the legislature is the determining factor and that, whether a provision is mandatory or directory will depend upon the context. it has explained that, the distinction between a provision which is mandatory and one which is directory. it has observed that, while a provision which is mandatory must be strictly observed, in the case of a provision which is directory, it is sufficient that it is substantially complied with. 31. the supreme court in sharif-ud-din (supra) has considered the provisions of jammu & kashmir representation of people act, 1957. it has held that, in order to find out the true character of the legislation, that is, whether the legislation is mandatory or directory in nature, the court has to ascertain the object which the provision of law in question is to subserve and the design and the context for which it is enacted. if the object of a law is to be defeated by non-compliance with it, then, such provision is to be regarded as mandatory, but when a provision of law relates to any performance of any public duty and the invalidation of any act done in disregard of that provision causes serious prejudice to those for whose benefit it is enacted and at the same time who have no control over the performance of the duty, such provision should be treated as a directory one. it has held that, where, a provision of law prescribes that a certain act has to be done in a particular manner by a person in order to acquire a right and which is coupled with another provision which confers an immunity on another when such act is not done in that manner, the former has to be regarded as a mandatory one. a procedural rule ordinarily should not be construed as mandatory if the defect in the act done in pursuance of it can be cured by permitting appropriate rectification to be carried out at a subsequent stage unless by according such permission to rectify the error later on, another rule would be contravened. whenever a statute prescribes that a particular act is to be done in a particular manner and also lays down that failure to comply with the said requirement leads to a specific consequence, such a requirement should be held to be mandatory. 32. in owners and parties interested in m.v. \"vali pero\" (supra) the supreme court has considered the calcutta high court rules. it has held that, the defect of not taking the signature of the witness on the deposition was not fatal to the reception of the deposition in the evidence. it has observed that, rules of procedure are not by themselves an end but the means to achieve the ends of justice. construction of the rule of procedure which permits justice and prevents miscarriage by enabling the court to do justice in myriad situation, all of which cannot be envisaged, acting within the limits of the permissible construction, must be preferred to that which is rigid and negatives the cause of justice. 33. the supreme court in chandrika prasad yadav (supra) has observed that, the question as to whether a statute is directory or mandatory would not depend upon the phraseology used. the principle as regards the nature of the statute must be determined having regard to the purpose and object to the statute seeks to achieve. 34. the patna high court in smt. sunita devi & ors. (supra) has held that, the provisions of order viii rule 1 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 are not mandatory and that in exceptional cases, written statement can be accepted beyond the time limit prescribed by the code of civil procedure, 1908. the supreme court in r.n. jadi & brothers & ors. (supra), salem advocate bar association, tamil nadu (supra) and zolba (supra) has considered the provisions of order viii rule 1 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 which limits the time period for filing a written statement by a defendant in a suit. in salem advocate bar association, tamil nadu (supra) the supreme court has held that, order viii rule 1 and the proviso thereto are directory in character and not mandatory. such view has been reiterated in r.n. jadi & brothers & ors. (supra) and zolba (supra). 35. the supreme court in manbodhan lal srivastava (supra) has observed that the use of the word 'shall' in a statute, though generally taken in a mandatory sense, does not necessarily mean that in every case it shall have effect that is to say that, unless the words of the statute punctiliously valid, the proceeding or the outcome of the proceeding would be invalid. it has observed that, article 320(3)(c) is not mandatory. irregularity in consultation with public service commission does not afford a public servant with cause of action in a court of law. 36. the supreme court in shivjee singh (supra) has considered section 1 and section 202(2) proviso of the criminal procedure code, 1973. it has held that, despite the use of the word 'shall', in section 1 of the criminal procedure code, 1973, it has to be treated as directory. it has held that, the proviso to section 202(2) of the criminal procedure code, 1973 is also not mandatory. the supreme court in smt. lila gupta (supra) has considered the proviso to section 15 of the hindu marriage act, 1955 and held the same not to be mandatory. 37. the supreme court in macquarie bank limited (supra) has considered section 9(3)(c) of the insolvency and bankruptcy code and held that, the same to be a procedural provision and directory in nature. 38. the supreme court in bihar rajya bhumi vikas bank samiti (supra) has considered the provisions of section 34 of the act of arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 and held that, the views of the high courts of bombay and calcutta represent the correct view. candor gurgaon two developers and projects pvt. ltd. (supra) of the calcutta high court has been noted therein. it has held that the vested right of a party to challenge the award under section 34 cannot be taken away of a non-compliance of issuance of prior notice before filing of the arbitration petition. 39. the full bench of kerala high court in m. gopalan (supra) while considering the provisions of section 23 of the prevention of food adulteration act, 1954 and rule 7(3) of the prevention of food adulteration rules, 1955 has held that rule 7(3) of the rules are directory in nature. 40. in ambalal sarabhai enterprises limited (supra) the supreme court has considered the issue whether the transaction between the parties in the suit under consideration before the supreme court can be considered as a commercial dispute so as to enable the commercial court to entertain the suit. it has held, the literal and strict interpretation has to be applied while interpreting a particular statute or a provision. adverting to the various provisions of the act of 2015 it has held the act of 2015 allows the court to adopt a proactive approach in resolving a commercial dispute. it has observed that. the intent of the legislature is to have a procedure which expedites the disposal of commercial disputes and thus create a positive environment for investment and development and make india an attractive place to do business. it has also held a purposive interpretation of the objects and reasons and the various amendments to the code of civil procedure, 1908 made by the act of 2015 leaves no room for doubt that the provisions of the act of 2015 are to be strictly construed. the object shall be fulfilled only if the provisions of the act of 2015 are and interpreted in a narrow sense and not hampered by the usual procedural delays plaguing the traditional legal system. 41. in dhanbad fuels limited (supra), the court has considered an order passed by the commercial court rejecting an application under order vii rule 11 (d) of the code of civil procedure, 1908 seeking dismissal of the suit in view of non compliance of section 12a of the act of 2015. in the facts of that case, the defendant in the suit filed an application under order vii rule 11(a) of the code of civil procedure, 1908 which was rejected. the defendant did not raise the issue of non compliance of section 12a of the act of 2015 therein. the subsequent application under order vii rule 11 (d) for rejection of the plaint on the ground of non compliance of section 12a of the act of 2015 filed more than a year since institution of the suit was rejected by the trial court. in revision, the court had directed reference to mediation and stay of the suit for limited period so as to allow the process of mediation to run its course. the revisional court had taken note of the fact that the suit was filed in august 2019, standard operating procedure for pre-institution mediation and settlement was prescribed on december 11, 2020 and the panel for trained mediators was availed on january 27, 2020. 42. the bombay high court in 2021 scc online bom 195 (ganga taro vazirani v. deepak raheja) has held that, section 12a of the act of 2015 is a procedural provision and if there is a substantial complaining the plaintiff cannot be non-suited. 43. section 12a of the act of 2015 has been introduced to the act of 2015 by an amendment. it has been introduced to the act of 2015 with retrospective effect from may 3, 2018. sub-section (1) of section 12a of the act of 2015 has required the plaintiff to exhaust the remedy of preinstitution mediation to institute a suit which may fall within the purview of the act of 2015. sub-section (2) of section 12a has required the central government to authorise authorities constituted under the legal services authority act, 1987 for the purposes of pre-institution mediation. in exercise of powers conferred under sub-section (2) of section 12a of the act of 2015, the central government has by a notification dated july 3, 2018 published in the gazette of india on july 3, 2018, authorised the state authority and the district authority constituted under the legal services authorities act, 1987 for the purposes of pre-institution mediation and settlement under chapter iiia of the act of 2015, that is, section 12a of the act of 2015. 44. sub-section (3) of section 12a has prescribed a time limit of three months for the completion of the process of mediation. the first proviso to such sub-section has allowed the time limit to complete the process of mediation to be extended for a further period of two months, with the consent of parties. the second proviso to sub-section (3) has mandated that, the period during which the parties remained occupied with the pre-institution mediation, shall not be computed for the purpose of limitation under the limitation act, 1963. sub-section (4) of section 12a of the act of 2015 has required the parties to reduce the settlement, if any, arrived at with regard to the commercial dispute, into writing, and such settlement to be signed by the parties and the mediator. subsection (5) of section 12a of the act of 2015 has provided that, the settlement arrived at under the provisions of section 12a of the act of 2015 shall have the same status and effect as if it is an arbitral award on agreed terms under sub-section (4) of section 30 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. the settlement therefore can be enforced as an award. the award partakes the character of a decree by virtue of the legal fiction imbibed under the act of 1996 in respect of an award. 45. the scheme of section 12a of the act of 2015 as has been amended is that, a commercial dispute must receive a pre-institution mediation. such pre-institution mediation has to be completed within the time frame stipulated. in the event such pre-institution mediation results in a settlement, then such settlement will partake the character of an award necessarily inviting the application of the provisions of the act of 1996 along with all attendant rigors and benefits with regard to an award passed under the act of 1996. therefore, a pre-institution mediation, may result in an award which is enforceable as a decree of a court within a maximum period of 5 months from the date of application for mediation made under section 12a (1) of the act of 2015. a regular suit, even under the rigours of the act of 2015 may not attend finality within the maximum period of five months prescribed for completion of a preinstitution mediation. the provisions for pre-institution mediation are therefore a mechanism which allows expeditious disposal of a commercial dispute between the parties. 46. section 12a (1) of the act of 2015 has debarred a plaintiff from instituting a suit relating to a commercial dispute, without exhausting the remedy of pre-institution mediation, unless the plaintiff seeks urgent reliefs. the word 'shall' used in section 12a (1) of the act of 2015 has to be considered in light of the act of 2015 and the authorities cited at the bar. 47. whether a provision of any statute is mandatory or not depends upon various factors. existence or user of the word 'shall' is not the sole determinative factor. user of such word usually denotes a mandatory nature to the provision. however there are instances where, the word 'shall' has been read to be directory. in order to arrive at a conclusion as to whether or not, the provision of the statute is mandatory, the court has to find out the object and purpose of the act in question. the court has to ascertain the object, design, purport and the context in which the provision of law was enacted. if the object of the act would be defeated by non-compliance, then such statute has to be regarded as mandatory. if a provision of law prescribes that, for a person to acquire a right a certain act has to be done in a particular manner and it is coupled with another provision which confers a right on another when such act is not done in that manner, then it has to be regarded as a mandatory provision. 48. procedural law can be mandatory also. section 69 of the indian partnership act, 1932 is one of such instance which has been held to be mandatory by the supreme court in 1977 volume 1 supreme court cases 379 (seth loonkaran sethiya & ors. v. mr. ivan e. john & ors). the time to file written statement as prescribed by the act of 2015 by introducing amendments to the procedural part of the code of civil procedure, 1908 has been held to be mandatory by the supreme court in 2019 volume 12 supreme court cases 210 (scg contracts (india) private ltd. v. k.s. chamankar infrastructure private ltd. & ors). section 80 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 which is a procedural provision has been held to be mandatory by supreme court in 1977 volume 1 supreme court cases 257 (state of maharashtra v. chanderkant). in 2013 volume 10 supreme court cases 178 (state of kerala v. sudhir kumar) the supreme court has held that, a suit filed without complying with section 80(1) of the code of civil procedure, 1908 cannot be regularised by filing an application under section 80(2). 49. section 69 of the partnership act 1932 and section 80 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 prohibits institution of a suit without satisfaction of the parameters laid down therein. both have been held to be procedural law but mandatory. similarly, section 12a of the act of 2015 has a prohibition on institution of a suit in the sate parameters. the prohibition or institution of a suit under section 12a of the act of 2015 is of similar nature as that of the prohibition under section 69 of the indian partnership act, 1932 and section 80 of the code of civil procedure 1908. in all three cases, the prohibition is absolute when the plaintiff fails to observe the modalities stipulated therein. section 69 of the indian partnership act, 1932 and section 80 of the code of civil procedure 1908 does not contemplate substantial compliance. on the same analogy section 12a of the act of 2015 should not do so also. both section 69 of the indian partnership act, 1932 and section 80 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 non-suits a plaintiff if the stipulate parameters are complied with by the plaintiff. section 12a of the act of 2019 stipulates the same result for the plaintiff on non-compliance. the consequence of non-adherence to section 12a of the act of 2015 renders the institution of the suit void in the same nature as that ofa breach of section 69 of the indian partnership act, 1932 and section of 80 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 affects a plaint. the pain of non compliance with section 12a of the act of 2015 for the plaintiff is getting non-suited. being non-suited for non-compliance of statutory provisions is a concept not unknown to law. 50. ambalal sarabhai enterprises (supra) has laid down that, the provisions of the act of 2015 has to be strictly construed. the construction and interpretation of the act of 2015 has to be such that it fulfills the object of expeditious disposal of a commercial dispute. the provisions of the act of 2015 have to be interpreted in a narrow sense so that the procedural delays plaguing the traditional legal system are obviated. 51. section 12a of the act of 2015 although being procedural in nature has a public purpose. the public purpose is to have commercial disputes within the meaning of the act of 2015 disposed of expeditiously through mediation at the pre-institution stage. a mandatory pre-institution mediation will not only expedite the resolution of a commercial dispute within the meaning of the act of 2015 on an amicable platform but will also facilitate and face up the time of a congested commercial division or a commercial court to devote time and energy to the disposal of the pending suits. section 12a of the act of 2015 if construed as mandatory achieves twin objects of expeditious disposal and freeing up time and space for the court. 52. the object of the act of 2015 is to ensure expeditious and speedy disposal of a commercial dispute. expedition and speed in disposing of a commercial dispute is attained, in the wisdom of the legislature, by a pre-institution mediation. section 12a(1) of the act of 2015 distinguishes suits filed under the act of 2015 into two categories. it treats the two categories of suits differently. suits are categorized into two on the basis of need of the plaintiff to obtain urgent interim relief. one category is a suit where the plaintiff does not seek urgent interim relief. in such category section 12a of the act of 2015 debars the plaintiff from instituting a suit unless the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of preinstitution mediation. the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 12a of the act of 2015 are such that, a plaintiff is obligated to approach the appropriate authority for a pre-institution mediation, unless he seeks urgent interim relief, in respect of a commercial dispute, to approach the court for resolution of the commercial dispute. section 12a of the act of 2015 prescribes an obligation on the plaintiff to undertake the preinstitution mediation and vests a corresponding right on the defendant. the defendant enjoys the right of a pre-institution mediation and in the default of the plaintiff not going for pre-institution mediation, then having a suit against the defendant by such defaulting plaintiff, being barred by law. failure of the plaintiff to exhaust pre-institution mediation, unless, he seeks urgent relief, in a commercial dispute, gives a corresponding right to the defendants to claim that, such suit could not have been instituted by the plaintiff. such failure of the plaintiff will result in the dismissal of the suit if allowed to be instituted. the other category of suits under section 12a of the act of 2015 is a suit where the plaintiff seeks urgent interim reliefs. 53. the two categories of suits under section 12a of the act of 2015 are treated differently. in the category of suits where the plaintiff does not seek urgent interim relief, the plaintiff is statutorily required to exhaust pre-institution mediation, whereas a plaintiff seeking urgent interim relief is not required to do so. in a suit where the plaintiff does not seek urgent interim reliefs, limitation is extended or kept in abeyance, as one may perceive it, till the conclusion of the statutorily mandated period of mediation while in the other category no such benefit is extended. 54. given the nature of the language used in section 12a of the act of 2015, and the two categories of suits being dealt with thereunder, and taking into consideration the distinction between 'filing' of a suit and its 'institution' in my view, it requires the court to apply its mind at the time of the suit being presented before it, as to whether the plaintiff in a suit which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief under the act of 2015 exhausted the remedy of pre-institution mediation in accordance with the manner and procedure prescribed or not. sub-section (1) of section 12a of the act of 2015 casts a duty upon the court to ensure that a suit is instituted by a plaintiff in accordance with procedure laid down therein. the duty is akin to a duty under section 3 of the limitation act, 1963. a plaintiff may not undertake pre-institution mediation if the plaintiff is in a position to demonstrate that, the plaintiff requires urgent interim relief. in order to do so, the plaintiff has to approach the court before which the suit is to be instituted and satisfy the court that it needs to institute such suit without undertaking a preinstitution mediation in view of the urgency claimed by the plaintiff. 55. a civil court has jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature, excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. various statutes have either expressly or impliedly barred the jurisdiction of a civil court to try a suit of civil nature under section 9 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. for instance such bar can be had at section 18 of recovery of debts due to banks and bankruptcy act, 1993. the right of a litigant to approach a civil court to have suits of civil nature adjudicated and decided is not unconditional. section 9 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 itself recognizes that such right is not unconditional. such right can be abridged, regulated or taken away as the case may be. section 12a of the act of 2015 is a provision which regulates and affects the right of the plaintiff to approach a court to try suits of a civil nature. of course, section 12a of the act of 2015 is in the context of a commercial dispute to be tried by a commercial court or a commercial division of a high court, as the case may be. 56. it cannot be contended that, a plaintiff has an unconditional right to approach the commercial court or a commercial division of a high court to have an issue involving a 'commercial dispute' within the meaning of the act of 2015 decided by such court without adhering to the provision of section 12a of the act of 2015. the right to approach such court is regulated by section 12a of the act of 2015. the regulation in place is such that it expedites resolution of the commercial dispute. 57. section 12 a of the act of 2015 has entered the statute book with retrospective effect from may 3, 2018. it has been introduced to the act of 2015 by the amendment act of 2018. the amendment act of 2018 has been published in the gazette of india on august 21, 2018. the act of 2015 has come into force on october 23, 2015. the act of 2015 has been published in the gazette of india on january 1, 2016. 58. between the periods october 23, 2015 when the act of 2015 had come into retrospective effect till january 1, 2016, when the amendment act of 2018 was published, the public was not aware that a plaintiff was required to undertake a pre-institution mediation in respect of a commercial dispute of the specified value. in my view, suits involving a commercial dispute of the specified value instituted before the commercial division without pre-institution mediation till january 1, 2016 cannot be faulted on the touchstone of failure to undertake a preinstitution mediation in terms of section 12 a of the act of 2015 simply on the ground that the public was not aware of the requirement to do so till january 1, 2016. 59. for the period therefore from october 23, 2015 till january 1, 2016, a plaintiff was not aware of the provisions of section 12 a of the act of 2015 for such plaintiff to comply therewith. there is one more period to which, the plaintiff cannot be faulted for not undertaking a preinstitution mediation. it is the period from january 1, 2016 till december 11, 2020 being the date when the manner and procedure for the preinstitution mediation had been prescribed by the rules made by the central government. the same would include the availability of requisite infrastructure for pre-institution mediation as also availability of trained mediators. once the procedure has been prescribed by the rules of the central government and the requisite infrastructure to undertake a preinstitution mediation is in place, a plaintiff cannot claim that, section 12 a of the act of 2015 is directory and not mandatory, when such plaintiff is not seeking any urgent interim relief. therefore, for the period from october 23, 2015 till december 11, 2020 a plaintiff cannot be faulted for not undertaking pre-institution mediation under section 12a of the act of 2015 where the plaintiff is not seeking any urgent interim relief as the requisite infrastructure to do so was not in place. 60. in view of the discussions above, the first issue is answered by holding that section 12a of the act of 2015 is mandatory. in respect of suits filed upto december 11, 2020 the plaintiff cannot be non-suited for non-compliance as the requisite infrastructure under section 12a was not notified. 61. section 12a has been introduced to the statute with retrospective effect from may 3, 2018. therefore, a plaintiff not seeking urgent interim relief has to exhaust the remedy of pre-institution mediation in terms of the procedure as prescribed by the rules made by the central government. section 15 has provided for transfer of pending cases. section 15 has dealt with both suits as well as arbitration applications. under sub-section (1) of section 15 of the act of 2015, all suits and applications, including application under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 relating to a commercial dispute of the specified value pending in a high court where a commercial division has been constituted, shall be transferred to the commercial division of such high court. sub-section (2) of section 15 has provided for transfer of pending suit and application, including applications under the act of 1996 relating to a commercial dispute to a commercial court that has been constituted for such purpose. the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 15 has stipulated that no suit or application of which the final judgement has been reserved by the court prior to the constitution of the commercial division for the commercial court shall be transferred under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2). sub-section (5) of section 15 has provided that in the event, a suit or an application has not been transferred in terms of sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) or sub-section (3), the commercial appellate division of the high court may, on the application of any of the parties to the suit, withdraw such suit or application from the court before which it is pending and transfer the same for trial or disposal to the commercial division or the commercial court as the case may be. 62. the transfer provisions of pending suits and applications as has been incorporated in section 15 of the act of 2015, allows two methods of transfer of the pending suits and applications. one method of transfer is a transfer contemplated under sub-section (1), (2) and (3) of section 15 by which, the court in seisin of the suit or application transfers such suit or application on a finding that, the dispute involved is a commercial dispute within the meaning of the act of 2015 and is of specified value. the other mode of transfer is on an application of a party to the commercial appellate division of the high court. 63. section 15 of the act of 2015 has to be read along with sections 6 and 7 of the act of 2015. 64. sections 6 and 7 of the act of 2015 are as follows:\"6. jurisdiction of commercial court.--the commercial court shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value arising out of the entire territory of the state over which it has been vested territorial jurisdiction. explanation.--for the purposes of this section, a commercial dispute shall be considered to arise out of the entire territory of the state over which a commercial court has been vested jurisdiction, if the suit or application relating to such commercial dispute has been instituted as per the provisions of sections 16 to 20 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908). 7. jurisdiction of commercial divisions of high courts.--all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value filed in a high court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of that high court: provided that all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes, stipulated by an act to lie in a court not inferior to a district court, and filed or pending on the original side of the high court, shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the high court: provided further that all suits and applications transferred to the high court by virtue of sub-section (4) of section 22 of the designs act, 2000 (16 of 2000) or section 104 of the patents act, 1970 (39 of 1970) shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the high court in all the areas over which the high court exercises ordinary original civil jurisdiction.\" 65. sections 6 and 7 of the act of 2015 have vested the commercial court and the commercial division of a high court with jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of specified value. under section 7 of the act of 2015, all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value filed in a high court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the high court. the two provisos to section 7 of the act of 2015 are not material in the instant matters. 66. it has been contended that, by virtue of the language used in section 6 and 7 of the act of 2015 suits and applications before a high court having an ordinary original civil jurisdiction, are required to be filed in such jurisdiction and be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of such high court. in other words, it has been contended that, a suit, although may involve a commercial dispute, will be filed in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of this hon'ble court but the same has to be heard and decided by the commercial division. it has been contended that, the suits so filed are interportable between the ordinary original civil jurisdiction and the commercial division. a court in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction on finding that the suit involves a commercial dispute within the meaning of the act of 2015 must transfer it to the commercial division without anything else and on the transfer the commercial division will proceed to hear and dispose of it as if the suit was instituted in the commercial division. such contentions, however, cannot be accepted. 67. all high courts in india do not have ordinary original civil jurisdiction. section 7 of the act of 2015 governs such of the high courts who have ordinary original civil jurisdiction. it is in such context that the word 'filed' used in section 7 of the act of 2015 has to be understood. in any event, a suit after 'filing' has to be 'presented' before an appropriate person for it to be duly 'instituted'. the distinction between filing and institution has been recognised in bihari chowdhurry and anr. (supra). 68. section 15 is attracted to only such suits and applications which involve a commercial dispute as defined under the act of 2015 and is of the specified value, again as notified under the act of 2015. these twin parameters have to be satisfied for section 15 to apply. section 15 of the act of 2015 is not an open ended provision for transfer of all suits and applications satisfying the twin tests, for eternity. 69. section 15 has a terminus by reason of the user of the word \"pending\". the terminus is the date when the specified value is notified. the terminus shifts with the reworking of the specified value. in other words, in a given case, if the authorities issue a notification stipulating that the specified value under the act of 2015 would be rs. 3 lakhs then, all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of such specified value pending in a high court where there is a commercial division and in any civil court in respect of which a commercial court has been constituted, shall be transferred to the commercial division or the commercial court as the case may be. 70. all high courts in india do not have ordinary original civil jurisdiction. sub-section (1) of section 15 of the act of 2015 relates to and governs such of the high courts that have ordinary original civil jurisdiction. in the high courts in india having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the act of 2015 culls out a commercial division for them. the act of 2015 has stipulated the matters which such commercial division is required to deal with. the act of 2015 has not vested any original jurisdiction to a high court which does not have it prior to the act of 2015 coming into effect. the act of 2015 has only specified the suits and applications which are to be dealt with in the commercial division of a high court which has ordinary original civil jurisdiction. section 7 of the act of 2015 has to be construed and understood in such context. 71. section 15 has required the transfer of pending suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of the specified value to the commercial division of a high court. section 12a of the act of 2015 has stipulated a pre-institution mediation. reading the three sections namely sections 7, 12a and 15 together and interpreting the three sections in the strict and narrow sense as ambalal sarabhai (supra) has required a court to give a narrow and strict interpretation to the provisions of the act of 2015, then, it cannot be said that, there is interportability between the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of a high court and the commercial division of such high court. a suit which has been filed subsequent to the notification of the specified value in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court cannot be transferred to the commercial division of the high court by virtue of section 15(1) of the act of 2015. a suit filed subsequent to the notification of the specified value in the ordinary civil jurisdiction of a high court having a commercial division cannot be said to be a \"pending\" suit within the meaning of section 15(1) of the act of 2015. the moment a suit is not \"pending\" in terms of section 15(1) of the act of 2015, the same cannot be transferred to the commercial division by virtue of section 15(1) of the act of 2015. whether or not such a suit can be transferred under section 15(5) of the act of 2015 has not fallen for consideration and therefore, such issue is not answered. 72. section 15 cannot be considered open ended as done in hubtown (supra) in view of the provisions of section 12a requiring a preinstitution mediation for a suit involving a commercial dispute. hubtown (supra) has been rendered prior to the coming into effect of section 12a of the act of 2015. subsequent to the introduction of section 12a reading section 15 as open ended would render section 12a otiose. if section 15 is considered open ended then, in a given situation a plaintiff can file a suit involving a commercial dispute not in the commercial division to have it transferred subsequently thereto and thereby not comply with section 12 a. 73. despite the absence of power under section 15(1) of the act of 2015 to transfer a suit relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value filed in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court, having a commercial division, to the commercial division of such high court, after such suit being filed subsequently to the specification of the specified value, the court has powers under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 to deal with the same. power under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure 1908 stands regulated by section 15(1) of the act of 2015 so far as pending suits relating to a commercial dispute of the specified value in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court. once the suit has been filed beyond date of the notification of the specified value, order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908, governs the field. 74. in exercise of powers under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908, the court has to return the plaint to be filed before the court having jurisdiction. in the case of a suit relating to a commercial dispute of the specified value filed in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court having a commercial division, filed beyond the date of notification of the specified value, the plaint of such a suit must be returned to the plaintiffs for presentation before the appropriate court, in exercise of powers under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. once the same is done, the plaintiff in such a suit has to file the plaint of such suit in the same high court but in the commercial division of such high court. once the same is done, the question of operation of section 12a of the act of 2015 will arise. 75. there is a distinction between filing and institution of a suit. this distinction has been noticed in bihari chowdhurry and anr. (supra) where the supreme court has considered the provisions of section 80 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. in the context of section 80 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 the supreme court has held that, a suit against the government/government officer, to which the requirement of a prior notice under section 80 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 is attracted cannot be validly instituted until the expiration of the period of two months next after the notice in writing has been delivered to the authorities concerned in the manner prescribed in section 80 and if filed before the expiry of such period, the suit has to be dismissed as not maintainable. 76. a suit transferred under the provisions of section 15 of the act of 2015 has to be considered as the continuation of the old suit now to be tried either in the commercial division or in the commercial court as the case may be. however, a suit involving a commercial dispute and of the specified value filed subsequent to the notification of the specified value has to be transferred to the commercial court or the commercial division as the case may be under the provisions of order vii rule 11 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. such suit when presented before the commercial court or the commercial division has to be treated as a fresh suit in view of the ratio laid down in modern construction and company (supra). 77. the second to the fourth issues that have fallen for consideration can be answered in the manner following: (a) suits involving a commercial dispute filed in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction subsequent to the date of the notification of the specified value are not maintainable in such jurisdiction in view of provisions of section 7 of the act of 2015. (b) in the event, in a suit governed by scenario (a) above, the plaintiff applies for transfer, the same can be granted under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (c) on an order under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 being passed, the plaint has to be returned to the plaintiff to be filed before the appropriate forum. (d) the rigors of section 12 a of the act of 2015 will apply to the suit returned under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 for it to be instituted before the commercial division on its presentation. 78. the act of 2015 has not provided for any transfer of a suit filed in the commercial division to any other court in the event a suit is found to be incorrectly filed in the commercial division. thus in my view such suit has to be dealt with under order vii rule 11 or order vii of rule 10 as the case may be. the fifth and the sixth issues that have been raised herein are answered accordingly. 79. so far as proceedings governed by the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 involving a 'commercial dispute' within the meaning of the act of 2015 are concerned they would be guided by section 15 of the act of 2015 for filing upto the notification of the specified value. filings in the courts other than commercial division would mean that such filings have to be transferred under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 is such court is invited by any of the parties to the proceeding to do so or dismiss it under order vii rule 11 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. in the case of a proceeding under the act of 1996 the rigors of section 12 a of the act of 2015 are not attracted. the seventh issue that has been raised is answered accordingly. 80. in the cs no. 213 of 2018, the plaintiff has a money claim as against the defendants. according to the plaintiff, the defendants along with other owners of an immovable property had entered into a development agreement with a developer. the defendants had offered the plaintiff sale of an apartment measuring about 2,870 square feet on the 32nd floor of the proposed building including a servant quarter and two car parking spaces for the total sum of rs. 2,47,88,700/-. the plaintiffs had from time to time advanced a sum of rs. 1,73,52,092/to the defendants towards part consideration and part payment for the flat. the plaintiff and the defendants had entered into a memorandum of understanding dated july 3, 2013 with regard to the apartment proposed to be constructed at the property. the defendants had promised to commence construction within one year from the date of the memorandum of understanding and complete the construction within four years from the date of sanction of the building plan by the appropriate authority. the defendants had failed to keep their commitments. thereafter, the defendant no. 1 had informed the plaintiff that, the plaintiff will be entitled to an allotment of an apartment measuring 3,575 square feet on the 18th floor instead of an apartment measuring 2,870 square feet on the 32nd floor. the defendant no. 1 had also demanded increase in the total consideration to rs. 3,24,05,090/-. the plaintiff had through its advocate's letter dated february 5, 2018 called upon the defendants to confirm the allotment of an apartment measuring 2,870 square feet on the 32nd floor. the defendant no. 1 had by its letter dated february 22, 2018 refuted such claim of the plaintiff. the plaintiff had by its letter dated february 23, 2018 called upon the defendants to return the consideration amount received by the defendants along with interest at the rate of 18% per annum. according to the plaintiff, it had advanced the sum of rs. 1,73,52,092/to the defendants which the defendants are liable to refund along with interest at the rate of 18% per annum. the defendants not having returned such sum, the plaintiff has filed the instant suit after obtaining leave under clause 12 of the letters patent, 1865. 81. in the cs no. 213 of 2018, the plaintiff has applied for decree and final judgment under chapter xiii a of the original side rules. the defendant no. 1 has applied for extension of time to file written statement. the defendant no. 1 has also applied by way of the present application for rejection of the plaint. 82. it has been admitted at the bar in cs no. 213 of 2018 that, the subject matter of the suit involves a commercial dispute arising out of an agreement relating to an immovable property that the parties have used and are using exclusively in trade or commerce, within the meaning of section 2 (1)(c)(vii) of the act of 2015. 83. cs no. 213 of 2018 had been instituted in october 2018 much prior to the requisite infrastructure under section 12 a of the act of 2015 being in place on december 11, 2020. the plaintiff in cs no. 213 of 2018 therefore cannot be non-suited on such ground. ia no. g.a 4 of 2019 in cs no. 213 of 2018 is dismissed. the other pending application will appear in the list as adjourned motion 4 weeks hence. 84. in cs no. 116 of 2019 the plaintiffs have sought to recover money lent and advanced, from the defendant. the plaintiffs have not established themselves to fall in any of the categories under section 2 (1) (c) of the act of 2015. the disputes involved in the suit cannot be said to be a \"commercial dispute\" within the meaning of the act of 2015. by ia no. ga 4 of 2021 the plaintiffs have applied for transfer of the suit to the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of this hon'ble court. 85. the act of 2015 has no provision for transfer of a suit from the commercial division of the high court to its ordinary original civil jurisdiction. however, the commercial division of the high court can invoke order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 to deal with such a prayer. 86. in such circumstances, ia no. ga 4 of 2021 in cs no. 116 of 2019 is disposed of by directing the department to return the plaint to the learned advocate on record for the plaintiff for presentation before the appropriate court. on return of the plaint, the department will record cs no. 116 of 2019 as disposed of in the commercial division. the plaintiffs are at liberty to renew their prayer under section 14 of the limitation act, 1963 before the appropriate court. 87. in ia no. g a 2 of 2020 in ap no. 25 of 2016 the petitioner has sought permission to assign five units covered in a development agreement dated december 28, 2007 registered through an agreement dated march 30, 2009. the disputes involved between the parties will fall under section 2 (1) (c) (vi) of the act of 2015. the proceedings are pending since 2016. therefore, it would be appropriate to invoke section 15 of the act of 2015 and transfer ia no. g a 2 of 2020 in ap no. 25 of 2016 to the commercial division. learned advocate on record for the petitioner is granted leave to incorporate the words \"commercial division\" in the cause title of the petition and affidavits on record. list the application in the commercial division 4 weeks hence. all other points raised by the parties are kept open. 88. by the application being ia no. g a 2 of 2020 in e c 243 of 2017 the petitioners have applied under section 36 of the act of 1996. it has been contended that, the prescription of specified value in the act of 2015 is of no consequence in dealing with an arbitration proceeding under the act of 1996. with respect, in an arbitration proceeding, the court needs to decide as to whether a \"commercial dispute\" within the meaning of the act of 2015 is involved or not and then whether the value of the dispute is of the specified value or not. in the facts of e c 243 of 2017 a shareholders agreement is involved attracting section 2 (1) (c) (xii) of the act of 2015. ia no. g a 2 of 2020 in e c 243 of 2017 is therefore returned to the learned advocate on record for the petitioner for filing before the appropriate forum. on return of the petition, the department will treat ia no. ga 2 of 2020as disposed of. the petitioner also has the liberty not to press i a no. g a 2 of 2020 and file an application under section 36 of the act of 2015 on the self same cause of action in the commercial division. 89. by way of ia no. ga 2 of 2021 in cs no. 136 of 2020, the defendant no. one has applied for rejection of the plaint. the defendant no. 1 has contended that, the dispute in the suit is a commercial dispute within the meaning of section 2 (1) (c) (vii) of the act of 2015. the plaintiff has filed cs no. 136 of 2024 seeking eviction of the defendant no. 1. the defendant no. 1 has contended that the agreement between the parties was a lease agreement relating to an immovable property in respect of which the defendant no. 1 was inducted as a tenant for commercial purpose. since the defendant no. 1 has admitted the suit property to be in use for commercial purpose it would be appropriate to hold that the suit involves a commercial dispute within the meaning of section 2 (1) (c) (vii) of the act of 2015. the plaint of cs no. 136 of 2020 is therefore returned to the learned advocate on record of the plaintiff for presentation in the commercial division. on return of the plaint, the department will treat cs no. 136 of 2020 as disposed of. the plaintiff will be at liberty to avail of the benefits of section 14 of the limitation act, 1963. 90. cs no. 136 of 2020 having been instituted in november 2020, that is, prior to december 11, 2020 the question of non-suiting the plaintiff for non-compliance of section 12a of the act of 2015 on transfer of the suit to the commercial division does not arise. 91. the petitioners in a p no. 223 of 2020 have applied under section 14 of the act of 1996 for termination of the mandate of the arbitrator in respect of a loan agreement. the respondent is a financer. the disputes come within section 2 (1) (c) (i) of the act of 2015. a p no. 223 of 2020 be returned to the learned advocate on record for the petitioner for filing before the appropriate forum. on return of the petition, the department will treat a p no. 223 of 2020 as disposed of. the petitioner also has the liberty to not press a. p. no. 223 of 2020 and file a fresh on the self same cause of action before the commercial division. ia no. ga 1 of 2020 in a p no.223 of 2020 is disposed of accordingly.
