These four writ petitions arise from a common award between the same parties and the dispute involved in all these writ petitions are identical, and therefore, with the consent of the learned Couns el appearing on both sides, all the petitions are clubbed, heard together and disposed of by this common order. \n2. Brief facts of the case that would be relevant for the purpose of disposal of these writ petitions are, the petitioner herein was awarded four different contracts pursuant to the tender notification published by respondent no.1 and agreements were also executed by respondent no.1 in favour of the petitioner for the project - 'Improvements to Basavakalyan-Raichur Road' from KM 67 to 99.80 in Chittapur of Gulbarga District. Since there were certain disputes between the parties arising out of the contract, petitioner had approached this Court in CMP Nos.20005- 20009/2014 which was disposed of by this Court on 19.01.2015 appointing respondent no.2 as the Sole Arbitrator. \n3. The learned Arbitrator had thereafter entered appearance and pursuant to the notices issued by him, parties have filed claim petition, statement of objections and also counter claim. The learned Arbitrator partly allowed the claim petition vide his common award dated 30.10.2018 and as against the said common award, respondent no.1 herein had filed four separate arbitration suits before the Principal District & Sessions Judge, Kalaburagi (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commercial Court') under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, 'the Act of 1996'). Along with the suit, respondent no.1 had also filed an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay, if any, caused in filing the arbitration suit. \n4. The learned Judge of the Commercial Court vide the impugned order dated 30.01.2020 has allowed the said applications and the delay caused in filing the arbitration suit was condoned. Being aggrieved by the same, the petitioner is before this Court. \n5. Sri Ameet Kumar Deshpande, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the arbitration suits under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 were filed by respondent no.1 before the Commercial Court beyond the period of limitation and the Commercial Court has got jurisdiction to condone the delay only as provided under Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996. He submits that the arbitration suit is required to be filed within three months from the date the applicant has received the copy of the award and the Commercial Court can condone a maximum of 30 days delay thereafter, and if the delay is more than that, the same cannot be condoned. He submits that in the case on hand, the delay is much more than 30 days after expiry of three months period and therefore, the Commercial Court could not have condoned the same. \n6. He submits that the application for correction of award is required to be filed within 30 days from the date of receipt of award as provided under Section 33 of the Act of 1996. In the case on hand, the award is passed on 30.10.2018 and the application is filed on 06.02.2019 which is much beyond the period provided under Section 33 of the Act of 1996. He submits that the learned arbitrator has no power to consider the application under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 if the same is filed after expiry of thirty days and therefore the order passed by him is a nullity and nonest in the eye of law. He submits that since the order under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 is passed without jurisdiction the limitation for filing application under Section 34(1) of the Act of 1996 commences from the date of receipt of award by applicant and not from the date the learned arbitrator has disposed of Section 33 application. He submits that no application was filed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 but only a request letter was issued by respondent No.1. He submits that the petitioner was not heard by the learned Arbitrator before the award was corrected on the basis of a letter submitted by respondent no.1 herein. In support of his contentions, he has relied upon the following judgments: \n     (i)     MUK LTD. VS UNION OF INDIA - AIR              Online 2016 DEL 1; \n\n\n     (ii)    D.M.JAWHAR MERICAN VS ENGINEERS              INDIA LTD. - (DLH) 2009 (3) 129; \n\n\n     (iii)   SIMPLEX INFRASTRUCTURE VS UNION              OF INDIA - (2019)2 SCC 455;\n\n\n     (iv)    IRCON INTERNATIONAL LTD. BUDHRAJ              MINING & ORS. - 2007(4) ARBLR 159              DELHI; \n\n\n     (v)     UNION OF INDIA VS SABOO MINERALS              PVT. LTD . - 2003(3) RAJ 354. \n\n\n     7.      Per   contra,   Sri       Dhyan   Chinnappa,   learned Additional Advocate General appearing for respondent no.1 submits that it is not in dispute that the application under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 was filed for correction of the award after expiry of 30 days from the date of receipt of the copy of award. He submits that the order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 merges with the award. He also submits that the petitioner has not challenged the order dated 08.03.2019 passed by the learned Arbitrator allowing the application filed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 for correction of the typographical errors in the award. He submits that the application under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 was filed to correct the CMP numbers and the correction now made by the learned Arbitrator enures to the benefit of both the parties and if the said correction is not made, the petitioner will not be put in a position to execute the awards. He submits that the order under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 was passed by the learned Arbitrator on 08.03.2019 and the arbitration suit under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 was filed before the Commercial Court on 09.07.2019, which is well within the period prescribed under Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996. \n8. He submits that the limitation prescribed for challenging the award is three months, and therefore, the actual number of days in the three months from the date of the order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 is required to be taken into consideration, and in addition to the same, the Commercial Court has power to condone the delay of 30 days. He submits that the judgment in MUK Ltd.'s case supra and also in Ircon International Ltd.'s case has been passed in a proceeding where the challenge was made against the order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996, and therefore, the said judgments would not be applicable to the facts of this case. He submits that petitioner herein who is the beneficiary of the order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 has thought it fit not to challenge the said order, and therefore, by its conduct, it has to be presumed that it has consented for such an order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996. In support of his arguments, he has relied upon the following judgments:\n      (i)     VED PRAKASH VS UNION OF INDIA -               2018(10) SCJ 280;\n\n\n      (ii)    STATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH & ANR.\n              VS HIMACHAL TECHNO ENGINEERS & \n              ANR. - (2010)12 SCC 210;\n\n\n      (iii)   BOKARO & RAMGUR LTD. VS PRASUN               KUMAR BANERJEE - AIR 1968 PAT 150, \n\n\n\n\n\n     (iv)   NAGAR      PALIKA,       MIRZAPUR         VS             MIRZAPUR ELECT. SUPPLY CO. LTD. - \n            AIR 1990 SC 2273, \n\n\n     (v)    RAFIQUE BIBI (DEAD) BY LRS VS SYED             WALIUDDIN (DEAD) BY LRS & OTHERS -             (2004)1 SCC 287. \n9. He also refers to the award passed by the learned Arbitrator and submits that without assigning any reasons he has awarded a sum of more than hundred crores in favour of the contractor/petitioner which would be a huge burden to the State exchequer. \n10. The undisputed facts of the case are that the award was pronounced by the learned Arbitrator on 30.10.2018 and the copy of the award was handed over to the parties on the very same date. Request under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 was made on 06.02.2019 for correction of the CMP numbers in the award and the learned Arbitrator had allowed the said application and had issued a corrected copy of the award on 08.03.2019. Arbitration suit before the Commercial Court was filed under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 on 06.07.2019 and the application IA No.II was also filed along with the suit to condone the delay, if any, caused in filing the suit. The Commercial Court vide the order impugned has held that the limitation to file the application/suit under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 has commenced in this case from 08.03.2019 onwards in view of the order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 by the learned arbitrator and has exercised its jurisdiction to condone the delay of thirty days caused beyond the limitation period of three months provided under Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 and accordingly allowed IA No.II filed for condonation of the delay. \n11. The question that would arise for consideration in these petitions is - \"Whether the Commercial Court was justified in holding that the period of limitation to file an application/suit under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 commences from the date of the order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 having regard to the facts and circumstances of the present case ?\n12. Chapter VII of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 provides for recourse against arbitral award. Section 34(1) of the Act of 1996 provides that recourse to a Court against the arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3).\n13. Sub-section (2) of Section 34 of the Act of 1996 provides the ground on which the arbitral award may be set- aside by the Court and sub-section 3 of Section 34 of the Act of 1996 provides for the period of limitation for filing an application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996.\n14. Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 reads as under:-\n\"(3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date o which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal;\nProvided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.\"\n15. The limitation prescribed under Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 for filing an application challenging the arbitral award is three months from the date on which the party making application has received the copy of award and the proviso to Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 provides that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making an application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter. Therefore, it is clear that the Court before which, an application is filed under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 can entertain the application by condoning the delay of a maximum period of thirty days after expiry of three months period provided for filing the application and said Court has no power to condone any further delay beyond thirty days. \n16. Reading of Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 also makes it clear that if a request has been made under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 then the period of limitation is required to be considered from the date on which the request has been disposed of by the Arbitral Tribunal. \n17. Section 33 of the Act of 1996 provides for correction and interpretation of award; additional award and it reads as hereunder :-\n(1) Within thirty days from the receipt of the arbitral award, unless another period of time has been agreed upon by the parties-- (a) a party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to correct any computation errors, any clerical or typographical errors or any other errors of a similar nature occurring in the award;\n(b) if so agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to give an interpretation of a specific point or part of the award. \n(2) If the arbitral tribunal considers the request made under sub-section (1) to be justified, it shall make the correction or give the interpretation within thirty days from the receipt of the request and the interpretation shall form part of the arbitral award.\n(3) The arbitral tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1), on its own initiative, within thirty days from the date of the arbitral award.\n(4) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party with notice to the other party, may request, within thirty days from the receipt of the arbitral award, the arbitral tribunal to make an additional arbitral award as to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the arbitral award.\n(5) If the arbitral tribunal considers the request made under sub-section (4) to be justified, it shall make the additional arbitral award within sixty days from the receipt of such request.\n(6) The arbitral tribunal may extend, if necessary, the period of time within which it shall make a correction, give an interpretation or make an additional arbitral award under sub-section (2) or sub- section (5).\n(7) Section 31 shall apply to a correction or interpretation of the arbitral award or to an additional arbitral award made under this section.\n18. From a reading of Section 33 of the Act of 1996, it is clear that an application for correction of any computation errors, clerical or typographical errors or any other errors of similar nature occurred in the award is required to be made within thirty days from the date of receipt of arbitral award, unless another period of time as agreed upon by the parties and the application under this provision is required to be made with notice to the other party. In view of Section 33(7) of the Act of 1996 any correction or interpretation under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 made to the arbitral award, will form part of the original award. \n19. Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of MKU Limited vs. Union of India1 and has referred to para 24 of the said judgment which reads as follows :-\nAIROnline 2016 Del 1 \"24. A plain reading of Section 33(1) of the Act indicates that the time for filing the application provided under the Section is inflexible. An application for correcting errors under Section 33 of the Act can be made only within a period of 30 days from receipt of the arbitral award subject to the parties agreeing otherwise. In the present case, admittedly, there is no agreement or arrangement between the parties for extension of the period as specified under Section 33 of the Act. The Arbitrator derives his jurisdiction to act as such from the agreement between the parties and the provisions of the Act. Thus, the Arbitrator did not have the jurisdiction to entertain an application under Section 33 of the Act beyond the period of thirty days from the date of receipt of the Interim Award dated 12.02.2016. In my view, the application made by the respondent was clearly incompetent and the Arbitrator could not have entertained the same. \n20. In the case of Ircon International Ltd., vs Budhraja Mining2, which has been relied by the learned Senior counsel for the petitioner, the Delhi High Court has held as follows :-\n\"A plain reading of the aforesaid provisions indicates that, unless another period of time has been agreed upon by the parties, an application for correction of any computational errors or typographical errors has to be made to the arbitral Tribunal within 30 days from the receipt of the arbitral Award. It is also necessary to observe that the application has to be made with notice to the other party. Sub-section (3) of Section 33 also 2007 (4) ARBLR 159 Delhi empowers the arbitral Tribunal to make such corrections on its own initiative within 30 days from the date of the arbitral Award. Sub-section (2) of Section 33 stipulates that the arbitral Tribunal, if it considers the request for corrections to be justified, shall make the corrections within 30 days from the receipt of the request and the same shall form part of the arbitral Award. It is, therefore, clear that there are three different sets of periods of limitation prescribed under the said provisions. The first is the period of 30 days of receipt of the Award by a party during which the said party can request the arbitral Tribunal to correct any computational or typographical errors in the Award. The second period is a period of 30 days for the arbitral Tribunal to make the correction. The third period prescribed is in the case where the arbitral Tribunal seeks to make a correction on its own initiative. The period prescribed is 30 days from the date of the arbitral Award. Since the arbitral Tribunal makes a correction under this provision, on its own initiative, the date of the receipt of the arbitral Award is not relevant and the clock starts running from the date of the arbitral Award itself. In the present case this provision is not in issue but it brings out the nature of the limitation periods prescribed for making corrections of computational errors/ typographical errors. The nature being that it is strictly time bound and cannot be extendable unless provided in the statute itself. The provision for extension of time has been made in Sub-section (6) of Section 33 and it only pertains to the time during which the tribunal may make a correction under Sub- section (2) or Sub-section (5) of the said Section 33. In other words, there is a specific provision for extending the time within which the Tribunal makes the correction after a request is received by it. There is, however, no provision enabling the Tribunal to extend the time for receiving the request from a party to make corrections of computational and/ or typographical errors. This is sufficient indication of the fact that the legislature permitted extension of time to the arbitral Tribunal to decide on the question of corrections but did not permit extension of time by the arbitral Tribunal for receiving an application whereby a party makes a request for carrying out corrections. It is in this context that Sub- section (3) of Section 33 also gains importance. As pointed out above, that provision enables the arbitral Tribunal to make a correction on its own initiative and only 30 days time was granted for doing so and that too from the date of the arbitral Award. There is no provision like Section 33(6) which enables the arbitral Tribunal to correct an error on its own initiative beyond 30 days from the date of the arbitral Award. The position, therefore, is very clear that where the legislature permitted extension of time it did so expressly. In these circumstances, the inescapable conclusion would be that the legislative intent was that the delay, if any, in filing of an application under Section 33(1)(a) of the said Act could not be condoned by invoking the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act.\" \n21. The learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the respondents during the course of his arguments has pointed out that the judgment in the case of MKU Limited (supra) and also in the case of Ircon International Ltd. (supra) have been rendered by the Delhi High Court wherein a challenge was made to the orders passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996. He also submitted that the law laid down in the said cases are not in dispute but the same cannot be made applicable to the facts of the present case as no challenge has been made by the petitioner herein to the order passed by the learned Arbitrator under Section 33 of the Act of 1996.\n22. I find force in the said contention urged by the learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the respondents. Admittedly, no challenge has been made by the petitioner herein to the order passed by the learned Arbitrator under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 and therefore, the judgments in the case of MKU Ltd. (supra) and Ircon International Ltd. (supra) would not be applicable to the facts of this case. \n23. In the case of D.M.Jawhar Merican vs Engineers India Limited3, the Delhi High Court was considering the question whether a party is entitled for extension of limitation under Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996, if the application filed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996, does not in fact constitute an application under Section FAO (OS) No.445/2008 - 30.03.2009 33 of the Act of 1996. In the said case an application was filed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 contending that he was entitled for higher amount of compensation than that was awarded by the learned Arbitrator. It is under these circumstances, in para 21 of the said judgment the Delhi High Court has observed as follows :-\n\"21. We find merit in the aforesaid submission of learned counsel for respondent. In our view, merely because an application is styled as one under Section 33 of the Act the objector would not be entitled to the extension of limitation under Section 34(4) of the Act till the disposal of such an application, if otherwise the application, as filed, does not in fact constitute an application to \"request the arbitral tribunal to correct any computation errors, any clerical or typographical errors or any other errors of a similar nature occurring in the award\". We have been shown the application preferred by the appellant as one under Section 33 of the Act dated 12.02.2005. The crux of the appellants submission in this application was that he was entitled to the award of higher amount of compensation than that awarded by the learned Arbitrator. In the application the appellant had stated as follows:\n\"8. The learned Arbitrator while passing the Final Award dated 18.01.2005, in para 39 at page 53 has committed an error by restricting the award amount to MR 211,250 on an alleged observation that the Claimant himself has restricted the claim in a sum of MR 211,250.\n9. ........................................\n10. It is submitted that according to the Claimant he is entitled to MR 418,750 for EIL Job No.3623 by splitting the same into 2 equal halves and MR 1,875 for EIL Job No.3606 and US$ 15,390 for EIL Job No.3371. The same also finds reference at page 12 of the Interim Award dated 23.04.2004.\n11. The Claimant had correctly set out the same amounts in the Claim Petition dated 16th September, 2002 by claiming MR 209,375 being 50% of the commission payable for EIL Job No.3623 being MR 209,375 plus MR 1875 for EIL Job No.3606 totaling to MR 211,250 under the 1st head and another sum of MR 209,375 being the balance 50% commission being MR 209,375 for EIL Job No.3623 under the 2nd head. But an error occurred in the penultimate para in the claim petition dated 16th September, 2002 in so far as while adding up the claim amount in US$, the 50% of commission amount for EIL Job No.3623 being MR 209,375 was not taken into account. But soon thereafter the error was noticed and the Claimant filed a revised claim petition to correct the claim amount by claim petition dated 9th April, 2003 and the penultimate para was corrected. But at all times the Claimant claimed commission in a sum of MR 420,625 towards commission for EIL Job Nos.3623 and 3606 and US$ 15390 for Job No.3371 as commission. Apart from the commission amount the Claimant also claimed another sum in MR 420,625 and US$ 15390 towards interest at 20% for 5 years on the claim amount. The modified Claim petition dated 9th April, 2003 was allowed. \nThe error apparent in the Final Award, wherein it has been recorded that the Claimant has restricted his claim to MR 211,250 needs to be corrected and the full amount in the sum of MR 389,275 which the Honble Arbitrator has found the Claimant to be entitled to, may kindly be awarded in favour of the Claimant. \nUnder these circumstances as stated herein above it would be just and proper and as such it is prayed that the Honble Arbitrator may be pleased to correct/modify the Final Award dated 18.01.2005 [under Section 33 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996] and pass an Award thereby holding that the Claimant is entitled to a sum of MR 389,275 as commission in respect of EIL Job Nos.3623 and 3606 as observed and concluded by the Honble Arbitrator in para 39 of the Final Award dated 18.01.2005.\"\"\n24. In D.M.Jawhar Merican's case (supra) the Delhi High Court having found that the application under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 was not for correction of any typographical and clerical errors but for modification on the merits of the case had held that the starting point of limitation for filing application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 was from the date of receipt of copy of the award by the applicant and has further held that even if the starting point of limitation would have been taken from the date of the order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996, even then the application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 was not filed within the period of limitation as provided under Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 and therefore the High Court of Delhi has held that the Court trying the application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 cannot entertain such an application which is filed beyond the period of thirty days after expiry of three months period from the date of award.\n25. In the case of M/s Simplex Infrastructure Ltd. vs Union of India4 at paragraphs 13 and 14 the Honb'le Supreme Court has held follows :-\n\"13. A plain reading of sub-section (3) along with the proviso to Section 34 of the 1996 Act, shows that the application for setting aside the award on the grounds mentioned in sub- section (2) of Section 34 could be made within three months and the period can only be extended for a further period of thirty days AIR 2019 Supreme Court 505 on showing sufficient cause and not thereafter. The use of the words \"but not thereafter\" in the proviso makes it clear that the extension cannot be beyond thirty days. Even if the benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act is given to the respondent, there will still be a delay of 131 days in filing the application. That is beyond the strict timelines prescribed in sub-section (3) read along with the proviso to Section 34 of the 1996 Act. The delay of 131 days cannot be condoned. To do so, as the High Court did, is to breach a clear statutory mandate. \n14. The respondent received the arbitral award on 31 October 2014. Exactly ninety days after the receipt of the award, the respondent filed an application under Section 34 of the 1996 Act before the District Judge, Port Blair on 30 January 2015. On 12 February 2016, the District Judge dismissed the application for want of jurisdiction and on 28 March 2016, the respondent filed an application before the High Court under Section 34 of the 1996 Act for setting aside the arbitral award. After the order of dismissal of the application by the District Judge, the respondent took almost 44 days (excluding the date of dismissal of the application by the District Judge and the date of filing of application before the High Court) in filing the application before the High Court. Hence, even if the respondent is given the benefit of the provision of Section 14 of the Limitation Act in respect of the period spent in pursuing the proceedings before the District Judge, Port Blair, the petition under Section 34 was filed much beyond the outer period of ninety days.\" \n26. In the case of M/s Simplex Infrastructure Ltd., (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the Court considering an application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 cannot entertain such an application which is filed beyond the period of thirty days after expiry of the limitation of three months for filing the application. \n27. In the case of Union of India (Uoi) Another vs Saboo Minerals Pvt.Ltd.5, the High Court of Delhi was considering a case where the application under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 was filed beyond the period of thirty days and the said application was dismissed by the learned Arbitrator on the ground of delay and a contention was urged before the High Court that the period of limitation to file application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 would start only after dismissal of the application under Section 33 of the Act of 1996. In the said case in para 4 of the judgment the Hon'ble Delhi High Court has held follows :- \n\"4. To exclude the time taken in pursuing the application under Section 33 of the Act, the application filed under Section 33 has to be within the period prescribed in the Act. In a case where an application under Section 33 of the Act has been filed say after a period of six months from the date of receipt of the award by the party, it cannot be said that the time for filing objections under Section 34 of the Act would start from the date 2003 VAD Delhi 623 of rejection of such an application. If this contention is accepted, any party with a view to circumvent the limitation provided in Section 34 of the Act would make an application before the Arbitrator under Section 33 of the Act and wait for his decision and file objections after disposal of such an application, which was not even maintainable because of the same having been filed beyond the time prescribed in Section 33 of the Act. I am, therefore, not impressed with the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the appellant that the limitation would start from the date of rejection of the application under Section 33 by the Arbitrator. If the application under Section 33 had been filed within time, no doubt, the appellant would have been entitled to the exclusion of time taken in pursuing the said application but as the application under Section 33 of the Act itself was barred by time, in my opinion, the appellant cannot take advantage of Section 34(3) of the Act so as to start limitation from the date of rejection of such an application.\" \n28. In the present case though the application under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 was filed by the respondent herein after expiry of period of thirty days from the date of award, the Tribunal has entertained the same and carried out necessary typographical errors in the body of the award. It is not in dispute the correction made is with regard to the typographical error in mentioning the CMP numbers and this correction would enure to the benefit of all the parties to the award and though the respondent has filed the application before the Commercial Court under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 contending that the period of limitation starts from the date of the order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996, the petitioner herein has not challenged the said order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 by the learned Arbitrator. \n29. Admittedly, the application/suit under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 was filed before the Commercial Court on 06.07.2019 and the order impugned has been passed on 30.01.2020. During the intervening period no challenge has been made by the petitioner to the order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 and therefore it has to be presumed that it has impliedly agreed for such an order which also enures to its benefit and admittedly the petitioner has filed execution proceedings before the Commercial Court mentioning the corrected CMP numbers. \n30. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ved Prakash Mithal and Sons vs Union of India6 which arose from a 2018 SCC OnLine SC 3181 case were the application filed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 was dismissed by the learned Arbitrator and the Court before which Section 34 application was filed, had held that the application made under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 was time barred for the reason that there was no correction made to the award, though there was an application under Section 33 of the Act of 1996. It has been further held that the word disposal mentioned in Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 can be either by allowing the application or by dismissing the application and therefore the period of limitation for filing an application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 commences from the disposal of the application under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 by the learned Arbitrator.\n31. From the reading of the various judgments referred to herein above, it is clear that- a) The period of limitation for filing an application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 commences from the date the applicant receives the copy of the arbitral award and the period of limitation provided under Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 is three months from the date of the award;\n(b) The Court before whom the application under Section 34 is filed, can condone the further delay of thirty days beyond the period of three months, if the applicant shows that it was prevented by sufficient cause from making application within the said period of three months but the court has no power to condone the delay beyond thirty days having regard to the word used in the proviso to Section 34(3) of the Act, 'but not thereafter'. \n(c) If a request is made under Section 33 of the Act, 1996 before the Tribunal, then the limitation under Section 34(3) for filing an application under Section 34 would commence from the date on which such request has been disposed of by the arbitral Tribunal/arbitrator. \n32. Learned Additional Advocate General has argued that the petitioner is also a beneficiary of the order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 and therefore he has not challenged the said order and he has filed execution petition mentioning the corrected CMP numbers in the said proceedings and therefore his conduct amounts to an implied agreement or consent for the order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996. In the case of Bokaro and Ramgur Ltd. Vs Prasun Kumar Banerjee 7, the Full Bench of the Patna High Court at para 19 has observed as follows :-\n\"19. Principles of waiver and acquiescence can also be pressed into service in support of the view taken above. In Article 1175 at page 637 of Halsbury's Laws of England. 3rd Edition. Vol. 14, it is stated:\n\"Waiver is the abandonment of a right, and is express or implied from conduct. A person who is entitled to the benefit of a stipulation in a contract or of a statutory provision may waive it and allow the contract or transaction to proceed as though the stipulation or provision did not exist.\" \nThe petitioner Company in this case was entitled to put a stop to the Arbitrator proceeding in the matter on the expiry of 4 months after he entered on the reference because of the stipulation in the arbitration agreement imported under the Act but it waived it and allowed the proceeding to proceed as though the stipulation did not exist. In my opinion, it waived its right. In the same Volume in Article 1177 at page 638, the term 'acquiescence' has been stated to imply in its proper legal sense that a person abstains from interfering while a violation of his legal rights is in progress. The next Article says that acquiescence operates by way of estoppel and is an instance of estoppel by words or conduct. Of course, for the application of the principles of waiver and acquiescence and also to a certain extent for the AIR 1968 Pat 150 application of the doctrine of estoppel by conduct knowledge of one's legal rights or true facts must be there. On the facts of the instant case as narrated above, I have no doubt that it was there.\"\n33. In the case of Nagar Palika, Mirzapur vs The Mirzapur Elect. Supply Co.Ltd.8 the Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering a case which arose from an appeal filed as against the award which was passed by the learned Arbitrator, with the consent of the parties, on all heads of disputes between the parties. When the said award was sought to be made the rule of the Court, the appellant therein had objected on the ground that the learned Arbitrator had ignored to decide the heads of disputes raised by it. That objection was over ruled by the Trial Court as well as by the High Court, since by consent of parties all the heads which were raised by the rival parties were decided by the learned arbitrator without assigning any reasons. In the said case, further objection was taken by the appellant that the learned Arbitrator had passed the award, after expiry of the outer limit fixed for disposal of the Arbitration case. This argument was rejected by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the AIR 1990 SC 2273 ground that the conduct of the parties is a major factor to waive the extension of time given by the Court and the time was taken as extended in the said case. \n34. Even in the present case, though the respondents herein had disclosed before the Commercial Court at the time of filing the application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 about the order dated 08.03.2019 passed by the learned Arbitrator under Section 33 of the Act of 1996, till date no steps have been taken by the petitioner herein to challenge the said order. Section 34(3) of the Act 1996 specifically states that if any order is passed under Section 33 of the Act, 1996 by the learned Arbitrator then the period of limitation commences from the date of the said order for filing an application under Section 34(1) of the Act of 1996. Therefore, if the petitioner had any grievance as against the order passed by learned arbitrator under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 it ought to have challenged the same before the appropriate forum. In the absence of any such challenge and having regard to the fact that the petitioner has filed an execution petition with the corrected CMP numbers, it virtually amounts to an acquiescence and implied agreement for the order passed by the learned Arbitrator under Section 33 of the Act of 1996.\n35. It is a settled principle of law that if a party has any grievance against any order passed by a Competent Authority or Court, the said order is required to be challenged before an appropriate forum in the manner known to law and if the same is not done, party would be bound by such an order. If the order is passed illegally or without following the procedure provided under law the said order cannot be brushed aside or ignored by the party who is adversely affected by the same. An illegal or irregular order passed without compliance of the procedure of law cannot be termed as an order passed without jurisdiction, and therefore not binding on the parties. \n36. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rafique Bibi (Dead) by LRs vs Syed Waliuddin (Dead) by LRs and others9 at paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 has observed as follows :-\n\"8. A distinction exists between a decree passed by a Court having no jurisdiction and consequently being a nullity and not executable and a decree of the Court which is merely illegal or not passed in accordance with the procedure laid down by law. A decree suffering from illegality or irregularity of procedure, cannot be termed inexecutable by the executing Court; the remedy of a person aggrieved by such a decree is to have it set aside in a duly constituted legal proceedings or by a superior Court failing which he must obey the command of the decree. A decree passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction cannot be denuded of its efficacy by any callateral attack or in incidental proceedings. \n9. In Vasudev Dhanjibhai Modi v. Rajabhai Abdul Rehman & Ors., [1970] 1 SCC 670, it has been held :-\n\"When the decree is made by a Court which has no inherent jurisdiction to make it, objection as to its validity may be raised in an execution proceeding if the objection appears on the face of the record. But where the objection as to jurisdiction of the Court to pass the decree does not appear on the face of the record and requires examination of the questions raised and decided at the trial or which could have been but have not been raised, the executing Court will have no jurisdiction to entertain an objection as to the validity of the decree even on the ground of absence of jurisdiction.\" \n(2004) 1 Supreme Court Cases 287 10. It is not the plea of the appellant-judgment debtor- that the Court which passed the decree did not have the jurisdiction to do so. It is also not their case that a ground for eviction of the tenants on the ground of default in payment of arrears of rent was not available to the respondent-landlords within the meaning of the Delhi and Ajmer Act or the successor Rajasthan Act. The only submission made is that before passing the decree the Court should have afforded the tenant an opportunity of depositing the rent in arrears, which was not done. Firstly, we find merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the respondents that it was for the tenants to have invited the attention of the Court by making an application in that regard so as to avail an opportunity of wiping out the effect of their default which gave rise to cause of action to the respondents, by depositing the rent during the pendency of the suit. That having not been done, the appellant-tenants cannot be heard to urge any infirmity in the decree. Secondly, accepting it at its face value, in the eyes of law, the challenge seeks to expose a procedural irregularity which may, at best, result in the decree being termed as an 'illegal decree', but that in itself would not amount to branding the decree as 'without jurisdiction' or 'a nullity'. The plea which is sought to be urged in the execution proceedings was available to be raised by the tenants before the High Court in an appeal against the decree. Such a plea was not taken before the passing of the decree and cannot now be allowed to be urged during the execution proceedings. It is unfortunate that a decree of eviction passed in a suit commenced in the year 1956 and culminating in a final decree in the year 1986 is still starving for its execution.\"\n37. A plain reading of Section 33 of the Act of 1996 makes it clear that the learned arbitrator has jurisdiction to receive an application/request from a party to the award to correct computation, clerical and typographical errors and thereafter pass appropriate orders as provided under the said provision of law. If the Court which has jurisdiction fails to correctly exercise the same while passing an order, such order cannot be considered as one without jurisdiction. The existence of jurisdiction does not depend on the correctness of its exercise. The application under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 is filed before the learned arbitrator who has passed the award and therefore it cannot be said that he had no jurisdiction to receive it for consideration. If that is so, he also has jurisdiction to entertain the same. \n38. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Hindusthan Commercial Bank Ltd vs Punnu Sahu (dead through legal representatives 10 has held that the expression \"entertain\" would mean \"adjudicate upon\" or AIR 1970 Supreme Court 1384 \"proceed to consider on merits\". In the case of Nusli Neville Wadia vs. Ivory Properties and Others11, the Hon'ble Supreme Court at paragraphs 16, 17, 33 and 36 has observed as follows :-\n\"16. Jurisdiction is the power to decide and not merely the power to decide correctly. Jurisdiction is the authority of law to act officially. It is an authority of law to act officially in a particular matter in hand. It is the power to take cognizance and decide the cases. It is the power to decide rightly or wrongly. It is the power to hear and determine. Same is the foundation of judicial proceedings. It does not depend upon the correctness of the decision made. It is the power to decide justiciable controversy and includes questions of law as well as facts on merits. Jurisdiction is the right to hear and determine. It does not depend upon whether a decision is right or wrong. Jurisdiction means power to entertain a suit, consider merits, and render binding decisions, and \"merits\" means the various elements which enter into or qualify plaintiff's right to the relief sought. If the law confers a power to render a judgment or decree, then the court has jurisdiction. The court must have control over the subject matter, which comes within classification limits of law under which Court is established and functions. \n17. The word jurisdiction is derived from Latin words \"Juris\"\nand \"dico,\" meaning \"I speak by the law\" and does not relate to rights of parties as between each other but to the power of the AIR 2019 Supreme Court 5125 court. Jurisdiction relates to a class of cases to which a particular case belongs. Jurisdiction is the authority by which a judicial officer takes cognizance and decides the cases. It only presupposes the existence of a duly constituted court having control over subject matter which comes within classification limits of the law under which court has been established. It should have control over the parties litigant, control over the parties' territory, it may also relate to pecuniary as well as the nature of the class of cases. Jurisdiction is generally understood as the authority to decide, render a judgment, inquire into the facts, to apply the law, and to pronounce a judgment. When there is the want of general power to act, the court has no jurisdiction. When the court has the power to inquire into the facts, apply the law, render binding judgment, and enforce it, the court has jurisdiction. Judgment within a jurisdiction has to be immune from collateral attack on the ground of nullity. It has corelation with the constitutional and statutory power of tribunal or court to hear and determine. It means the power or capacity fundamentally to entertain, hear, and determine. \nxxx xxx xxx 33. There is a difference between the existence of jurisdiction and the exercise of jurisdiction. In case jurisdiction is exercised with material irregularity or with illegality, it would also constitute jurisdictional error. However, if a court has jurisdiction to entertain a suit but in exercise of jurisdiction, a mistake has been committed, though it would be a jurisdictional error but not lack of it. It may be a jurisdictional error open for interference in appellate or revisional jurisdiction. \nxxx xxx xxx 36. In a case, jurisdictional facts, as well as adjudicatory facts, may arise. When jurisdictional facts to entertain are missing, the court/tribunal cannot act at all. In the case of adjudicatory facts, the court can proceed with the trial of the case exercising jurisdiction, and the same implies that the court has the jurisdiction to deal with the matter, that is called the power to examine on merits. Adjudication is the power to proceed to consider on merits.\" \n39. The order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 in the present case cannot be said to be one without jurisdiction on the face of the record because, though Section 33 of the Act of 1996 provides for a period of thirty days to file an application for correction of the award on computation, clerical or typographical errors etc., if the parties are agreeable the said period can be extended. In the case on hand, admittedly after the order was passed by the learned Arbitrator under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 the petitioner has not challenged the same. Though it has stated that it had no notice of the proceedings before the learned Arbitrator under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 , even after the order was brought to its notice by the respondents at the time of filing the application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 before the Commercial Act, the petitioner has not taken any steps to challenge the said order. \n40. The learned arbitrator undoubtedly has jurisdiction to entertain an application under Section 33 of the Act of 1996, and if he has passed an illegal or erroneous order it cannot be said that the same is without jurisdiction and if that is so, then in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rafique Bibi (supra) the petitioner is required to challenge the order passed by the learned Arbitrator under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 before the competent forum. Unless the petitioner successfully challenges the said order passed by the learned Arbitrator under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 it is not open for it to raise a contention in the proceedings under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 that the limitation for filing an application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 should be taken into consideration from the original date of award and not from the date of the order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996. Undisputedly the learned arbitrator has allowed the application made under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 and consequently the error in the award has been corrected and therefore the correction made becomes the part of original award. \n41. In the case of the State of Himachal Pradesh and another vs Himachal Techno Engineers and another12, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraphs 14 to 19 has held as follows :-\n\"14. The High Court has held that \"three months\"\nmentioned in section 34(3) of the Act refers to a period of 90 days. This is erroneous. A \"month\" does not refer to a period of thirty days, but refers to the actual period of a calendar month. If the month is April, June, September or November, the period of the month will be thirty days. If the month is January, March, May, July, August, October or December, the period of the month will be thirty-one days. If the month is February, the period will be twenty-nine days or twenty-eight days depending upon whether it is a leap year or not. \n(2010) 12 Supreme Court Cases 210 15. Sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the Act and the proviso thereto significantly, do not express the periods of time mentioned therein in the same units. Sub-section (3) uses the words \"three months\" while prescribing the period of limitation and the proviso uses the words \"thirty days\" while referring to the outside limit of condonable delay. The legislature had the choice of describing the periods of time in the same units, that is, to describe the periods as \"three months\" and \"one month\"\nrespectively or by describing the periods as \"ninety days\" and \"thirty days\" respectively. It did not do so. Therefore, the legislature did not intend that the period of three months used in sub-section (3) to be equated to 90 days, nor intended that the period of thirty days to be taken as one month. \n16. Section 3(35) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 defines a \"month\" as meaning a month reckoned according to the British calendar. \n17. In Dodds v. Walker - (1981) 2 All ER 609 (HL), the House of Lords held that in calculating the period of a month or a specified number of months that had elapsed after the occurrence of a specified event, such as the giving of a notice, the general rule is that the period ends on the corresponding date in the appropriate subsequent month irrespective of whether some months are longer than others. To the same effect is the decision of this Court in Bibi Salma Khatoon v. State of Bihar - (2001) 7 SCC 197.\n18. Therefore when the period prescribed is three months (as contrasted from 90 days) from a specified date, the said period would expire in the third month on the date corresponding to the date upon which the period starts. As a result, depending upon the months, it may mean 90 days or 91 days or 92 days or 89 days. \nRe : Question (iii)\n19. As the award was received by the Executive Engineer on 12.11.2007, for the purpose of calculating the three months period, the said date shall have to be excluded having regard to Section 12(1) of Limitation Act, 1963 and Section 9 of General Clauses Act, 1897. Consequently, the three months should be calculated from 13.11.2007 and would expire on 12.2.2008. Thirty days from 12.2.2008 under the proviso should be calculated from 13.2.2008 and, having regard to the number of days in February, would expire on 13.3.2008. Therefore the petition filed on 11.3.2008 was well in time and was not barred by limitation.\" \n42. In the case on hand, the original award was passed on 30.10.2018, the application under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 was filed on 06.02.2019 and the order under Section 33 of the Act of 1996 was passed by the learned Arbitrator on 08.03.2009. If the limitation for filing application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 before the Commercial Court is taken into consideration from the date of the order passed by the learned Arbitrator under Section 33 of the Act of 1996, the period of three months should be calculated from 09.03.2019 and the same would expire on 08.06.2019. The period of thirty days under the proviso to Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 is required to be calculated from 09.03.2019 and it would expire on 08.07.2019. The application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 was filed before the Commercial Court on 06.07.2019 and therefore the said application is within the period of limitation as provided under Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 and the Commercial Court in its discretion has exercised its power under Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 and has condoned the delay in filing the application which was beyond the period of three months from the date of order passed under Section 33 of the Act of 1996, but was within the thirty days after the expiry of the three months period. This order passed by a Commercial Court having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case cannot be therefore held to be bad in law and accordingly, I answer the question for consideration in the affirmative. Under the circumstances, I do not find any good ground to interfere with the order's passed by the Commercial Court, which are impugned in these writ petitions. Accordingly, the writ petitions are dismissed. \nSd/-\nJUDGE sn",

same as per the prime lending rate of state bank of india for the applicable period to be calculated from november, 2012 till actual payment to the claimant, as well as the part of the impugned arbitral award dated 02.06.2017, whereby against the counter claim of rs.13,40,63,107/-only rs.9,47,706/with lump sum amount of rs. 2,00,000/only awarded to the opposite party (appellant) as well as against the order dated 11.08.2017 passed in the arbitration case no. 01 of 2016 by the learned sole arbitrator rejecting the application under section 33 (4) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 filed on behalf of the opposite party (present appellant) has been dismissed by the learned commercial court, ranchi by the judgment dated 25.06.2018 passed in commercial (revoc) case no. 05 of 2017. 2. the brief facts of the case which are required to be enumerated, reads hereunder as :the government of jharkhand intended to provide convenient and speedy government services to the citizens, using information and technologies communication through common services centers (cscs). the cscs will be utilized as efficient distribution channels through which the government of jharkhand can offer its services, information and schemes etc. to citizens in a cost effective, sustainable and efficient manner. to undertake the delivery of government services on a public private partnership basis, the government of jharkhand intends to appoint service centre agencies (scas) to roll out and manage the cscs in the state of jharkhand and offer revenue support to the scas, as mutually agreed and accepted by the state designated agency (sda) through the sca's financial bid. therefore for the purpose of providing the said services, such as issuance and preparation of aadhar card, voter id, caste certificates, residential certificates etc., the sca was required to be engaged for the setting up such cscs, at least one csc in a panchayat, in the different districts / division of the state. the common services centers are also known as pragya kendra. therefore, a tender for rolling out and operation of around 4500 common service centres in 5 divisions of the state of jharkhand was floated. accordingly, m/s alternative for india development, respondent herein, submitted its technical and commercial bid for 600 cscs in palamau division in response to the tender and the said bid was accepted by the sda. thereafter, the master service agreement (msa) was entered into on 11th april, 2007 for establishing 600 cscs in palamau division. it has been mentioned in the request for proposal (rfp) that in each panchayat of the palamau division at least one csc was to be established, roll out and made operational. there were 600 panchayats in the entire palamau division. as such, at least / minimum 600 nos. of cscs were essentially required to be rolled out and operated by the sca in the palamau division in accordance with rfp, the bid documents and the agreement. clause-2.3 of the msa provided for roll out of cscs, the schedule for completion of rollout with cumulative percentage of minimum number of cscs in each division to be rolled out. as per the said clause of msa, the 100% of the cscs i.e. 600 in numbers, were to be rolled out within 12 months. it has also been mentioned at clause 2.3(a) that the sca shall set up and operationalize the cscs at its own cost and expense within 12 months from the effective date. clause-3.1(f) clearly mentions that the sca would not be eligible for the revenue of goj, support unless the cscs have been rolled out within the specified timeframe and are certified as operational by the sda. clause 3.1 (f) also provides that only upon setting up cscs and making operational 50% of the said cscs, the sca shall be eligible for 50% of the revenue support for the said operational cscs and the balance 50% shall be deferred till the roll out of 100% cscs. as per the master service agreement (msa) executed on 11th april, 2007, alternative for india development, the respondent herein, was to roll out all the 600 cscs within 12 months with effect from 11th april, 2007 but the respondent failed to meet the target. thereafter, vide supplementary agreement dated 03.09.2012 wherein maximum period of completion of roll out of cscs by the sca was extended to 66 months from the effective date which was completed on 10th october, 2012. the respondent failed to complete 100% roll out, i.e. roll out of 600 cscs in palamau division, till the date of termination of agreement. it is the case of the appellant that since m/s. alternative for india development failed to set up and made operational at least 50% of the cscs during the stipulated period, as such, was not eligible for any revenue support since the government of jharkhand has incurred heavy loss due to failure in roll out of required number of cscs in palamau division. the revenue support for operational cscs were calculated and the non-roll out penalty, non-operational penalty were imposed as per the provisions of msa. the jap-it had paid revenue support to the respondent for the period september 2012 to march 2013. it was found that non rollout and non-operational penalty amount for period of april, 2013 to december, 2013 was higher than the payable revenue support amount, thus, no revenue support amount found to be due for payment to the respondent. it is the case of the appellant that non-performance of the contractual obligation by the sca was the reason for the termination of the msa vide order dated 27.06.2016. however, said termination of msa, forfeiture of bank guarantee and blacklisting is not related to revenue support. the revenue support was main issue in the arbitration proceedings. the prayer of the claimant (present respondent) for additional award in relation to the forfeiture of bank guarantee, termination of msa by placing reliance upon the order passed by the hon'ble high court of jharkhand in w.p. (c) no. 3103 of 2016 dated 22.06.2017 was having no relevancy in the matter in context. therefore, the prayer of the claimant for an additional award has been rejected by the sole arbitrator on 11.08.2017. it is the case of the appellant that l.p.a. no. 405 of 2017 filed on behalf of jap-it before this court against the order dated 22.06.2017 passed in w.p. (c) no. 3103 of 2016 has been disposed of on 19.03.2018. the claimant (present respondent) moved the hon'ble high court in arbitration application no. 01 of 2016 in which final order dated 15.07.2016 was passed and the sole arbitrator was appointed. thereafter the claimant filed statement of claim along with documents before the arbitrator. the appellants, being the opposite parties, filed their statement of defense dated 07.10.2016 alongwith all relevant documents also giving point wise reply of the claim petition. it is the further case of the appellants that since considerable amount was to be realized from m/s alternative for india development on account of non-roll out, non-operational penalty and also towards liquidated damages for not confirming and not performing in terms of the msa, therefore, a counter claim also made by jap-it dated 07.10.2016 before the learned sole arbitrator claiming an amount of rs. 13,40,63,107/including liquidated damages of rs. 1,16,16,000/-. after hearing the parties, an arbitral award has been passed on 02.06.2017 in arbitration case no. 01 of 2016 by the sole arbitrator holding the respondents (the appellant herein) entitled for an amount of rs.9,47,706/towards the claim made under the head of the 70% share of the amount received by the claimant from the citizens by offering the government services plus a lump sum amount of rs. 2,00,000/for the delay caused in disbursement of the said amount of the share of the state government. further, the respondent has been awarded with right to impose non-roll out penalty for the total 6 number of cscs for the period from 26th november, 2012, the date when claimant had rolled out 594 cscs to 26th june, 2016, the date of termination of the msa, which comes to rs.7,84,800/-. further, direction has been given that after the deduction of the amounts awarded to the respondents as well as after deduction of the amount already paid to the claimant by way of revenue support, i.e. rs. 60, 66,912 for the period from october, 2012 till march, 2013, the claimant is awarded with revenue support for the total number of 594 cscs @ of rs. 3284/per csc per month calculated from 26th november, 2012 to 25th june, 2016, i.e., rs.7,58,80,510/plus interest upon the same within a period of two months. thereafter, an application was filed under section 33 (1) (a) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 on behalf of the claimant, in which the learned arbitrator passed a supplementary award dated 07.07.2017 by adding an amount of rs. 32,80,541/observing that the awarded amount be read as rs.7,91,61,051/and the amount awarded has been modified to the said extent. the claimant filed another application under section 33(4) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 to pass additional award for refund of rs.47,28,960/towards the bank guarantee submitted by the claimant which was forfeited which has been held to be not maintainable and accordingly dismissed. being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the said part of the arbitral award dated 02.06.2017 passed by the learned arbitrator an arbitration case no. 01 of 2016, whereby the claimant awarded with revenue support for total number of 594 common service centres as well as supplementary award dated 07.07.2017 as also against the rejection of the part of the counter claim and against the order dated 11.08.2017 passed in the said arbitration case no. 01 of 2016 by the learned sole arbitrator, the appellant filed an application under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 being the commercial (revoc) case no. 05 of 2017 before the learned commercial court, ranchi. the learned commercial court heard the application learned commercial court, ranchi has passed the judgment on 25.06.2018 dismissing the said petition. being aggrieved with the judgment dated 25.06.2018 passed in commercial (revoc) case no. 05 of 2017 by the learned commercial court, ranchi, the instant commercial appeal has been preferred. 3. mr. sachin kumar, learned additional advocate general appearing for the appellant state, has submitted that the work in question, i.e., 600 common service centres was ought to be completed and had to be made operative and to that effect a certificate was required to be given by the authority concerned and it is only thereafter the revenue support was to be given to the claimant, as would appear from the condition stipulated under condition no.3.1(f) of the master service agreement. but, herein, the centre has not been completed in entirety, rather only 594 centres have been installed and it has not been made operative since no revenue has been transmitted to the state exchequer and, therefore, there was no certificate of making the centres operational as was required to be given in view of the condition stipulated for the purpose of providing revenue support. but the learned arbitrator, without taking into consideration the aforesaid aspect of the matter, has passed the award in favour of the respondent concerned and hence the very issue of the condition as contained under condition no.3.1(f) has been given go-bye and, therefore, it is against the public policy and the award suffers from perversity. the further contention has been raised that the learned arbitrator has further erred in passing the award in the counter claim by holding the appellant state entitled to meager amount of rs.9,47,706/according to the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned arbitrator ought to have decided the counter claim by passing an award commanding upon the claimant to compensate the state exchequer by making payment of the amount which ought to have been collected through the people at large way of extending the benefit from the centres. but, instead of doing so, the award has been passed in favour of the claimant directing the state appellant to make payment of rs.7,91,61,051/and hence, the very aspect of the matter of putting state exchequer at loss has not been appreciated. the contention has been made that on these grounds the award has been challenged before the forum available under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, but the learned court has also not appreciated the aforesaid fact and merely on the basis of the reason that the forum available under section 34 is having very little scope to exercise the power of judicial review so far as the finding recorded by the arbitral tribunal is concerned. but the issue which is being raised as a ground, as referred hereinabove, ought to have been considered by the forum exercising the power conferred under section 34 of the act, 1996. learned counsel for the appellant, in support of his argument, has relied upon the judgment rendered by hon'ble apex court in the case of ssangyong engineering and construction company limited v. national highways authority of india (nhai) reported in (2019) 15 scc 131. learned counsel for the appellant, in the backdrop of the aforesaid premise, coupled with the reliance put upon the judgment rendered by the hon'ble apex court in the case of ssangyong engineering and construction company limited v. national highways authority of india (nhai) (supra) has contended that the order impugned dated judgment dated 25.06.2018 passed in commercial (revoc) case no. 05 of 2017 suffers from patent illegality and, hence, not sustainable in the eyes of law. 4. per contra, mr. harendra kr. mahato, learned counsel appearing for the claimant, the respondent herein, has submitted that the learned arbitrator has considered each and every aspect of the matter, if the award will be looked into, more particularly paragraph 12 and 27 thereof. according to the learned counsel for the claimant, the respondent herein, the learned arbitrator has considered the condition stipulated at condition no. 2.1(a) i.e. (i) for completion of 600 centres; and condition no.3.2(a)(i) that a certificate is to be given of making the centres operational. the learned arbitrator has considered the aforesaid condition and considering the fact that 594 centres have already been installed out of 600 which is near about 99% and hence only because 1% of the centre has not been installed the benefit of revenue support cannot be denied to be given to the respondent. the learned arbitrator has further considered the second condition of certificate to be given by the agency making the centres operational but the said certificate was to be given by the s.d.a., the agency concerned and hence, giving the certificate with respect to making the centre operational was the duty of the agency and if such certificate was not given by the agency for which the claimant cannot be made to suffer. learned arbitrator has further considered the stand of the claimant as referred at paragraph 12 of the award wherein it has been admitted by the state that in order to make out the operational process more easier and transparent omt/e-nagrick/e-taal systems have been adopted. the state has taken the plea that aforesaid software system since has been found to be faulty and hence the certificate could not be given. learned counsel for the claimant, therefore, has taken the ground that if the learned tribunal has considered the very condition as contained in condition no. 2.1(a) i.e. (i) for completion of 600 centres; and condition no.3.2(a)(i) that a certificate is to be given of making the centres operational. however, learned tribunal has passed the award by taking into consideration the fact that 99% of the centres has been installed and the certificate of making the centre operational since has not been given due to the faulty software system, as per the admission made by the agency, as would appear from the discussion made in paragraph 12 of the award and in that view of the matter if the award has been passed in favour of the claimant, the same cannot be said to suffer from an error. in that view of the matter, it cannot be said that the award is against the public policy. the further contention has been made that the scope of judicial review either under section 34 or the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 or under section 13(1a) of the commercial courts act is very limited and the same can only be exercised if the award is found to be contrary to the public policy and the award suffers from perversity. but, none of the condition is available herein and by taking into consideration the aforesaid fact the learned court while exercising the power under section 34 of the act, 1996 if has declined to interfere with the arbitral award, the same cannot be said to suffer from an error. learned counsel appearing for the respondent has relied upon the judgment associate builders v. delhi development authority reported in (2015) 3 scc 49, oil & natural gas corporation ltd. v. saw pipes ltd. reported in (2003) 5 scc 705 and navodaya mass entertainment limited v. j.m. combines reported in (2015) 5 scc 698. 5. we have heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the documents available on record as also the finding recorded by the learned arbitrator and the learned court while exercising the power under section 34 of the act, 1996. 6. this court, before appreciating the argument advanced on behalf of the parties, deems it fit and proper to refer the position of law regarding the power of judicial review in the arbitral award. in the case of associate builders v. delhi development authority reported in (2015) 3 scc 49, the hon'ble apex court while dealing with the scope of judicial review in the matter of an arbitral award has taken into consideration the judgment passed in mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181 and has held at para 22 which is required to be referred herein which reads hereunder as :22. in mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd. [(2006) 11 scc 181] , this court held: \"58. in renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co. [1994 supp (1) scc 644] this court laid down that the arbitral award can be set aside if it is contrary to (a) fundamental policy of indian law; (b) the interests of india; or (c) justice or morality. a narrower meaning to the expression 'public policy' was given therein by confining judicial review of the arbitral award only on the aforementioned three grounds. an apparent shift can, however, be noticed from the decision of this court in ongc ltd. v. saw pipes ltd. [(2003) 5 scc 705] (for short 'ongc'). this court therein referred to an earlier decision of this court in central inland water transport corpn. ltd. v. brojo nath ganguly [(1986) 3 scc 156] wherein the applicability of the expression 'public policy' on the touchstone of section 23 of the contract act, 1872 and article 14 of the constitution of india came to be considered. this court therein was dealing with unequal bargaining power of the workmen and the employer and came to the conclusion that any term of the agreement which is patently arbitrary and/or otherwise arrived at because of the unequal bargaining power would not only be ultra vires article 14 of the constitution of india but also hit by section 23 of the contract act, 1872. in ongc [(2003) 5 scc 705] this court, apart from the three grounds stated in renusagar [renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co., 1994 supp (1) scc 644] , added another ground thereto for exercise of the court's jurisdiction in setting aside the award if it is patently arbitrary. 59. such patent illegality, however, must go to the root of the matter. the public policy violation, indisputably, should be so unfair and unreasonable as to shock the conscience of the court. where the arbitrator, however, has gone contrary to or beyond the expressed law of the contract or granted relief in the matter not in dispute would come within the purview of section 34 of the act. however, we would consider the applicability of the aforementioned principles while noticing the merits of the matter. 60. what would constitute public policy is a matter dependent upon the nature of transaction and nature of statute. for the said purpose, the pleadings of the parties and the materials brought on record would be relevant to enable the court to judge what is in public good or public interest, and what would otherwise be injurious to the public good at the relevant point, as contradistinguished from the policy of a particular government. further, the hon'ble apex court in the case of psa sical terminals pvt. ltd. vs board of trustees of v.o. chidambranar port trust tuticorin and others reported in 2021 scc online sc 508, has taken the similar view which has been observed at paragraph 43 of the judgment which is being referred hereunder as:43. it will thus appear to be a more than settled legal position, that in an application under section 34, the court is not expected to act as an appellate court and reappreciate the evidence. the scope of interference would be limited to grounds provided under section 34 of the arbitration act. the interference would be so warranted when the award is in violation of \"public policy of india\", which has been held to mean \"the fundamental policy of indian law\". a judicial intervention on account of interfering on the merits of the award would not be permissible. however, the principles of natural justice as contained in section 18 and 34(2)(a)(iii) of the arbitration act would continue to be the grounds of challenge of an award. the ground for interference on the basis that the award is in conflict with justice or morality is now to be understood as a conflict with the \"most basic notions of morality or justice\". it is only such arbitral awards that shock the conscience of the court, that can be set aside on the said ground. an award would be set aside on the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award and as such, which goes to the roots of the matter. however, an illegality with regard to a mere erroneous application of law would not be a ground for interference. equally, reappreciation of evidence would not be permissible on the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. in a recent judgment passed in reliance infrastructure ltd. vs state of goa reported in 2023 scc online sc 604, the hon'ble apex court has reiterated its view and has observed at paragraph 48 which reads hereunder as :\"48. in mmtc limited (supra), this court took note of various decisions including that in the case of associate builders (supra) and exposited on the limited scope of interference under section 34 and further narrower scope of appeal under section 37 of the act of 1996, particularly when dealing with the concurrent findings (of the arbitrator and then of the court). this court, inter alia, held as under:-\"11. as far as section 34 is concerned, the position is well-settled by now that the court does not sit in appeal over the arbitral award and may interfere on merits on the limited ground provided under section 34(2)(b)(ii) i.e. if the award is against the public policy of india. as per the legal position clarified through decisions of this court prior to the amendments to the 1996 act in 2015, a violation of indian public policy, in turn, includes a violation of the fundamental policy of indian law, a violation of the interest of india, conflict with justice or morality, and the existence of patent illegality in the arbitral award. additionally, the concept of the \"fundamental policy of indian law\" would cover compliance with statutes and judicial precedents, adopting a judicial approach, compliance with the principles of natural justice, and wednesbury [associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corpn., [1948] 1 k.b. 223 (ca)] reasonableness. furthermore, \"patent illegality\" itself has been held to mean contravention of the substantive law of india, contravention of the 1996 act, and contravention of the terms of the contract. 12. it is only if one of these conditions is met that the court may interfere with an arbitral award in terms of section 34(2)(b)(ii), but such interference does not entail a review of the merits of the dispute, and is limited to situations where the findings of the arbitrator are arbitrary, capricious or perverse, or when the conscience of the court is shocked, or when the illegality is not trivial but goes to the root of the matter. an arbitral award may not be interfered with if the view taken by the arbitrator is a possible view based on facts. 13. it is relevant to note that after the 2015 amendment to section 34, the above position stands somewhat modified. pursuant to the insertion of explanation 1 to section 34(2), the scope of contravention of indian public policy has been modified to the extent that it now means fraud or corruption in the making of the award, violation of section 75 or section 81 of the act, contravention of the fundamental policy of indian law, and conflict with the most basic notions of justice or morality. additionally, sub-section (2-a) has been inserted in section 34, which provides that in case of domestic arbitrations, violation of indian public policy also includes patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. the proviso to the same states that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence. 14. as far as interference with an order made under section 34, as per section 37, is concerned, it cannot be disputed that such interference under section 37 cannot travel beyond the restrictions laid down under section 34. in other words, the court cannot undertake an independent assessment of the merits of the award, and must only ascertain that the exercise of power by the court under section 34 has not exceeded the scope of the provision. thus, it is evident that in case an arbitral award has been confirmed by the court under section 34 and by the court in an appeal under section 37, this court must be extremely cautious and slow to disturb such concurrent findings.\" it is evident from the judicial pronouncements referred hereinabove, that the appellate court while exercising the power regarding the illegality and propriety of the arbitral award is not supposed to reappraise the evidence as also interference to the arbitral award does not intend a review of the merits of the dispute, rather, it is limited to the situations whether the findings of the arbitrator are arbitrary or capricious or perverse or when the conscience of the court shocks or when the illegality is not trivial but goes to the root of the matter. further, an arbitral award may not be interfered with if the view taken by the arbitrator is a possible view based on facts. 7. so far as the fact of the given case is concerned, the government of jharkhand, for convenient and speedy government services to the citizens, through common services centers (cscs) such as issuance and preparation of aadhar card, voter id, caste certificates, residential certificates etc., decided that at least one csc in a panchayat, in the different districts / division of the state should be established and, therefore, a tender for rolling out and operation of around 4500 common service centres in 5 divisions of the state of jharkhand was floated. accordingly, m/s alternative for india development, respondent herein, submitted its technical and commercial bid for 600 cscs in palamau division in response to the tender and the said bid was accepted by the sda. thereafter, agreement was entered into on 11th april, 2007 for establishing 600 cscs in palamau division. there were 600 panchayats in the entire palamau division. as such, at least / minimum 600 nos. of cscs were essentially required to be rolled out and operated by the sca in the palamau division. clause-3.1(f) of the contract stipulates that the sca would not be eligible for the revenue support of government of jharkhand, unless the cscs have been rolled out within the specified timeframe and are certified as operational by the sda. clause 3.1 (f) also provides that only upon setting up cscs and making operational 50% of the said cscs, the sca shall be eligible for 50% of the revenue support for the said operational cscs and the balance 50% shall be deferred till the roll out of 100% cscs. as per the agreement, alternative for india development, the respondent herein, was to roll out all the 600 cscs within 12 months with effect from 11th april, 2007 but the respondent failed to meet the target. thereafter, vide supplementary agreement dated 03.09.2012 wherein maximum period of completion of roll out of cscs by the sca was extended to 66 months from the effective date which was completed on 10th october, 2012. the respondent failed to complete 100% roll out, i.e. roll out of 600 cscs in palamau division, till the date of termination of agreement. it is the case of the appellant that since m/s. alternative for india development failed to set up and made operational at least 50% of the cscs during the stipulated period, as such, was not eligible for any revenue support since the government of jharkhand has incurred heavy loss due to failure in roll out of required number of cscs in palamau division. the revenue support for operational cscs was calculated and the non-roll out penalty, non-operational penalty were imposed as per the provisions of the agreement. the jap-it had paid revenue support to the respondent for the period september 2012 to march 2013. it was found that non rollout and non-operational penalty amount for period of april, 2013 to december, 2013 was higher than the payable revenue support amount, thus, no revenue support amount found to be due for payment to the respondent. the revenue support was main issue in the arbitration proceedings wherein prayer was made by the claimant for additional award has been rejected by the sole arbitrator on 11.08.2017. the claimant (respondent herein) moved before this court in arbitration application no. 01 of 2016 in which final order dated 15.07.2016 was passed and the sole arbitrator was appointed. thereafter the claimant filed statement of claim along with documents before the arbitrator. the appellants, being the opposite parties, filed their statement of defense dated 07.10.2016 alongwith all relevant documents. after hearing the parties, the arbitral award has been passed on 02.06.2017 in arbitration case no. 01 of 2016 by the sole arbitrator holding the respondents (the appellant herein) entitled for an amount of rs.9,47,706/towards the claim made under the head of the 70% share of the amount received by the claimant from the citizens by offering the government services plus a lump sum amount of rs. 2,00,000/for the delay caused in disbursement of the said amount of the share of the state government. further, the respondent has been awarded with right to impose non-roll out penalty for the total 6 number of cscs for the period from 26th november, 2012, the date when claimant had rolled out 594 cscs to 26th june, 2016, the date of termination of the msa, which comes to rs.7,84,800/-. further, direction has been given that after the deduction of the amounts awarded to the respondents as well as after deduction of the amount already paid to the claimant by way of revenue support, i.e. rs. 60, 66,912 for the period from october, 2012 till march, 2013, the claimant is awarded with revenue support for the total number of 594 cscs @ of rs. 3284/per csc per month calculated from 26th november, 2012 to 25th june, 2016, i.e., rs.7,58,80,510/plus interest upon the same within a period of two months. thereafter, an application was filed under section 33 (1) (a) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 on behalf of the claimant, in which the learned arbitrator passed a supplementary award dated 07.07.2017 by adding an amount of rs. 32,80,541/observing that the awarded amount be read as rs.7,91,61,051/and the amount awarded has been modified to the said extent. the claimant filed another application under section 33(4) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 to pass additional award for refund of rs.47,28,960/towards the bank guarantee submitted by the claimant which was forfeited which has been held to be not maintainable and accordingly dismissed. being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the said part of the arbitral award dated 02.06.2017 passed by the learned arbitrator an arbitration case no. 01 of 2016, whereby the claimant awarded with revenue support for total number of 594 common service centres as well as supplementary award dated 07.07.2017 as also against the rejection of the part of the counter claim and against the order dated 11.08.2017 passed in the said arbitration case no. 01 of 2016 by the learned sole arbitrator, the appellant filed an application under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 being the commercial (revoc) case no. 05 of 2017 before the learned commercial court, ranchi. the learned commercial court heard the application and passed the judgment on 25.06.2018 dismissing the said petition. being aggrieved with the judgment dated 25.06.2018 passed in commercial (revoc) case no. 05 of 2017 by the learned commercial court, ranchi, the instant commercial appeal has been preferred. it is evident from the record that the agreement has been entered which contains several conditions. one of the conditions is for the purpose of giving revenue support to the claimant. 8. learned counsel appearing for the appellant since is questioning the arbitral award as also the order passed by the learned court in exercise of power conferred under section 34 of the act, 1996 that the award so passed by casting liability upon the state appellant due to the negligence in not giving the revenue support even after completion of the entire centres and the centres have not become operational. therefore, this court, instead of dealing with other conditions, is now confining to deal with the condition which pertains to extending the benefit of revenue support in favour of the claimant which is available at condition no.2.1 of the agreement which is being referred hereunder as :\"2.1 scope of the msa a) the sca mandated to establish around 600 number of cscs in palamu division of the state of jharkhand. the goj will provide a variety of government services through the cscs. these centres are proposed to be set up in the panchayat bhawans or suitable spaces available or at alternate locations preferably near the same. the sca shall be responsible for identifying such locations with the guidance of the sda. b) the goj will extend revenue support to the sca as agreed mutually under this msa. c) the details of the palamu division and the revenue support sought is as follows : sl. name of approx revenue support required no. division no. of from jap-it in indian cscs rupees per csc per proposed month over the 4 year period 1 palamu 600 3284 it is evident that for the purpose of giving revenue support, two conditions have been stipulated in the condition as referred hereinabove. the first is that the centre, 600 in number, is to be set up and the second condition is that the centre is to be made operational and to that effect a certificate is to be given by the s.d.a., the agency concerned, the state functionary herein. the claim of the claimant is that out of 600 centres, 594 centres have been set up, however, it was not within the period as agreed in pursuance to the agreement dated 11th april, 2007 but subsequent thereto, a supplementary agreement has been enreached in between the parties whereby extension of 66 months have been granted under which out of 600 centres, 594 centres have been set up. but no revenue support has been given and a dispute arose which was finally referred to the arbitrator by appointing arbitrator by the high court in exercise of power conferred under section 11(6) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. the claimant has taken the plea that there is no laches on his part and out of 600 centres, 594 centres have been set up and the operation certificate which was to be given by the s.d.a. has not been given and, therefore, the revenue support, which, as per the agreement the claimant was entitled, since has not been given, the claimant has been made to suffer and hence the award is prayed to be passed in his favour. 9. while on the other hand, the state appellant has also filed counter claim on the pretext of the fact that the revenue which was to be generated by virtue of setting up of the agency has not been transmitted to the state exchequer due to the laches committed on the part of the claimant and, hence they are entitled for the damages. 10. the learned tribunal has considered various aspect of the matter. the documents have been adduced. the learned tribunal, in order to adjudicate the issue, has formulated following issues :(i) whether the claimant is entitled to the claim raised by it in the petition of claim and whether the same is payable in law or on facts in terms of the master service agreement and the supplementary agreement? (ii) whether the supplementary agreement dated 03.09.2012 has merged with the main master service agreement dated 11.04.2007 and whether the parties are bound by the terms of the master service agreement as well as the supplementary agreement dated 03.09.2012? (iii) whether the respondents have relinquished or waived the provisions of the master service agreement in relation to the payment of the revenue support amount by the respondent to the claimant? (iv) whether the respondents are barred by principle of estoppels from relying on the provisions of master service agreement relating to the payment of the revenue support amount by the respondent to the claimant? (v) whether the claimant has performed its part of the contract and / or whether it has breached / violated any of the terms of the contract entered into between the parties particularly clause 4.2(b) of the contract as alleged by the respondent? (vi) whether an amount of rs.8,52,07,100/is payable by the respondents to the claimant towards the revenue support as claimed by it? (vii) whether an amount of rs. 2,79,62,132/is payable by the respondents to the claimant as escalation cost as claimed by the claimant? (viii) whether the claimant is entitled to interest @ 15% on delayed payment i.e. rs. 3,97,92,689/till the date of filing of the claim petition as claimed by it? (ix) whether an amount of rs.13,40,63,107/is payable by the claimant to the respondent by way of counter claim on account of revenue collected from the citizens for government services, non-rollout penalty amount, non-operational penalty amount, offsetting amount, liquidated damages as claimed by the respondent in terms of the master service agreement read with supplementary agreement dated 03.09.2012 and whether the amount aforesaid is at all admissible to be paid by the claimant to the respondent and whether the claimant was required to roll out 600 common service centers in accordance with the provisions of master service agreement dated 11.04.2007 read with supplementary agreement dated 03.09.2012? the state appellant is only concerned with issue no.(ix) which pertains to revenue support in the light of non-compliance of the condition stipulated under condition no.2.1(a) of the master service agreement. the learned tribunal has considered the aforesaid condition and by taking note of the fact that out of 600 centres, 594 centres have been installed which is almost 99% of the work in entirety and hence came to the conclusion that if 1% of the centres has not been set up, the claimant cannot be denied the benefit of revenue support. the learned arbitrator has considered the second condition regarding certificate to be given of making the centres operational, that is the ground taken by the state appellant that in absence of certificate of making the centres operational, there cannot be revenue support to be given to be claimant. the learned arbitrator has considered the stand of the state appellant in order to assess that by whom the operational certificate was to be given, whether it was to be given by the state or if the state has not given, whether the claimant can be held responsible for that so as to put him at financial loss by not giving the benefit of revenue support. the learned arbitrator has further considered the stand of the appellant wherein it has been admitted that the operational certificate could not be given due to change in the system, as would appear from the discussion so made at paragraph 12 of the award passed by the learned arbitrator, for ready reference, paragraph 12 is quoted hereunder as :\"12. further, the learned senior counsel for the claimant, arguing upon the penal provisions under the msa emphasized on the point that, as a consequence of the execution of the supplementary agreement, the entire clause 2.3(b) stood deleted and thereby no penal provisions remained enforceable under the msa. therefore, non-operational penalty and or non-roll out penalty cannot be levied as there is no provision in the msa regarding penalty for the same and therefore the schedule to the msa which speaks about penalty is of no avail. further he contended that, the respondent has calculated the non-operational penalty on the basis of reports of enagrik software which in itself was faulty and not provided for in the msa. accordingly the claimant is not liable to pay any amount towards penalty for nonroll out or non operationality of any cscs. therefore, respondent cannot rely on the penalty clause which stood deleted after the execution of the supplementary agreement; therefore the respondent cannot bank upon something which does not exist in the msa. further by citing clause 3.2(a)(i) of the msa, the claimant stated that, it had to submit certificate from jap-it or designated agency certifying that all the cscs have been rolled out and are operational but the respondent never issued a single certificate in respect of the same rather they alternatively introduced online monitoring tool for certifying cscs. he further submitted that, the fact that the omt/enagrick/etaal systems introduced by the respondent at subsequent stages of agreement period were nonfunctioning and not reliable, was also recorded in the internal csc review meeting held on 14.05.2017 in the chamber of the principal secretary, department of it.\" the learned arbitrator, after taking into consideration the admission on the part of the state, that due to the glitch in the software, the operational certificate could not be given, has given specific finding at paragraph 27 of the award wherein it has been held that if it is the admission on the part of the state appellant that the operational certificate could not be given due to introduction of the new software which has been found to be faulty, therefore, for the fault on the part of the state, the claimant cannot be allowed to suffer, for ready reference paragraph 27 of the award is being quoted and referred hereunder as :\"27. further, under clause 2(a) which provides for the scope of the msa states that, the sca is mandated to establish 600 numbers of cscs in the palamu division of state of jharkhand. further the clause 2(c) goes on to provide the details of the palamu division and the revenue support sought for the same. the 3rd row of the table provided in the said clause which deals with the number of cscs reads as \"approx no of csc's proposed\". therefore, after analysing the msa in its entirety, i am of the view that, under various clauses in the said msa the roll-out and operations of the cscs are indicated in percentile calculation and the same is not practically possible without the figures being certain or exact. i am therefore certain that, it is evidently clear from the wordings and interpretation of the terms of the msa in total that, the sca was required to roll-out a total of 600 cscs, since all the calculations made under the msa, may it be for revenue support or for imposition of penalty was provided in percentage manner and the same percentile figure cannot be obtained unless and until the figure out of which it has to be derived is certain or exact.\" the learned arbitrator on the basis of the aforesaid fact, has passed the award holding therein that the appellant itself is at fault in not giving operation certificate who is only to give certificate as per the stipulation made under condition no.3.2(a)(i) and, therefore, for the fault committed by the agency, the claimant cannot be allowed to suffer and, accordingly, passed the award in favour the claimant. 11. the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that the award is contrary to the public policy and suffers from perversity, which according to our considered view, cannot be said to have substance, reason being that if the condition has been enshrined in the agreement, it is incumbent upon the parties to comply it in strict sense. either of the parties, if do not comply with the condition and due to such non-compliance no relief can be sought for by such party who is at fault. herein, the condition stipulated at condition no. 2.1(a) i.e., for completion of 600 centres; and condition no.3.2(a)(i) that a certificate is to be given of making the centres operational. 12. so far as the completion of 600 centres are concerned, out of 600 centres, 594 centres have already been installed, i.e., 99% of the work and hence denial of the revenue support only if 1% centres have not been set up, the same has been held to be not justified by the learned arbitrator as also the learned court while refusing to interfere with the award in exercise of power conferred under section 34 of the act, 1996, which according to our considered view, cannot be said to suffer from an error, it is for the reason that there cannot be any deviation from the agreement and if condition has been stipulated, the same has to be adhered to. the plea is being taken on behalf of the state appellant that the operational certificate is not available and hence the learned arbitrator or the forum under section 34 of the act, 1996 ought to have taken into consideration the aforesaid fact. 13. there is no denial that it ought to have been considered but the fact herein is that the operational certificate if was required to be given by the state and when the state is admitting the fact that due to the technical glitch in the new software introduced for giving operation certificate which establishes that the laches is on the part of the state and the law is well settled that if the laches is on the part of the party, such party cannot be allowed to take advantage of its wrong/illegality as has been held by hon'ble apex court in the case of kusheshwar prasad singh vs. state of bihar and ors., (2007) 11 scc 447, wherein at paragraphs-14, 15 and 16, the hon'ble apex court has observed as under: \"14. in this connection, our attention has been invited by the learned counsel for the appellant to a decision of this court in mrutunjay pani v. narmada bala sasmal [air 1961 sc 1353] wherein it was held by this court that where an obligation is cast on a party and he commits a breach of such obligation, he cannot be permitted to take advantage of such situation. this is based on the latin maxim commodum ex injuria sua nemo habere debet (no party can take undue advantage of his own wrong). 15. . this court (at scc p. 142, para 28) referred to broom's legal maxims (10th edn.), p. 191 wherein it was stated: \"it is a maxim of law, recognised and established, that no man shall take advantage of his own wrong; and this maxim, which is based on elementary principles, is fully recognised in courts of law and of equity, and, indeed, admits of illustration from every branch of legal procedure.\" 16. it is settled principle of law that a man cannot be permitted to take undue and unfair advantage of his own wrong to gain favourable interpretation of law. it is sound principle that he who prevents a thing from being done shall not avail himself of the non-performance he has occasioned. to put it differently, \"a wrongdoer ought not to be permitted to make a profit out of his own wrong\".\" so far as the question of public policy is concerned, there is not dispute that the interference would be warranted if the award is in violation of the public policy of india. the hon'ble apex court in the case of oil & natural gas corporation ltd. v. saw pipes ltd. (supra), has been pleased to observe as under paragraph 31 that the expression public policy of india, as contained in section 34, would now be the fundamental policy of indian law, as explained in para 18 and 27 of associate builders v. delhi development authority reported in (2015) 3 scc 49, i.e., the fundamental policy of indian law would be related to renusagar [renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co. (1994) supp (1) scc 644] understanding of this expression. paragraph 31 of the judgment rendered in public policy of india. the hon'ble apex court in the case of oil & natural gas corporation ltd. v. saw pipes ltd.(supra) is quoted hereunder as :\"31. therefore, in our view, the phrase \"public policy of india\" used in section 34 in context is required to be given a wider meaning. it can be stated that the concept of public policy connotes some matter which concerns public good and the public interest. what is for public good or in public interest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public good or public interest has varied from time to time. however, the award which is, on the face of it, patently in violation of statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public interest. such award/judgment/decision is likely to adversely affect the administration of justice. hence, in our view in addition to narrower meaning given to the term \"public policy\" in renusagar case [1994 supp (1) scc 644] it is required to be held that the award could be set aside if it is patently illegal. the result would be -award could be set aside if it is contrary to: (a) fundamental policy of indian law; or (b) the interest of india; or (c) justice or morality, or (d) in addition, if it is patently illegal. illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality is of trivial nature it cannot be held that award is against the public policy. award could also be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of the court. such award is opposed to public policy and is required to be adjudged void.\" it has further been observed that the public policy of india is now constricted to be first; award is contrary to the fundamental policy of indian law as understood in paragraph 28 of the associate builders v. delhi development authority (supra), which reads hereunder as:28. in a recent judgment, ongc ltd. v. western geco international ltd. [(2014) 9 scc 263 : (2014) 5 scc (civ) 12] , this court added three other distinct and fundamental juristic principles which must be understood as a part and parcel of the fundamental policy of indian law. the court held: (scc pp. 278-80, paras 35 & 38-40) \"35. what then would constitute the 'fundamental policy of indian law' is the question. the decision in ongc [(2003) 5 scc 705 : air 2003 sc 2629] does not elaborate that aspect. even so, the expression must, in our opinion, include all such fundamental principles as providing a basis for administration of justice and enforcement of law in this country. without meaning to exhaustively enumerate the purport of the expression 'fundamental policy of indian law', we may refer to three distinct and fundamental juristic principles that must necessarily be understood as a part and parcel of the fundamental policy of indian law. the first and foremost is the principle that in every determination whether by a court or other authority that affects the rights of a citizen or leads to any civil consequences, the court or authority concerned is bound to adopt what is in legal parlance called a 'judicial approach' in the matter. the duty to adopt a judicial approach arises from the very nature of the power exercised by the court or the authority does not have to be separately or additionally enjoined upon the fora concerned. what must be remembered is that the importance of a judicial approach in judicial and quasi-judicial determination lies in the fact that so long as the court, tribunal or the authority exercising powers that affect the rights or obligations of the parties before them shows fidelity to judicial approach, they cannot act in an arbitrary, capricious or whimsical manner. judicial approach ensures that the authority acts bona fide and deals with the subject in a fair, reasonable and objective manner and that its decision is not actuated by any extraneous consideration. judicial approach in that sense acts as a check against flaws and faults that can render the decision of a court, tribunal or authority vulnerable to challenge. *** 38. equally important and indeed fundamental to the policy of indian law is the principle that a court and so also a quasi-judicial authority must, while determining the rights and obligations of parties before it, do so in accordance with the principles of natural justice. besides the celebrated audi alteram partem rule one of the facets of the principles of natural justice is that the court/authority deciding the matter must apply its mind to the attendant facts and circumstances while taking a view one way or the other. nonapplication of mind is a defect that is fatal to any adjudication. application of mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of the mind and disclosure of mind is best done by recording reasons in support of the decision which the court or authority is taking. the requirement that an adjudicatory authority must apply its mind is, in that view, so deeply embedded in our jurisprudence that it can be described as a fundamental policy of indian law. 39. no less important is the principle now recognised as a salutary juristic fundamental in administrative law that a decision which is perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would have arrived at the same will not be sustained in a court of law. perversity or irrationality of decisions is tested on the touchstone of wednesbury [associated provincial picture houses ltd. v. wednesbury corpn., (1948) 1 kb 223 : (1947) 2 all er 680 (ca)] principle of reasonableness. decisions that fall short of the standards of reasonableness are open to challenge in a court of law often in writ jurisdiction of the superior courts but no less in statutory processes wherever the same are available. 40. it is neither necessary nor proper for us to attempt an exhaustive enumeration of what would constitute the fundamental policy of indian law nor is it possible to place the expression in the straitjacket of a definition. what is important in the context of the case at hand is that if on facts proved before them the arbitrators fail to draw an inference which ought to have been drawn or if they have drawn an inference which is on the face of it, untenable resulting in miscarriage of justice, the adjudication even when made by an arbitral tribunal that enjoys considerable latitude and play at the joints in making awards will be open to challenge and may be cast away or modified depending upon whether the offending part is or is not severable from the rest.\" (emphasis in original) it requires to refer herein the paragraph 33 of the judgment rendered in the case of associate builders v. delhi development authority (supra) for the purpose of consideration of the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant in order to assess as to whether the learned arbitrator or the learned court exercising the power under section 34 of the act, has acted contrary to the public policy of india, for ready reference, paragraph 33 is quoted hereunder as :\"33. it must clearly be understood that when a court is applying the \"public policy\" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court of appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. a possible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. thus an award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be invalid on this score [ very often an arbitrator is a lay person not necessarily trained in law. lord mansfield, a famous english judge, once advised a high military officer in jamaica who needed to act as a judge as follows:\"general, you have a sound head, and a good heart; take courage and you will do very well, in your occupation, in a court of equity. my advice is, to make your decrees as your head and your heart dictate, to hear both sides patiently, to decide with firmness in the best manner you can; but be careful not to assign your reasons, since your determination may be substantially right, although your reasons may be very bad, or essentially wrong\".it is very important to bear this in mind when awards of lay arbitrators are challenged.] . once it is found that the arbitrators approach is not arbitrary or capricious, then he is the last word on facts. in p.r. shah, shares & stock brokers (p) ltd. v. b.h.h. securities (p) ltd. [(2012) 1 scc 594] , this court held: \"21. a court does not sit in appeal over the award of an arbitral tribunal by reassessing or reappreciating the evidence. an award can be challenged only under the grounds mentioned in section 34(2) of the act. the arbitral tribunal has examined the facts and held that both the second respondent and the appellant are liable. the case as put forward by the first respondent has been accepted. even the minority view was that the second respondent was liable as claimed by the first respondent, but the appellant was not liable only on the ground that the arbitrators appointed by the stock exchange under bye-law 248, in a claim against a non-member, had no jurisdiction to decide a claim against another member. the finding of the majority is that the appellant did the transaction in the name of the second respondent and is therefore, liable along with the second respondent. therefore, in the absence of any ground under section 34(2) of the act, it is not possible to re-examine the facts to find out whether a different decision can be arrived at.\" in this regard, paragraph 42.3 and paragraphs 43 to 45 of the aforesaid judgment are also relevant which are quoted hereunder as :\"42.3. (c) equally, the third subhead of patent illegality is really a contravention of section 28(3) of the arbitration act, which reads as under: \"28.rules applicable to substance of dispute.--(1)-(2)*** (3) in all cases, the arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract and shall take into account the usages of the trade applicable to the transaction.\" this last contravention must be understood with a caveat. an arbitral tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract, but if an arbitrator construes a term of the contract in a reasonable manner, it will not mean that the award can be set aside on this ground. construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide unless the arbitrator construes the contract in such a way that it could be said to be something that no fair-minded or reasonable person could do. 43. in mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd. [(2006) 11 scc 181] , this court held as under: \"112. it is trite that the terms of the contract can be express or implied. the conduct of the parties would also be a relevant factor in the matter of construction of a contract. the construction of the contract agreement is within the jurisdiction of the arbitrators having regard to the wide nature, scope and ambit of the arbitration agreement and they cannot be said to have misdirected themselves in passing the award by taking into consideration the conduct of the parties. it is also trite that correspondences exchanged by the parties are required to be taken into consideration for the purpose of construction of a contract. interpretation of a contract is a matter for the arbitrator to determine, even if it gives rise to determination of a question of law. 113. once, thus, it is held that the arbitrator had the jurisdiction, no further question shall be raised and the court will not exercise its jurisdiction unless it is found that there exists any bar on the face of the award.\" 44. in msk projects (i) (jv) ltd. v. state of rajasthan [(2011) 10 scc 573] , the court held: \"17. if the arbitrator commits an error in the construction of the contract, that is an error within his jurisdiction. but if he wanders outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits a jurisdictional error. extrinsic evidence is admissible in such cases because the dispute is not something which arises under or in relation to the contract or dependent on the construction of the contract or to be determined within the award. the ambiguity of the award can, in such cases, be resolved by admitting extrinsic evidence. the rationale of this rule is that the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined outside and independent of what appears in the award. such a jurisdictional error needs to be proved by evidence extrinsic to the award. 45. in rashtriya ispat nigam ltd. v. dewan chand ram saran [(2012) 5 scc 306], the court held: \"43. in any case, assuming that clause 9.3 was capable of two interpretations, the view taken by the arbitrator was clearly a possible if not a plausible one. it is not possible to say that the arbitrator had travelled outside his jurisdiction, or that the view taken by him was against the terms of contract. that being the position, the high court had no reason to interfere with the award and substitute its view in place of the interpretation accepted by the arbitrator. 44. the legal position in this behalf has been summarised in para 18 of the judgment of this court in sail v. gupta brother steel tubes ltd. [(2009) 10 scc 63] and which has been referred to above. similar view has been taken later in sumitomo heavy industries ltd. v. ongc ltd. [(2010) 11 scc 296] to which one of us (gokhale, j.) was a party. the observations in para 43 thereof are instructive in this behalf. 45. this para 43 reads as follows: (sumitomo case [(2010) 11 scc 296] '43. . the umpire has considered the fact situation and placed a construction on the clauses of the agreement which according to him was the correct one. one may at the highest say that one would have preferred another construction of clause 17.3 but that cannot make the award in any way perverse. nor can one substitute one's own view in such a situation, in place of the one taken by the umpire, which would amount to sitting in appeal. as held by this court in kwality mfg. corpn. v. central warehousing corpn. [(2009) 5 scc 142] the court while considering challenge to arbitral award does not sit in appeal over the findings and decision of the arbitrator, which is what the high court has practically done in this matter. the umpire is legitimately entitled to take the view which he holds to be the correct one after considering the material before him and after interpreting the provisions of the agreement. if he does so, the decision of the umpire has to be accepted as final and binding.'\" 14. it is evident from the aforesaid judgment that the construction of the terms of the contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes the contract in such a manner that no fair-minded or reasonable person would, in short, that the arbitrator's view is not even a possible view to take. if the arbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits an error of jurisdiction. this ground of challenge will now fall within the new ground under section 34(2-a). further, re-appreciation of evidence which is what an appellate court is permitted to do, cannot be permitted under the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of award. the paragraph 42.1 of the judgment rendered in the case of associate builders v. delhi development authority (supra) laid down that mere contravention of the substantive law in india itself is no longer a ground available to set aside an arbitral award. paragraph 42.2 of the aforesaid judgment, however, would remain for an arbitrator gives no reason for an award and contravenes section 31(3) of the 1996 act that would certainly amount to patent illegality on the face of the award. the hon'ble apex court has further observed therein that a decision which is perverse, as understood in paragraph 31 and 32 of the associate builders v. delhi development authority (supra), will no longer being a ground for challenge a public policy of india would certainly amount to patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. thus, a finding based on no evidence at all or an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. additionally, the finding based on documents taken behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator, would also qualify as a decision based on no evidence in as much as such decision is not based on evidence laid by the parties, therefore, would also have to be categorized as perverse. 15. it is, thus, evident that the settled legal position is that in an application under section 34 of the act, 1996, the court is not expected to act as an appellate court and re-appreciate the evidence. the scope of interference would be limited to the ground provided under section 34 of the act, 1996. the interference would be so warranted when the award is in violation of the public policy of india which has been held to be a fundamental policy of indian law. further, the arbitral award can also be interfered with if it shocks the conscience of the court as also the award would be set aside on the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award and if the decision is perverse. 16. this court, having considered the proposition laid down by the hon'ble apex court in the aforesaid judgment and coming back to the award passed by the learned tribunal, has found that the award has not been passed by giving go-bye to the condition stipulated in the agreement, rather, thoughtful consideration has been given by the learned tribunal regarding the condition stipulated under condition no. 2 and having discussed the same at paragraph 27, the award has been passed on 02.06.2017. 17. this court, thus, is of the view after going through the award passed by the learned arbitrator that there is no error on the face of it, it does not suffer from perversity and it is not against the public policy. 18. this court, after considering the order passed by the court exercising the power under section 34 of the act, 1996 has found therefrom that the learned court has considered the fact in entirety as also has considered the scope of judicial review by taking note of the judgment rendered in the case of oil & natural gas corporation ltd. v. saw pipes ltd. (supra) which pertains to interference to be shown in a case of violation of public policy/perversity or if there is any error on the face of the award, but the learned court has not found any error on the face of the award and the award having not been found contrary to the public policy and does not suffer from the perversity, rather, the learned court, by taking note of the consideration so made by the learned arbitrator, has given specific finding that the award suffers from no error. 19. this court, on the basis of the discussion made hereinabove, is of the view that the award passed by the learned tribunal as also the order passed by the learned court in exercise of power under section 34 of the act, 1996, suffer from no error. 20. so far as the ground agitated that the award of counter claim awarding meager amount is concerned, according to the considered view of this court, the learned sole arbitrator has awarded rs.9,47,706/towards the claim made under the head of the 70% share of the amount received by the claimant from the citizens by offering the government services plus a lump sum amount of rs.2,00,000/towards the delay caused in disbursement of the said amount of the share of the state government. the aforesaid finding, therefore, suggests that it is not that there is no order on counter claim, as has been argued, rather, the order has been passed on the counter claim awarding rs.9,47,706/towards the claim made under the head of the 70% share of the amount received by the claimant from the citizens by offering the government services plus a lump sum amount of rs.2,00,000/towards the delay caused in disbursement of the said amount of the share of the state government, therefore, the counter claim has also been considered and award has been passed holding the state entitled for the aforesaid amount of rs.9,47,706/plus rs.2,00,000/-. 21. this court, taking into consideration the fact that the award passed by the learned sole arbitrator since suffers from no error, having not found to be contrary to public policy, therefore, is of the view that the order passed by the learned court under section 34 of the act, 1996 requires no interference in exercise of power of judicial review. 22. accordingly, the instant appeal fails and is dismissed. 23. consequently, pending interlocutory applications also stand dismissed.
