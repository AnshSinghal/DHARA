Present Revision Petition has been filed by the Petitioner under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 assailing the order dated 12.02.2021 passed by the Trial Court in Cs(Comm) No. 319/2019. The Trial Court vide impugned order has granted unconditional leave to defend to the Defendant in the suit. Petitioner herein is the Plaintiff in the suit and the Respondent is the sole Defendant. \n2. At the outset, learned counsel for the Respondent raised objection to the maintainability of the present revision petition on the ground that the order impugned herein is an interlocutory order and a revision petition is barred under Section 8 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the Act). Learned counsel has relied on the judgement of the Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji vs Jayaben D. Kania & Ors. (1981) 4 Scc 8, to contend that an order granting leave to defend, conditional or unconditional, is an interlocutory order. Reliance is placed on the judgement of the Gujarat High Court in State of Gujarat vs Union of India, being R/Special Civil Application No. 737 of 2018, decided on 07.05.2018, to substantiate the argument that there is a bar under Section 8 of the Act against entertaining a civil revision petition against interlocutory orders passed by the Trial Court albeit the Court has held that writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India would be maintainable under the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court against the interlocutory orders of the subordinate Courts. \n3. Responding to the objection of maintainability raised by the Respondent, learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the present petition is maintainable. It is urged that the order impugned in the present petition is an order by which an unconditional leave to defend has been granted to the Defendant and therefore once the rights of the parties have been finally decided, the order cannot be termed as an interlocutory order. It is further argued that various Courts including this High Court have held that a revision petition under Section 115 Cpc is maintainable against an order granting leave to defend to a Defendant in a summary suit under Order Xxxvii Cpc.\n4. Learned counsel relies on the judgement of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Spicejet Ltd. vs. Arun Kumar (2017) Scc OnLine Del 12712, wherein the Court has observed that an order granting leave to defend is to be assailed in a revision petition under Section 115 Cpc. Reliance is also placed on the judgement of the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir in Bal Krishan vs Jugal Kishore being Cr No. 10/2015, decided on 27.03.2019, where a revision petition was filed under Section 115 Cpc before the High Court against the order of the Trial Court granting leave to defend in a suit under Order Xxxvii Rule 3(5) of Cpc. A question was raised by the Respondent therein on the maintainability of the revision petition on the ground that the order granting leave to defend was an interlocutory order, against which no revision lies under Section 115 Cpc. Court held that the petition was maintainable as the order impugned was not an interlocutory order on the ground that had the order been passed in favour of the Petitioner, the result would have been passing of a decree in favour of the Petitioner. Learned counsel for the Petitioner also relies on two judgements of the Coordinate Benches of this Court in Netrapal Singh vs Ravinder Kumar Kalyani 2019 Scc OnLine Del 9622 and Versatile Commotrade Pvt. Ltd. vs Maniram Sh. Munni Ram Through LRs & Ors. 2019 Scc OnLine Del 9003 and contends that in both the cases, Revision Petitions were entertained by the Court against respective orders of the Trial Courts, by which leave to defend was granted to the Defendants, in suits under Order Xxxvii Cpc.\n5. Since the foremost issue before the Court i s the maintainability of the present petition, the facts necessary to that extent are that the Petitioner filed a suit under Order XXXVII CPC seeking recovery of a liquidated sum of Rs. 1,11,86,611/-, which included the principal amount of Rs. 82,86,379/- and interest amounting to Rs. 29,00,232.65p/- calculated @ 14% per annum. \n6. It is averred in the plaint that the Plaintiff is a Company incorporated under the Companies Act and engaged in the business of Healthcare and supporting technologies and is an exclusive distributor of Haemonetics in India for supply of medical items. Defendant is a proprietor of a firm M/s. Mega Care International and engaged in the business of supplying medical equipments, disposables and related services. In 2009, Defendant approached the Plaintiff for supply of Haemonetics and an MOU was signed between the parties in 2009-2010, whereby Defendant was granted distributorship for 27 months, subject to extension on mutually agreed terms. The MOU expired in 2012, but parties carried on the business on a mutual understanding, till disputes arose in 2016, when the Defendant started making defaults in payments despite receiving the goods. Various e- mails were exchanged between the parties, wherein the Defendant acknowledged that money was due and payable and also assured that payments would be made, yet payments were not paid, despite drawing up a schedule of payment. Subsequently, Defendant acknowledged that a sum of Rs. 1.06 Crores was payable but requested for settling at Rs. 50 Lacs only, to which Plaintiff agreed, however, Defendant did not honour his commitment. Left with no option, Plaintiff filed a suit for recovery, from which the present petition arises. \n7. Summons in the suit was served upon the Defendant, who entered appearance within limitation and Plaintiff thereafter applied for summons for judgement. On being served, Defendant made an application for unconditional leave to defend, raising various issues therein. Reply to the application was filed by the Plaintiff and rejoinder was filed by the Defendant. \n8. The Trial Court, after hearing arguments, was of the view that the Defendant had successfully raised triable issues and concluded that the suit for recovery was for balance amount due from the Defendant and not purely on the value of the invoices relied upon in the suit and thus granted unconditional leave to defend. It is this order which is assailed by the Petitioner before this Court. \n9. I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and examined their rival submissions. \n10. The issue that arises for consideration before this Court is the maintainability of the present Revision Petition filed under Section 115 CPC in view of the provisions of Section 8 of the Act. In order to determine this issue, it is first necessary to examine the provisions of the said Section, which is extracted hereunder for ready reference:\n\"8. Bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order.--Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the Commercial Court.\" \n11. I may note before proceeding further that the suit was filed in 2019 under the Act and there is no dispute between the parties on this aspect. The Act was enacted pursuant to the 253rd Recommendations of the Law Commission. Relevant would it be to note some of the key recommendations which would indicate the intent of the Legislature behind the enactment, which was expeditious and fair disposal of the cases at a reasonable cost to the litigant as well as reduction in the backlog of pending cases in the Courts. Relevant passages from the Report are as follows:\n\"4.1 While the need for commercial courts is obvious in India, the institution of such courts should be seen as a stepping-stone to reforming the civil justice system in India. At the same time, the reforms should be tailored to keep in mind the existing institutions and should focus on improving them within the existing legal framework. \n4.2 The Commercial Courts, the Commercial Divisions and the Commercial Appellate Divisions of High Courts that have been recommended are intended to serve as a pilot project in the larger goal of reforming the civil justice system in India. The goal is to ensure that cases are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant. Not only does this benefit the litigant, other potential litigants (especially those engaged in trade and commerce) are also advantaged by the reduction in backlog caused by the quick resolution of commercial disputes. In turn, this will further economic growth, increase foreign investment, and make India an attractive place to do business. Further, it also benefits the economy as a whole given that a robust dispute resolution mechanism is a sine qua non for the all- round development of an economy.\"\n12. I may also allude to the recommendations which led to enactment of Section 8 in the Act, with which this case concerns and are as follows :\n\"4.3 In view of the above, a summary of the key recommendations of the Law Commission are reiterated below: \nxxx xxx xxx (f) The constitution of a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court should take place simultaneously with the constitution of a Commercial Appellate Division. The Commercial Appellate Division will hear the appeals against the orders and decrees passed by the Commercial Divisions or Commercial Courts. The Commercial Appellate Division to not entertain any civil revision applications or petitions against any interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction (which can be agitated only in an appeal against a decree). Appeals would lie only against the orders enumerated in Order XLIII of the CPC and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and against no other orders. \nxxx xxx xxx ( k) The Bill shall have a streamlined procedure to be adopted for the conduct of cases in the Commercial Division and in the Commercial Court by amending the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. The amended CPC as applicable to the Commercial Divisions and Commercial Courts will prevail over the existing High Court rules and other provisions of the CPC to the contrary. Some of the important changes proposed to the CPC are listed below:\nxxx xxx xxx (xviii) No civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of the Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction.\" \n13. From a reading of the relevant part of the Report of the Law Commission and the provisions of Section 8 of the Act, two things clearly emerge, being relevant to the present case, firstly, that the said Legislation is a step towards providing an expeditious and fast track mechanism for disposal of suits, pertaining to commercial disputes and secondly, there is a bar to a civil revision application/petition against an interlocutory order of a Commercial Court. Second part of Section 8 which provides that any such challenge shall be raised only in an Appeal against the decree of the Commercial Court, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 13 of the Act, fortifies the background and the goal of the enactment. Underlying spirit and intent of the provision of Section 8 is to ensure that the time frame stipulated for case management to achieve the goal of speedy disposal does not become redundant by frequent filing of Revision Petitions/Applications against interlocutory orders. Thus, there can hardly be a debate that interlocutory orders passed by Commercial Courts cannot be assailed in Revision Petitions under Section 115 CPC.\n14. To this extent, I may rely on the observations of the Gujarat High Court in State of Gujarat (supra) which are to the following effect:\n\"13. In view of the above and for reasons stated above and considering the decisions of Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to hereinabove, our conclusions in nutshell are as under:-\n(1) The bar contained under Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act against entertainability of \"civil revision application or petition\" against the interlocutory orders passed by the subordinate/Commercial Courts, shall not be applicable to the writ petitions under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.\" \n15. The question that now arises is whether the order granting unconditional leave to defend in a summary suit can be termed as an interlocutory order so as to bar the jurisdiction of this Court in entertaining the present petition by virtue of the provisions of Section 8 of the Act. \n16. The expression interlocutory order was considered by the Supreme Court in the landmark judgement in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra). I may note here that in the said case the challenge before the Supreme Court was to an order of the Bombay High Court by which the Appeal filed against an order of the Trial Court was dismissed as not maintainable on the ground that the impugned order was not a judgement within the meaning of Clause 15 of Letters Patent of the High Court. The substantial question of law before the Supreme Court was the scope, ambit and meaning of the word judgement in the aforesaid Clause. In that context, the Supreme Court held that a judgement can be of three kinds; (a) a final judgement which decides all questions or issues in controversy, leaving nothing else to be decided which would mean that the action brought by the Plaintiff is either dismissed or decreed in part or in full; (b) a preliminary judgement which in turn may take two forms, where the suit is dismissed on preliminary objections without going into merits or where there is an objection to the maintainability such as bar of jurisdiction etc. and the objections are decided against the Defendant and the suit continues and (c) intermediary or interlocutory judgements which contain the quality of finality and are specified under Order XLIII Rule 1 CPC or not covered by the said provision but have trappings of finality. Supreme Court held that judgement falling under category (a) and the first form in category (b) as well as those having characters and trappings of finality though being interlocutory orders would be appealable before the larger Bench. Relevant para of the judgement is as follows:\n\"118. In other words, a judgment can be of three kinds:\n(1) A Final Judgment-a judgment which decides all the questions or issues in controversy so far as the Trial Judge is concerned and leaves nothing else to be decided. This would mean that by virtue of the judgment, the suit or action brought by the plaintiff is dismissed or decreed in part or in full. Such an order passed by the Trial Judge indisputably and unquestionably is a judgment within the meaning of the Letters Patent and even amounts to a decree so that an appeal would lie from such a judgment to a Division Bench. \n(2) A preliminary judgment- This kind of a judgment may take two forms-(a) where the Trial Judge by an order dismisses the suit without going into the merits of the suit but only on a preliminary objection raised by the defendant or the party opposing on the ground that the suit is not maintainable. Here also, as the suit is finally decided one way or the other, the order passed by the Trial Judge would be a judgment finally deciding the cause so far as the Trial Judge is concerned and therefore appealable to the larger Bench. (b) Another shape which a preliminary judgment may take is that where the Trial Judge passes an order after hearing the preliminary objections raised by the defendant relating to maintainability of the suit, e.g., bar of jurisdiction, res Judicata, a manifest defect in the suit, absence of notice under Section 80 and the like, and these objections are decided by the Trial Judge against the defendant, the suit is not terminated but continues and has to be tried on merits but the order of the Trial Judge rejecting the objections doubtless adversely affects a valuable right of the defendant who, if his objections are valid, is entitled to get the suit dismissed on preliminary grounds. Thus, such an order even though it keeps the suit alive, undoubtedly decides an important aspect of the trial which affects a vital right of the defendant and must, therefore, be construed to be a judgment so as to be appealable to larger Bench. \n(3) Intermediary or Interlocutory judgment-Most of the interlocutory orders which contain the quality of finality are clearly specified in clauses (a) to (w) of Order 43 Rule 1 and have already been held by us to be judgments within the meaning of the Letters Patent and, therefore, appealable. There may also be interlocutory orders which are not covered by Order 43 Rule 1 but which also possess the characteristics and trappings of finality in that, the orders may adversely affect a valuable right of the party or decide an important aspect of the trial in an ancillary proceeding. Before such an order can be a judgment the adverse effect on the party concerned must be direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote. For instance, where the Trial Judge in a suit under Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure refuses the defendant leave to defend the suit, the order directly affects the defendant because he loses a valuable right to defend the suit and his remedy is confined only to contest the plaintiff's case on his own evidence without being given a chance to rebut that evidence. As such an order vitally affects a valuable right of the defendant it will undoubtedly be treated as a judgment within the meaning of the Letters Patent so as to be appealable to a larger Bench. Take the converse case in a similar suit where the trial Judge allows the defendant to defend the suit in which case although the plaintiff is adversely affected but the damage or prejudice caused to him is not direct or immediate but of a minimal nature and rather too remote because the plaintiff still possesses his full right to show that the defence is false and succeed in the suit. Thus, such an Order passed by the Trial Judge would not amount to a judgment within the meaning of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent but will be purely an interlocutory order.\" \n17. Insofar as the present case is concerned, para 3 above of the judgement is extremely relevant. Supreme Court has held that even interlocutory orders can be appealable if they possess characteristics and trappings of finality and the test is to determine the adverse effect on the party concerned and to see if the effect is direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote. While so holding the Apex Court categorically referred to orders passed under Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure refusing or granting leave to defend, as an illustration. The observations are significant for the present controversy inasmuch as it was held that where the Trial Court refuses to grant leave to defend to the Defendant, it directly affects the Defendant because he loses a valuable right to defend the suit and the remedy is confined only to contest the Plaintiffs case on his own evidence without a chance to rebut that evidence. As the order vitally affects a valuable right, it is a judgement appealable before a larger Bench. However, in a converse case in a similar suit, where the Court allows the Defendant to defend the suit, although the Plaintiff is adversely affected but the damage or prejudice caused to him is of a minimal nature and too remote because the Plaintiff still possesses full right to show that the defence is false and succeed in the suit. Having so observed, the Supreme Court categorically held that such an order would not amount to a judgement within the meaning of Clause 15 of Letters Patent and is purely an interlocutory order. Neither of the parties have referred to or relied upon any judgement of the Supreme Court subsequent to the judgement in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra) wherein a different interpretation has been given to the expression interlocutory order/judgement. \n18. In fact, the salutary principles laid down in the said judgement have been followed by several High Courts, very recently, including the High Court of Uttarakhand in Kanupriya vs Ashutosh Agrawal being Appeal from Order No. 99 of 2017, decided on 05.07.2017, where the interpretation of the said expression came up for consideration in the context of Section 19 of the Family Courts Act. \n19. The High Court relied on the observations in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra), more particularly para 118, and the relevant para of the judgement of the Uttarakhand High Court is as follows:\n\"6 . We may also notice the judgment of the Bench of this Court in Rahul Samrat Tandon vs. Smt. Neeru Tandon, reported in 2010 (2) UD 4. Therein, the appeal was filed under Section 19 of the Act against an order passed on an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court referred to the decisions in the cases of Sunil Hansraj Gupta vs. Payal Sunil Gupta, reported in AIR 1991 Bombay 423; Radheshyam Gupta vs. Smt. Laxmi Bai, reported in AIR 1977 Madhya Pradesh 271; and Gurbaksh Singh vs. Smt. Taran Jit, reported in AIR 1977 Himachal Pradesh 66. The court took the following view:\n\"11. A bare perusal of Section 19(1) of 1984 Act shows that an appeal is only maintainable in two cases. Firstly, it is maintainable against a judgment. Secondly, it is also maintainable against an order, if that order is not an interlocutory order. Now even assuming for the sake of argument that the order presently impugned is an order of an interlocutory nature, then what has to be seen is as to whether the order stands in the category of a \"judgment\", as stated under Section 19 of the 1984 Act. The word \"judgment\" has not been defined in the Family Court Act. It is defined under Section 2 (9) of the Code of Civil Procedure as follows:\n\"2. Definitions.-\n(9) \"judgment\" means the statement given by the Judge of the grounds of a decree or order;\" \nThis definition, referred above, is of no use to us as it does not define either the wide or narrow parameters within which the word \"judgment\" has to be construed nor does it state as to what are the characteristics of a 'judgment'. However, there are a catena of decisions defining the parameters of what would constitute a \"judgment\". Leading case on this issue is that of Shah Babulal Khimji Vs. Jayaben D. Kania and another AIR 1981 SC 1786. The Supreme Court in this seminal judgment had laid down the parameters within which the Court must examine as to when an order or even an interlocutory order has the trappings of a judgment. Though the issue was as to what would constitute a \"judgment\" which would be appealable in a letter patent appeal, all the same, the broad principles laid down in the above case would equally apply to the present case as well. As per the ratio laid down by the Apex Court in the above judgment, an order or an interlocutory order would be called a judgment, if it has the quality of \"finality\" to it. The Apex Court laid down that there can be three kinds of judgments. Relevant portion of the said judgment to that effect is as follows:\n\" xxx xxx xxx 3) Intermediary or interlocutory judgment:\nMost of the interlocutory orders which contain the quality of finality are clearly specified in clauses (a) to (w) of Order 43, Rule 1 and have already been held by us to be judgments within the meaning of the Letters Patent and, therefore, appealable. \nThere may also be interlocutory orders which are not covered by Order 43, Rule 1 but which also possess the characteristics and trappings of finality in that, the orders may adversely affect a valuable right of the party or decide an important aspect of the trial in an ancillary proceeding. Before such an order can be a judgment the adverse affect on the party concerned must be direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote...\" \nThe court referred to the judgment of the Apex Court in Shah Babulal Khimji vs. Jayaben D. Kania and another, reported in AIR 1981 SC 1786. Therein, the Apex Court had categorized the decisions as final judgments, preliminary judgments and intermediary or interlocutory judgments. Under the category of \"intermediary or interlocutory judgment\", the Apex Court observed as already referred to above. The court also referred to the judgment of the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Smt. Kiran Bala Srivastava vs. Jai Prakash Srivastava, reported in 2005 (23) LCD 1. The court further appreciated the importance of an order passed under Section 24 in the light of the aforesaid judgment noting that the provision is important from the point of view of the wife, as her survival during the pendency of the proceedings under the Act and right to prosecute or defend the proceedings depends on the outcome of the proceedings under Section 24. Agreeing with the Allahabad High Court judgment, the court held that the appeal is maintainable as the impugned order therein was in the nature of a judgment and is appealable under Section 19 of the Act.\"\n20. I may usefully refer to another passage from the same judgment as follows :- \n\"9. In the judgment of the High Court of Kerala in the case of Thankappan Nair vs. Prasannakumari & others in M.F.A. No. 1760/1994-B, decided on 30.06.1995, a Bench considered the question whether an order attaching the salary for failure to pay maintenance as ordered by the court was interlocutory. The court concluded that the order was interlocutory. The court, inter alia, held as follows and dismissed the appeal finally: \n\"6. In Webster's \"New World Dictionary\" the word \"interlocutory order\" has been defined as an order other than final decision. This expression \"interlocutory order\"\nhas appeared differently in different statutes and received different construction by the courts depending upon the contexts and setting in which the expression has been used. Under Section 397(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, revisional jurisdiction is excluded in relation to an interlocutory order. However, the expression \"interlocutory order\" appearing in the said section has received wider meaning in a number of decisions (vide Amar Nath v. State of Hariyana 1977 (4) SCC 137, Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra (1977) 4 SCC 551 and Hariyana Land Reclamation and Development Corporation Ltd. v. State of Hariyana (1990) 3 SCC 588.\n8. With the help of legal principles discussed in the above decisions we can gauge the amplitude of the expression \"interlocutory order\" in Section 19 of the Act. We bear in mind that what is banned under the said Chapter is not only appeals against interlocutory orders but even the revisional jurisdiction is also foreclosed in the sweep. Of course, it is unusual that in a statute wherein appellate jurisdiction is closed then revisional jurisdiction is also closed in respect of the same category of orders. What would have been the legislative intent in providing such a ban. The parties in Family Courts very often include destitute and orphaned wives and or children and perhaps poor widows also. If appeal or revision is provided against interlocutory orders the proceedings in the Family Court could successfully be scuttled by rich and contumacious opposite parties by taking the matter to the High Court against any order passed during interlocutory stages. Legislature would have intended to prevent it. In that perspective it can be construed that the interlocutory order envisaged in Chapter V of the Act is an order other than final orders. Hence the meaning of interlocutory order in Section 19 shall be understood as an order which is not a final order.\"\"\n21. A judgment of the Supreme Court in V.C. Shukla vs State AIR 1980 SC 962 is also relevant in the context of interpretation of the expression interlocutory order and the observations are as under :-\n\"Ordinarily speaking, the expression interlocutory in legal parlance is understood in contra distinction to what is styled as final. In the course of a judicial proceeding before a court, for judicially determining the main dispute brought to the court for its resolution, a number of situations arise, when that court goes on disposing of ancillary disputes raised by parties to the proceeding by making orders and unless the order finally disposes of a proceeding in a court all such orders during the course of a trial would be broadly designated \"interlocutory\"\norders. Such interlocutory orders are steps, taken towards the final adjudication and for assisting the parties in the prosecution of their case in the pending proceedings.\" \n22. From a reading of the aforesaid judgements, the inevitable conclusion is that an order of the Trial Court passed in a summary suit under Order XXXVII CPC, granting leave to defend to Defendant, conditional or unconditional, is an interlocutory order. The Commercial Court Act has no provision which separately defines the said expression. In my view, despite the enactment of the said Act, this Court has to fall back on the interpretation of the expression given by the Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra) which holds the field till date and is a binding dicta.\n23. I may also mention that the expression interlocutory order has been a subject-matter of interpretation given in the context of Special Statutes with an underlined legislative intent. In V.C. Shukla (supra) while dealing with connotation of the word interlocutory order in Section 11 of the Special Courts Act, where a Revision was filed against an order directing framing of charge against the Appellant, Court held as under:\n\"The dominant purpose of the Act is to achieve not only speedy determination but a determination with the utmost dispatch. Therefore, the provisions of the Act must be interpreted so as to eliminate all possible avenues of delay or means of adopting dilatory tactics by plugging every possible loophole in the Act through which the disposal of the case may be delayed. It was for this purpose that a non obstante clause was put in S. 11 of the Act so as to bar appeals against any interlocutory order whether it is of an intermediate nature or is quasi final. As the non obstante clause expressly excludes the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Courts cannot call into aid the provisions of S. 397(2) of the Code which would amount to frustrating the very object which S. 11 seeks to advance. The absence of revision is more than compensated by giving the accused a right of an appeal against any judgment or order of the Special Judge as of right and open on facts and law. The trial is held by a sitting High Court Judge who also would have the power of revision if he was sitting in a High Court. Therefore, it would not be in keeping with the dignity, decorum and status of the Special Judge to provide for an appeal even against such an order which he is supposed to pass with full application of mind and due deliberation. \nIn order to construe the term 'interlocutory', it has to be construed in contradistinction to or in contrast with a final order. In other words, the words 'not a final order' must necessarily mean an interlocutory order or an intermediate order. Thus, the expression 'interlocutory order' is to be understood and taken to mean converse of the term 'final order'. \nAn interlocutory order merely decides some point or matter essential to the progress of the suit or collateral to the issues sought but not a final decision or judgment on the matter in issue. An intermediate order is one which is made between the commencement of an action and the entry of the judgment. An order framing of the charge being an intermediate order falls squarely within the ordinary and natural meaning of the term 'interlocutory order' as used in S. 11(1) of the Act.\" \n24. As recent as in 2019, a Division Bench of High Court of Madras in Magic Frames and Ors. vs Radiance Media P. Ltd. 2019(4)CTC497, while deciding the issue of maintainability of an appeal against an order dismissing an application filed by the Defendants under Order 13-A CPC to pass a summary judgment albeit in the context of appeal under Section 13(2) of the Act had the occasion of considering expression \"interlocutory order\". In that context, the Court relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in LIC Vs. Sanjeev Builders (P) Ltd., 2018 (11) SCC 722, and Shah Babulal Khimji (supra) as under :-\n\"6. The learned counsel for the appellants/defendants further contended that after amendment, the word \"decision\" is replaced by \"judgment or order\". Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act-sub-section (1) was substituted by subsection (1) along with sub-section (1-A) with proviso. The Sub-section (1) after amendment, deals with the appeals from the Subordinate Courts dealing with commercial transactions. The said sub-section (1-A) deals with the appeals from the District Court as well as Commercial Division of the High Court to the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court. The Proviso is common to subsection (1) and sub-section (1-A). While sub-section (1-A) says that any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of a High Court, may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court, proviso to sub-section (1- A) deals with lying of appeal from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order 43 of CPC as amended by the said Act and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Further, the learned counsel for the appellants also submitted that Section 13(2) of the Commercial Courts Act provides that, \"notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\" Thus, the term \"judgment or order\" inserted in sub-section (1-A) by the amendment, was consciously introduced by the Legislature and the term \"judgment or order\" is not touched by the proviso or sub-section (2). Thus, the learned counsel for the appellants drew the attention of this Court to the scheme of Section 13, wherein, after amendment, it clearly says that when an appeal is filed against an interlocutory order, if such order is covered by Order 43 CPC, then the appeal automatically lies. This is the effect of the proviso. The proviso does not go further and it does not prohibit appeals against other orders. The learned counsel for the appellants therefore submitted that whether an order is a judgment or not, will be determined by the appellate Court before admitting the appeal. In this regard, the learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the guidelines for such determination are well settled and recently noticed in the decision of the Supreme Court reported in MANU/SC/1361/2017 : 2018 (11) SCC 722 (LIC Vs. Sanjeev Builders (P) Ltd), in which, while elaborating upon the nature of \"interlocutory order\" or \"judgment\", it was observed by the Apex Court as follows:\n\"9. Elaborating upon nature of \"interlocutory order\" or \"judgment\" and observing that the Letters Patent Appeal would lie from the judgment which would affect the vital and valuable rights of the parties and which work serious injustice to the parties concerned, in Shah Babulal Khimji Vs. Jayaben D. Kania and Another MANU/SC/0036/1981 : (1981) 4 SCC 8, it was held as under (SCC pp. 53 & 57- 58, paras 106 & 114-17:-\n\"106. Thus, the only point which emerges from this decision is that whenever a trial Judge decides a controversy which affects valuable rights of one of the parties, it must be treated to be a judgment within the meaning of the Letters Patent.\n114. In the course of the trial, the trial Judge may pass a number of orders whereby some of the various steps to be taken by the parties in prosecution of the suit may be of a routine nature while other orders may cause some inconvenience to one party or the other, e.g., an order refusing an adjournment, an order refusing to summon an additional witness or documents, an order refusing to condone delay in filing documents, after the first date of hearing an order of costs to one of the parties for its default or an order exercising discretion in respect of a procedural matter against one party or the other. Such orders are purely interlocutory and cannot constitute judgments because it will always be open to the aggrieved party to make a grievance of the order passed against the party concerned in the appeal against the final judgment passed by the trial Judge. \n115. Thus, in other words every interlocutory order cannot be regarded as a judgment but only those orders would be judgments which decide matters of moment or affect vital and valuable rights of the parties and which work serious injustice to the party concerned. Similarly, orders passed by the trial Judge deciding question of admissibility or relevancy of a document also cannot be treated as judgments because the grievance on this score can be corrected by the appellate court in appeal against the final judgment. \n116. We might give another instance of an interlocutory order which amounts to an exercise of discretion and which may yet amount to a judgment within the meaning of the Letters Patent. Suppose the trial Judge allows the plaintiff to amend his plaint or include a cause of action or a relief as a result of which a vested right of limitation accrued to the defendant is taken away and rendered nugatory. It is manifest that in such cases, although the order passed by the trial Judge is purely discretionary and interlocutory, it causes gross injustice to the defendant who is deprived of a valuable right of defence to the suit. Such an order, therefore, though interlocutory in nature contains the attributes and characteristics of finality and must be treated as a judgment within the meaning of the Letters Patent. This is what was held by this Court in Shanti Kumar case (Shanthi Kumar R. Canji Vs. Home Insurance Co. of New York, (1974) 2 SCC 387, as discussed above. \n117. Let us take another instance of a similar order which may not amount to a judgment. Suppose, the trial Judge allows the plaintiff to amend the plaint by adding a particular relief or taking an additional ground which may be inconsistent with the pleas taken by him but is not barred by limitation and does not work serious injustice to the defendant who would have ample opportunity to disprove the amended plea taken by plaintiff at the trial. In such cases, the order of the trial Judge would only be a simple interlocutory order without containing any quality of finality and would therefore not be a judgment within the meaning of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent.\" (emphasis supplied)\" \n10. Applying the above principle to the case in hand, we find that the order allowing the application impleading respondent No. 3 as assignee (Order XXII Rule 10 CPC) after 27 years of filing of the suit vitally affects the valuable rights of the appellant. The order allowing amendment of plaint by impleading respondent No. 3 as \"Plaintiff No. 3\" on the basis of alleged assignment of agreement dated 24.08.1987 decides a vital question which concerns the rights of the parties and hence is a \"judgment\" to maintain the Letters Patent Appeal. In our view, allowing of such application after 27 years of filing suit for specific performance would cause serious prejudice to the appellant-defendant depriving valuable right of defence available to the appellant and hence the order of Single Judge allowing the Chamber Summons is a \"judgment' within the meaning of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent.\" \nxxx xxx xxx 8. The learned counsel for the appellants also relied on a judgment of the Supreme Court reported in MANU/SC/0036/1981 : 1981 (4) SCC 8 (Shah Babulal Khimji Vs. Jayaben D. Kania), wherein the Apex Court held as follows:\n\"106. Thus, the only point which emerges from this decision is that whenever a trial Judge decides a controversy which affects valuable rights of one of the parties, it must be treated to be a judgment within the meaning of the Letters Patent.\" \n\"115. Thus, in other words every interlocutory order cannot be regarded as a judgment but only those orders would be judgments which decide matters of moment or affect vital and valuable right of the parties and which work serious injustice to the party concerned. Similarly, orders passed by the trial Judge deciding question of admissibility or relevancy of a document also cannot be treated as judgments because the grievance on this score can be corrected by the appellate court in appeal against the final judgment.\" \n\"120. Thus, these are some of the principles which might guide a Division Bench in deciding whether an order passed by the trial Judge amounts to a judgment within the meaning of the Letters Patent. We might, however, at the risk of repetition give illustrations of interlocutory orders which may be treated as judgments:\n(1) An order granting leave to amend the plaint by introducing a new cause of action which completely alters the nature of the suit and takes away a vested right of limitation or any other valuable right accrued to the defendant. (2) An order rejecting the plaint. \n(3) An order refusing leave to defend the suit in an action under Order 37, Code of Civil Procedure. \n(4) An order rescinding leave of the trial Judge granted by him under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent. \n(5) An order deciding a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the suit on the ground of limitation, absence of notice under Section 80, bar against competency of the suit against the defendant even though the suit is kept alive. (6) An order rejecting an application for a judgment on admission under Order 12 Rule 6. (7) An order refusing to add necessary parties in a suit under Section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure. \n(8) An order varying or amending a decree . (9) An order refusing leave to sue in forma pauperis. \n(10) An order granting review. \n(11) An order allowing withdrawal of the suit with liberty to file a fresh one.\n(12) An order holding that the defendants are not agriculturists within the meaning of the special law.\n(13) An order staying or refusing to stay a suit under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (14) An order granting or refusing to stay execution of the decree. \n(15). An order deciding payment of court-fees against the plaintiff.\"\n25. Madras High Court finally held as under :-\n\"29. It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the appellants that whenever a trial Judge decides a controversy which affects the valuable rights of one of the parties, it must be treated to be a 'judgment' within the meaning of the \"Letters Patent\". But we see in the instant case that the dismissal of the application by the learned Single Judge has not affected the valuable rights of the parties to contest the suit, which is very much available to the respective parties on the merits of the matter. Therefore, the decision relied on by the learned counsel for the appellants, reported in 1981 (4) SCC 8 (Shah Babulal Khimji Vs. Jayaben D. Kania), is distinguishable and different on the facts and circumstances of the case and it is not applicable to the present case on hand. \n30. Furthermore, we are of the opinion that the nature of the order passed by the Court will not finally determine the rights of the parties and the respondent/plaintiff or the appellants/defendants have an opportunity to prove their respective case by proceeding with the trial. Therefore, it cannot be construed that the nature of the order passed by the learned Single Judge is \"judgment\". On that ground, we are of the opinion that the present appeal is not maintainable. Moreover, the object of the Commercial Courts Act is to provide for speedy disposal of triable valuable commercial dispute. When that being so, the object of the Commercial Courts Act cannot be defeated by filing plethora of appeals to stall the original proceedings. \nHence, we are of the opinion that the present appeal is not maintainable.\"\n26. Learned counsel for the Petitioner has relied on the judgements of the Coordinate Benches of this Court in Spicejet Ltd. (supra), Netrapal Singh(supra) and Versatile Commotrade Pvt. Ltd.(supra) to argue that the Revision Petition is maintainable. In my view, none of the three judgements inure to the advantage of the Petitioner to support the proposition argued. In Spicejet Ltd. (supra), the petition was filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and the original suit was not a commercial suit. In that context the Court had observed that an order of the Trial Court granting leave to defend is assailable in a revision petition. Since the suit was not under the Commercial Courts Act, bar of Section 8 of the Act did not come into play and thus the Court had no reason or occasion to deal with the provisions of the Section. Likewise in the other two judgments, the suits were not under the Commercial Courts Act and thus, provisions of Section 8 of the Act were not an issue for consideration. Since Section 8 of the Act did not come into play, the revision petitions were maintainable and entertained by the Court. In so far as the judgment in Bal Krishan (supra) is concerned, suffice would it be to state that the finding of the Court is against the dicta of the Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra) where, the Supreme Court clearly held that an order granting leave to defend is an interlocutory order and the said judgment clearly binds this Court. \n27. In view of the aforesaid judgements and the legislative intent underlying Section 8 of the Act, I hold that the impugned order herein is an interlocutory order and the present petition is not maintainable, on account of the bar under Section 8 of the Act. \n28. Revision petition is accordingly dismissed, giving liberty to the Petitioner to resort to appropriate remedies available, in accordance with law. It is made clear that this Court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case, including the alternate argument of the Petitioner that even if the Trial Court was inclined to grant leave to defend, it ought to have granted conditional leave. \nJYOTI SINGH, J APRIL 16, 2021 rd",

(b) be pleased to direct the defendant to perform its part of the contract as the plaintiff already performed its part of the contract and accordingly, the defendant must take or cause to take all necessary actions, deeds and signatures in this regard in the interest of justice. (c) be pleased to issue a mandatory injunction directing the defendant to take all necessary steps to remove its charge from the registrar of companies and issue necessary no­due/no claim certificate to the plaintiff and appoint court commissioner, if found necessary for the purpose of removing the charge of the defendant bank from the record of the registrar of companies, ahmedabad in the interest of justice. (d) be pleased to award damages of rs.20,00,00,000/­ along with interest of 12% per annum from the date of passing of the decree till final realization in favour of the plaintiff for breach of the terms of sanction letter dated 13.03.2015 committed by the defendant in the interest of justice. (e) be pleased to pass such other and further orders as deemed fit in the interest of justice. 5. the other averments made in the plaint are as under:­ 5.1 the plaintiff is a company registered under the indian companies act, 1956 having its registered office address at the address mentioned in the cause title herein­above. the respondent is a banking company under the banking regulation act, 1949 having one of its branch offices at the address provided in the cause title of the present suit. 5.2 the plaintiff states that it is engaged in the business of the cotton ginning and pressing and presently employs close to 50 employees. 5.3 the defendant is a nationalized bank and is engaged in the business of banking as per the provisions of the banking regulation act, 1949. 5.4 the plaintiff is constrained to file the present suit against the c/fa/5349/2019 judgment defendant as the defendant inspite of agreeing to discharge the plaintiff as per the sanction letter dated 13/03/2015 invoked the corporate guarantee and is enforcing the same. the brief facts giving rise to cause of action arising to file the present suit is that the bank agreed to discharge the plaintiff from the corporate guarantee on the condition that the plaintiff give in security two additional properties which were agreed to. the plaintiff performed its part of the agreement and once the plaintiff performed its part of the contract, the defendant failed to perform its part of the contract. 5.5 the plaintiff states that a company by the name of m/s abc cotspin pvt. ltd (hereinafter referred to as \"abc cotspin\") was desirous of availing loan from the defendant bank for the business purposes and therefore, approached by the defendant bank for the purpose of availing the credit facilities. that it appears that the following credit facilities were sanctioned by the defendant bank in favour of abc cotspin vide sanction letter dated 19.11.2012 and additional sanction letter dated 14.03.2013: credit facilities amount packing credit cum fbp/fbd under l/c sub 34,00,00,000/­ limit packing credit (15,00,000/­) bp/bd/fbd (under l/c outside mpbf) rs.25,00,00,000/­ notional cel (being

corporate guarantee dated 16.08.2013 of rs.75 crores was executed by the plaintiff in favour of the defendant bank c/fa/5349/2019 judgment in order to guarantee the loan amount sanctioned to m/s abc cotspin. 5.7 that further, it appears that since the aggregate credit facilities were amounting to rs.137 crores, a corporate guarantee dated 07.11.2013 was executed by the plaintiff in favour of the defendant bank. 5.8 it appears that subsequently credit facilities of rs.137 crores were reveiwed and increased to aggregate credit limit of rs.487 crores vide sanction letter dated 25.02.2014 as stated herein under:­ credit facilities amount packing credit cum fbp/fbd under l/c sub 34,00,00,000/­ limit packing credit (15,00,000/­) bp/bd/fbd (under l/c outside mpbf) rs.25,00,00,000/­ notional

states that in order to secure the aforesaid facilities, a corporate guarantee dated 28.02.2014 of rs.350 crores was executed in favour of the defendant bank by the plaintiff. 5.10 the plaintiff states that it wanted to get discharged from the aforesaid liability and therefore, approached the defendant bank to release it from its liability in respect of the amount of m/s. abc cotspin. that therefore, vide sanction letter dated 13.03.2015 which recorded the terms agreed between the parties, it was stated that on mortgage of two fresh properties and release of two mortgage properties described therein, the corporate guarantee of the plaintiff will be released. c/fa/5349/2019 judgment 5.11 that the following mortgages were proposed to be released and the following mortgages were to be done under the sanction letter dated 13.03.2015 as under:­ properties proposed to be released: a. land and building of ginning factory located at gut no.1, survey no.102, village badnapur, jalna­aurangabad highway, maharashtra in the name of plaintiff. b. factory land and building and plant and machinery located survey no.18/2, village lathidad, tal. botad,dist. bhavnagar in the name of abc cotspin. new collateral securities added: a. office situated at 13th floor, regent chambers, nariman point, mumbai in the name of abc cotspin. b. flat situated at c­404, prathna residency, nr. vandematra cross road, gota, ahmedabad in the name of mr. ashish s. jobanputra. 5.12 that upon release of mortgage of the two properties described herein above and the mortgage of new collateral securities as described herein­ above, the corporate guarantee of the plaintiff would stand to be released as quoted herein below: \"2. the corporate guarantee of m/s. prime cotex pvt. ltd. will be released after release of land and building of ginning factory located at gut no.1 survey no.102, village badnapur, jalna aurangabad highway, maharashtra in the name of prime cottex pvt. ltd. and creation of charge by way of equitable mortgage on fresh properties.\" 5.13 that the mortgage of new collateral properties as described herein c/fa/5349/2019 judgment above was executed and done in favour of the defendant on 05/06.05.2015. 5.14 that on 07.05.2015 and 08.05.2015, the mortgages of the two properties including the property of the plaintiff was released and all title documents in respect thereof were returned to the plaintiff. 5.15 that, it is extremely clear that all the relevant terms and conditions precedent to discharge of corporate guarantee as per sanction letter dated 13.03.2015 were performed and therefore, the defendant no.5 m/s. prime cottex pvt. ltd was discharged as per the terms and conditions of the sanction letter dated 13.03.2015. 5.16 however, in breach of the terms of sanction, the defendant bank filed an original application for recovery against the present plaintiff before the debts recovery tribunal. the plaintiff states that it was wrongly made a party to the original application before the debts recovery tribunal­1 at ahmedabad. that the plaintiff has claimed to be discharged before the hon'ble tribunal in its written statement. 5.17 the plaintiff states that in breach of the terms of the sanction letter dated 13.03.2015, the defendant has even failed to remove its charge from the roc which is still reflecting in the record of the registrar of companies. that the plaintiff states that it has suffered huge damages due to such neglect and breach of contract by the defendant. the plaintiff has also suffered huge losses and loss of reputation in as much as the plaintiff has been rendered incapacitated in taking any financial assistance from any other bank or financial institution because non­release of charge in roc records has created a situation where the plaintiff cannot charge the released properties in favour of any other bank or financial institution. such inability has caused huge losses as the plaintiff has lost all business c/fa/5349/2019 judgment opportunities to make substantial profits on account of business which could have been increased. similarly, it has also suffered huge loss of reputation for its inability to stay in the market for want of finance. 5.18 the plaintiff states that the defendant malafidely and in order to harass the plaintiff has implicated in the case filed by it against m/s. abc cotspin. such false implication in the case and looking at the huge liability of abc cotspin, many customers have shied away in dealing with the plaintiff which has resultantly caused further loss of business and as well as loss reputation. 5.19 that further due to non­removal of charge from the roc, no other bank was ready and willing to provide loan to the plaintiff for expansion of operations and therefore, the plaintiff has not been able to expand his business due to the breach of contract by the defendant. on the contrary, the plaintiff has lost a lot of business due to the defaults of the defendant bank and therefore, the defendant is liable to compensate the plaintiff for the loss caused to it. 5.20 the plaintiff has quantified the damages at rs.20 crores on account of loss of business as well as loss of reputation. it may be stated that there is no formula to calculate damages by any exactitude, however, looking at the turnover of the plaintiff and capital invested by it, it can safely be concluded that it has suffered loss of minimum of rs.20 crores. 5.21 that after performing the conditions precedent to the release of corporate guarantee, the defendant was requested several times by the plaintiff to clear its charge from the roc but to no avail. 5.22 the plaintiff states that in view of the above facts and circumstances, and material on record, the plaintiff is entitled to the damages as claimed c/fa/5349/2019 judgment by it and further the defendant bank is required to be directed by permanent injunction to forthwith cause removal of charge from roc records. the plaintiff is also entitled to receive confirmation from defendant as to discharge of its corporate guarantee. 5.23 the plaintiff states that it has an ex­facie case and balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiff and hence, the plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs as prayed for by it. 5.24 the plaintiff states that the cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of this hon'ble court in as much as the sanction letter was issued, signed and received by the plaintiff in ahmedabad, the loan agreement was executed in ahmedabad, the loan amount was disturbed within the district of ahmedabad and the defendant resides and carry out business for gain within the territory of ahmedabad. that the cause of action arose when the sanction letter dated 13.03.2015 was issued by the defendant bank, when as per the terms of the sanction letter, the mortgage of new collateral properties was done on 05/06.05.2015 and thereafter, the two mortgage properties were released on 07/08.05.2015. that therefore, the present suit is filed within the period of limitation of three years. 6. thus, it appears that the appellant herein prayed for a declaration relying upon the sanction letter dated 13th march, 2015. in other words, the appellant is trying to enforce the performance of the contract in terms of the sanction letter dated 13th march, 2015. the above takes us to the sanction letter dated 13th march, 2015. the same reads thus:­ bank of baroda bob/midahm/2015/59 13.03.2015 m/s. abc cotspin private limited c/4, nikumbh complex,

(v) the defendant no.5 is hereby restrained by means of injunction from depleting, transferring, encumbering, alienating or in any way dealing with its properties/ assets without first paying the claim of the applicant bank and the bank is/will be at liberty to file an appropriate application before the ld. recovery officer for attachment of movable and immovable personal properties of the defendant no.5 for recovery of the dues of the bank, even if the same was released. this injunction would not be observed against third party having bonafide transferee rights in their favour. (vi) the defendants are hereby restrained by means of injunction from depleting, transferring, encumbering, alienating or in any way dealing with their properties/assets without first paying the claim of the applicant bank. 8. we would like to reproduce the relevant observations made by the debt recovery tribunal, which are relevant for our purpose. the observations are as under:­ 24. i am of the opinion that the facts and circumstances of the present case are quite different, because in this case, the sanction dtd.13.03.2015 vide which applicant bank agreed to release properties and personal guarantee of defendant no.5 was conditional, whereas in the judgments quoted on behalf of defendant no.5, there was no such condition and further in this case, the bank although agreed to release the personal guarantee of defendant no.5, but till date bank has not released personal guarantee of defendant no.5 and owing to conditions put forth in the sanction itself, bank cannot be compelled to release personal guarantee of defendant no.5, as subsequently it has come out that defendant no.1 acted against the terms of sanction of loan. further restructuring and sanction letter dtd:13.03.2015 has no c/fa/5349/2019 judgment independent existence. in fact that was a rehabilitation of default already committed and cannot be treated as denote contract or fresh arrangement at the back of guarantor. it was only a sanction to the proposal of defendants which was not fully acted upon. no fresh facilities were actually disbursed on sanction dtd.13.03.2015, further being guarantor, defendant no.5 cannot be absolved from the liabilities in respect of loan transactions/ availment made during continuance and subsistence of its corporate guarantee. 9. thus, the aforesaid observations of the debt recovery tribunal would indicate that the bank agreed to release the personal guarantee of the appellant herein, but the same has not been released as the original defendant no.1 [principal borrower] acted against the terms of sanction of loan. 10. it is the case of the appellant herein that he has discharged all his liabilities and therefore, the bank was obliged to discharge him of all the liabilities incurred in the loan transaction. the appellant is seeking to enforce the contract in the form of sanction letter and for that purpose, the appellant instituted the commercial suit no.10 of 2018. upon such suit being instituted by the appellant, the bank preferred an application exh.22 and that the plaint be rejected. in the application preferred by the bank, exh.22, the following averments have been made. 6. the provisions under recovery of debts and bankruptcy act (drt) are so clear and categorical that there is no scope for the borrower to file a suit independently in a situation when the recovery application at the drt has already been filed by the banks or financial institutions against the said defendant/borrower. the defendant herein (bank of baroda) reproduces order vii rule 11(d) of cpc and sec.17(1), sec.18 and sec.19 (6 to 11) of the recovery of debts and bankruptcy act which are of direct relevance to the present proceedings:­ quote: order 7, rule 11 of cpc 11. rejection of plaint the plaint shall be rejected in the c/fa/5349/2019 judgment following cases :­ [d] where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law; sec.17[1], sec.18 and sec.19[6 to 11] of the recovery of debts and bankruptcy act. 17. jurisdiction, powers and authority of tribunal [1] a tribunal shall exercise, on and from the appointed day, the jurisdiction, powers and authority to entertain and decide applications from the banks and financial institutions for recovery of debts due to such banks and financial institutions. 18. bar of jurisdiction on and from the appointed day, no court or other authority shall have, or be entitled to exercise, any jurisdiction, powers or authority [except the supreme court, and a high court exercising jurisdiction under articles 226 and 227 of the constitution] in relation to the matters specified in section 17. 19. application to the tribunal [6] where the defendant claims to set­off against the applicant's demand any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable by him from such applicant, the defendant may, at the first hearing of the application, but not afterwards unless permitted by the tribunal, present a written statement containing the particulars of the debt sought to be set­off. [7] the written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a cross suit so as to enable the tribunal to pass a final order in respect both of the original claim and of the set­off. [8] a defendant in an application may, in addition to his right of pleading a set­off under sub­section(6), set up, by way of counter­ claim against the claim of the applicant, any right or claim in respect of a cause of action accruing to the defendant against the applicant either before or after the filing of the application but before the defendant has delivered his defense or before the time limited for delivering his defense has expired, whether such counter claim is in the nature of a claim for damages or not. [9] a counter claim under sub­section (8) shall have the same effect as a cross­suit so as to enable the tribunal to pass a final order on the same application, both on the original claim and on the counter­claim. c/fa/5349/2019 judgment 7. the defendant further submits that this defendant herein had granted financial assistance to m/s. abc cotspin pvt. ltd. of rs.487.00 crores and the documents to that effect were executed in the year 2013. 8. in view of the fact that o.a. no.605 of 2015 has already been filed by defendant dated 01/12/2015, the plaintiffs are not legally entitled to file independent suit against defendant bank after filing of the above referred original application. it is only by way of counter claim against the claim of defendant as applicant before drt that the plaintiffs could have approached hon'ble drt in the above referred proceedings in case they felt genuinely aggrieved by against the original application filed by the bank for recovery of its dues. 11. the application exh.22 came to be adjudicated by the presiding officer of the commercial court and vide judgment and decree dated 04/07/2018, the same came to be allowed. while allowing the application exh.22, the commercial court observed as under:­ 9. it is further the case of the plaintiff that upon release of mortgage of above two properties and mortgage of new collateral securities, the corporate guarantee of m/s. prime cotex pvt. limited would be released. thereafter on 7.5.2015 and 8.5.2015, the mortgage of the two properties including the properties of plaintiff was released and all title documents in respect thereof were returned to the plaintiff. the plaintiff has further submitted that it had performed its part regarding discharge of corporate guarantee as per sanction letter dated 13.3.2015 and plaintiff was discharged as per the terms and conditions of the sanction letter. the plaintiff has further submitted that however, in breach of terms of the condition, the defendant bank had filed original application before debt recovery tribunal for recovery against the present plaintiff and wrongly made him party. the plaintiff has further submitted that the defendant even failed to remove its charge from the roc which is still reflecting in the record of the roc and plaintiff suffered huge losses and loss of reputation and plaintiff has lost all business opportunities to make substantial profit. the plaintiff has further submitted that it requested the defendant several times to release corporate guarantee but the defendant had not cared to do that. the plaintiff has submitted that in view of the above facts and circumstances and material on record, the plaintiff is constrained to file present suit. c/fa/5349/2019 judgment 10. in light of the aforesaid facts of the case of the plaintiff, as far as the first submission made by the defendant that the suit is barred by section 19(6) and 19(11) of debts and bankruptcy act, 1993 is concerned, section 17 of the act bar the jurisdiction of the civil court in respect of the matters in which debt recovery tribunal is competent to take cognizance. in the present case, it is not in dispute that the defendant herein has instituted the original application before debt recovery tribunal and the same was numbered as original application no.605/2015. in the said application, the present plaintiff was impleaded as defendant no.5. in the said application, the defendant no.5 has filed the counter affidavit at exh.41 before debt recovery tribunal wherein the plea regarding the bank guarantee was taken. the plea regarding the guarantee was dealt by the ld. tribunal at page nos.41, 42 and 43 of the order and finally the debt recovery tribunal came to the conclusion that defendant no.5 has stood as the guarantor. in the operative portion of the order, the debt recovery tribunal has passed the order against defendant no.5 for recovery of the dues by sale of the properties. the fact is not in dispute that in the present suit, the entire controversy revolves around the issue of bank guarantee. therefore, the issue of guarantee has already been decided by the debt recovery tribunal and same cannot be permitted again to be agitated before this court. since, debt recovery tribunal has taken cognizance, therefore, the jurisdiction of this court is barred under section 17 of the debts and bankruptcy act, 1993. thus, in my considered view, the jurisdiction of civil court is barred. 11. as far as submission of the ld. counsel for the plaintiff that the issue is pending before the hon'ble supreme court for adjudication is concerned, as on today the civil court has no jurisdiction in respect of the matter in which the debt recovery tribunal has jurisdiction by virtue of the section 17 of the act. in the case of jagdishsing v/s/ heeralal and others in c.a. no.9771/2013, decided on 30.10.2013, the hon'ble supreme court has held that civil court has not jurisdiction to entertain the suit in view of section 34 of act. 12. i have considered the judgments of hon'ble supreme court in the case of bank of rajashthan limited v/s. vck share & stock broking services limited (supra) in which the hon'ble supreme court has held that the borrower has two options i.e. either to raise counter claim before debt recovery tribunal or institute the suit before civil court but it does not say that the borrower can exercise both the options simultaneously. in the present case, the issues of guarantee has already been agitated and the main controversy is regarding the bank guarantee has already been decided by debt recovery tribunal. therefore, once the issue has been decided by the debt recovery tribunal, plaintiff cannot be permitted to raise issue of bank guarantee c/fa/5349/2019 judgment before civil court. therefore, ratio of judgment is not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. 13. i have also considered the ration of judgment, in the case of cofex exports limited v/s. canara bank (supra). in para 38 of the judgment, the hon'ble delhi high court has categorically held that issue heard and decided by the tribunal shall co­operate as res­ judicata and shall bind the parties in the suit before the civil court by virtue of explanation viii to s.11 of civil procedure code. in the present case, the issue regarding bank guarantee has already been decided by the debt recovery tribunal and if the plaintiff is aggrieved of the findings of the debt recovery tribunal, the remedy is available in the law. this court can not sit in appeal on the findings returned by the tribunal on the issue of bank guarantee. therefore, in my considered view, the present application preferred by the applicant deserves to be allowed. accordingly, i pass following order. order application below exh.22 is hereby allowed. the plaint stands rejected under order vii rule 11 of civil procedure code, 1908. no order as to costs. pronounced in the open court today on 4th day of july, 2018. 12. the plain reading of the impugned order passed by the commercial court rejecting the plaint would indicate that the plaint has been rejected substantially on the two grounds; (i) the suit instituted by the appellant is barred by virtue of section­17 of the act, 1993 and (ii) the same is also barred by the principles of res­judicata. submissions on behalf of the appellant:­ 13. mr. aditya gupta, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant [original plaintiff] vehemently submitted that the commercial court committed a serious error in passing the impugned order rejecting the plaint. according to mr. gupta, the plaint could not have been rejected by applying the principles of res­judicata. he would submit that the commercial court committed an error in taking the view that the suit preferred by his client is barred by the provisions of sections­17 and 18 c/fa/5349/2019 judgment respectively of the act, 1993. he would submit that his client is a guarantor under the common law of contract as also in terms of the loan agreement, and has an independent right. he would submit that no form has been created in endorsement or enforcement of such right. according to him, the jurisdiction of a civil court is barred only in respect of the matters, which strictly come within the purview of the section­17 thereof and not beyond the same. he would submit that the commercial court definitely has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the suit preferred by his client. mr. gupta in support of his submission has placed strong reliance on the decision of the supreme court in the case of nahar industrial enterprises ltd. vs. hong kong & shanghai banking corporation reported in (2009) 8 scc 646. 14. mr. gupta further submitted that section­9 of the code of civil procedure provides that the courts have the jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature except the suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. he would submit that the plain reading of sections­17 and 18 respectively of the act, 1993 would indicate that the civil court's jurisdiction is barred only in regard to the applications by a bank or financial institution for recovery of its debts. the jurisdiction of the civil court is not barred in regard to any suit filed by a borrower or guarantor or any other provisions of the bank in any relief. in support of such submission, the learned counsel has placed reliance on a decision of the supreme court in the case of indian bank vs. abs marine products (p) ltd reported in (2006) 5 scc 72. 15. mr. gupta vehemently submitted that the commercial court committed a serious error in applying the principles of res­judicata as embodied under section­11 of the cpc for the purpose of rejecting the plaint. he would submit by placing strong reliance on the decision of the c/fa/5349/2019 judgment supreme court in the case of kamala & others vs. k.t. eshwara sa and others reported in (2008) 12 scc 661 that the principles of res­ judicata, when attracted, would bar another suit in view of section­12 of the cpc. the question involving a mixed question of law and fact which may require not only examination of the plaint, but also, other evidence and the order passed in the earlier suit may be taken up either as a preliminary issue or at the final hearing, but, the said question cannot be determined at the stage of proceedings under order vii rule 11(d) of the cpc. 16. in the last, mr. gupta submitted that the court committed a serious error in placing reliance on the decision of the delhi high court in the case of cofex exports ltd. vs. canara bank reported in air 1997 delhi 355. according to mr. gupta, the ratio of this decision of the delhi high court is not applicable to the facts of the present case. in such circumstances referred to above, mr. gupta prays that there being merit in this appeal, the same be allowed and the impugned judgment and decree be quashed and set aside. submissions on behalf of the bank:­ 17. mr. bhaskar sharma, the learned counsel appearing for the bank has vehemently opposed this appeal. mr. sharma would submit that no error not to speak of any error of law could be said to have been committed by the commercial court in rejecting the plaint. according to mr. sharma, the commercial court is justified in rejecting the plaint on both the grounds i.e. the suit being barred by the provisions of the act 1993 and also by applying the principles of res­judicata keeping in mind the adjudication at the end of the drt in the original application filed by the bank. mr. sharma vehemently submitted that the suit instituted by the appellant herein is frivolous. mr. sharma would submit that the c/fa/5349/2019 judgment attempt on the part of the appellant as a guarantor is to wriggle out of his liabilities as a guarantor and for such reason, unnecessarily the appellant is creating trouble for the bank by instituting frivolous proceedings. in such circumstances referred to above, mr. sharma prays that there being no merit in this appeal, the same be dismissed. analysis:­ 18. having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the only question that falls for our consideration is whether the commercial court committed any error in rejecting the plaint. 19. it is a settled position of law that an order vii rule 11(d) of the code has limited application. it must be shown that the suit is barred under any law. such a conclusion must be drawn from the averments made in the plaint. as observed by the supreme court in the case of kamala & others (supra), the different clauses in order vii rule 11 should not be mixed up. whereas, in a given case, an application for rejection of the plaint may be filed on more than one ground specified in various sub­clauses thereof, a clear finding to that effect may be arrived at. what would be relevant for invoking clause (d) of order vii, rule 11 of the code is the averments made in the plaint. for that purpose, there cannot be any addition or subtraction. for the purpose of invoking order vii, rule 11(d) of the code, no amount of evidence can be looked into. the defence of the defendant is of no significance. the issues on merit of the matter which may arise between the parties would not be within the realm of the court at that stage. 20. we are of the view that the entire approach of the commercial court in this regard could be termed as incorrect. the commercial court c/fa/5349/2019 judgment has not taken the necessary pains to read the averments in the plaint. the commercial court has only gone by what the defendant bank submitted. if the court is of the view that the plaint is liable to be rejected being barred by any law, then it owes a duty to state in so­many words in the order as regards the averments made in the plaint making the suit barred by any provisions of law. from the tenor of the impugned order, it appears that the court below is of the view that it is not necessary to look into the averments made in the plaint because the cognizance of the factum of original application before the drt was sufficient to hold that suit is barred. principles of res­judicata:­ 21. before proceeding to deal with the issue of res­judicata, it would be profitable to quote the provisions of section­11 of the cpc, which reads thus:­ section 11. res judicata: no court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and, substantially, in issue has been directly and, substantially, in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been, subsequently, raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such court. explanation i the expression \"former suit\" shall denote a suit which has been decided prior to the suit in question whether or not it was instituted prior thereto. explanation ii for the purposes of this section, the competence of a court shall be determined irrespective of any provisions as to a right of appeal from the decision of such court. explanation iii the matter above referred to must in the former suit have been alleged by one party and either denied or admitted, expressly or impliedly, by the other. explanation iv any matter which might and ought to have been c/fa/5349/2019 judgment made ground of defence or attack in such former suit shall be deemed to have been a matter directly and substantially in issue in such suit. explanation v any relief claimed in the plaint, which is not expressly granted by the decree, shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been refused. explanation vi where persons litigate bona fide in respect of a public right or of a private right claimed in common for themselves and others, all persons interested in such right shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to claim under the persons so litigating. [explanation vii the provisions of this section shall apply to a proceeding for the execution of a decree and references in this section to any suit, issue or former suit shall be construed as references, respectively, to a proceeding for the execution of the decree, question arising in such proceeding and a former proceeding for the execution of that decree. explanation viii an issue heard and finally decided by a court of limited jurisdiction, competent to decide such issue, shall operate as res judicata in a subsequent suit, notwithstanding that such court of limited jurisdiction was not competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised.] 22. the principle of res judicata, as enshrined in the above provision, is based on the principle of equity, good conscience and justice. it would be inequitable, unfair and opposed to the principles of natural justice to adjudicate an issue raised in the later proceeding if such issue has been concluded in a former proceeding. it augments the principle of finality of the litigation. 23. in order to attract the provision of res judicata, there should not only be a sufficient pleading to that effect, but the plaint, the written statement, the issues involved in the earlier proceeding and the judgment of the earlier proceeding should be brought on record in accordance with the provision governing the field. (see: md. salie versus md. hanifa reported in manu/sc/0510/1976 : air 1976 sc c/fa/5349/2019 judgment 1569 and v. rajeshwari versus t.c. saravanabava reported in manu/sc/1057/2003 : (2004) 1 scc 551.) 24. in case of ishwar dutta vs. land acquisition collector reported in air 2005 sc 3156, it is held that the principle of res judicata was based on the principle of estoppels. 25. when a proceeding based on particular cause of action has attained finality, the principle of res judicata applies. there is no hesitation in our mind to hold that the principle of res judicata is a mixed question of fact and law. (see: kamala versus k.t. eshwara sa reported in manu/sc/7542/2008 : (2008) 12 scc 661.) 26. in k.t. eshwara sa and others [supra] the supreme court observed as under:­ 21. order vii, rule 11(d) of the code has limited application. it must be shown that the suit is barred under any law. such a conclusion must be drawn from the averments made in the plaint. different clauses in order vii, rule 11, in our opinion, should not be mixed up. whereas in a given case, an application for rejection of the plaint may be filed on more than one ground specified in various sub­ clauses thereof, a clear finding to that effect must be arrived at. what would be relevant for invoking clause (d) of order vii, rule 11 of the code is the averments made in the plaint. for that purpose, there cannot be any addition or subtraction. absence of jurisdiction on the part of a court can be invoked at different stages and under different provisions of the code. order vii, rule 11 of the code is one, order xiv, rule 2 is another. 22. for the purpose of invoking order vii, rule 11(d) of the code, no amount of evidence can be looked into. the issues on merit of the matter which may arise between the parties would not be within the realm of the court at that stage. all issues shall not be the subject matter of an order under the said provision. 23. the principles of res judicata, when attracted, would bar c/fa/5349/2019 judgment another suit in view of section 12 of the code. the question involving a mixed question of law and fact which may require not only examination of the plaint but also other evidence and the order passed in the earlier suit may be taken up either as a preliminary issue or at the final hearing, but, the said question cannot be determined at that stage. 27. in the case of m/s. kaushik co­op. building society vs. n. parvathamma reported in air 2017 sc 1962, the apex court has held and observed in paras­6, 7 and 8 as under:­ 6. the main point revolves around the principles of res­judicata which is neither against public policy nor res­integra to civil procedure prevailing in our country. the doctrine of res judicata is a wholesome one which is applicable not merely to matters governed by the provisions of the code of civil procedure but to all litigations, as was observed by a. alagiriswami, j. in bombay gas co. vs. jagannath pandurang, (1975) 4 scc 690 (para 11). 7. the question of res­judicata is not res integra to our judicial system. the rule of res judicata while founded on ancient precedent is dictated by a wisdom which is for all time and that the application of the rule by the courts should be influenced by no technical considerations of form, but by matter of substance within the limits allowed by law: sheoparsan singh vs. ramanandan prasad narayan singh, air 1916 pc 78. furthermore, it is well settled that the principle of res judicata is applied for the purpose of achieving finality in litigation as laid down by this court in the case of sri bhavanarayanaswamivari temple vs. vadapalli venkata bhavanarayana charyulu, (1970) 1 scc 673, relevant paragraph of which is quoted below: \"8. . it was observed that the doctrine of res judicata is not confined to a decision in a suit but it applies to decisions in other proceedings as well. but how far a decision which is rendered in other proceedings will bind the parties depends upon other considerations one of which is whether that decision determines substantial rights of parties and the other is whether the parties are given adequate opportunities to establish the rights pleaded by them. the doctrine of res judicata is not confined to the limits prescribed in section 11, civil procedure code. the underlying principle of that doctrine is that there should be finality in litigation and that a person should not be vexed twice over in respect of the same matter.\". (emphasis supplied) 8. to constitute a matter res judicata, as observed by this court in c/fa/5349/2019 judgment syed mohd. salie labbai vs. mohd. hanifa, air 1976 sc 1569 : (1976) 4 scc 780, the following conditions must be proved: (1) that the litigating parties must be the same; (2) that the subject­matter of the suit also must be identical; (3) that the matter must be finally decided between the parties; and (4) that the suit must be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction. in the case of narayana prabhu venkateswara prabhu vs. narayana prabhu krishna prabhu, air 1977 sc 1268 : (1977) 2 scc 181, it was observed by this court: \"one of the tests in deciding whether the doctrine of res judicata applies to a particular case or not is to determine whether two inconsistent decrees will come into existence if it is not applied.\" 27.1 in the aforesaid decision, the apex court has held and observed in para­18 as under:­ 18.we are of the considered opinion that it may be true that the court at initial stage may not enter into the merit of the matter. its opinion in the nature of things would be a prima facie one. but the court must also consider that the analogy of res­judicata or of the technical rules of civil procedure is, in cases like the present one, appropriate and the courts are expected to administer the law so as to effectuate its underlying object. court shall also bear in mind that the basic character of this principle is public policy and preventive as to give finality to the decision of the court of competent jurisdiction and prevent further litigation. 28. kamala & others (supra) later came to be referred to and relied upon in the case of vaish aggarwal panchayat vs. inder kumar & others; civil appeal no.2089 of 2015; decided on 25/08/2015, wherein the supreme court observed as under:­ 12. the plea of res judicata is founded on proof of certain facts and then by applying the law to the facts so found. it is, therefore, necessary that the foundation for the plea must be laid in the pleadings and then an issue must be framed and tried. a plea not properly raised in the pleadings or in issues at the stage of the trial, would not be permitted to be raised for the first time at the stage of appeal [see (raja) jagadish chandra deo dhabal deb v. gour hari mahato[2], medapati surayya v. tondapu bala gangadhara ramakrishna reddi[3] and katragadda china anjaneyulu v. kattaragadda china ramayya[4]].\" after so stating, the court further observed that:­ \"not only the plea has to be taken, it has to be substantiated by producing c/fa/5349/2019 judgment the copies of the pleadings, issues and judgment in the previous case. maybe, in a given case only copy of judgment in previous suit is filed in proof of plea of res judicata and the judgment contains exhaustive or in requisite details the statement of pleadings and the issues which may be taken as enough proof. but as pointed out in syed mohd. salie labbai v. mohd. hanifa[5] the basic method to decide the question of res judicata is first to determine the case of the parties as put forward in their respective pleadings of their previous suit and then to find out as to what had been decided by the judgment which operates as res judicata.\" 13. in this regard the pronouncement in kamala and others v. k.t. eshwara sa and others[6] would be seemly. in the said case while dealing with the principle engrafted under order vii rule 11(d) c.p.c., the court has held thus:­ \"21. order 7 rule 11(d) of the code has limited application. it must be shown that the suit is barred under any law. such a conclusion must be drawn from the averments made in the plaint. different clauses in order 7 rule 11, in our opinion, should not be mixed up. whereas in a given case, an application for rejection of the plaint may be filed on more than one ground specified in various sub­clauses thereof, a clear finding to that effect must be arrived at. what would be relevant for invoking clause (d) of order 7 rule 11 of the code are the averments made in the plaint. for that purpose, there cannot be any addition or subtraction. absence of jurisdiction on the part of a court can be invoked at different stages and under different provisions of the code. order 7 rule 11 of the code is one, order 14 rule 2 is another. 22. for the purpose of invoking order 7 rule 11(d) of the code, no amount of evidence can be looked into. the issues on merit of the matter which may arise between the parties would not be within the realm of the court at that stage. all issues shall not be the subject­matter of an order under the said provision.\" 14. after so stating, while proceeding to deal with the concept of resjudicata, the court opined:­ \"23. the principles of res judicata, when attracted, would bar another suit in view of section 12 of the code. the question involving a mixed question of law and fact which may require not only examination of the plaint but also other evidence and the order passed in the earlier suit may be taken up either as a preliminary issue or at the final hearing, but, the said question cannot be determined at that stage. 24. it is one thing to say that the averments made in the plaint on their face discloses no cause of action, but it is another thing to say c/fa/5349/2019 judgment that although the same discloses a cause of action, the same is barred by a law. 25. the decisions rendered by this court as also by various high courts are not uniform in this behalf. but, then the broad principle which can be culled out therefrom is that the court at that stage would not consider any evidence or enter into a disputed question of fact or law. in the event, the jurisdiction of the court is found to be barred by any law, meaning thereby, the subject­ matter thereof, the application for rejection of plaint should be entertained.\" 15. in this regard a reference to a three­judge bench decision in balasaria construction (p) ltd. v. hanuman seva trust[7] and others would be fruitful. be it noted the said case was referred to a larger bench vide balasaria construction (p) ltd. v. hanuman seva trust[8]. the order of reference reads as follows:­ \"4. this case was argued at length on 30­8­2005. counsel appearing for the appellant had relied upon a judgment of this court in n.v. srinivasa murthy v. mariyamma[9] for the proposition that a plaint could be rejected if the suit is ex facie barred by limitation. as against this, counsel for the respondents relied upon a later judgment of this court in popat and kotecha property v. state bank of india staff assn.[10] in respect of the proposition that order 7 rule 11(d) was not applicable in a case where a question has to be decided on the basis of fact that the suit was barred by limitation. the point as to whether the words \"barred by law\" occurring in order 7 rule 11(d) cpc would include the suit being \"barred by limitation\" was not specifically dealt with in either of these two judgments, cited above. but this point has been specifically dealt with by the different high courts in mohan lal sukhadia university v. priya soloman[11], khaja quthubullah v. govt. of a.p.[12], vedapalli suryanarayana v. poosarla venkata sanker suryanarayana[13], arjan singh v. union of india[14] wherein it has been held that the plaint under order 7 rule 11(d) cannot be rejected on the ground that it is barred by limitation. according to these judgments the suit has to be barred by a provision of law to come within the meaning of order 7 rule 11 cpc. a contrary view has been taken in jugolinija rajia jugoslavija v. fab leathers ltd.[15], national insurance co. ltd. v. navrom constantza[16], j. patel & co. v. national federation of industrial coop. ltd.[17] and state bank of india staff assn. v. popat & kotecha property. the last judgment was the subject­matter of challenge in popat and kotecha property v. state bank of india staff assn. this court set aside the judgment and held in para 25 as under: \"25. when the averments in the plaint are considered in the c/fa/5349/2019 judgment background of the principles set out in sopan sukhdeo case[18] the inevitable conclusion is that the division bench was not right in holding that order 7 rule 11 cpc was applicable to the facts of the case. diverse claims were made and the division bench was wrong in proceeding with the assumption that only the non­ execution of lease deed was the basic issue. even if it is accepted that the other claims were relatable to it they have independent existence. whether the collection of amounts by the respondent was for a period beyond 51 years needs evidence to be adduced. it is not a case where the suit from statement in the plaint can be said to be barred by law. the statement in the plaint without addition or subtraction must show that it is barred by any law to attract application of order 7 rule 11. this is not so in the present case.\" 5. noticing the conflict between the various high courts and the apparent conflict of opinion expressed by this court in n.v. srinivasa murthy v. mariyamma and popat and kotecha property v. state bank of india staff assn. the bench referred† the following question of law for consideration to a larger bench: \"whether the words 'barred by law' under order 7 rule 11(d) would also include the ground that it is barred by the law of limitation.\" 15. the three­judge bench opined that there was no conflict of opinion and thereafter the matter came back to the division bench for adjudication. the division bench reproduced what has been stated by the three­judge bench. it is as under:­ \"before the three­judge bench, counsel for both the parties stated as follows: \".it is not the case of either side that as an absolute proposition an application under order 7 and rule 11(d) can never be based on the law of limitation. both sides state that the impugned judgment is based on the facts of this particular case and the question whether or not an application under order 7 rule 11(d) could be based on law of limitation was not raised and has not been dealt with. both sides further state that the decision in this case will depend upon the facts of this case.\" 16. after so stating, the division bench opined that in the facts of the said case, the suit could not be dismissed as barred by limitation without proper pleadings, framing of issue on limitation and taking evidence, for question of limitation is a mixed question of fact and law and on ex­facie reading of the plaint it could not be held that the suit was barred by time. c/fa/5349/2019 judgment 17. coming to the case at hand we find that the allegations in the plaint are absolutely different. there is an asseveration of fraud and collusion. there is an assertion that in the earlier suit a decree came to be passed because of fraud and collusion. in such a fact situation, in our considered opinion, the high court has fallen into error by expressing the view that the plea of res­judicata was obvious from the plaint. in fact, a finding has been recorded by the high court accepting the plea taken in the written statement. in our view, in the obtaining factual matrix there should have been a trial with regard to all the issues framed. 29. thus, the dictum discernible as laid by the supreme court is that the court should be very slow in rejecting the plaint on the ground of res­judicata as the issue with regard to res­judicata would be a mixed question of law and fact and, it may be necessary for the court to ask the party to lead evidence on such issue. 30. it is a settled proposition of law that the court, at the time of considering an application under order 7, rule 11 of the code, shall confine itself to the averments made in the plaint and the documents annexed thereto. it shall not look into the defence of the defendants in order to find out as to whether the suit is barred by law. therefore, the plaint cannot be rejected on the plea of being barred by principle of res judicata upon invocation of the provision contained under order 7, rule 11 (d) of the code. 31. the madras high court in the case of g. subramani vs. v.rajasekaran reported in 2013 (4) ctc 468, considered the applicability of the principle of res­judicata while considering the application under order 7 rule 11 cpc and found that the plaint cannot be rejected on the basis of defence made in the written statement and the bar of res­judicata is an issue to be raised and decided, but not as a ground to reject the plaint. paragraph 11 of the said decision reads as c/fa/5349/2019 judgment follows: \"11. the other contention that the decision of the registrar of firms that the retirement date was genuine and valid would operate as res judicata and hence, the same shall be a statutory bar for the present suit is also bound to be rejected, because the learned counsel is not in a position to show any provision which says that the decision of the registrar of firms shall be final and that civil court's jurisdiction to go into the question stands barred. even otherwise, the question of bar of res judicata shall not be the ground on which a plaint can be rejected. what section 11 of the code of civil procedure says is that a question, which has been substantially and directly raised as an issue in a previously decided suit, shall not be tried by the court dealing with the subsequent suit. so, the said provision can be interpreted to mean that such a suit can be dismissed on the ground of bar of res judiciata and it cannot be stretched too much to say that the bar of res judicata shall be the ground for rejection of the plaint. the question of res judicata shall be a mixed question of law and fact. it has got to be raised and decided. a plaint can be rejected based on the pleadings made in the plaint and the documents produced along with the plaint. a plaint cannot be rejected based on the defence statement of the defendant made in the written statement or any averment made in the affidavit filed in support of the application filed under order 7, rule 11 of the code of civil procedure.\" 32. in the case on hand examining the plaint, it is not possible to come to the conclusion that the suit is barred by res­judicata inasmuch as although there is a reference to the original application filed by the bank before the drt yet there is nothing­else in the form of the avements in the plaint, on the basis of which this court can come on definite conclusion that the suit is barred by the principles of res­ judicata. this principles can be made applicable only by examining the plaint and the evidence in the earlier suit or any other proceedings so as to establish that the matter in issue is substantially the same. 33. we shall now look into the second question whether the suit could be said to be barred by the provisions of sections­17 and 18 of the act, 1993. c/fa/5349/2019 judgment 34. section­17 of the act, 1993 reads thus:­ 17. jurisdiction, powers and authority of tribunal [1] a tribunal shall exercise, on and from the appointed day, the jurisdiction, powers and authority to entertain and decide applications from the banks and financial institutions for recovery of debts due to such banks and financial institutions. [(1a) without prejudice to sub­section (1), (a) the tribunal shall exercise, on and from the date to be appointed by the central government, the jurisdiction, powers and authority to entertain and decide applications under part ii of insolvency and bankruptcy code, 2016. (b) the tribunal shall have circuit sittings in all district headquarters] (2) an appellate tribunal shall exercise, on and from the appointed day, the jurisdiction, powers and authority to entertain appeals against any order made, or deemed to have been made, by a tribunal under this act. 35. section­18 of the act, 1993 reads thus:­ 18. bar of jurisdiction on and from the appointed day, no court or other authority shall have, or be entitled to exercise, any jurisdiction, powers or authority [except the supreme court, and a high court exercising jurisdiction under articles 226 and 227 of the constitution] in relation to the matters specified in section 17. 36. as the bank has also invoked sections­19(6) and 19(11) of the act, 1993, we shall look into the two provisions. 19. application to the tribunal [6] where the defendant claims to set­off against the applicant's demand any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable by him from such applicant, the defendant may, at the first hearing of the application, but not afterwards unless permitted by the tribunal, present a written statement containing the particulars of 1[the debt sought to be set­off along with original documents and other evidence relied on in support of claim of set­off in relation to any ascertained sum of money, against the applicant.] c/fa/5349/2019 judgment [11] where a defendant sets up a counter­claim in the written statement and in reply to such claim the applicant contends that the claim thereby raised ought not to be disposed of by way of counter­claim but in an independent action, the tribunal shall decide such issue along with the claim of the applicant for recovery of the debt.] 37. in nahar industrial enterprises ltd. [supra], the hon'ble supreme has held that section 34 of the sarfaesi act does not oust the jurisdiction of the civil court altogether to entertain a suit under section­9 of the civil procedure code. it was held therein that the jurisdiction of the civil court is plenary in nature and the civil court is entitled to decide the respective claims of the parties in a suit unless the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain such suit under section 9 of the civil procedure code is ousted expressly by a statute or by necessary implication therefrom. after examining the scope and/or ambit of the debt recovery act and the sarfaesi act, the hon'ble supreme court held therein that the debt recovery tribunal cannot be treated as a civil court, as the said debt recovery tribunal was constituted with a specific purpose and has a limited jurisdiction; it can neither pass a decree nor can debtor seek declaratory relief from the debt recovery tribunal. the debt recovery tribunal can only issue recovery certificate. some instances were also mentioned in the said judgment. it was further held therein that notwithstanding the provision contained in section 34 of the sarfaesi act, the civil court's jurisdiction is not ousted in certain circumstances; say for example, (i) the banks and the financial institution for the purpose of enforcement of their claim for a sum below rupees ten lakh is required to file civil suit before the civil court; (ii) even the debtors can file their claims or set off or counter­claim before the civil court; (iii) even before filing any proceeding or recovery of debt by the bank or the financial institution, the debtor may file c/fa/5349/2019 judgment preemptive suits and obtain order of injunction; (iv) civil suit is also maintainable in a case where allegation of fraud and misrepresentation is involved; (v) civil court's jurisdiction can also be invoked when several other issues of complicated nature may arise between the parties etc. we quote the relevant paragraphs:­ 97. a debtor under the common law of contract as also in terms of the loan agreement may have an independent right. no forum has been created for endorsement of that right. jurisdiction of a civil court as noticed hereinbefore is barred only in respect of the matters which strictly come within the purview of section 17 thereof and not beyond the same. the civil court, therefore, will continue to have jurisdiction. 98. even in respect of set off or counter­claim, having regard to the provisions of sub­sections (6) to (11) of section 19 of the act, it is evident :­ a) that the proceedings must be initiated by the bank b) some species of the remedy as provided therein would be available therefor. c) in terms of sub­section (11) of section 19, the bank or the financial institution is at liberty to send a borrower out of the forum. d) in terms of the provisions of the act, thus, the claim of the borrower is excluded and not included. e) in the event the bank withdraws his claim the counter­claim would not survive which may be contrasted with rule 6 of order viii of the code. f) sub­section (9) of section 19 of the act in relation thereto has a limited application. g) the claim petition by the bank or the financial institution must relate to a lending/borrowing transaction between a bank or the financial institution and the borrower. h) the banks or the financial institutions, thus, have a primacy in respect of the proceedings before the tribunal. i) an order of injunction, attachment or appointment of a receiver can be initiated only at the instance of the bank or the financial institution. we, however, do not mean to suggest that a tribunal having a plenary power, even otherwise would not be entitled to pass an order of injunction or an interim order, although ordinarily expressly it had no statutory power in relation the as the bank c/fa/5349/2019 judgment reto. j) it can issue a certificate only for recovery of its dues. it cannot pass a decree. k) although an appeal can be filed against the judgment of the tribunal, pre­deposit to the extent of 75 % of the demand is imperative in character. l) even cross­examination of the witnesses need not be found to be necessary. m) subject to compliance of the principle of natural justice it may evolve its own procedure. n) it is not bound by the procedure laid down under the code. it may however be noticed in this regard that just because the tribunal is not bound by the code, it does not mean that it would not have jurisdiction to exercise powers of a court as contained in the code. `rather, the tribunal can travel beyond the code of civil procedure and the only fetter that is put on its powers is to observe the principles of natural justice.'[see industrial credit and investment corpn. of india ltd. v. grapco industries ltd., (1999) 4 scc 710] the tribunal, therefore, would not be a civil court. exclusion of jurisdiction must be express 105. the civil court indisputably has the jurisdiction to try a suit. if the suit is vexatious or otherwise not maintainable action can be taken in respect thereof in terms of the code. but if all suits filed in the civil courts,whether inextricably connected with the application filed before the drt by the banks and financial institutions are transferred, the same would amount to ousting the jurisdiction of the civil courts indirectly. suits filed by the debtor may or may not be counter claims to the claims filed by banks or financial institutions but for that purpose consent of the plaintiff is necessary. 106. it is furthermore difficult to accept the contentions of the respondents that the statutory provisions contained in section 17 and 18 of the drt act have ousted the jurisdiction of the civil court as the said provisions clearly state that the jurisdiction of the civil court is barred in relation only to applications from banks and financial institutions for recovery of debts due to such banks and financial institutions. 107. a civil court is entitled to decide the respective claims of the parties in a suit. it must come within the purview of the hierarchy of courts as indicated in section 3 of the code. it will have jurisdiction to determine all disputes of civil nature unless the same is barred c/fa/5349/2019 judgment expressly by a statute or by necessary implication. 108. although some arguments have been advanced before us whether having regard to the provisions of sections 17 and 18 of the act the civil court jurisdiction is completely ousted, we are of the view that the jurisdiction of the civil court would be ousted only in respect of the matters contained in section 18 which has a direct co­relation with section 17 thereof, that is to say that the matter must relate to a debt payable to a bank or a financial institution. the application before the tribunal would lie only at the instance of the bank or the financial institution for the recovery of its debt. it must further be noted in this respect that had the jurisdiction of the civil courts been barred in respect of counterclaim also, the statute would have said so and sections 17 and 18 would have been amended to introduce the provision of counterclaim. 109. we may in this context place on record the following observations from indian bank (supra): \"14. section 9 of the code of civil procedure provides that the courts shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature, excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. 15. it is evident from sections 17 and 18 of the debts recovery act that civil court's jurisdiction is barred only in regard to applications by a bank or a financial institution for recovery of its debts. the jurisdiction of civil courts is not barred in regard to any suit filed by a borrower or any other person against a bank for any relief. 16. .what is significant is that sections 17 and 18 have not been amended. jurisdiction has not been conferred on the tribunal, even after amendment, to try independent suits or proceedings initiated by borrowers or others against banks/financial institutions, nor the jurisdiction of civil courts barred in regard to such suits or proceedings. 110. it must be remembered that the jurisdiction of a civil court is plenary in nature. unless the same is ousted, expressly or by necessary implication, it will have jurisdiction to try all types of suits. 111. in dhulabhai v. state of m.p.,[ (1968) 3 scr 662 ], this court opined:­ \"32. . the result of this inquiry into the diverse views expressed in this court may be stated as follows: (2) where there is an express bar of the jurisdiction of the c/fa/5349/2019 judgment court, an examination of the scheme of the particular act to find the adequacy or the sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant but is not decisive to sustain the jurisdiction of the civil court. where there is no express exclusion the examination of the remedies and the scheme of the particular act to find out the intendment becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be decisive. in the latter case it is necessary to see if the statute creates a special right or a liability and provides for the determination of the right or liability and further lays down that all questions about the said right and liability shall be determined by the tribunals so constituted, and whether remedies normally associated with actions in civil courts are prescribed by the said statute or not. (7) an exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil court is not readily to be inferred unless the conditions above set down apply.\" 112. in dwarka prasad agarwal v. ramesh chander agarwal, [(2003) 6 scc 220] \"19. a bare perusal of the aforementioned provisions leaves no manner of doubt that thereby the jurisdiction of the civil court has not been ousted. the civil court, in the instant case, was concerned with the rival claims of the parties as to whether one party has illegally been dispossessed by the other or not. such a suit, apart from the general law, would also be maintainable in terms of section 6 of the specific relief act, 1963. in such matters the court would not be concerned even with the question as to the title/ownership of the property.\" therein five principles were laid down stating :­ \"22. the dispute between the parties was eminently a civil dispute and not a dispute under the provisions of the companies act. section 9 of the code of civil procedure confers jurisdiction upon the civil courts to determine all disputes of civil nature unless the same is barred under a statute either expressly or by necessary implication. bar of jurisdiction of a civil court is not to be readily inferred. a provision seeking to bar jurisdiction of a civil court requires strict interpretation. the court, it is well settled, would normally lean in favour of construction, which would uphold retention of jurisdiction of the civil court. the burden of proof in this behalf shall be on the party who asserts that the civil court's jurisdiction is ousted. (see sahebgouda v. ogeppa, (2003) 6 scc 151.) even otherwise, the civil court's jurisdiction is not completely ousted under the companies act, 1956.\" 113. in nagri pracharini sabha v. vth addl. distt. and sessions c/fa/5349/2019 judgment judge, [1991 supp (2) scc 36] \"2. a litigant having a grievance of a civil nature has, independently of any statute, a right to institute a suit in the civil court unless its cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. the position is well­settled that exclusion of jurisdiction of the civil court is not to be readily inferred and such exclusion must be either expressly or implied.\" 114. in ramesh chand ardawatiya v. anil panjwani, [(2003) 7 scc 350] this court opined :­ \"19. . where there is a special tribunal conferred with jurisdiction or exclusive jurisdiction to try a particular class of cases even then the civil court can entertain a civil suit of that class on availability of a few grounds. an exclusion of jurisdiction of the civil court is not to be readily inferred. (see dhulabhai v. state of m.p.)\" 115. power to create or enlarge jurisdiction is legislative in character. similarly, right of revision or appeal is normally a creature of statute. 16. in rajasthan srtc v. zakir hussain, [(2005) 7 scc 447] this court has held:­ \"21. it is a well­settled principle of law as laid down by this court that if the court has no jurisdiction, the jurisdiction cannot be conferred by any order of court. this court in the case of a.r. antulay v. r.s. nayak, air paras 40 to 42 wherein it is, inter alia, held and observed as under: (scc pp. 650­51, paras 38­40) . . 39. . the power to create or enlarge jurisdiction is legislative in character. parliament alone can do it by law and no court, whether superior or inferior or both combined can enlarge the jurisdiction of a court or divest a person of his rights of revision and appeal. .. .\" 117. the act, although, was enacted for a specific purpose but having regard to the exclusion of jurisdiction expressly provided for in sections 17 and 18 of the act, it is difficult to hold that a civil court's jurisdiction is completely ousted. indisputably the banks and the financial institutions for the purpose of enforcement of their claim for a sum below rs. 10 lakhs would have to file civil suits before the civil courts. it is only for the claims of the banks and the financial institutions above the aforementioned sum that they have to approach the debt recovery tribunal. it is also without any cavil that the banks and the financial institutions, keeping in view the provisions of sections 17 and 18 of the act, are necessarily required to file their c/fa/5349/2019 judgment claim petitions before the tribunal. the converse is not true. debtors can file their claims of set off or counter­claims only when a claim application is filed and not otherwise. even in a given situation the banks and/or the financial institutions can ask the tribunal to pass an appropriate order for getting the claims of set­off or the counter claims, determined by a civil court. the tribunal is not a high powered tribunal. it is a one man tribunal. unlike some special acts, as for example andhra pradesh land grabbing (prohibition) act, 1982 it does not contain a deeming provision that the tribunal would be deemed to be a civil court. 38. we have to our advantage a decision of a co­ordinate bench of this court in the case of vishal exports overseas limited & others vs. state bank of indian & others rendered in the first appeal no.1956 of 2018; decided on 10/07/2018, wherein, mr. m.r. shah, j. speaking for the bench [as his lordship then was] observed as under:­ 7.2 at this stage, it is required to be noted that as such, while passing the impugned order and rejecting the plaint under order vii rule 11 of the cpc, as such, there is no specific finding recorded by the learned commercial court that the independent suit preferred by the plaintiffs filed against the respective banks shall not be maintainable and/or shall be barred by any law. it cannot be disputed that the plaint under order vii rule 11(d) of the cpc can be rejected if it is found that the suit is barred by any law. at this stage, it is also required to be noted that as such, the learned judge has not exercised the power under order vii rule 11(a) of the cpc. therefore, the short question which is posed for the consideration of this court is whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned commercial court is justified in rejecting the plaint under order vii rule 11 of the cpc on the grounds stated in the impugned order? 7.3 from the plaint, it appears that the plaintiffs, in the year 2010, instituted the civil suit against the respondents herein original defendants banks/ lenders for recovery of rs.7,86,61,71,301/­ with interest at the rate of 12% p.a. as and by way of damages/ compensation from the defendants for their various wrongful actions, including breach of contract, actions in bad faith and acts of misfeasance and/or nonfeasance and tortuous liability. the relief is sought against all the defendants jointly and severally by way of damages/compensation. it emerges from the record that prior thereto, the banks/ consortium of banks and banks independently and/or jointly filed different original applications in the year 2007/ 2008/ 2009, before the drt for recovery of approximately rs.800 crores from c/fa/5349/2019 judgment the plaintiffs borrowers. it is true that the plaintiff/ plaintiffs did not file/ lodge any counter­claim against the consortium bank and other banks and instead filed a civil suit against the consortium banks seeking a decree referred to hereinabove. immediately on being served with the summonses of the suit, the banks/consortium banks filed the application seeking rejection of the plaint on the ground that the suit is barred by sections 18 and 19 of the finance act, 1993. 7.4 learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties have relied upon the decisions of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of united bank of india, calcutta v. abhijit tea co. pvt. ltd. and others (supra), indian bank v. abs marine products (p) ltd. (supra), state bank of india v. ranjan chemicals ltd. and another (supra), and nahar industrial enterprises limited v. hong kong and shanghai banking corporation (supra) and bank of rajasthan limited v. vck shares and stock broking services limited (supra). however, considering the controversy and the issues before the hon'ble supreme court in the aforesaid decisions and the questions which are now referred to the larger bench by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of bank of rajasthan limited v. vck shares and stock broking services limited (supra), it appears that the issue before the hon'ble supreme court in the aforesaid decisions was whether an independent suit filed by a borrower against a bank or financial institution, which has applied for recovery of its loan against the plaintiff under the finance act, is liable to be transferred and tried along with the application under the finance act by drt? in none of the decisions referred to hereinabove, the hon'ble supreme court has observed and held that independent suit by the borrower in the civil court shall be maintainable or not maintainable. considering the decisions of the hon'ble supreme court referred to above, it appears that the hon'ble supreme court was considering the necessity for joint trial by treating the suit before the civil court as counter­claim for number of reasons, namely, to save the expenses of two attendances by the counsel and witnesses and the trial judge will be able to try the two actions at the same time and take common evidence in respect of both the claims. therefore, the desirability to consider the suit as a counter­claim and/ or desirability to have a joint trial for convenience and to avoid the duplication to save expenses as observed hereinabove is a different thing than to say that independent suit shall not be maintainable under the law, more particularly, under the finance act, 1993, and therefore the plaint is liable to be rejected under order vii rule 11 of the cpc. from the impugned order passed by the learned judge, it appears that while rejecting the plaint under order vii rule 11 of the cpc, the learned judge has heavily relied upon a few observations of the division bench in the earlier round of litigation in special civil application no.7434/2014 and other allied special civil applications, more particularly, paragraphs­15 and 16 of the said order, reproduced c/fa/5349/2019 judgment by the learned commercial court in paragraph­32 of its order. however, considering the observations made in paragraphs­15 and 16, it cannot be culled out that the division bench in the aforesaid order has observed that the suit filed by the plaintiffs was not at all maintainable. the observations made in paragraphs­15 and 16 which have been heavily relied upon by the learned judge are required to be considered in light of the issues/controversy before the court. on considering the entire judgment and order passed in special civil application no.7434/2014 and other allied special civil applications, it transpires that one of the prayer by the plaintiffs was that till the application filed by the banks under order v as the bank ii rule 11 of the cpc in the present suit is decided and disposed of, the proceedings of the original applications before the drt be stayed. one another main prayer before the division bench was consolidation of all the original applications filed by various banks and consortium of banks which was rejected by the learned drt. to the prayer of the plaintiffs to stay further proceedings of the original applications till the application under order vii rule 11 of the cpc in the present proceedings is decided and disposed of, the division bench made observations in paragraphs­15 and 16, as under: \"15. in spite of express provision of law, the present petitioners have exercised and opted for filing a suit before the city civil court instead of filing counter claim and thereafter, insisting that very suit be heard and decided first and thereafter the present applications preferred by the consortium of banks may be decided. if that request may be accepted, then the whole purpose of special enactment for the recovery of public debts would be frustrated. 16. the aforesaid two distinctive proceedings preferred before the tribunal as well as the civil court have been selected by the parties to the proceedings at their own volition whereas the petitioners have selected the forum of civil court. thereafter, they cannot insist that unless the proceedings before the city civil court is concluded, the aforesaid proceedings before the tribunal should be stayed. even otherwise also, records and proceedings clearly indicate that the aforesaid six applications were preferred first in the point of time. thereafter, there was an option for the present petitioners to prefer the counter claim in the aforesaid original applications instead of preferring a regular suit for recovery of damages. still however, they have opted for preferring the suit and thereafter by way of urging to stay the proceedings before the tribunal clearly indicate the intention of stalling the proceedings before the debts recovery tribunal.\" from the aforesaid observations, it cannot be said that the division c/fa/5349/2019 judgment bench, in the aforesaid order, specifically observed that the independent suit filed by the plaintiffs before the civil court was not maintainable at all. from the impugned order, it appears that the learned judge, commercial court, has rejected the plaint by observing in paragraphs­32 and 33 as under: \"32. in view of the aforesaid facts and considering the very conduct on the part of the plaintiffs which indicates that without agitating a counter­claim before drt and pressing for continuing with the suit which, as held herein above, the relief thereof could have been claimed by way of lodging a counter­claim which, in fact, despite several opportunities available to the plaintiffs, has not chosen the same and therefore, the plaintiffs cannot take the benefit of their own wrong by keeping the proceedings of the present suit pending on one side and challenging several miscellaneous and final orders passed by the drt on the other side, despite there being clear findings of the hon'ble court as to the remedies available to the plaintiffs under sections 18 and 19 of the rddb act. 33. hence, the possibility of plaintiffs having not acquainted with the remedies available to them and the knowledge thereof, cannot be ruled out and the said fact seems to have been substantiated from several orders passed by the drt, drat and also by the hon'ble high court of gujarat and therefore, the very conduct on the part of the plaintiffs disentitle the plaintiffs even to continue with the proceedings of the present suit in the light of the detailed discussion made herein above.\" however, as observed hereinabove, it is not at all observed that independent suit shall not be maintainable at all in view of the scheme of the finance act, 1993. merely because some remedy might have been available, in the present case, may be by way of counter­claim, which the plaintiff did not avail and instead, filed an independent suit, cannot be a ground to reject the plaint under order vii rule 11 of the cpc, unless it is observed and found that the suit is clearly barred by any law. 7.5 at this stage, it is required to be noted that in the present case, now no fruitful purpose would be served in relegating the plaintiffs to lodge the counter­claim and/or to transfer the suit to the drt (the issue which is now at large before the hon'ble supreme court) as the original applications filed by the bank have already been disposed of long back much before even the application under order vii rule 11 of the cpc is decided and disposed of and no applications are pending before the learned drt. it is also required to be noted that different original applications were filed by different banks against the c/fa/5349/2019 judgment plaintiffs borrowers and their application for consolidation of the original applications were rejected which came to be confirmed by the division bench of this court. the present suit is filed by the plaintiffs jointly against the consortium of bank/ banks and therefore even if the plaintiffs could have filed the counter­claim, it was not possible as decree is sought against all the banks jointly and severally and as such, a counter­claim in different original applications would be possible or not is also a very serious question. one can understand if only one original application was pending of the consortium banks and the suit is either transferred and/or one counter­claim is filed in only one original application, which is not so in the present case. 8. in any case, in absence of any specific finding given by the learned judge, commercial court, that independent suit shall not be maintainable and/or the same is specifically barred under the provisions of the finance act, 1993, the learned judge is not justified in rejecting the plaint under order vii rule 11 of the cpc. there can be a very serious dispute whether the reliefs which are sought in the plaint by way of damages/ compensation from the defendants for their various wrongful actions, including breach of contract, actions in bad faith and acts of misfeasance and/or non­feasance and tortuous liability can be treated as counter­claim in an application under section 19 of the finance act, 1993. be that as it may, as observed hereinabove, there is no specific finding recorded by the learned trial curt that the independent suit filed by the plaintiffs is specifically barred by any law, more particularly, by the provisions of the finance act, 1993 and therefore, the plaint cannot be rejected under order vii rule 11 of the cpc. therefore, without touching the questions which are referred to the larger bench of the hon'ble supreme court in bank of rajasthan limited v. vck shares and stock broking services limited(supra), on the aforesaid ground alone, the impugned order passed by the learned judge, commercial court, rejecting the plaint under order vii rule 11 of the cpc deserves to be quashed and set aside. 39. the law appears to be well settled. as regards sections­18 and 19 respectively of the act, 1993, the cause of action for the bank to institute the original application before the drt was the alleged non­ payment of the amounts advanced to the borrower. the cause of action as pleaded by the appellant in his capacity as a guarantor in his suit was the alleged breach by the bank of the contract in the form of sanction letter dated 13/03/2015. whatever may be the worth of the claim, in c/fa/5349/2019 judgment other words, we cannot go into the issue at this stage whether the claim of the appellant herein is sustainable in law or not or whether he is justified in asking the bank to discharge him of all his liabilities in view of the sanction letter and the conditions contained thereof. we are only concerned with the limited issue whether the appellant as the original plaintiff could have been non­suited at the threshold by rejecting the plaint. it is evident that the issues that arose in the application preferred by the bank before the drt were different from the issues that arose in the suit instituted by the appellant herein as a guarantor. it is evident from the sections­17 and 18 of the act, 1993 that the civil court's jurisdiction is barred only in regard to the applications by a bank or a financial institution for recovery of its debts. the jurisdiction of civil courts is not barred in regard to any suit filed by a borrower or any other person against a bank for any relief. section­ 19(6) and 19(11) on which much emphasis has been laid upon by the bank for the purpose of getting plaint rejected are merely enabling provisions as held by the supreme court in the case of indian bank (supra). in this regard, we quote the relevant observations of the supreme court in the case of indian bank vs abs marine products pvt. ltd. reported in 2006 (5) scc 72. 15. it is evident from sections 17 and 18 of the debts recovery act that civil court's jurisdiction is barred only in regard to applications by a bank or a financial institution for recovery of its debts. the jurisdiction of civil courts is not barred in regard to any suit filed by a borrower or any other person against a bank for any relief. it is not disputed that the calcutta high court had jurisdiction to entertain and dispose of c.s. no.7/1995 filed by the borrower when it was filed and continues to have jurisdiction to entertain and dispose of the said suit. there is no provision in the act for transfer of suits and proceedings, except section 31 which relates to suit/proceeding by a bank or financial institution for recovery of a debt. it is evident from section 31 that only those cases and proceedings (for recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions) which were pending before c/fa/5349/2019 judgment any court immediately before the date of establishment of a tribunal under the debts recovery act stood transferred, to the tribunal. in this case, there is no dispute that the debt recovery tribunal, calcutta, was established long prior to the company filing c.s. no.7/1995 against the bank. the said suit having been filed long after the date when the tribunal was established and not being a suit or proceeding instituted by a bank or financial institution for recovery of a debt, did not attract section 31. 16. as far as sub­sections (6) to (11) of section 19 are concerned, they are merely enabling provisions. the debts recovery act, as it originally stood, did not contain any provision enabling a defendant in an application filed by the bank/financial institution to claim any set off or make any counter claim against the bank/financial institution. on that among other grounds, the act was held to be unconstitutional (see delhi high court bar association vs. union of india air 1995 delhi 323). during the pendency of appeal against the said decision, before this court, the act was amended by act 1 of 2000 to remove the lacuna by providing for set off and counter­claims by defendants in the applications filed by banks/financial institution before the tribunal. the provisions of the act as amended were upheld by this court in union of india vs. delhi high court bar association [2002 (4) scc 275]. the effect of sub­sections (6) to (11) of section 19 of the amended act is that any defendant in a suit or proceeding initiated by a bank or financial institution can : (a) claim set off against the demand of a bank/financial institution, any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable by him from such bank/financial institution; and (b) set­up by way of counter­claim against the claim of a bank/financial institution, any right or claim in respect of a cause of action accruing to such defendant against the bank/financial institution, either before or after filing of the application, but before the defendant has delivered his defence or before the time for delivering the defence has expired, whether such a counter claim is in the nature of a claim for damages or not. what is significant is that sections 17 and 18 have not been amended. jurisdiction has not been conferred on the tribunal, even after amendment, to try independent suits or proceedings initiated by borrowers or others against banks/financial institutions, nor the jurisdiction of civil courts barred in regard to such suits or proceedings. the only change that has been made is to enable defendants to claim set off or make a counter­claim as provided in sub­sections (6) to (8) of section 19 in applications already filed by the bank or financial institutions for recovery of the amounts due to them. in other words, what is provided and permitted is a cross­action by a defendant in a pending application by the bank/financial institution, the intention being to have the claim of the bank/financial institution made in its application and the c/fa/5349/2019 judgment counter­claim or claim for set off of the defendant, as a single unified proceeding, to be disposed of by a common order. 17. making a counter claim in the bank's application before the tribunal is not the only remedy, but an option available to the borrower/defendant. he can also file a separate suit or proceeding before a civil court or other appropriate forum in respect of his claim against the bank and pursue the same. even the bank, in whose application the counter­claim is made, has the option to apply to the tribunal to exclude the counter­claim of the defendant while considering its application. when such application is made by the bank, the tribunal may either refuse to exclude the counter­claim and proceed to consider the bank's application and the counter­claim together; or exclude the counter­ claim as prayed, and proceed only with the bank's application, in which event the counter­claim becomes an independent claim against a bank/financial institution. the defendant will then have to approach the civil court in respect of such excluded counter claim as the tribunal does not have jurisdiction to try any independent claim against a bank/financial institution. a defendant in an application, having an independent claim against the bank, cannot be compelled to make his claim against the bank only by way of a counter­claim. nor can his claim by way of independent suit in a court having jurisdiction, be transferred to a tribunal against his wishes. 18. in this case, the first respondent does not wish his case to be transferred to the tribunal. it is, therefore, clear that the suit filed by the first respondent against the bank in the high court for recovery of damages, being an independent suit, and not a counter­claim made in the application filed by the bank, the bank's application for transfer of the said suit to the tribunal was misconceived and not maintainable. the high court, where the suit for damages was filed by the company against the bank, long prior to the bank filing an application before the tribunal against the company, continues to have jurisdiction in regard to the suit and its jurisdiction is not excluded or barred under section 18 or any other provision of debts recovery act. 40. in the aforesaid context, we may also refer to and rely upon the observations made by the supreme court in paragraph­51 of nahar industrial enterprises [supra]. indian bank [supra] has been referred to in paragraph­51 of nahar industrial enterprises ltd. paragraph­51 reads thus:­ 51. purporting to distinguish the decision in indian bank (supra), c/fa/5349/2019 judgment it was held that as the claim of the company in the suit could have been maintained as a counter claim in the application of the bank, there was no warrant for curtailing the power of the court to order joint trial by introducing a restriction to the effect that it could be ordered only if there was consent by both the parties, holding: \"8. their lordships have held that the subject matter of the suit and the proceeding before the tribunal were in no way connected, but it appears to us that the two litigations arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions between the bank and the company. even if, as observed by their lordships, a counter claim in the application by the bank before the tribunal was not the only remedy available to the company but an option was available to the company to sue, and the company has exercised that option by filing a suit, it does not in any manner affect the power of the court to order a joint trial of the application and the suit in the debt recovery tribunal provided the debt recovery tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain the action of the company. what is relevant to note is that the claim of the company in the suit could have been maintained as a counter­claim in the application of the bank, even if it did not arise out of the same cause of action. there is no warrant for curtailing the power of the court to order joint trial by introducing a restriction to the effect that a joint trial can be ordered only if there was consent by both sides. the power inherent in the court on well accepted principles to order a joint trial, does not depend upon the volition of the parties but it depends upon the convenience of trial, saving of time and expenses and the avoidance of duplicating at least a part of the evidence leading to saving of time and money.\" 41. it appears from the impugned order that the commercial court has placed reliance on the observations made by the delhi high court in paragraph­38 of cofex exports ltd. paragraph­38 reads thus:­ 38. there is a remedy for every wrong. every legal claim or right must be enforced. however, nobody has a right to have his claim being tried by a particular forum there is nothing wrong if the claims and cross claims whether by way of set­off or by way of counter claim allegedly existing between a person and a bank or financial institution are left to be enforced before two different for a ­ before debt recovery tribunal by bank or financial institution and before civil court by any person other than the two. the person at whose instance the cross suit was filed or the cross claim, counter­claim or plea of set­off was preferred cannot complain of prejudice inasmuch as he can always approach the civil court for decree in respect of the claims forming c/fa/5349/2019 judgment subject matter of set­off or counter claims. the law has provided separate forums for the adjudication of claims by banks and financial institutions and by persons other than these. each has a right to invoke the jurisdiction of the forum meant for it and each forum shall try the claim within its jurisdictional competence. finality shall attach to the findings arrived at and reached by each of the two within its respective jurisdictional competence.issues heard and decided by the tribunal shall operate as res judicata and shall bind the parties in the suit before the civil court by virtue of explanation viii to s. 11 civil procedure code . however, the civil court shall be free to decide such issues as lie within its jurisdictional competence. if the civil court must decide an issue seized by it and within its competence and if there be an unavoidable conflict between the findings recorded by the civil court and by the tribunal, the finding of civil court would obviously override and supersede the findings recorded by the tribunal for a court is a court and tribunal is a tribunal; the former adjudicates on trial, the later holds only a summary inquiry guided by principles of natural justice as the act provides. 42. we fail to understand on what basis the plaint could have been rejected by relying on the observations referred to above. it is an error apparent on the part of the commercial court to have relied upon such observations without understanding the true purport of the same. 43. we sum up our final conclusion on the aforesaid issues as under:­ (i) civil court's jurisdiction to entertain a declaratory suit is not barred as the drt is not authorized to issue any declaration relating to title of the parties etc. drt' s jurisdiction is restricted only to issuance of certificate. (ii) civil court's jurisdiction to entertain a civil suit is not barred when complicated questions or disputed facts are involved in the lis which is required to be resolved by elaborate trial on evidence. (iii) civil court's jurisdiction to entertain a suit is not barred when ultimate decision is to be taken on the allegations of fraud and c/fa/5349/2019 judgment misrepresentation. (iv) civil court's jurisdiction to entertain any suit filed before the bank takes any step for recovery of its dues by following the provisions of the debt recovery act or the sarfaesi act, is not barred. (v) civil court's jurisdiction to entertain any suit in the nature of set off or counter­claim is also not barred, particularly when any of the actions of the bank to recover its dues as per the sarfaesi act is not challenged in the suit. (vi) it is well settled that plaint should be rejected only when the requirement as contemplated under order 7 rule 11 cpc is pleaded and proved. such pleading in support of the application filed under order 7 rule 11 cpc raising any of the grounds set out therein, should straightaway pinpoint to the relevant averments made in the plaint supporting the claim of the defendant made in his application under order 7 rule 11 cpc. in other words, the plaint averments on the face of it, must show that the case of the party who files an application under order 7 rule 11 cpc is made out. on the other hand, if the grounds raised by the party in his application under order 7 rule 11 cpc require further enquiry or probing of the matter, which otherwise is not possible without conducting a trial, the plaint cannot be rejected simply based on the allegation made by the party who filed the said application. it is needless to say that rejection of the plaint is an extreme step in a suit proceedings, since such rejection amounts to dismissal of the suit even before considering the claim of the plaintiff by conducting trial. it is also to be noted that such application can be filed by the defendant even before filing the written statement or at any time thereafter. therefore, such exercise of considering the application under order 7 rule 11 cpc should be done by the trial court with c/fa/5349/2019 judgment utmost care and caution, since the right of a party to have a full­ fledged trial cannot be denied at the threshold by rejecting the plaint based on the averments contained in the application alone, unless the grounds raised in such application are also justified through a plain reading of the plaint itself. 44. in the overall view of the matter, we are convinced that the plaint could not have been rejected either on the ground of res­judicata or on the ground of suit being barred by the provisions of sections­17 and 18 respectively of the act, 1993. 45. in the result, this appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. the impugned judgment and decree passed by the commercial court dated dated 04/07/2018 below exh.22 in the commercial suit no.10 of 2018 is hereby quashed and set aside. the commercial suit no.10 of 2018 is ordered to be restored to the commercial court, city civil court, ahmedabad. decree shall be drawn accordingly.
