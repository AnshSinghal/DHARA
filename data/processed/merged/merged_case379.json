Parties are referred to hereunder as arrayed before the Commercial Court in COP Nos. 19 and 18 of 2022 on the file of the Court of Principal Special Court in the Cadre of District Judge for Trial and Disposal of Commercial Disputes at Hyderabad. \n3. Petitioner and respondent entered into Multi Annual Agreement (for short, 'MAA') on 4.5.2011 for the purpose of purchase and supply of Wind Turbine Generators for the total capacity of 2000 MW during the term from 2011 to 2016. Said MAA provided for committed Minimum volume of 1635 in Megawatts which was mandatorily to be off taken by the respondent for each delivery year commencing from 2011 till 2016 and supplied by the petitioner. MAA provided that in the event of failure of either party to comply with their mandatory obligations, the breaching party is liable to pay liquidated damages to other party. Compliance of MAA required petitioner to incur substantial investments towards PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 establishment of factory, cost of raw material, plant and machinery, changes in the inventories, financing costs, warehousing costs etc.\n4. According to petitioner, soon after first purchase order was placed by the respondent for delivery in 2011, respondent continued defaulting on its commitments to off take annual volume of WTGS. According to petitioner even the first purchase order was defective and falling short of requirements. Having regard to the defaults committed by the respondent, petitioner issued demand letters claiming liquidated damages. As issue was not resolved in spite of several efforts made, petitioner invoked the arbitration clause as provided in MAA by raising two independent arbitration claims for liquidated damages covering the period from 2011-2014 and 2015 respectively. Arbitral Tribunal comprised of Hon'ble Justice M Jagannatha Rao, Retired Judge Supreme Court of India as Presiding Arbitrator, Mr. Justice Balasubramaniah, Retired Judge, Madras High Court and Mr Justice C.V.Ramulu Retired Judge, High Court of Andhra Pradesh as Co-Arbitrators. The Arbitral Tribunal passed final arbitral awards on 15.7.2021 in dispute Nos.1 and 2 separately covering two separate periods, viz., years 2011-2014 and 2015. In Arbitration Case No.1 of 2018 the Arbitral Tribunal awarded 295,44,94,116/- that include interest component @ 9% per annum from 31.3.2018 to 15.7.2021, after adjusting the counter-claim. The PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 Arbitral Tribunal also directed return of two bank guarantees and two corporate guarantees. \n5. In Arbitration Case No.2 of 2018 the Arbitral Tribunal awarded liquidated damages and interest of 141,57,13,562/- up to 15.7.2021. The Tribunal further granted interest @ 6 % from 15.7.2021. The further claim of petitioner for 438,26,79,452/- and counter claim of 129,58,94,884/- was rejected. \n6. After passing of the awards, petitioner filed C.O.P.No.18 of 2022 (subject matter of COMCA No.7 of 2023) and C.O.P.No.19 of 2022 (subject matter of COMCA No.6 of 2023) on the file of the Court of Principal Special Court in the Cadre of District Judge for Trial and Disposal of Commercial Disputes at Hyderabad under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,1996 ( Act,1996). 7.1. In C.O.P.No.19 of 2022 petitioner prayed to grant the following reliefs:\n\"It is, therefore, most humbly and respectfully prayed that in view of the above facts and circumstances the Hon'ble Court be pleased to:\na) Direct the Respondent to deposit a sum of INR 141,57,13,562/ (Indian Rupees One Hundred Forty-One Crore Fifty-Seven Lakhs Thirteen Thousand Five Hundred Sixty-Two only) along with applicable interest @6% from the date of Arbitral Award till its realisation before this Hon'ble Court, until the execution of the Arbitral Award or the Award is set-aside by the Hon'ble Court under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996;\nb) In the alternative, direct the Respondent to furnish security in the form of Bank Guarantees or cash deposits before this Hon'ble Court, to PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 the extent of IN 141.57,13,562/- (Indian Rupees One Hundred Forty-One Crore Fifty-Seven Lakhs Thirteen Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Two only) along with applicable interest @6% from the date of Arbitral Award till its realisation; and c) Restrain the Respondent from alienating, transferring, mortgaging, encumbering, or creating any kind of third-party rights or interests of whatsoever nature on their assets belonging to the Respondent Company or its subsidiary companies, until the execution of the Arbitral Award or the Award is set-aside by the Hon'ble Court under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996;\nd) Direct the Respondent to declare all its immovable and movable assets including the assets which are free from any charge, mortgage, pledge, or any form of encumbrance or third-party rights;\ne) In the event the Respondent fails to either furnish Bank Guarantee or cash deposit before this Hon'ble Court to the extent of amount as awarded by the Arbitral Award, this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to attach the assets and properties of the Respondent particularly their operational renewable power projects (i.e. inclusive of Wind Turbine Generators, Solar Power Plants/Projectsinstalled and/or commissioned at various project sites across India), which are directlyand indirectly owned, controlled and operated by the Respondent, to the equivalent sum of the claims as allowed in the Arbitral Award;Grant ad-interim status quo order restraining the Respondent from proceeding further with the alienation, disposing of, encumbering or creating any kind of third-party rights or interests of whatsoever nature on their assets belonging to the Respondent Company, till the disposal of the present Petition; and f) Pass any other Order(s) or direction (s) which this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper to secure the amount mentioned in the Arbitral Award and all the claims of the Petitioner and in the facts and circumstances of the present case.\" \n7.2. In C.O.P.No.18 of 2022 petitioner prayed to grant the following reliefs:\n\"It is, therefore, most humbly and respectfully prayed that in view of the above. facts and circumstances the Hon'ble Court be pleased to:\na) Direct the Respondent to deposit a sum of IN 295,44,94,116/-(Indian Rupees Two Hundred Ninety-Five Crore Forty-Four Lakhs Ninety-Four Thousand One Hundred and Sixteen only) along with applicable interest @6% from the date of Arbitral Award till its realisation before this Hon'ble Court, until the execution of the Arbitral Award or the Award is set-aside PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 by the Hon'ble Court under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996;\nb) In the alternative, direct the Respondent to furnish security in the form of Bank Guarantees or cash deposits before this Hon'ble Court, to the extent of INR 295,44,94,116/- (Indian Rupees Two Hundred Ninety- Five Crore Forty-Four Lakhs Ninety-Four Thousand One Hundred and Sixteen only) along with applicable interest @6% from the date of Arbitral Award till its realisation; and c) Restrain the Respondent from alienating, transferring, mortgaging, encumbering, or creating any kind of third-party rights or interests of whatsoever nature on their assets belonging to the Respondent Company or its subsidiary companies, until the execution of the Arbitral Award or the Award is set-aside by the Hon'ble Court under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996;\nd) Direct the Respondent to declare all its immovable and movable assets including the assets which are free from any charge, mortgage, pledge, or any form of encumbrance or third-party rights;\ne) In the event the Respondent fails to either furnish Bank Guarantee or cash deposit before this Hon'ble Court to the extent of amount as awarded by the Arbitral Award, this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to attach the assets and properties of the Respondent particularly their operational renewable power projects (i.e. inclusive of Wind Turbinecommissioned at various project sites across India), which are directly and indirectly owned, controlled and operated by the Respondent, to the equivalent sum of the claims as allowed in the Arbitral Award;\nf) Pass an order directing the Respondent to return the Bank Guarantee and Corporate Guarantee to the Petitioner;\ng) Grant ad-interim status quo order restraining the Respondent from proceeding further with the alienation, disposing of, encumbering or creating any kind of third-party rights or interests of whatsoever nature on their assets belonging to the Respondent Company, till the disposal of the present Petition;\nh) Pass an order restraining the Respondent from invoking the Bank Guarantee and Corporate Guarantee during the pendency of the present Petition;\ni) Pass any other Order(s) or direction (s) which this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper to secure the amount mentioned in the Arbitral Award and all the claims of the Petitioner and in the facts and circumstances of the present case.\" \nPNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 8. On due consideration of the respective submissions, by elaborate order, the Commercial Court partly allowed the petitions. In C.O.P.No.19 of 2022 the Commercial Court directed to declare all its movable and immovable assets including the assets which are free from any charge, mortgage, pledge or any form of encumbrance or third party rights and to return the bank guarantee and the corporate guarantees given by the petitioner within 30 days from the date of order. In C.O.P.No.18 of 2022, the Commercial Court directed to declare all its movable and immovable assets including the assets which are free from any charge, mortgage, pledge or any form of encumbrance or third party rights and to return the bank guarantee and the corporate guarantees given by the petitioner within 30 days from the date of order. \n9. The legality and validity of the orders passed by the Commercial Court in COP Nos.19 and 18 of 2022 respectively are challenged in these Appeals. \n10. The learned senior counsel Sri D.Prakash Reddy appearing for respondent contended that the Commercial Court grossly erred in passing orders impugned in these appeals. In Section 9 application, remedy is available only till the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal is executable and once award is executable the person in whose favour award is passed has to seek enforcement of the award under Section 36 PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 of the Act by following the procedure laid down in Civil Procedure Code. This fact was not appreciated by the learned Commercial Court and grossly erred in granting the relief. According to learned senior counsel, the Commercial Court has no jurisdiction and competence to pass such orders. By referring to the relief granted in C.O.P.No.19 of 2022 directing the respondent to return the bank guarantee, he would submit that this clearly shows non application of mind by the commercial Court. The relief is granted in excess of the reliefs prayed and therefore the said order suffers from jurisdictional error. He would therefore submit that the orders under challenge are liable to be set aside. \n11. Per contra, according to Sri Trideep Pais, learned counsel for respondent, scope of Section 9 application is very wide and it co-exists vis--vis the execution proceedings under Section 36 of the Act. He would submit that merely because award is executable does not take away the application of section 9 at the instance of the decree holder. He would submit that what was available to the decree holder prior to amendment of Section 36 of the Act, cannot take away by virtue of amendment and decree holder cannot be put to a worse position than what was available then. He would submit that according to Section 9 post award also interlocutory reliefs can be sought by the decree holder till award is enforced. The principle of law is well settled and needs no PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 reiteration. He would therefore submit that trial Court rightly passed orders granting limited reliefs to the petitioner. 11.1. Regarding Bank Guarantees, he would submit that the bank guarantees have lapsed long ago, therefore they cannot be encashed, but since respondent has not returned the bank guarantees, the petitioner's bankers have kept the accounts as running accounts and penal interest is charged on these accounts causing lot of hardship and suffering to the petitioner. Further, since bank guarantees are not closed, the entitlement of the petitioner to secure further Bank Guarantees/advances is severally affected, therefore keeping the bank guarantees by the Respondent is causing grave prejudice and irreparable hardship to the petitioner. \n11.2. He would submit that taking recourse to the provisions of Civil Procedure Code for enforcement of the awards is a long drawn process, having regard to the procedural compliances required to be observed. The remedy provided by Section 9 of the Act enables preservation of concerned assets pending consideration of the applications under Section 34 and pending enforcement of the decree by taking recourse to Section 36 of the Act. Further, petitioner does not have the information regarding assets and liabilities of the respondent and unless such information is made available it is difficult to enforce the awards. Though PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 petitioner sought larger reliefs only limited reliefs are granted by the Court below and unless such measures are enforced, there is every possibility of the respondent alienating the properties frustrating the fruits of the awards obtained by the petitioner. Therefore, such measures are required to safeguard the interest of the decree holder. Further, the longer bank guarantees are kept by the respondent, more hardship being caused to petitioner and he cannot be compelled to wait till the execution of decrees under Section 36. He would submit that there is no overlapping of the provisions in Section 36 vis-a-vis Section 9 of the Act. \n11.3. In support of his contention, learned counsel placed reliance on following decisions:\ni) Essar House Private Limited vs. Arcellor Mittal Nippon Steel India Limited1;\nii) Dirk India Private Limited vs. Maharashtra State Electricity Generation company Limited2;\niii) Wind World (India) Ltd., vs. Enercon GmbH and others3;\niv) A.Ashraf vs. Kasim V.K.,4;\nv) Mahco Monsanto Biotech (India) Pvt. Ltd., vs. Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd.,5;\nvi) M/s.Samson Maritime Limited vs. M/s. Hardy exploration & Production (India) Inc.,6 2022 SCC Online SC 1219 2013 SCC Online Bom 481 2017 SCC Online Bom 1147 2018 SCC Online Ker 4913 2019 SCC Online Bom 9852 PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 vii) Project Director, National Highways No.45E and 220, National Highways Authority of India vs. M.Hakeem and another7 12 . In reply, learned senior counsel Sri D.Prakash Reddy would contend that since main relief was not granted, it was not permissible for the Commercial Court to grant ancillary relief. Petitioner has not come in appeal against refusal to grant main relief. As respondent to these appeals, petitioner cannot seek to expand the scope of order passed by the Commercial Court as Commercial Court only granted two reliefs which are ancillary but refused to grant principal reliefs, petitioner has no say in the matter. \n13. The issue for consideration is whether the Decree holder can take recourse to Section 98 of the Act, 1996 seeking interlocutory measures 2016 SCC Online Mad 9122 (2021) 9 SCC 1 Section 9 : Interim measures, etc., by Court : \n(1) A party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36, apply to a court-- (i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely:--\n(a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement; (b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration; (c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence; (d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver; (e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the Court to be just and convenient;\nand the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it.\n(2) Where, before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, a Court passes an order for any interim measure of protection under sub-section (1), the arbitral proceedings shall be commenced PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 pending initiation of execution proceedings under Section 369 of the Act, 1996.\n14. From a bare reading of Section 9 of the Act, it is manifest that at 3 stages aggrieved person can take recourse to Section 9 of the Act for seeking interlocutory protection/to grant appropriate measures, before initiation of arbitral proceedings on a dispute inter-parties, during the arbitral proceedings, and after the award is passed.\n15. Section 36 is about enforcement of award. Decree-holder can seek to enforce award after expiry of period to avail remedy under Section 34 by opposite party or though application is filed under Section 34 but the award is not stayed. Enforcement of the award has to be as per Civil within a period of ninety days from the date of such order or within such further time as the Court may determine. \n(3) Once the arbitral tribunal has been constituted, the Court shall not entertain an application under sub-section (1), unless the Court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under section 17 efficacious. \nSection 36 :Enforcement :\n(1) Where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under section 34 has expired, then, subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), such award shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court. \n(2) Where an application to set aside the arbitral award has been filed in the Court under section 34, the filing of such an application shall not by itself render that award unenforceable, unless the Court grants an order of stay of the operation of the said arbitral award in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3), on a separate application made for that purpose. \n(3) Upon filing of an application under sub-section (2) for stay of the operation of the arbitral award, the Court may, subject to such conditions as it may deem fit, grant stay of the operation of such award for reasons to be recorded in writing:\nProvided that the Court shall, while considering the application for grant of stay in the case of an arbitral award for payment of money, have due regard to the provisions for grant of stay of a money decree under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. \nPNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 Procedure Code that requires observing lengthy procedure and may consume good amount of time. Section 36 does not envisage interim measures pending enforcement of the award. Having obtained award, it is the right of the decree-holder to ensure that fruits of his success are not frustrated by actions/conduct of the opposite party, by resorting to disposal of assets or creating third party interests or moving away movables from the jurisdictional limits of cause of action and, as in this case, there is no clarity on assets and liabilities of the respondent. \nTherefore, a decree-holder can seek interim measures to preserve the assets, movable or immovable, to secure information on assets and liabilities and seek other measures so that the decree secured by him is not frustrated.\n16. Section 9 of the Act is wide in its scope and application and steps in to aid the decree-holder. The decree-holder can take recourse to Section 9 seeking interim measures to safeguard his interest till the award is enforced under Section 36 of the Act. It is step in aid to enforce the award. On cumulative reading of Sections 9 and 36 of the Act, it is apparent that there is no conflict in these two provisions. They compliment each other. \nPNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 17. The scope of Section 9 and its enforceability is no more res integra. In Dirk India (P) Ltd. v. Dirk India (P) Ltd.,10, Division Bench of Bombay High Court, presided by Hon'ble Dr. Justice D.Y.Chandrachud, as a judge of Bombay High Court, as he then was, has analysed in depth scope of Section 9 and other provisions of Act, 1996. The Division Bench held as under:\n\"14. Two facets of Section 9 merit emphasis. The first relates to the nature of the orders that can be passed under clauses (i) and (ii). Clause (i) contemplates an order appointing a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings. Clause (ii) contemplates an interim measure of protection for : (a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement; (b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration; and (c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration; (d) an interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver;\nand (e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the Court to be just and convenient. The underlying theme of each one of the sub-clauses of clause (ii) is the immediate and proximate nexus between the interim measure of protection and the preservation, protection and securing of the subject-matter of the dispute in the arbitral proceedings. In other words, the orders that are contemplated under clause (ii) are regarded as interim measures of protection intended to protect the claim in arbitration from being frustrated. The interim measure is intended to safeguard the subject-matter of the dispute in the course of the arbitral proceedings. The second facet of Section 9 is the proximate nexus between the orders that are sought and the arbitral proceedings. When an interim measure of protection is sought before or during arbitral proceedings, such a measure is a step in aid to the fruition of the arbitral proceedings. When sought after an arbitral award is made but before it is enforced, the measure of protection is intended to safeguard the fruit of the proceedings until the eventual enforcement of the award. Here again the measure of protection is a step in aid of enforcement. It is intended to ensure that enforcement of the award results in a realisable claim and that the award is not rendered illusory by dealings that would put the subject of the award beyond the pale of enforcement. Now it is in this background that it is necessary for the Court to impart a purposive interpretation to the meaning of the expression \"at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36\". Under Section 36, an arbitral award can be enforced under the Code of Civil Procedure in the same manner as if it were a decree of the Court. The arbitral award can be enforced where the time for making 2013 SCC Online Bom 481 PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 an application to set aside the arbitral award under Section 34 has expired or in the event of such an application having been made, it has been refused. The enforcement of an award enures to the benefit of the party who has secured an award in the arbitral proceedings. That is why the enforceability of an award under Section 36 is juxtaposed in the context of two time frames, the first being where an application for setting aside an arbitral award has expired and the second where an application for setting aside an arbitral award was made but was refused. The enforceability of an award, in other words, is defined with reference to the failure of the other side to file an application for setting aside the award within the stipulated time limit or having filed such an application has failed to establish a case for setting aside the arbitral award. Once a challenge to the arbitral award has either failed under Section 34 having been made within the stipulated period or when no application for setting aside the arbitral award has been made within time, the arbitral award becomes enforceable at the behest of the party for whose benefit the award enures. Contextually, therefore, the scheme of Section 9 postulates an application for the grant of an interim measure of protection after the making of an arbitral award and before it is enforced for the benefit of the party which seeks enforcement of the award. An interim measure of protection within the meaning of Section 9(ii) is intended to protect through the measure, the fruits of a successful conclusion of the arbitral proceedings. A party whose claim has been rejected in the course of the arbitral proceedings cannot obviously have an arbitral award enforced in accordance with Section 36. The object and purpose of an interim measure after the passing of the arbitral award but before it is enforced is to secure the property, goods or amount for the benefit of the party which seeks enforcement.\" (emphasis supplied) 17.1 . In Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) Pvt. Ltd. (supra), learned single Judge of Bombay High Court observed that it is for the Court to protect the decreetal amount of the petitioner, and more so considering the apprehensions of the petitioner from the material on record. According to learned single Judge, provisions of Section 9 entitle a party who is beneficiary to an award to approach the Court and seek interim measures so that the fruits of the award/decree are available to the party in execution of the award/decree and that the award is not rendered illusion or mere paper decree (paragraph 19). \nPNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 17.2. In Samson Maritime Limited (supra), learned single Judge of the Madras High Court observed that exercise of power under Section 9 after passing of an award cannot be construed as enforcement of award in any manner. That enforcement is a different action from the action of securing or protecting for effecting such enforcement. Learned single Judge observed that the decree holder has a right, is entitled to seek protection of his right so that there cannot be a delay in execution of award causing further hardship if respondent takes such action to frustrate or delay the execution of the award.\n17.3. The Division Bench of Kerala High Court in M.Ashraf (supra) observed that the Court has to adopt a liberal approach when interim relief is sought after an arbitral award is made but before it is enforced. The measure of protection is intended to safeguard the subject matter of dispute or the fruits of the proceedings till the enforcement of the award. Interim measure of protection, then sought, is a step in aid of enforcement of the award. It is intended to ensure that the award is not rendered illusory by the opposite party. (paragraph 12) 17.4. In Essar House Private Limited (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court had an occasion to consider scope of Section 9 of the Act. On detailed analysis of various provisions of the Act, view taken by several High courts, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:\nPNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 \"41. Section 9 of the Arbitration Act provides that a party may apply to a Court for an interim measure or protection inter alia to (i) secure the amount in dispute in the arbitration; or (ii) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the Court to be just and convenient, and the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it.\n42. As argued by Mr. Kaul, besides the specific power of securing the amount in dispute, the Courts have been empowered to pass any interim measure of protection, keeping in view the purpose of the proceedings before it. The said provision confers a residuary power on the Court to pass such other interim measures of protection as may appear to be just and convenient. \n43. Many High Courts have also proceeded on the principle that the powers of a Court under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act are wider than the powers under the provisions of the CPC. \n...... \n48. Section 9 of the Arbitration Act confers wide power on the Court to pass orders securing the amount in dispute in arbitration, whether before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, during the arbitral proceedings or at any time after making of the arbitral award, but before its enforcement in accordance with Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. All that the Court is required to see is, whether the applicant for interim measure has a good prima facie case, whether the balance of convenience is in favour of interim relief as prayed for being granted and whether the applicant has approached the court with reasonable expedition. \n49. If a strong prima facie case is made out and the balance of convenience is in favour of interim relief being granted, the Court exercising power under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act should not withhold relief on the mere technicality of absence of averments, incorporating the grounds for attachment before judgment under Order 38 Rule 5 of the CPC. \n50. Proof of actual attempts to deal with, remove or dispose of the property with a view to defeat or delay the realisation of an impending Arbitral Award is not imperative for grant of relief under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act. A strong possibility of diminution of assets would suffice. To assess the balance of convenience, the Court is required to examine and weigh the consequences of refusal of interim relief to the applicant for interim relief in case of success in the proceedings, against the consequence of grant of the interim relief to the opponent in case the proceedings should ultimately fail.\" \n17.5. From the decisions referred to above, it is beyond pale of doubt that section 9 vests residuary power in the Court to pass interim measures of protection as may appear to be just and equitable and PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 particularly to safeguard the interests of the decree holder. We are in respectful agreement with the views expressed by Hon'ble Bombay High Court, High Court of Madras and High Court of Kerala. \n18. Having regard to the legal position as it stands now, it is necessary to look into the pleadings of the petitioners in the C.O.Ps filed under Section 9 of the Act, 1996. \n19. In paragraph-13 of the application, petitioner states that he apprehends that during Covid-19 Pandemic party respondents were pursuing actions that might completely render the Arbitral awards a mere paper decrees and entire arbitral proceedings a fruitless endeavour of petitioner. In paragraph-14, it is stated that his apprehension ensue from various internal reports and information available with the industry sources/news paper reports that respondents are vigorously attempting to sell its unencumbered operational assets and for that purpose hired third party to look for a buyer. According to petitioner reports would also suggest that respondent tried and offered to sell its entire Clean Energy portfolio and is again trying to sell it in parts. It is further contended that reports further state that they have identified some of the buyers and they have allegedly signed non disclosure agreement and were to submit their bids in September, 2021. The information available in the news paper reports were annexed to the applications. In paragraph 15, it PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 is further contended that verification of financial statements of the respondents would clearly raise grave concern on respondent's capabilities to comply with the award. According to petitioner the last filing of the annual balance sheet was of the year 2019-2020 and thereafter no balance sheet or profit and loss statements were filed by the respondents and the last balance sheet of financial year 2019-2020 would show that respondent's profits were on constant decline. \nPetitioner further apprehends that with a motive to deprive the fruits of the award respondent might sell its clean power assets, especially, assets which are unencumbered. It is further contended that respondent's assets are charged in favour of the lenders/ parties but petitioner was unable to ascertain the exact liability of the respondent to determine the extent of charges created by the respondent from the master data as obtained from the website of Ministry of Corporate Affairs and that it is not discernable from the website of Ministry of Corporate Affairs as to the unencumbered assets of the respondent as on date. Having regard to these pleadings, petitioner prayed for the reliefs, extracted above. \n20. In substance, petitioner sought for depositing of amount awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal and in the alternative to direct the respondent to furnish security in the form of bank guarantee or cash deposits for the amount awarded by the arbitrators with interest. Petitioner also prayed to restrain the Respondent from alienating, transferring, mortgaging, PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 encumbering, or creating any kind of third-party rights or interests of whatsoever nature on their assets belonging to the Respondent Company or its subsidiary companies, until the execution of the Arbitral Award or the Award is set-aside in an application under Section 34 of the Act. In paragraph 'D' of the prayer, petitioner prayed to direct the respondent to declare all its immovable and movable assets including the assets which are free from any charge, mortgage, pledge, or any form of encumbrance or third-party rights. \n21. Though, comprehensive reliefs were sought with the apprehension expressed in the applications filed by the petitioner and the status of assets and liabilities of respondent are not available in public domain, the Commercial Court had only directed the respondent to declare all its movable and immovable assets including the assets which are free from any charge, mortgage, pledge or any form of encumbrance or third party rights and to return the bank guarantees. \n22. The Arbitral Tribunal passed two awards in two disputes cumulatively awarding 440 crores. So far said amount is not paid by the respondent. Respondent has filed applications under Section 34 of the Act challenging the awards, but no interlocutory orders are granted in his favour. Since no interlocutory orders are granted by the Commercial Court, the awards passed by the Arbitral Tribunal are enforceable. To seek enforcement of the awards, petitioner has to know PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 the assets and liabilities of the respondent as same are not in the public domain. Therefore, petitioner also sought a direction to the respondents to declare movable and immovable assets including the assets which are free from any charge, mortgage or in the form of encumbrance or third party rights. Unless this information is available to the petitioner, he will not be able to enforce the awards. \n23. As no stay is granted in Section 34 applications, the awards are enforceable but they are not enforced so far. In order to seek enforcement of the awards, the measures sought by the petitioner are valid and legal. As noticed from the precedent decisions, in an application filed under Section 9 after the awards were passed by the Arbitral Tribunal and before enforcement of the awards, it is permissible for the Commercial Court to pass appropriate orders to protect the interest of the decree-holder and to ensure that the decree-holder enjoys the fruits of the Arbitral award. Since the information on the assets and liabilities are not in the public domain and not available with the petitioner, apprehension expressed by the petitioner for possible liquidation of the assets and difficulty in enforcing the awards is a genuine concern in the facts of this case. The petitioner has made out a strong prima facie case to grant orders under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 post award. \nPNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 24. It is to be noticed that in COP No.19 of 2022 petitioner has not prayed for return of the bank guarantees as they were not falling for consideration before the Arbitral Tribunal. However, it is to be noted that the two arbitral claims arise out of MAA dated 04-05-2011 praying to grant liquidated damages for two periods, 2011-2014 and 2015. At the time of entering into agreement, the petitioner has submitted bank guarantees. Though petitioner has not sought return of bank guarantees in COP No.19 of 2022 and sought such relief in COP No.18 of 2022, merely on this ground the order cannot be nullified when we are convinced that the Commercial Court has rightly exercised its discretion and at any rate bank guarantees have to be returned. Except this minor lapse, the Commercial Court considered all aspects and on due appreciation of facts and contentions urged by both parties passed orders impugned herein. In the circumstances, we do not see any error committed by the Commercial Court in granting reliefs in C.O.P.Nos.19 and 18 of 2022 respectively. Both Appeals are dismissed. No order as to costs. Pending miscellaneous applications if any shall stand closed. \n_________________________ P.NAVEEN RAO, J ___________________________ NAGESH BHEEMAPAKA,J Date: 21.04.2023 TVK/KKM PNR,J & NBK,J COMCA Nos.6 & 7 of 2023 HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE P.NAVEEN RAO & HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE NAGESH BHEEMAPAKA COMMERCIAL COURT APPEAL NOS. 6 & 7 OF 2023 Date: 21.04.2023 Tvk/kkm",

[2.0] feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order dated 05.12.2016 passed by the learned judge, commercial court, vadodara (hereinafter referred to as \"commercial court, vadodara\") below exh.1 in commercial civil suit no.288/2016, by which the commercial court, vadodara has dismissed the said suit on the finding recorded by the commercial court, vadodara while disposing of the application exh.5 that the commercial court, vadodara has no territorial jurisdiction, the original plaintiff has preferred the present first appeal no.2897/2016. [2.1] feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order dated 05.12.2016 passed below exh.5 in commercial civil suit no.288/2016, by which the commercial court, vadodara has dismissed the said application exh.5 solely and mainly on the ground that the commercial court, vadodara has no territorial jurisdiction, the original plaintiff has preferred the present appeal from order. [3.0] for the sake of convenience, facts in appeal from order arising out of the order passed below exh.5 are narrated and considered, which in nut­shell are as under: [3.1] that the original plaintiff is a company registered under the companies act, 1956 and is engaged in the business of manufacturing of hc-nic page 2 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 thermostats and thermoplastic lined equipment and pipe and fittings. that the original defendant no.1 is a company incorporated under the laws of republic of indonesia and is engaged in the manufacturing of pulp paper and tissue paper. the original defendant no.2 is a public sector bank. [3.2] it appears that original defendant no.1 was desirous of building a pulp mill in ogan komering llir, south sumatra, republic of indonesia. that for the said the original defendant no.1 decided to secure services of the plaintiff and awarded a contract for the supervision and installation of the said material to the original plaintiff. that two contracts were executed between original plaintiff and the original defendant no.1 on 10.07.2015, viz. the supply contract and the installation contract. both the contracts were amended vide amendment agreement no.1 dated 14.09.2016 respectively. it appears that as per clause 4.2 of the supply contract amendment agreement no.1, the original plaintiff was supposed to issue a bank guarantee upon the original defendant no.1 for a sum of 10% of the due price of the balance equal to usd 6,92,58,390. that in an irrevocable and unconditional bank guarantee bearing no.074915 fgper0002 was issued by the original defendant no.2 bank to the original defendant no.1 for sum of usd 6,92,58,390 towards the performance of the supply contract and the supply contract amendment agreement no.1. it appears that the supply contract was further amended vide amendment agreement no.2 dated 10.11.2015. the scope of the supply was increased and the aggregate value of the supply contract subsequently amounted to usd 83,24,132. that the installation contract was further amended vide amendment agreement no.2 dated 10.11.2015. pursuant to clause 4.1 of the supply contract of amendment agreement no.2, the bank guarantee was to be increased by 10% of the additional goods hc-nic page 3 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 amounting to usd 1,39,82,930. that bank guarantee was amended and the value of the original bank guarantee was increased from usd 6,92,58,390 for 10% of the total value of the supply contract including the amendment agreements. dispute arose between the parties. that thereafter the original defendant no.1 issued letter to the original defendant no.2 bank invoking bank guarantee and directing the original defendant no.2 to pay the same usd 8,32,41,320. that thereafter the plaintiff instituted the commercial civil suit no.288/2016 in the commercial court, vadodara seeking the following reliefs. \"(a) this hon'ble court may be pleased to declare that the defendant no.2 has no right whatsoever to invoke the bank guarantee bearing no.074915fgper0002 in favour of the defendant no.1 or acting upon the letter of the defendant no.1 dated 10.10.2016; (b) it may be further declared that the defendant no.2 is under no obligation to honour the bank guarantee bearing no.074915fgper0002 since the plaintiff has completed all its obligations under the supply contract and hence, the bank is discharged of its obligations to honour the bank guarantee. (c) the hon'ble court be pleased to grant an injunction restraining the defendants from acting upon or enforcing the letter dated 10.10.2016 and invoking the bank guarantee bearing no.074915fgper0002; (d) the defendant no.1 be restrained to make any claims under the bank guarantee bearing no.074915fgper0002 and the defendant no.2 be restrained from making payment to the defendant no.1 in furtherance of letted dated 10.10.2016, under the above bank guarantee.\" that in the said suit the original plaintiff also submitted the application exh.5 for interim injunction restraining the original defendant no.2 bank from making any payment to the original defendant no.1, under the bank guarantee in question and also restraining the original defendant no.2 from acting upon the letter dated 10.10.2016. the original plaintiff also prayed for an interim injunction restraining the original defendant no.1 from enforcing the bank hc-nic page 4 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 guarantee in question and from insisting for payment under the bank guarantee in any manner whatsoever. that the said suit and the application exh.5 was instituted on 19.10.2016. that the commercial court, vadodara issued the notice on interim relief making it returnable on 08.11.2016. [3.3] feeling aggrieved in issuing the notice on interim relief only and not granting any ad­interim injunction, the original plaintiff preferred appeal from order before this court being appeal from order no.412/2016. this court initially granted ad­interim injunction as prayed. that the said appeal from order came to be disposed of by this court vide order dated 11.11.2016 directing the commercial court, vadodara to decide the application below exh.5 in time bound manner and directed to continue the ex parte ad­interim injunction granted till the final disposal of the application exh.5. while disposing of the said appeal from order, this court also observed that the continuation of the ad­interim injunction shall be without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the respective parties in the application exh.5 as well as in the main suit and without prejudice to the contentions of the original defendant no.1 that the commercial court, vadodara and/or even any other court in gujarat has no territorial jurisdiction. [3.4] that thereafter the said application exh.5 has been dismissed by the commercial court, vadodara mainly on the ground that in view of the clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement by which both the parties agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the court of singapore, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction over such disputes, the commercial court, vadodara has no territorial jurisdiction. that on the basis of the findings recorded by the learned commercial court while disposing of the application exh.5 and holding that the commercial hc-nic page 5 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 court, vadodara has no territorial jurisdiction, the learned commercial court has passed the order below exh.1 and has dismissed the suit by observing that as observed while disposing of the application exh.5, the commercial court, vadodara has no territorial jurisdiction and therefore, the suit is liable to be dismissed. consequently, the commercial court, vadodara has dismissed the suit for want of territorial jurisdiction. [3.5] feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court below exh.5, the original plaintiff has preferred the appeal from order no.471/2016. [3.6] feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order passed below exh.1 in dismissing the suit, the original plaintiff has preferred the present first appeal no.2897/2016. [4.0] shri r.s. sanjanwala, learned senior advocate has appeared on behalf of the original plaintiff and shri mihir joshi, learned senior advocate has appeared on behalf of the respondent no.1 herein original defendant no.1. [5.0] shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, learned commercial court has materially erred in dismissing application exh.5 and consequently in dismissing the suit on the ground that the commercial court, vadodara would not have territorial jurisdiction. [5.1] it is vehemently submitted by shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that the hc-nic page 6 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 commercial court, vadodara has materially erred in not properly appreciating the fact that the commercial suit before the learned commercial court was for an appropriate injunction with respect to the bank guarantee and more particularly against the defendant no.2. it is submitted that admittedly the defendant no.2 is not a party to any of the agreement / contract between the plaintiff and defendant no.1. it is submitted that therefore qua the relief with respect to bank guarantee against defendant no.2, suit shall still be maintainable before the commercial court, vadodara. [5.2] it is further submitted by shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that merely because the party to the contract / agreement have agreed and chosen the singapore court as appropriate forum, still the commercial court, which can be said to be natural court would still continue to have the jurisdiction. it is submitted that it is not the case that the learned commercial court lacks inherent jurisdiction. [5.3] relying upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of modi entertainment network & anr. vs. w.s.g. cricket pte. ltd. reported in (2003)4 scc 341, it is submitted that as held by the hon'ble supreme court in the said decision, in a case where more than one forums are available, the court in exercise of its discretion to grant anti­suit injunction will examine as to which is the appropriate forum (forum conveniens) having regard to the convenience of the parties and may grant anti­suit injunction in regard to proceedings which are oppressive or vexatious or in a forum non conveniens. it is further submitted by shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that in the aforesaid decision it is further observed by the hon'ble supreme court that with a view to prevent hc-nic page 7 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 injustice in circumstances such as which permit a contracting party to be relieved of the burden of the contract; or since the date of the contract the circumstances or subsequent events have made it impossible for the party seeking injunction to prosecute the case in the court of choice because the essence of the jurisdiction of the court does not exist or because of a vis major or force majeure and the like, the court of natural jurisdiction can grant anti­suit injunction. it is submitted that the aforesaid aspect has not been appreciated by the commercial court, vadodara at all and without focusing on the aforesaid aspect and straightway relying upon and considering clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement the learned commercial court has mechanically held that the commercial court, vadodara shall not have territorial jurisdiction. it is further submitted by shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate that in the present case the commercial court, vadodara has not properly appreciated the fact that as the suit before the learned commercial court was for permanent injunction restraining the defendant no.2 from encashing the bank guarantee in favour of the defendant no.1 and that the defendant no.2 bank is not a party to any of the contract either supply contract or purchase contract, the plaintiff cannot file the suit at the singapore court against the defendant no.2 and therefore, the commercial court, vadodara being natural court would have territorial jurisdiction to decide and grant such a relief against the defendants, more particularly with respect to the bank guarantee. it is further submitted by shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that in the present case neither order vii rule 10 nor order vii rule 11 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as \"cpc\") shall be applicable. it is submitted that as such in the present case commercial court, vadodara has not exercised the power under order vii rule 11 of the cpc. it is submitted that in the present case order vii rule 10 of the hc-nic page 8 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 cpc also shall not be applicable as it cannot be said that the commercial court, vadodara being a natural court would lack inherent jurisdiction. it is submitted that as held by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of modi entertainment network & anr. (supra), in an exceptional case being made out, despite the ouster clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement, the suit shall still be maintainable before the natural court. it is submitted that therefore order vii rule 10 of the cpc shall not be applicable at all. relying upon para 26 of the decision in the case of modi entertainment network & anr. (supra), it is submitted that if all the parties to the suit are not party to the agreement having ouster clause, the suit before the court of natural jurisdiction will still be maintainable. [5.4] shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has vehemently submitted that as the suit was for permanent injunction with respect to the bank guarantee and the original defendant no.2 is not a party to the agreement / contract containing the ouster clause, the suit against the defendant no.2 shall still be maintainable before the commercial court, vadodara having territorial jurisdiction and therefore, the commercial court, vadodara ought not to have held that it has no territorial jurisdiction. in support of his above submissions, he has heavily relied upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of sukanya holdings (p) ltd. vs. jayesh h. pandya and anr. reported in (2003)5 scc 531 (paras 8 to 17). [5.5] it is further submitted by shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that in the present case neither any separate application was filed by the defendant either to frame the preliminary issue whether the commercial court, vadodara hc-nic page 9 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 would have any territorial jurisdiction or not and/or to dismiss the suit on the ground that the commercial court, vadodara would not have territorial jurisdiction and on the basis of the defence while deciding the application exh.5 and on the findings recorded by the commercial court, vadodara while deciding the application exh.5, the commercial court, vadodara has dismissed the suit by observing that while deciding the application as it is held that the commercial court, vadodara would not have territorial jurisdiction and the suit is liable to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed, which is not permissible. it is submitted that therefore no opportunity has been given to the original plaintiff to show cause why the plaint / suit may not be rejected on the ground that the commercial court, vadodara would not have territorial jurisdiction in view of the ouster clause mentioned in clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement. [5.6] it is further submitted that during the course of the hearing of application exh.5 the submissions were made on behalf of the defendant no.1 with respect to the territorial jurisdiction in view of the ouster clause contained in clause 6 and while deciding the application exh.5, the commercial court, vadodara has dismissed the suit which is not permissible. in support of his above submissions, shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate has heavily relied upon the decision of this court in the case of mukeshkumar mohanlal mashru vs. dilipkumar mohanlal mashru & ors. rendered in civil revision application no.462/1998. it is submitted that in the case before the learned single judge, the learned trial court dismissed the suit on the ground of limitation, solely relying upon the observations made while deciding the interim injunction application exh.5. not approving the above and confirming the order passed by the first appellate court quashing and setting aside the order passed by the learned trial court, this court has hc-nic page 10 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 observed and held that whatever the observations are made while deciding the interim injunction application exh.5, are always tentative and while deciding the interim injunction application only and if the learned trial court is of the opinion that the suit is required to be dismissed on the ground that the same is barred by limitation, in that case, the same can be done on an appropriate application by defendant requesting to frame preliminary issue with respect to the limitation or in application under order vii rule 11(d) of the cpc and after giving opportunity to the respective parties. it is submitted that in the aforesaid decision it is further observed and held by this court that without framing preliminary issue it was not permissible for the learned trial court to dismiss the suit, solely relying upon the observations made while deciding the application exh.5. it is submitted that in the present case similar situation has arisen and the commercial court, vadodara has dismissed the suit solely relying upon the observations made while deciding application exh.5. [5.7] relying upon another decision of this court in the case of lark laboratories ltd. vs. nabros pharma pvt. ltd. reported in 2009(2) glr 1376 (para 14), it is submitted that in the case of a composite suit having multiple cause of action and with respect to some of the prayers the suit is permissible within the territorial jurisdiction of the concerned court where the suit is filed and with respect to some of the reliefs there is a lack of jurisdiction of the court in which the suit is filed, in that case, the plaintiff is required to be given an opportunity to amend the plaint and delete the relief for which the court has no jurisdiction and to continue the suit with respect to the remaining reliefs. he has also relied upon another decision of this court in the case of m/s. tec papers pvt. ltd. thro' director, yogesh shivshanker vs. ahmedabad municipal corporation & anr. reported in 2009(3) glh 511. hc-nic page 11 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 making above submissions, it is vehemently submitted by shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that the commercial court, vadodara has materially erred in dismissing the application exh.5 solely on the ground that the commercial court, vadodara would not have any territorial jurisdiction in view of ouster clause contained in clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement. it is submitted that the commercial court, vadodara has not examined the application exh.5 on merits. therefore, it is requested to quash and set aside the impugned order passed below exh.5 and remand the matter back to the commercial court, vadodara to decide application exh.5 afresh and on merits. [5.8] making above submissions, shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has submitted that in absence of any application by the defendant either under order vii rule 10 of the cpc and/or any application to frame the preliminary issue with respect to territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, vadodara and solely relying upon the observations made while deciding the application exh.5 that the commercial court, vadodara would not have territorial jurisdiction, the commercial court, vadodara has dismissed the suit which is not permissible and therefore, it is requested to allow the first appeal and quash and set aside the impugned order passed by the commercial court, vadodara dismissing the suit. [6.0] present appeal from order and first appeal are vehemently opposed by shri mihir joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1. [6.1] it is vehemently submitted by shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that in the facts and hc-nic page 12 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 circumstances of the case and more particularly considering clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement and when the parties have chosen singapore court as a neutral court / forum, no error has been committed by the commercial court, vadodara in holding that the commercial court, vadodara would not have territorial jurisdiction. [6.2] it is vehemently submitted by shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that as such basically the suit was against the original defendant no.1 only and with respect to the breach of contract by the original defendant no.1. it is submitted that the entire cause of action is one i.e. against the original defendant no.1 only and by clever drafting the relief is sought against the original defendant no.2 also. it is submitted that to get out of the ouster clause contained in clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement and only with a view to see that the suit is maintainable at vadodara, the relief is sought against the original defendant no.2 also. shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 has taken us to the averments in para 34 onwards of the suit in support of his submissions that the suit is basically against the original defendant no.1 and the entire cause of action is pleaded against the original defendant no.1 only. it is submitted that therefore considering clause 6.2 of the supply / purchase agreement, when both the parties to the contract agreed to resolve the dispute by a neutral court at singapore, thereafter it is not open for the plaintiff to contend contrary to the agreement more particularly clause 6. it is submitted that any other act / conduct on the part of the plaintiff, contrary to the agreement, more particularly clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement would be such which can be termed as breach of contract. it is submitted that therefore in the facts and circumstances of the case the commercial court, vadodara has not committed any error in holding that in view of hc-nic page 13 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement, the commercial court, vadodara shall not have any territorial jurisdiction. [6.3] now, so far as the submissions on behalf of the original plaintiff that there was no separate application submitted by the original defendant no.1 either under order vii rule 10 of the cpc and/or to raise the preliminary issue with respect to the territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, vadodara, it is vehemently submitted by shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that as such while passing the order under order vii rule 10 of the cpc, no separate application is required. it is submitted that if the court finds that it has no territorial jurisdiction in that case in exercise of power under order vii rule 10 of the cpc, the court can reject / return the plaint. [6.4] it is further submitted by shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that even otherwise in the present case the parties are not taken by surprise. it is submitted that at the time of hearing of appeal from order no.412/2016 before this court, the original defendant no.1 categorically submitted that the original defendant no.1 may be permitted to contend that the commercial court, vadodara shall not have any territorial jurisdiction and that while disposing of the said appeal from order even this court also specifically observed that it will be open for the original defendant no.1 to take a plea that the commercial court, vadodara shall not have any territorial jurisdiction. it is submitted that therefore the commercial court, vadodara has not committed any error in considering the issue with respect to territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, vadodara and has not committed any error in giving specific finding with respect to territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, hc-nic page 14 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 vadodara. relying upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of t. arivandandam vs. t. v. satyapal and anr. reported in (1977)4 scc 467, it is submitted that as held by the hon'ble supreme court, fraudulent and frivolous litigations are to be nipped in the bird. it is submitted that therefore, the commercial court, vadodara is justified in concluding the said issue with respect to the jurisdiction of the commercial court, vadodara at the earliest. [6.5] now, so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of modi entertainment network ltd. (supra) is concerned, it is submitted by shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that as per order vi rule 4 of the cpc, the special facts such as whether the proceedings are oppressive or vexatious or in a forum non conveniens are specifically required to be pleaded in the suit / plaint. it is submitted that there are no specific averments pleaded in the suit. it is submitted that therefore in absence of any such pleading and considering clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement when the commercial court, vadodara has held that the commercial court, vadodara shall not have territorial jurisdiction and consequently has dismissed the suit, the same is not required to be interfered with by this court in exercise of appellate jurisdiction. [6.6] now, so far as the impugned order passed below exh.5 by the commercial court, vadodara is concerned, shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 has submitted that though the commercial court, vadodara has not considered application exh.5 on merits and has dismissed the application solely on the ground that the commercial court, vadodara hc-nic page 15 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 shall not have any territorial jurisdiction, shri joshi, learned senior advocate has requested to consider the case on merits by this court and consider the observations made by the commercial court, vadodara on jurisdiction as prima facie observations / findings. it is vehemently submitted by shri joshi, learned senior advocate that as such no case is made out by the plaintiff to restrain the bank from encashing the bank guarantee. [6.7] it is further submitted by shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that the original plaintiff has not produced on record the communication / letter dated 24.06.2016 addressed by drew and napier to the plaintiff by which the original plaintiff was informed that if notwithstanding the express provisions of the contract, the plaintiff elect to commence proceedings against their client in any jurisdiction other than singapore, ensure that copy of the letter is placed before the relevant court at the time such proceedings are commenced. it is submitted that said crucial document has not been produced on record. it is submitted that such a conduct on the part of the plaintiff disentitles the plaintiff from getting any injunction. [6.8] it is further submitted that even otherwise if the plaintiff wants to rely upon the first contract, the plaintiff has to go before the singapore court alone. [6.9] it is further submitted by shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that as such no cause has been shown to restrain the bank from encashing the bank guarantee. it is submitted that there are no allegations of breach of terms of the bank guarantee. hc-nic page 16 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 [6.10] it is submitted that even as per the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of south east asia shipping co. ltd. vs. nav bharat enterprises pvt. ltd. reported in (1996)3 scc 443 the cause of action with respect to the bank guarantee can be said to have arisen where the bank is situated. it is submitted that therefore also, the commercial court, vadodara would not have any territorial jurisdiction. [6.11] shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 has heavily relied upon the decisions of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of south east asia shipping co. ltd. (supra); u.p. state sugar corporation vs. sumac international ltd. reported in (1997)1 scc 568; dwarikesh sugar industries ltd. vs. prem heavy engineering works (p) ltd. reported in (1997)6 scc 450 in support of his submissions that no case is made out for grant of injunction restraining the bank from encashing the bank guarantee. [6.12] shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 has further submitted that even in para 11 after considering the decisions of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of south east asia shipping co. ltd. (supra) and even modi entertainment network & anr. (supra), the commercial court, vadodara has observed that no cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of commercial court, vadodara. [6.13] it is further submitted by shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that even in para 57 the plaintiff has specifically pleaded in the suit/plaint that they are going to invoke the dispute resolution clause as provided for in the contract. it is submitted that therefore the plaintiff have accepted hc-nic page 17 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 that the dispute is to be resolved as per the contract between parties more particularly dispute resolution clause no.6. it is submitted that therefore also no error has been committed by the commercial court, vadodara in holding that the commercial court, vadodara shall not have any jurisdiction and therefore, the commercial court, vadodara has rightly not granted the injunction as prayed for. making above submissions it is requested to dismiss the present appeal from order as well as the first appeal. [7.0] in reply to the submissions made by shri joshi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant no.1, shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has vehemently submitted that in the present case the bank guarantee has been issued at vadodara and even the payment was also received at vadodara and therefore, so far as suit is concerned, it can be said that part cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of commercial court, vadodara. shri sanjanwala, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has submitted that the averments in the plaint as a whole are required to be considered and therefore, considering section 20(3) of the cpc, the suit is maintainable where the part cause of action has arisen i.e. the commercial court, vadodara. making above submissions it is requested to allow the present appeal from order as well as the first appeal by quashing and setting aside the impugned orders passed below exh.5 and exh.1 and remand the matter to the commercial court, vadodara. [8.0] heard learned counsels appearing for respective parties at length. at the outset it is required to be noted that the commercial suit was preferred by the original plaintiff before the commercial court, hc-nic page 18 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 vadodara for the following reliefs. \"(a) this hon'ble court may be pleased to declare that the defendant no.2 has no right whatsoever to invoke the bank guarantee bearing no.074915fgper0002 in favour of the defendant no.1 or acting upon the letter of the defendant no.1 dated 10.10.2016; (b) it may be further declared that the defendant no.2 is under no obligation to honour the bank guarantee bearing no.074915fgper0002 since the plaintiff has completed all its obligations under the supply contract and hence, the bank is discharged of its obligations to honour the bank guarantee. (c) the hon'ble court be pleased to grant an injunction restraining the defendants from acting upon or enforcing the letter dated 10.10.2016 and invoking the bank guarantee bearing no.074915fgper0002; (d) the defendant no.1 be restrained to make any claims under the bank guarantee bearing no.074915fgper0002 and the defendant no.2 be restrained from making payment to the defendant no.1 in furtherance of letter dated 10.10.2016, under the above bank guarantee.\" that in the said suit the original plaintiff submitted the application exh.5 and prayed the following injunction: \"(a) pending hearing and final disposal of the suit, the defendant no.2 be restrained from making any payment to the defendant no.1, under the bank guarantee bearing no.074915fgper0002, the defendant no.2 be further restrained from acting upon the letter dated 10.10.2016; (b) the defendant no.1 be restrained from enforcing the bank guarantee bearing no.074915fgper0002 and from insisting for payment under the said guarantee in any manner whatsoever;\" [8.1] that at the time of hearing of application exh.5 a plea was taken by the original defendant no.1 that in view of clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement, only the court at singapore would have jurisdiction to entertain and resolve the dispute between the parties and consequently the commercial court, vadodara shall not have any hc-nic page 19 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 territorial jurisdiction. that solely relying upon clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement (ouster clause), the commercial court, vadodara has rejected the application exh.5 and consequently on the basis of the findings recorded while deciding application exh.5, the commercial court, vadodara has passed the order below exh.1 and has also dismissed the suit. it is an admitted position that in the suit neither there was any application submitted by the original defendant no.1 either under order vii rule 10 of the cpc and/or to raise the preliminary issue with respect to territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, vadodara and solely relying upon the observations / findings recorded while deciding application exh.5, the commercial court, vadodara has dismissed the suit. the order passed by the commercial court, vadodara below exh.1 dismissing the suit is the subject matter of first appeal no.2897/2016 and the order passed below exh.5 by the commercial court, vadodara rejecting application exh.5 is the subject matter of appeal from order no.471/2016. [8.2] first, we shall deal with first appeal no.2897/2016 and consider whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the commercial court, vadodara is justified in dismissing the suit solely relying upon the observations / findings recorded while deciding the application exh.5 to the effect that the commercial court, vadodara shall not have any territorial jurisdiction. as observed hereinabove neither any separate application was submitted by the original defendant no.1 either under order vii rule 10 of the cpc and/or to raise the preliminary issue with regard to the territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, vadodara and/or any application to dismiss the suit for want of territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, vadodara. in light of the above the impugned order passed by the commercial court, vadodara dismissing the suit is required to be considered. hc-nic page 20 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 [8.3] identical question came to be considered by this court in the case of mukeshkumar mohanlal mashru (supra). in the case before the learned single judge the trial court dismissed the suit on the ground of limitation, solely relying upon the observations made while deciding interim injunction application exh.5. the learned first appellate court quashed and set aside the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial court dismissing the suit on the ground of limitation by observing that without framing the issue with respect to limitation and even if preliminary issue and solely relying upon the observations made while deciding interim injunction application, the learned trial court ought not to have dismissed the suit. in the revision application before this court while confirming the order passed by the first appellate court, it is observed by the learned single judge of this court that the learned trial court was not justified in dismissing the suit on the ground of limitation, solely relying upon the observations made while deciding interim injunction application exh.5. in para 4, it is observed and held as under: \"[4] having heard learned advocates appearing on behalf of the respective parties and considering the order passed by learned trial court as well as learned appellate court, it appears to the court that learned trial court was not justified in dismissing the suit on the ground of limitation solely relying upon observations made while deciding the interim injunction application exh.5 application. it cannot be disputed that whatever the observations are made while deciding interim injunction application exh.5 are always tentative and while deciding interim injunction application only and if the learned trial court is of the opinion that the suit is required to be dismissed on the ground that the same is barred by limitation, in that case, the same can be done on application by defendant requesting to frame preliminary issue with respect to limitation or in application under order 7 rule 11(d) of the code of civil procedure and after giving an opportunity to the respective parties. however without framing preliminary issue, it was not permissible for the learned trial court to dismiss the suit solely relying upon the observations made while deciding application exh.5. under the circumstances, no illegality has been committed by learned appellate court in quashing and setting aside the judgement and decree passed by learned trial court hc-nic page 21 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 dismissing the suit and remanding the same to the learned trial court.\" therefore, in the present case the commercial court, vadodara is not justified in passing the order below exh.1 and dismissing the suit, solely relying upon the observations made while passing the order below exh.5, in absence of any application by the original defendant no.1 either under order vii rule 10 of the cpc and/or raising the preliminary issue with respect to the territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, vadodara and/or in absence of any application by the original defendant no.1 to dismiss the suit for want of territorial jurisdiction of commercial court, vadodara. thus, as such no opportunity has been given to the plaintiffs to show cause why the suit may not be dismissed on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction by the commercial court, vadodara. if a proper and appropriate application would have been made by the original defendant no.1 and the plaintiff would have been given an opportunity to show cause why the suit may not be dismissed on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction of commercial court, vadodara, in that case the plaintiff would have shown the cause and would have pleaded / submitted that despite clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement, still for the relief sought against the original defendant no.2 and with respect to the bank guarantee, the suit for injunction shall still be maintainable at the commercial court, vadodara. in absence of such opportunity the commercial court, vadodara is not justified in dismissing the suit. [8.4] now, so far as the submission on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that no separate application is required under order vii rule 10 of the cpc is concerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that, we are of the prima facie opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the case order vii rule 10 of the cpc shall not be applicable. order vii rule 10 hc-nic page 22 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 of the cpc shall be applicable in a case where the court in which the suit is filed is lacking inherent jurisdiction. considering paras 24 and 26 of the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of modi entertainment network & anr. (supra) and the decision of the delhi high court in the case of piramal healthcare limited (formerly known as nicholas piramal india ltd.) vs. diasorin s.p.a reported in (2010) 172 dlt 131 prima facie it cannot be said the court at vadodara who can be said to be a natural court, lacks inherent jurisdiction. it might be a different thing that in view of ouster clause agreed by and between the parties and so stated in the contract / agreement and the agreement between the parties to select the neutral court / forum, the natural court may not exercise the jurisdiction and may relegate the parties to the contract to go before the neutral forum / court selected by them. however, it cannot be said that the natural court would lack total inherent jurisdiction. [8.5] even as held by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of modi entertainment network & anr. (supra) in an exceptional case being made out despite the ouster clause the natural court can exercise the jurisdiction. after discussing the law on the point the hon'ble supreme court in para 24 has laid down the following principles. \"(1) in exercising discretion to grant an anti­suit injunction the court must be satisfied of the following aspects : ­ (a) the defendant, against whom injunction is sought, is amenable to the personal jurisdiction of the court; (b) if the injunction is declined the ends of justice will be defeated and injustice will be perpetuated; and (c) the principle of comity ­ respect for the court in which the commencement or continuance of action/proceeding is sought to be restrained ­ must be borne in mind; (2) in a case where more forums than one are available, the court in exercise of its discretion to grant anti­suit injunction will examine as to which is the appropriate forum (forum conveniens) having regard to the convenience of the parties and may grant anti­suit injunction in hc-nic page 23 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 regard to proceedings which are oppressive or vexatious or in a forum non­conveniens; (3) where jurisdiction of a court is invoked on the basis of jurisdiction clause in a contract, the recitals therein in regard to exclusive or non­exclusive jurisdiction of the court of choice of the parties are not determinative but are relevant factors and when a question arises as to the nature of jurisdiction agreed to between the parties the court has to decide the same on a true interpretation of the contract on the facts and in the circumstances of each case; (4) a court of natural jurisdiction will not normally grant anti­suit injunction against a defendant before it where parties have agreed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court including a foreign court, a forum of their choice in regard to the commencement or continuance of proceedings in the court of choice, save in an exceptional case for good and sufficient reasons, with a view to prevent injustice in circumstances such as which permit a contracting party to be relieved of the burden of the contract; or since the date of the contract the circumstances or subsequent events have made it impossible for the party seeking injunction to prosecute the case in the court of choice because the essence of the jurisdiction of the court does not exist or because of a vis major or force majeure and the like; (5) where parties have agreed, under a non­ exclusive jurisdiction clause, to approach a neutral foreign forum and be governed by the law applicable to it for the resolution of their disputes arising under the contract, ordinarily no anti­ suit injunction will be granted in regard to proceedings in such a forum conveniens and favoured forum as it shall be presumed that the parties have thought over their convenience and all other relevant factors before submitting to non­ exclusive jurisdiction of the court of their choice which cannot be treated just an alternative forum; (6) a party to the contract containing jurisdiction clause cannot normally be prevented from approaching the court of choice of the parties as it would amount to aiding breach of the contract; yet when one of the parties to the jurisdiction clause approaches the court of choice in which exclusive or non­ exclusive jurisdiction is created, the proceedings in that court cannot per se be treated as vexatious or oppressive nor can the court be said to be forum non­conveniens; and (7) the burden of establishing that the forum of choice is a forum non­conveniens or the proceedings therein are oppressive or vexatious would be on the party so contending to aver and prove the same.\" in para 26 the hon'ble supreme court has further observed as under: hc-nic page 24 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 \"26. a plain reading of this clause shows that the parties have agreed that their contract will be governed by and be construed in accordance with english law and they have also agreed to submit to the non­exclusive jurisdiction of english courts (without reference to english conflict of law rules). we have already observed above that recitals in regard to submission to exclusive or non­exclusive jurisdiction of a court of choice in an agreement are not determinative. however, as both the parties proceeded on the basis that they meant non­exclusive jurisdiction of the english courts, on the facts of this case, the court is relieved of the interpretation of jurisdiction clause. normally, the court will give effect to the intention of the parties as expressed in the agreement entered into by them except when strong reasons justify disregard of the contractual obligations of the parties. in donohue's case (supra) although the parties to the agreement stipulated to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the english courts, the house of lords found that it would not be in the interests of justice to hold the parties to their contract as in that case strong reasons were shown by the respondent. it was felt necessary that a single trial of all the claims of the parties by one forum would be appropriate and as all the parties to the new york proceedings were not parties to the agreement stipulating exclusive jurisdiction of the english court and as all the claims before the new york court did not arise out of the said contract so they could not have been tried in the english court. it was urged that in the circumstances parallel proceedings ­ one in england and another in new york ­ would have to go on which might result in inconsistent decisions. those facts were considered as strong reasons to decline to grant anti­suit injunction though the parties had agreed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the english court. in contrast in sabah's case (supra) even though gop filed the suit first in the court of natural jurisdiction and sought anti­suit injunction against sabah restraining them from proceeding with the action brought by them in the english court, the court of appeal found that non­ exclusive jurisdiction clause in the agreement of guarantee executed by gop was binding on them. the action of gop in filing the suit earlier in the court of natural jurisdiction was held to be clearly in breach of contract and in the context of the non­exclusive jurisdiction clause, oppressive and vexatious unless the gop could show strong reasons as to why parallel proceeding would be justified. the only ground urged for continuance of proceeding in pakistan court was that it was a convenient forum which was considered not strong enough for the gop to disregard the contractual obligation of submission to the jurisdiction of the english court for resolution of disputes. the court of appeal, upheld the anti­suit injunction granted by the learned judge at the first instance as also the order declining to stay the english suit.\" hc-nic page 25 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 in para 27 the hon'ble supreme court has further observed that it cannot be laid down as general principles that once the parties have agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court, the proceedings or the action brought either in the court of natural jurisdiction or in the court of choice will per se be oppressive or vexatious. it is observed that it depends on the facts of each case and the question whether the proceedings in a court are vexatious or oppressive has to be decided on the basis of the material brought before the court. in the case of piramal healthcare limited (supra), the delhi high court has observed that when a court directs the plaintiff to approach to a foreign court / neutral court; it issues such a direction not because the natural court has no jurisdiction, but in the given circumstances it takes a view that parties should be held to their bargain. ina given case equaly the natural court may choose not to held parties to their bargain. [8.6] thus, considering the above it cannot be said that there shall be a total lack of jurisdiction of the natural court i.e. in the present case the commercial court, vadodara. therefore, in a case where the suit is filed before a natural court and as observed hereinabove the natural court would not loose the jurisdiction and/or it cannot be said that there shall be a total lack of jurisdiction of the natural court, therefore we are prima facie of the opinion that order vii rule 10 of the cpc shall not be applicable. [8.7] even otherwise even considering the provisions of order vii rule 10 of the cpc the suit is not required to be dismissed. if the trial court is of the opinion that it has no territorial jurisdiction, in that case, the trial court may return the plaint to the plaintiff to present it before appropriate court having jurisdiction. however, the court cannot hc-nic page 26 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 dismiss the suit under order vii rule 10 of the cpc. [8.8] in the present case as observed hereinabove, solely relying upon the observations made while deciding the application exh.5, the commercial court, vadodara has dismissed the suit which as observed hereinabove is not permissible. no opportunity has been given to the plaintiff to show cause why the suit may not be dismissed on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction by the commercial court, vadodara. as observed hereinabove no application has been preferred to raise the preliminary issue with respect to territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, vadodara. if the appropriate application would have been submitted by the original defendant no.1 to dismiss the suit on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, vadodara and the plaintiff would have been given the opportunity, the plaintiff would have submitted that despite the ouster clause still for the reliefs sought in the plaint the suit shall still be maintainable before the commercial court, vadodara and the natural court would have jurisdiction to entertain such a suit for relief of injunction as prayed. in absence of such application and the opportunity given to the plaintiff, the commercial court, vadodara is not justified in dismissing the suit. under the circumstances, the impugned order passed by the commercial court, vadodara below exh.1 dismissing the suit cannot be sustained and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside. [8.9] it is also required to be noted that as such the commercial court, vadodara has dismissed the suit solely considering the observations / findings recorded while deciding application exh.5. as per the settled proposition of law any observations made while deciding the interim injunction application are tentative and prima facie while hc-nic page 27 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 deciding the interim injunction application exh.5 only. therefore, if the commercial court, vadodara was of the opinion that the suit itself is liable to be dismissed on the ground that it has no territorial jurisdiction, in that case, the same can be done after following proper procedure and/or on appropriate application by the defendant and that too after giving opportunity to the plaintiff to show cause why the suit may not be dismissed and/or returned to present it before appropriate court having jurisdiction. however, solely relying upon the observations made while deciding interim injunction application exh.5, findings which are always tentative and prima facie, the court is not justified in dismissing the suit. appeal from order no.471/2016 [9.0] now, so far as the impugned order passed below exh.5 by the commercial court, vadodara is concerned, at the outset and as observed hereinabove, the commercial court, vadodara has dismissed the application exh.5 solely and mainly on the ground that the commercial court, vadodara has no territorial jurisdiction in view of clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement. for the reasons stated herein above and as observed hereinabove, commercial court, vadodara is not justified in holding that in view of clause 6 of supply / purchase agreement, commercial court, vadodara lacks total jurisdiction. we have also observed and held that the commercial court, vadodara has not properly appreciated the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of modi entertainment network & anr. (supra). therefore, for the reasons stated above, the matter is required to be remanded back to the commercial court, vadodara to decide the application exh.5 afresh more particularly the commercial court, vadodara has gone into the merits whether the plaintiff is entitled to the injunction as prayed or not and has rejected the application exh.5 on the aforesaid ground alone. hc-nic page 28 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 under the circumstances, without further expressing anything on merits whether the plaintiff is entitled to the injunction as prayed or not, the impugned order passed by the commercial court, vadodara is required to be quashed and set aside and the matter is required to be remanded back to the commercial court, vadodara to decide application exh.5 afresh in accordance with law and on merits. [10.0] in view of the above and for the reasons stated above, both, present appeal from order and the first appeal are allowed. impugned order dated 05.12.2016 passed by the commercial court, vadodara, vadodara below exh.5 rejecting the same holding that the commercial court, vadodara, vadodara had no territorial jurisdiction is hereby quashed and set aside. the impugned order dated 05.12.2016 passed by the commercial court, vadodara, vadodara below exh.1 dismissing the commercial suit no.288/2016 considering the observations / findings recorded while deciding the application exh.5 that the commercial court, vadodara, vadodara would not have any territorial jurisdiction is also hereby quashed and set aside. matters are remanded to the commercial court, vadodara to decide the application exh.5 afresh. it will be open for the original defendant no.1 to submit appropriate application either to raise the preliminary issue whether the commercial court, vadodara, vadodara would have any territorial jurisdiction or not and/or an appropriate application to dismiss the suit contending inter alia that in view of the clause 6 of the supply / purchase agreement, the commercial court, vadodara would not have any territorial jurisdiction and/or the commercial court, vadodara may not exercise the jurisdiction. as and when such application is made the commercial court, vadodara to consider the same in accordance with law and at the earliest and preferably within a period of 4 weeks from submitting such hc-nic page 29 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017 application/s. the commercial court, vadodara to decide and dispose of the application exh.5 afresh in accordance with law and on merits also within a period of 6 weeks from today. in view of disposal of main appeal from order and first appeal, civil application nos.12991/2016 and 12999/2016 for stay respectively in appeal from order and first appeal are also disposed of. sd/­ (m.r. shah, j.) sd/­ (b.n. karia, j.) further order at the time of pronouncement of the present judgment and order, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no.1 herein original defendant no.1 has brought to the notice of this court that it has come to their knowledge that after the present appeal from order and the first appeal were heard by this court and kept cav for orders, the plaintiff has already approached now the singapore court and have obtained some interim injunction. if that be so, it will be open for the defendant no.1 to point out the same before the commercial court, vadodara and the commercial court, vadodara to consider the same in accordance with law. sd/­ (m.r. shah, j.) sd/­ (b.n. karia, j.) ajay hc-nic page 30 of 30 created on sat aug 12 02:17:45 ist 2017"
