Facts giving rise to filing of this appeal in nutshell are that the appellant No.1 is a retired professor in Physiology with 45 years of experience in teaching, researching and practical experience in Physiology. The appellant Nos.1 to 5 are the authors of medical textbook, namely Fundamentals of Medical Physiology. The appellant No.1 has authored eight editions of the text book based on his continued research. \n3. On 30.01.1999, the appellant No.1 entered into an agreement with the first respondent's publishing house for publishing a medical textbook, namely Fundamentals of Medical Physiology - second edition. Between the years 1999 and 2015, appellant No.1 published four editions of the medical textbook. Thereafter, the agreement was superseded and the appellants and the respondents entered into a fresh agreement on 18.04.2015 for publication of new edition of the medical textbook. The appellant Nos.1 to 5 by a letter dated 16.11.2022 terminated the agreement inter alia on the grounds that (a) respondents failed to make satisfactory efforts in publishing and marketing the textbook; (b) respondents failed to communicate the actual sales of the textbook; and (c) respondents did not make any efforts to increase the availability of the textbook. \n4. Thereafter, appellant Nos.1 to 5 published eighth edition of the textbook in January, 2023 with the support of another publishing house, namely appellant No.6.\n5. Thereupon, the respondents filed a suit against the appellants seeking relief of permanent injunction, damages to the tune of Rs.1 crore along with interest @ 18% and for the relief of rendition of accounts. Along with the plaint, the respondents filed an application seeking temporary injunction restraining the defendants from printing, marketing, distributing, reproducing, publishing or making alterations of the book, namely Fundamentals of Medical Physiology, Volumes I and II, in any manner. \n6. The Commercial Court by an order dated 29.03.2023 inter alia held that the assignment agreement was executed between the parties under which the respondents/plaintiffs had been paying royalty regularly to the appellant Nos.1 to 5/defendant Nos.1 to 5. It was further held that the validity of termination of the agreement can only be considered after trial and for the purposes of consideration of interlocutory application, it has been held that assignment of copyright in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs is absolute. It was further held that the defences like undue influence and misrepresentation in respect of agreement dated 18.04.2015 can be considered only during trial. Therefore, it was held that the respondents/plaintiffs have prima facie case. The Commercial Court further concluded that in case, the appellants/defendants are not restrained from any further publication of the book, the same shall result in huge loss to the respondents/plaintiffs. Accordingly, the Commercial Court allowed the application for grant of temporary injunction and restrained the appellants/defendants from printing, publishing, marketing or distributing or allowing any others on their instructions to print, market, publish, distribute or reprint of any of the previous editions, including the eighth edition of the book till disposal of the suit. In the aforesaid factual background, this appeal has been filed. \n7. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellants while inviting the attention of this Court to the averments made in the plaint pointed out that no challenge has been made to termination of agreement and therefore, the suit is prima facie barred under Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. It is also argued that the injury which may be caused to the respondents/plaintiffs can be measured in terms of the damages. The attention of this Court has been invited to averments made in paragraphs 14 and 16 of the affidavit filed in support of the application for temporary injunction. It is further submitted that in the absence of any finding that the injury which may be suffered by the respondents/plaintiffs will be irreparable, the Court ought to have refused to grant temporary injunction. It is also contended that the agreement provides for payment of royalties and imposes obligation on the respondents/plaintiffs and therefore, the Commercial Court erred in treating the same as assignment. In support of the aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the decisions of the Supreme Court in Dalpat Kumar vs. Prahlad Singh 1, Seema Arshad Zaheer vs. Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai 2, Best Sellers Retail vs. Aditya Birla 3, I.S.Sikandar vs. K.Subramani 4, Mahinder 1 (1992) 1 SCC 719 2 (2006) 5 SCC 282 3 (2012) 6 SCC 792 4 (2013) 15 SCC 27 Kaur vs. Sant Paul Singh 5 and Mishra Bandhu Karyalaya vs. Shivratan Lal Koshal 6.\n8. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents/plaintiffs has submitted that the parties had entered into an assignment agreement on 18.04.2015 and if Section 18(2) read with Section 19(3) of the Copyright Act, 1957 is read in conjunction, it is evident that the same provides for assignment even on payment of royalty. It is submitted that the appellants/defendants did not raise any protest till 16.11.2022. It is also contended that the appellants/defendants have no right to unilaterally terminate the assignment agreement. It is contended that the respondents/plaintiffs are not required to challenge the unilateral cancellation of the assignment agreement and the remedy available to the appellants/defendants is under Section 57 of the Copyright Act. It is contended that the respondents/plaintiffs have a prima facie case in their favour and the Commercial Court has rightly granted the injunction as the respondents/plaintiffs would have 5 (2019) 9 SCC 358 6 AIR 1970 MP 261 suffered irreparable loss, in case the injunction as prayed for is not granted. In support of the aforesaid submissions, the learned counsel has placed reliance on the decisions of the Supreme Court in Martin Burn Limited vs. R.N.Bangerjee 7, Laxmikant V.Patel vs. Chetanbhai Shah 8, Midas Hygiene Industries (Private) Limited vs. Sudhir Bhatia 9, Sumtibai vs. Paras Finance Company 10 and The Chancellor Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford vs. Orient Longman Private Limited 11.\n9. We have considered the submissions on both sides and have perused the record. \n10. The distinction between the assignment of a copyright and licence thereof is well settled. Assignment transfers title in the copyright, whereas licence merely permits certain things to be done by the licensee. The title in the copyright is assigned to assignee, whereas the 7 AIR 1958 SC 79 8 (2002) 3 SCC 65 9 (2004) 3 SCC 90 10 (2007) 10 SCC 82 11 2003 (67) DRJ 184 licence is personal. Before proceeding further, it is apposite to take note of the decisions of Supreme Court with regard to grant of injunction. \n11. The Supreme Court in Wander Limited vs. Antox India Private Limited 12, while dealing with the issue whether a prima facie case is made out by the plaintiff in that case, held in paragraph 9 as under:\n9. Usually, the prayer for grant of an interlocutory injunction is at a stage when the existence of the legal right asserted by the plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and uncertain and remain uncertain till they are established at the trial on evidence. The court, at this stage, acts on certain well settled principles of administration of this form of interlocutory remedy which is both temporary and discretionary. The object of the interlocutory injunction, it is stated \"...is to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his rights for which he could not adequately be compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. The need for such protection must be weighed against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting from his having been prevented from exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be adequately compensated. The court must weigh one need against another and determine where the 'balance of convenience' lies.\"\n12 1990 (Supp) SCC 727 The interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo, the rights of parties which may appear on a prima facie case. The court also, in restraining a defendant from exercising what he considers his legal right but what the plaintiff would like to be prevented, puts into the scales, as a relevant consideration whether the defendant has yet to commence his enterprise or whether he has already been doing so in which latter case considerations somewhat different from those that apply to a case where the defendant is yet to commence his enterprise, are attracted. \n12. In Gujarat Bottling Company Limited vs. Coca Cola 13, the Supreme Court laid down the principles on the anvil of which the discretion of the Court to deal with the case of grant of interlocutory injunction can be exercised, namely (i) whether the plaintiff has a prima facie case;\n(ii) whether the balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiff and (iii) whether the plaintiff would suffer any irreparable injury if prayer for interlocutory injunction is disallowed. In paragraph 43, it was held as under:\n43. The grant of an interlocutory injunction during the pendency of legal proceedings is a matter requiring the exercise of discretion of the court. While exercising the discretion the court applies the following tests -- (i) whether the plaintiff has a prima facie case;\n13 (1995) 5 SCC 545 (ii) whether the balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiff; and (iii) whether the plaintiff would suffer an irreparable injury if his prayer for interlocutory injunction is disallowed. The decision whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction has to be taken at a time when the existence of the legal right assailed by the plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and uncertain and remain uncertain till they are established at the trial on evidence. Relief by way of interlocutory injunction is granted to mitigate the risk of injustice to the plaintiff during the period before that uncertainty could be resolved. The object of the interlocutory injunction is to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his right for which he could not be adequately compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. The need for such protection has, however, to be weighed against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting from his having been prevented from exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be adequately compensated. The court must weigh one need against another and determine where the \"balance of convenience\" lies. [See: Wander Ltd. v. Antox India (P) Ltd. [1990 Supp SCC 727], (SCC at pp. 731-32.] In order to protect the defendant while granting an interlocutory injunction in his favour the court can require the plaintiff to furnish an undertaking so that the defendant can be adequately compensated if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. \n13. Thus, it is evident that the Supreme Court noted that the very object of grant of interlocutory injunction is to protect the party against injury by violation of his right by which he could not be compensated in damages in the action, if uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. \n14. In Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprise Limited vs. K.S.Infraspace LLP Limited 14, the Supreme Court in paragraph 16 has held as under:\n16. The cardinal principles for grant of temporary injunction were considered in Dalpat Kumar v. Prahlad Singh [Dalpat Kumar v. Prahlad Singh, (1992) 1 SCC 719], observing as follows : (SCC p. 721, para 5) \"5. ... Satisfaction that there is a prima facie case by itself is not sufficient to grant injunction. The Court further has to satisfy that non-interference by the Court would result in \"irreparable injury\" to the party seeking relief and that there is no other remedy available to the party except one to grant injunction and he needs protection from the consequences of apprehended injury or dispossession. Irreparable injury, however, does not mean that there must be no physical possibility of repairing the injury, but means only that the injury must be a material one, namely, one that cannot be adequately compensated by way of damages. The third condition also is that \"the balance of convenience\" must be in favour of granting injunction. The Court while granting or refusing to grant injunction should exercise 14 (2020) 5 SCC 410 sound judicial discretion to find the amount of substantial mischief or injury which is likely to be caused to the parties, if the injunction is refused and compare it with that which is likely to be caused to the other side if the injunction is granted. If on weighing competing possibilities or probabilities of likelihood of injury and if the Court considers that pending the suit, the subject-matter should be maintained in status quo, an injunction would be issued. Thus the Court has to exercise its sound judicial discretion in granting or refusing the relief of ad interim injunction pending the suit.\"\n15. In the backdrop of the aforesaid well settled legal principles, we may now advert to the facts of the case in hand. The plaintiff in order to prove a prima facie case is required to establish that there are serious questions to be tried in the suit. From the averments made in the plaint, it is evident that the following questions arise for consideration in the suit:\ni) Whether the agreement dated 18.04.2015 executed between the parties is an assignment or a licence? \nii) Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to rescind the agreement and are entitled to the relief as sought for by them in the suit? \n16. The agreement executed between the parties on 18.04.2015 is titled as \"assignment agreement\". Under clause (1) of the aforesaid agreement, the authors have transferred all intellectual property rights, including copyrights, in favour of the publisher. Clause (5) provides for royalties and accounting procedure. Therefore, the agreement appears to be an assignment agreement. \n17. Thus, the plaintiffs have been able to make out a prima facie case as there are serious questions to be tried in the suit. \n18. It is pertinent to note that balance of convenience lies in favour of the defendants in the suit as in case they are prevented from publishing the book, namely Fundamentals of Medical Physiology - Volumes I and II, the students would be deprived of the benefit of latest edition of the book. \n19. Now we may advert to another essential ingredient for grant of injunction, namely irreparable injury. From the decisions referred to in the preceding paragraphs, it is evident that the object of grant of interlocutory injunction is to prevent a party against an injury by violation of his right by which he could not be adequately compensated in damages in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. In the instant case, in paragraph 18 of the plaint itself, the plaintiffs have pleaded the damages suffered by them. Paragraph 18 is reproduced below for the facility of reference:\n18. As per the Agreement, the Defendant No.1 is obligated not to act in a manner that would adversely affect the sale of the publication and in the event the Defendants No.1 to 5 do so, the Defendants no.1 to 5 have agreed to be liable for all the losses suffered by the Plaintiff caused by their actions. The Defendant No.6 in collusion with Defendants No.1 to 5 is printing, publishing and selling the said book at Rs.1,995/- MRP as purported 8th edition which is a clear breach of the Agreement dt. 18/04/2015. Therefore, the Defendants stand to illegally profit from such unauthorized publication of the book over which the Plaintiff has vested rights subsisting as on today. The Plaintiff states that it is entitled for Rs.2095/- MRP as compensation on every copy of the infringing book published and sold by the Defendants as loss of profits and damages and, the Plaintiff reserves its right to call upon the Statement of accounts of the Defendant No.6 to ascertain the same and amend the plaint if needed. \nFurthermore, the Plaintiff has 7th Edition books in stock which it is unable to sell on account of the circulation of the second edition in the market. Therefore, the Defendants are liable to pay the loss occasioned on the books that the Plaintiff is unable to print, publish and sell as until the date of realization of the suit. The Plaintiff estimates the total loss to his business at Rs.1,00,00,000/- as damages for the loss suffered by the Plaintiff on account of breach of Agreement by the Defendants No.1 to 5.\n20. In the instant case, even though the plaintiffs have been able to establish a prima facie case in their favour, yet they have failed to fulfil the requirement to demonstrate that, irreparable injury, would be caused to them in case injunction as prayed for is not granted. \n21. This Court is conscious of the scope of interference in an appeal with the order of injunction passed by the trial Court. In Printers (Mysore) Private Limited vs. Pothan Joseph 15, the Supreme Court has dealt with the scope of reversal by a Court of appeal and has held as under:\n... These principles are well established, but as has been observed by Viscount Simon in Charles Osenton & Co. v. Jhanaton (1942 AC 130) '...the law as to the reversal by a court of appeal of an order made by a judge below in the exercise of his discretion is well established, and any difficulty that arises is due only to the application of well settled principles in an individual case'. \n22. In the instant case, the Commercial Court has failed to apply the well settled legal principles for grant of injunction, namely irreparable injury. Therefore, the case for interference in this appeal is made out. \n23. For the aforementioned reasons, the order dated 29.03.2003 passed by the Commercial Court in I.A.No.8 of 2023 in COS.No.3 of 2023 is set aside. However, the respondent Nos.1 to 6 shall keep an account with regard to printing, marketing, publishing, distributing or reprinting any previous editions, including eighth edition of the medical book, namely Fundamentals of Medical Physiology 15 (1960) 3 SCR 713: AIR 1960 SC 1156 - Volumes I and II, already marketed and shall produce the same periodically before the Commercial Court. The Commercial Court shall make an endeavour to dispose of the suit expeditiously. \n24. In the result, the appeal is disposed of. \nMiscellaneous applications, pending if any, shall stand closed. \n______________________________________ ALOK ARADHE, CJ ______________________________________ N.V.SHRAVAN KUMAR, J 09.11.2023 Note: LR copy to be marked. \n(By order) pln",

(1) . (e) ―court‖ means-(i) in the case of an arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the high court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a suit, but does not include any civil court of a grade inferior to such principal civil court, or any court of small causes; (ii) in the case of international commercial arbitration, the high court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a suit, and in other cases, a high court having jurisdiction to hear appeals from decrees of courts subordinate to that high court; 7. the definition determines the court before which a party would have to bring a subject matter concerning arbitration for decision. the definition recognizes and preserves the hierarchy of courts by excluding a civil court inferior to the principal civil court in a district. 8. in this regard, the notification published on 20.3.2020 in the kolkata gazette extraordinary by the judicial department, government of west bengal, changes the perspective. the pecuniary jurisdiction of the city civil court and the calcutta high court was notified in exercise of the power conferred under section 3(1-a) of the commercial courts act, 2015. by the said notification, the pecuniary jurisdictions of the courts was specified in terms of the value of the commercial dispute and provided that the city civil court and the commercial division of the calcutta high court would have concurrent jurisdiction over commercial disputes between rs. 10 lakhs rs. 1 crore. admittedly, the petitioner's claim is approximately rs. 67.53 lacs. therefore, both the learned city civil court as well as the commercial division of this court would have concurrent jurisdiction to entertain the present application. the petitioner would hence have the choice of approaching either of the two courts. 9. the court disagrees with the argument made on behalf of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner that the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 is indifferent to a financial platform in the sense of pecuniary limits. this argument is belied by section 2(1)(b) of the commercial courts act, 2015 which defines a \"commercial court\" as a court constituted under section 3(1) of the act. section 3(1) in turn, empowers the state government to specify, after consultation with the concerned high court, by notification, the local limits of the area to which the jurisdiction of a commercial court can extend. 10. moreover, the pecuniary flavour of commercial matters with particular regard to arbitration in a commercial dispute of a specified value, can be found in section 10 of the 2015 act. section 10(2) deals with applications/appeals arising out of arbitrations in a commercial dispute of a specified value which has been filed in the original side of the high court while section 10(3) deals with arbitrations which ordinarily would lie before any civil court with original jurisdiction in a district, not being a high court. both these categories deal with non-international commercial arbitrations. commercial courts have been given exclusive jurisdiction to hear and dispose of appeals and applications arising out of domestic arbitrations within the authority of the principal civil court exercising territorial jurisdiction over the arbitration. 11. section 12(2) of the commercial courts act, which deals with determination of specified value, further takes into account the aggregate value of the claim and counter-claim as set out in the statement of claim and counter-claim in an arbitration of a commercial dispute as the basis for determining whether the arbitration is subject to the jurisdiction of a commercial division, commercial appellate division or commercial court, as the case may be. 12. hence, the commercial courts act, 2015, is replete with pecuniary platforms for the purpose of determining the court which would have the authority to receive, try and entertain a commercial dispute including that of an arbitration of a specified value. the notification of 20.3.2020 has to be read in this context and applications under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 certainly cannot be divorced from the notification or seen to be excluded from the mandate of the notification. 13. the notification dated 20.3.2020 of the judicial department, government of west bengal, which was published in the kolkata gazette extraordinary, envelopes all commercial courts in the state of west bengal and grades them in a pyramidal structure in or to the extent of their respective pecuniary limits. while the commercial courts at siliguri, asansol, alipore and rajarhat are at the base of the pyramid with a baseline of 30 lakhs, the commercial division of the calcutta high court is at the peak with exclusive pecuniary jurisdiction over commercial disputes in excess of rs. 1 crore. the middle of the pyramid is for the commercial disputes between rs. 10 lakhs and 1 crore in respect of which the city civil court at calcutta and the commercial division of the high court have been given concurrent jurisdiction. 14. this notification was issued by the state government in exercise of the powers conferred under section 3(1a) of the commercial courts act, 2015 after consultation with the high court specifying the pecuniary jurisdiction in terms of the value of the commercial disputes. section 3(1a) was inserted in the 2015 act with effect from 3.5.2018. the hierarchy of commercial courts is only with regard to their respective pecuniary limits. 15. as stated above, section 10 of the commercial courts act factors in arbitration matters in a commercial dispute of a specified value and confers the commercial division of a high court to hear and dispose of matters which are filed on the original side of the high court (section 10(2)). section 10(3) authorises the commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction over an arbitration in a commercial dispute of a specified value where the application would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district which is not a high court. 16. the notification of 20.3.2020, which was a subsequent development, fixed the pecuniary jurisdiction of the commercial courts, the city civil court and the commercial division of the high court for commercial disputes with a specified value. hence, determining the court in accordance with the situs of filing the appeal / application under the 1996 act under section 10(2) and (3) of the 2015 act stood re-arranged by the subsequent notification of 20.3.2020 which guides litigants to the court having pecuniary jurisdiction to hear the matter. 17. neither the notification of 20.3.2020 nor section 10(2) and (3) of the 2015 act carves out any exceptions for a \"court\" as defined under section 2(1)(e)(i) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. importing the definition of \"court\" as given in section 2(1)(e)(i) of the 1996 act would lead to an inevitable conflict between the said provision and section 10(2) and (3) of the commercial courts act, 2015 as well as the notification of 20.3.2020. the conflict would be in terms of a tussle between two principal civil courts in a district where one happens to be the high court exercising its ordinary original civil jurisdiction over the subject matter of the arbitration. in such cases, the high court being the superior court of the two, would become the \"court\" under section 2(1)(e)(i) to attract all applications made under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, even where the high court has concurrent pecuniary jurisdiction with the city civil court at calcutta. 18. this conclusion does not find support either from the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 or the the commercial courts act, 2015 read with the notification of 20.3.2020. the practical consequence of this view also cannot be discounted. it would mean that the city civil court at calcutta would be denuded of the authority to hear all applications under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 despite having concurrent pecuniary jurisdiction with the commercial division of the high court. 19. further, section 2(1)(e)(i) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, does not envisage any form of conflict between the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district and the high court exercising its ordinary original civil jurisdiction in the same district. section 2(1)(e)(i) is inclusive and treats the high court also to be a principal civil court in a district which is empowered to decide the questions forming the subject matter of the arbitration in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, in the same manner as in a suit. section 2(1)(e)(i) of the 1996 act may be contrasted with section 10(3) of the commercial courts act, 2015 which expressly excludes a high court where an application under the 1996 act has been filed before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district where the commercial court having territorial jurisdiction over the arbitration would be the proper court. 20. thus, the choice of a litigant to approach a court which has been conferred pecuniary jurisdiction to hear an application filed under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 cannot be limited or extinguished by reading calcutta high court as the only court under section 2(1)(e)(i) of the 1996 act. the litigant must be free to approach any court provided the court has been designated as the proper court in terms of pecuniary limits under the notification of 20.3.2020. 21. therefore, the choice of the petitioner in the present matter cannot be restricted to the calcutta high court as the only principal civil court of original jurisdiction in the district of calcutta. it hence follows that the petitioner cannot categorise the city civil court as lacking in jurisdiction to receive or try the first application which was filed before it. is the present application barred under section 42 of the 1996 act and order xxiii rule 1 of the cpc? 22. the statutory discipline of section 42 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 would consequently follow. section 42 begins with a non-obstante clause with regard to part i of the 1996 act or any other law for the time being in force and confers exclusive jurisdiction on a court which received the first application under an arbitration agreement to hear all subsequent applications arising out of that arbitration agreement. the petitioner's reason for withdrawing the application from the city civil court is hence found to be contrary to the construction as stated above. 23. the principle underlying section 42 of the 1996 act and order xxiii rule 1 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 is one of public policy which is to prevent a litigant from abusing the process of court by instituting proceedings on the same cause of action without any good reason and without obtaining permission of the court to file a fresh proceeding; sarguja transport service vs. state transport appellate tribunal; (1987) 1 scc 5. in essence, the petitioner after having abandoned its claim before a competent court having jurisdiction cannot file a fresh application on the same cause of action before the calcutta high court. 24. order xxiii rule 1(1) of the cpc permits the plaintiff to abandon a suit or a part of his or her claim after institution of a suit subject to order xxiii rule 1(3) which requires the satisfaction of a court on either of the two conditions mentioned therein to grant permission to the plaintiff to withdraw from the suit or part of the claim with liberty to institute a fresh suit in respect of the subject matter or such part of the claim. order xxiii rule 1 (3) is set out below : order xxiii. 1. withdrawal of suit or abandonment of part of claim (1) . . (3) where the court is satisfied,-(a) that a suit must fail by reason of some formal defect, or (b) that there are sufficient grounds for allowing the plaintiff to institute a fresh suit for the subject matter of suit or part of a claim, it may, on such terms as it thinks fit grant the plaintiff permission to withdraw from such suit or such part of the claim with liberty to institute a fresh suit in respect of the subject-matter of such suit or such part of the claim. 25. the court does not wish to delve any further into the question as to whether the rigours of order xxiii rule 1(3) would be applicable to the present proceedings. it is sufficient to say that the salient object of order xxiii, which is obtaining permission from the court to withdraw a proceeding with liberty to institute a fresh proceeding on the same subject matter, should be preserved. this would particularly be relevant to the facts of the present case where the petitioner exercised its right to approach the city civil court and then withdrew the petition on the premise that the city civil court does not have the jurisdiction to entertain the matter. the petitioner thereafter approached this court on the same cause of action and with the same reliefs as were before the city civil court. is the calcutta high court the proper court in terms of the arbitration clause in the loan agreement? 26. the relevant part of clauses 29 and 30 of the loan agreement are set out below : ―29. arbitration: . the venue of arbitration proceedings shall be at channai or such place/location/city which the company at its discretion may decide from time to time. 30. jurisdiction: subject to the arbitration clause contained herein, the courts in chennai alone shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any matter arising out of or concerning this agreement. however, the parties hereby agree, confirm and undertake that the company has a right to file its claim in relation to any amount payable by the borrower and or guarantors or any other connect matter/s as mentioned in this agreement in any other competent court in india at its sole discretion.‖ 27. the respondents argue that the calcutta high court would not be the proper court for the present proceeding since chennai has been designated as the venue / seat of arbitration. the petitioner, on the other hand, seeks to take advantage of the \"or\" in clause 29 to say that the venue of arbitration can be at any other place as decided by the company / petitioner. 28. clause 29 and 30 read together would inevitably point to chennai being the chosen venue of arbitration although the arbitration clause gives an option to the petitioner to unilaterally decide the venue of arbitration. the clause is arbitrary on the very face of it. the petitioner has been given the sole discretion to decide on shifting of the venue to any other place. any change of venue must be chosen by both the parties in sync with free choice in such matters. 29. the present case consists of certain admitted facts; the agreement was entered into at chennai, the agreement was terminated from chennai and the registered office of the petitioner is at chennai. the petitioner has not been able to establish a defence to these admitted facts. 30. arvind constructions co. (p) ltd. vs. kalinga mining corporation; (2007) 6 scc 798, iti limited vs. siemens public communications; (2002) 5 scc 510, sanghi industries limited vs. ravin cables ltd.; 2022 scc online sc 1329 and accord advertising pvt. ltd. vs. airports director, the airports authority of india; manu/wb/1919/2019 were cited for the proposition that the code of civil procedure applies to the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. this aspect has already been dealt with in the earlier section of this judgment. the decision of this court in binoy trading co. vs. tata motors finance limited; 2023 scc online cal 2271 on the provisions of the commercial courts act in relation to pecuniary jurisdiction of courts may be relevant for the present discussion. 31. state of maharashtra vs. atlanta limited; (2014) 11 scc 619 dealt with the power of the high court to assume jurisdiction in a challenge to an award. the supreme court however did not have any occasion to consider the import and significance of the commercial courts act, 2015 and the hierarchy of commercial courts in terms of pecuniary jurisdiction. state of west bengal vs associate contractors; (2015) 1 scc 32 would also not be relevant to the present application for the same reason. sri sushanta mallick vs. srei equipment finance limited; air 2015 cal 335 followed associate contractors and is accordingly distinguished on the same ground. debdas routh vs. hinduja leyland finance limited; air 2018 cal 322 was cited for the proposition that the choice of the courts is governed by section 2(1)(e)(i) read with section 42 subject to any agreement between the parties. the division bench of this court however gave particular emphasis to establishing the jurisdiction of the concerned court. the petitioner has not been able to establish any facts which would attract the jurisdiction of the calcutta high court. 32. the court accepts the preliminary objections raised by the respondents in view of the above reasons. ap 691 of 2023 (ap cpom 370 of 2024) is accordingly dismissed as not being maintainable. there shall be no orders as to costs. urgent photostat certified copies of this judgment, if applied for, be supplied to the parties upon fulfillment of requisite formalities.
