Radhakrishna, learned counsel appeared for the petitioner and Sri Challa Kodandaram Learned Senior Counsel, as instructed by Sri V. Srikantha Rao, learned counsel, appeared for the respondent. Both the learned counsel submitted arguments on the competency and jurisdiction of the Family Court-cum-7th Additional District Judge, Ananthapuramu, for passing orders in E.A.No.8 of 2022 in E.P.No.13 of 2016 in C.M.P.No.505 of 2012, dated 05.05.2022 due to the establishment of the Commercial Courts in the State of Andhra Pradesh. \n3) Sri M.Radhakrishna, learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted that a sole arbitrator was appointed to decide the disputes between the parties and he passed an Award, dated 13.10.2015, awarding certain amounts. The Award was challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Pursuant to further litigation, the matter reached the Commercial Court, Bellary. The litigation with regard to the said Award is still pending. In the meanwhile E.P.No.13 of 2016 was filed by the Decree Holder before the Principal District Judge, Anantapuramu, for bringing to sale the properties belonging to the Judgment Debtor. The same was transferred on 27.08.2019 to the Family Court, Anantapuramu, where the matter is now pending. Orders have been passed bringing the property for sale. The present CRP is filed questioning the orders, dated 05.05.2022, in E.A.No.8 of 2022 in E.P.No.13 of 2016, by which the Court ordered the issuance of sale certificate to the Decree Holder. \n4) The essential objection that is now raised before this Court is that after the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 came into force this Award can only be executed before the Commercial Court and that the regular District Judge did not have the jurisdiction to entertain this case. The value of the Award is Rs.32.86 crores along with interest etc. Therefore, learned counsel for the petitioner contends that this Award has to be executed before the Commercial Court only and not before the Principal District Judge, Anantapuramu or the transferee Court, the Family Court-cum-7th Additional District & Sessions Court, Anantapuramu. Learned counsel Sri Radhakrishna points out that it is an undisputed fact that the Award was passed on 13.10.2015 and the Commercial Courts Act came into force on 23.10.2015. He points out that initially by virtue of G.O.Ms.No.74, dated 10.06.2016, the Principal District and Sessions Courts in all the districts of the State of Andhra Pradesh were designated as Commercial Courts. But on 16.05.2019 by virtue of G.O.Ms.No.78, two Special Commercial Courts were constituted in the cities of Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada for the entire State of Andhra Pradesh. As far as the disputes pertaining to Anantapuramu are concerned they are under the jurisdiction of Commercial Court, Vijayawada, as per this G.O. The contention of the learned counsel, therefore, is that it is the Commercial Court, Vijayawada, alone that can entertain this Execution Petition and / or pass further orders. \n5) The contention of the respondents on the other hand, as far as jurisdiction is concerned, is that the Commercial Courts do not have the power to execute an Arbitration Award. Learned senior counsel contends that the execution of an Award, even if the same relates to a dispute of commercial value and commercial industry, can only be before a regular Civil Court as per the provisions of Order 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure. \n6) This is the sum and substance of the issue. \n7) Sri M.Radha Krishna, learned counsel argues that the 7th Additional District Judge is a coram non-judice and he does not have jurisdiction or power or to entertain the E.P. and to pass orders. He submits that since it is a question of an inherent lack of jurisdiction he is questioning the same in this CRP. He relies upon case law to argue that as the question of inherent lack of jurisdiction is raised this Court should decide this issue, since a decision on this matter would obviate the need for any further hearing etc. He relies upon Meenakshi Naidoo v. Subramaniya Sastri1 to submit that when the Court has no inherent jurisdiction the parties cannot confer the same on the court. He also relies upon Nammi Ganga Raju v. A. Ramakrishna2, Sri Vigneswara Swamy Devasthanam Sanghanm v. Commr., Endowments3. He relies upon the judgment of Sushil Kumar Mehta v. Gobind Ram Bohra4, and in particular para 26 to argue that if the Court has no jurisdiction at all and it goes to the root of the matter, the appearance of the parties will not cure the defect. \n8) Specifically, with regard to the Commercial Courts Act and the jurisdiction, learned counsel relies upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Jaycee 14 Indian Appeals 160 Laws (APH) 2002-12-107 2019 (6) ALT 435 Manu/SC/0593/1989 = (1990) 1 SCC 193 Housing Private limited and Others v. Registrar General, Orissa High Court, Cuttack and Others5, to argue that once the Commercial Courts are constituted, it is only the Commercial Court that has the jurisdiction to decide all the disputes including arbitration disputes above the specified value.\n9) Relying upon Section 3 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (for short \"the Act\") he argues that the Andhra Pradesh State Government has designated / constituted two Courts at Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada to hear all the commercial disputes over a specified value. Relying upon Section 10 of the Act learned counsel submits that in cases of arbitration disputes; jurisdiction has been conferred in case of international commercial arbitration to the Commercial Division of the High Court, and that as per Section 10 (3) of the Act if the dispute is \"other than the international commercial arbitration\" it shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising jurisdiction. Relying on this Section, it is strenuously argued that once the G.O. has been issued constituting the Commercial Court at Anantapuramu, Manu/SC/1363/2022 the execution can only be filed / continued before the said Court at Anantapuramu. Learned counsel also relies upon Section 15 of the Act to contend that all pending cases should be transferred to the Commercial Courts. He relies upon Sections 15 (1) to (4) of the Act for this submission. It is also pointed out that even if the suits and applications are not transferred by the Court an option is given under Section 15(5) of the Act to any of the parties to the litigation to withdraw such suit or an application and to transfer the same for trial or disposal to the Commercial Courts. \n10) Learned counsel emphasized that under Section 15 (1) of the Act pending suits and applications shall stand transferred. He emphasizes the words \"shall stand transferred\" and argues that a similar phrase fell for interpretation under the provisions of the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 (for short \"the RDDB Act\"). He relies upon the case of Punjab National Bank, Dasuya v. Chajju Ram6. He points out that this was a case pertaining to an Execution Petition, which was pending before the Civil Court. Since it is of the determined value the Supreme Court (2000) 6 SCC 655 held that it had to be transferred to the Tribunal only for execution. \n11) Coming to the case law on the point learned counsel relies upon the following judgments specifically to contend various High Courts have already held that the execution of the decree in a commercial dispute of the required value should be by the Commercial Court only:\ni) Vijay Cotton and Fiber Company v. Agarwal Cotton Spinning Pvt. Ltd7. (Gujarat High Court) \nii) The decision of the Rajasthan High Court in ESS Kay Fincorp Ltd. v. Suresh Choudhary8;\niii) A decision of the Delhi High Court reported in Delhi Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Pvt. Ltd., v. Himgiri Realtors Pvt. Ltd.,9 and iv) The decision of the Gujarat High Court in, Arun Kumar Jagatramka v. Ultrabulk A/S10. \n12) He also relies upon the Division Bench judgment of the Gujarat High Court in the case of OCI Corporation v.\nManu/GJ/0062/2019 2019 SCC OnLine Raj 7770 2021 SCC OnLine Del 3603 2022 Latest Case Law 1221 Guj = 2022 AIR (Guj) 69 Kandla Export Corporation and Others11, which was also challenged in the Supreme Court, but the SLP was dismissed. \n13) Learned counsel in particular emphasizes about the findings of the Hon'ble Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in Delhi Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Pvt. Ltd. (9 supra) and points out that the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court had considered the question threadbare and specifically looked into the question whether the Execution Petitions are \"applications\" within the meaning of the Commercial Courts Act. He draws the attention of this Court to paragraphs 34 to 41 of the reported judgment wherein the Division Bench has held ultimately that even an application for Execution shall lie before the Commercial Court only. The Division Bench also relied upon Section 38 of the CPC which empowers a Court which passes the Decree to execute the same. \n14) Relying upon the decision in Kandla Export Corporation case (11 supra), learned counsel submits that Sections 2, 6, 10 and 15 of the Commercial Courts Act were considered by the Division Bench in interpreting the Manu/GJ/2796/2016 Arbitration disputes and the Commercial Courts Act and ultimately it was held in paragraph 11 that all applications and appeals under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 are required to be transferred to the Commercial Division of the High Court of Gujarat, which is exercising original jurisdiction. He points out that the SLP filed in this case against the above mentioned judgment was dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on 03.03.2017 in SLP No.6557 of 2017. \n15) The contentions of Sri M. Radhakrishna can be summarized as follows:\na) The value of the Award is above Rs.32 crores and it is far above the commercial value as defined in the Commercial Courts Act. \nb) Since the Commercial Court at Vijayawada is constituted to exercise jurisdiction over the District at Anantapuramu, the E.P. cannot be entertained by the 7th Additional District Judge Court, Anantapuramu, and the said Court lacks the \"inherent jurisdiction\" to pass any orders in the matter. \nc) He submits that as it is a case of inherent lack of jurisdiction he can question the same at any stage and that, therefore, he has raised the issue before this Court. \nHe, therefore, submits that the CRP should be allowed on this question itself. \n16) In reply, Sri Challa Kodanda Ram, Learned Senior counsel also argues the matter at length. It is his primary contention that a decree can only be executed in the regular Civil Courts only under Order 21 C.P.C. and not by the Commercial Courts. \n17) First and foremost he relies upon the Constitution Bench judgment in the case of Dhulabhai v. State of M.P.12 to argue that the exclusion of the jurisdiction of a civil court cannot be inferred easily. He relies upon the conclusions of the Constitution Bench in paragraph 32 for this primary submission. He also relies upon two judgments of the Kerala High Court reported in Shaji Augustine v Chithra Woods AIR 1969 SC 78 = (1968) 3 SCR 662 Manors Welfare Association13 and a decision of the learned single Judge dated 07.03.2023 in the case of Beta Exim Logistics (P) Ltd. v. Central Railside Warehouse Co., Ltd.,14. He contends that Kerala High Court had analyzed the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act and Arbitration Act along with amendments in C.P.C. and rightly concluded that the Commercial Courts Act only deals with the hearing and disposal of Commercial disputes including arbitration disputes with a commercial flavor. He contends that the Commercial Act does not deal with execution applications which are still to be filed before a regular Civil Court only. As far as the judgment of the High Court in the cases of Kandla Export case (11 supra) the learned Senior Counsel submits that it was dealing with the international commercial arbitration and the transfer of the Execution Petition to the Commercial Division of the High Court, which was exercising original jurisdiction. He also points out that the further analysis carried out in the other judgments he refers to was not looked into by the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court. Lastly, he submits that the dismissal of the SLP does 2021 SCC OnLine Ker 9840 2023 SCC OnLine Ker 1392 not amount to a pronouncement on the merits of the matters nor does it means that the Hon'ble Supreme Court approved the findings of the Gujarat High Court. He points out that despite the amendments brought to the Commercial Courts Act, Arbitration Act and the CPC etc., no provision has been made conferring the power of \"execution\" on the Commercial Courts. He, therefore, submits that the correct view has been taken by the Kerala and Chhattisgarh High Courts and that by a process of interpretation this Court cannot create a jurisdiction and / or confer jurisdiction on a Court when the legislature in its wisdom did not choose to confer the said jurisdiction. He also relies upon South Eastern Coal-Fields Ltd., v Tirupati Construction District Burhar 15. He points out that the word \"application\" used in Section 15 of the Act does not refer to an Execution Petition. \nCOURT:\n18) This Court after considering the submissions notices that Sri M.Radha Krishna, learned counsel laid heavy emphasis on the discussion and the findings in Delhi Pharmaceuticals case (9 supra). In this judgment of the 2018 SCC OnLine Chh 63 Delhi High Court, the Division Bench held that the very purpose of constituting Commercial Courts namely the effective and quick adjudication of commercial disputes would be lost if the Execution Petitions were relegated to regular Civil Courts. The learned Judges held that a dispute does not come to an end with the decision by the Tribunal or the Court and that quietus is achieved only when the decree is executed. They held that the disputes can also arise even during the execution of the Arbitration Award, and the Commercial Court and Commercial Division would / should have jurisdiction over Award or a decree of a specified value. It was also noticed that the claimant or a party to the lis is interested in realizing the fruits of the decree and to hold that the Commercial Court would only have power to decide the lis but not the power to execute the same to give the fruits of the decree to the successful party, would sound the death knell of the Commercial Court. The Court also considered the fact that under Section 38 of C.P.C. the Court, which passed the decree, shall have the power to execute the same. To the same effect are the judgments of the Rajasthan High Court in ESS Kay Fincorp case (8 supra) and the Gujarat High Court judgment in Vijay Cotton and Fibre Company case (7 supra).\n19) The Kerala and the Chhattisgarh High Courts have, however, taken a different view. Learned single Judges of the Kerala High Court have noted that there is a conscious omission of the provisions relating to Execution under the CPC in the Commercial Courts Act. With regard to the judgment of the Kandla Export case (11 supra), which is cited by Sri M.Radha Krishna, the learned single Judge held that it is a case relating to an execution of international Award and, therefore, it is not applicable. Learned single Judge further held that if the doctrine of harmonious construction is adopted, as held in the Kandla Export case (11 supra) the Arbitration Act was held to be a special law vis a vis the more general Commercial Courts Act. He relied upon the earlier judgment reported in Shaji Augustine case (13 supra) wherein Section 15 of the Act was interpreted to hold that the meaning of the word 'application' occurring in Section 15 of the Act does not refer to Execution Petition. To the same effect is the Division Bench judgment of the Chhattisgarh High Court reported in South Eastern Coal Fields case (15 supra). Here the Division Bench held that the word 'application' in Section 15 (2) would mean an original application which was pending and not an Execution Application. \n20) In view of these contentions and the legal position, this Court is proposing to examine Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act and Order 21 CPC. The contention urged by the petitioner is that the Commercial Court alone should execute a decree above the specified value while the contention of the respondent is that the civil court alone should execute such a decree as the Commercial Courts Act does not deal with Order 21 C.P.C., at all. The meaning of the word \"application\" in Section 15 of the Act also assumes importance. \n21) Section 15 (1) of the Act deals with the commercial disputes pending in High Court. It is stated that all the suits and applications shall be transferred to the Commercial Division. Section 15 (2) is as follows:\n\"15 (2) All suits and applications, including applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a Commercial Court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such Commercial Court:\nProvided that no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the Court prior to the constitution of the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court shall be transferred either under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2).\"\n22) Section 15 (3) states that when suit or any application including an application under Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 stands transferred to the Commercial Court the provisions of - \"this Act shall apply to those procedures that were not completed at the time of transfer\".\n23) Section 6 is to the following effect - \"6. Jurisdiction of Commercial Court.--The Commercial Court shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value arising out of the entire territory of the State over which it has been vested territorial jurisdiction.\" \n24) Chapter-VI of the Commercial Court Act deals with the amendments to provisions of Code of Civil Procedure 1908. Section 16 (1) of the Act says that the provisions of CPC shall in their application to any suit be amended as specified in the schedule. Section 16 (2) of the Act states that Commercial Courts shall follow \"the provisions of CPC as amended by this Court in the trial of a suit in respect of Commercial dispute\". The Schedule, which is specified in the Act, in particular amends the 1st schedule of the CPC. In the Schedule of the Act, Clause 4 (A) deals with Order 5 of the CPC (Time for written statement). Clause 4 (B) deals with pleadings in a commercial dispute (Order 6). Clause 4 (C) deals with Order 7 Rule 2 (Again plaint). Clause 4 (D) deals with Order 8 (written statement). Order 7 is also suitably amended to deal with disclosure, discovery and inspection of documents in suits before the Commercial Division of a High court or a commercial Court. Order 11 Rule 1 deals with the plaintiffs list of documents etc. Order 11 Rule 7 deals with defendants list of documents and further deals with discovery of interrogatories, inspection, admission and denial of documents. Order 13A dealing with summary judgment is also amended. \n25) A reading of these sections and amendments in seriatim shows that the intention of the legislature was only to modify and streamline the procedures and practices relating to suits and applications in suits etc., which are pending for disposal. \n26) The heading of Chapter VI of the Act is - \"Amendments to the Provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908\". The amendments to the CPC, refer to the 1st schedule and specifically to Orders 5, 6, 8, 11, 13 (A) of CPC etc., and in addition a newly incorporated Order 15(A) is brought into force. All of them deal with trial and disposal of a suit only. None of the other provisions of the CPC are touched or amended including Order 21 CPC. \n27) In the opinion of this Court this deliberate silence by the legislature, in spite of the need for a law on the subject for quick and efficient disposal of the cases, including commercial disputes, being on everyone's mind makes it very clear that the legislature in its wisdom decided to speed up the trial and disposal of the cases in the commercial court alone. Time and again the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and various courts have spoken about the need for quick disposal of domestic and international commercial disputes. Hence a conscious effort was made by the Legislature to change the provisions of CPC regarding the trial and disposal of cases for a quicker disposal of the suits and applications. In this Court's opinion and as per settled law the assumption is that the legislature did not make a mistake. It did what it set out to do - to speed up trials. The silence or failure to refer to Order 21 does not mean that the Commercial Court cannot execute a decree. A purposive interpretation has to be given to the provisions of the Act. If it is not so interpreted the Commercial Courts will be powerless in many aspects. If the arguments of the learned senior counsel for the respondent are further extended and as other provisions of C.P.C. are also not touched upon / referred to it would mean - that the Commercial Court cannot add or delete parties (Order-I); cannot bring on record the legal representatives (Order 22); cannot grant injunctions (Order 39); order attachment or arrest before judgment (Order 38) and so on. These are a few illustrative aspects that are touched upon. This would virtually render the Commercial Courts non- effective and virtually defeat their purpose / objective. Can it be said that since Order 38 or Order 39 are not mentioned the Commercial Court cannot grant an interim order? This would lead to a collapse of these Courts. \n28) The special purpose - namely the quick disposal of commercial cases- and the purpose behind the Act is also strengthened by the contents of Section 6 which states that the Commercial Court can be conferred jurisdiction over the entire State unlike the restriction in Section 15 to Section 20 of CPC etc. The appeals pending in the Commercial Appeal Division are also to be disposed within six months as per Sec 16 of the Act. The clear bar against the revision application or petition against interlocutory application notwithstanding anything to the contrary in law in Section 9 of the Act, further strengthens this Court's conclusions that the emphasis was on quick and early disposal of cases. \n29) Section 16 of the Act is as follows:-\n\"16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes.--(1) The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule.\n(2) The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value. (3) Where any provision of any Rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail.\" \n30) Section 16(3) makes it clear that the amendments to the CPC made by this Act shall \"prevail\" over amendments made by the State Government or over the jurisdictional High Courts Rules. This is again done to facilitate quick disposal of suits and applications. Even the High Court Rules have to give way to these amendments. \n31) Further, in this Court's opinion the word 'application' occurring in Section 15 of the Act is also not limited to original applications only or to application in suits. Support can be drawn from the provisions of Order 21 CPC itself dealing with execution. Order 21 Rule 10 starts with the words - \"Application\" for Execution. Rule 11 says an oral \"application\" is permissible. Order 21 Rule 11(2) talks of a written \"application\" Similarly Rules 11A, 12, 13, 16 talk of \"applications\" for execution. The use of the words suits and applications including applications under the Arbitration Act 1996\" make it clear that it is not merely limited to suits and arbitration applications only. An inclusive definition is given to include all \"applications\" under Section 15. The intention of the Legislature is also clear from a reading of Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act, which deals with applications and appeals under the Arbitration Act. They are dealt with under this Section. This Court, therefore, holds that the word \"application\" in Section 15 includes execution applications also. The inclusive definition in Section 15(1) makes this clear. \n32) Even with regard to enforcement and execution this Court feels that the Arbitration Act, 1996 made the issue clear since the CPC is not applicable per se to the proceedings before an Arbitration Tribunal. Section 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act as it stood earlier was as follows:\n\"36 Enforcement:- Where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under section 34 has expired, or such application having been made, it has been refused, the award shall be enforced under the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (Act 5 of 1908) in the same manner as if it were a decree of the Court.\"\n33) Section 36 after amendment by Act 3 of 2016 is as follows:\n36. Enforcement.-(1) Where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under section 34 has expired, then, subject to the provisions of sub- section (2), such award shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court.\nIn view of the non-applicability of C.P.C. to Arbitrations this clarity was given with respect to execution of Awards in a Civil Court. On the other hand this 2015 Act is called the Commercial Courts Act itself. \n34) The purpose and intent of the Act is to provide for the constitution of Commercial Courts for adjudicating Commercial disputes of specified value and matters connected therewith and incidental thereto. Hence, a purposive and meaningful interpretation must be given - which means that quick disposal of commercial cases would include quick disposal of execution applications for enforcing the judgments passed. The conclusions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Jaycee Housing Private limited case (5 supra) in para 10 and 11 also supports this view. \n\"10. Thus, the Objects and Reasons of Commercial Courts Act, 2015 is to provide for speedy disposal of the commercial disputes which includes the arbitration proceedings. To achieve the said Objects, the legislature in its wisdom has specifically conferred the jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters as per Section 10 of the Act, 2015. At this stage, it is required to be noted that the Act, 2015 is the Act later in time and therefore when the Act, 2015 has been enacted, more particularly Sections 3 & 10, there was already a provision contained in Section 2(1)(e) of the Act, 1996. As per settled position of law, it is to be presumed that while enacting the subsequent law, the legislature is conscious of the provisions of the Act prior in time and therefore the later Act shall prevail. It is also required to be noted that even as per Section 15 of the Act, 2015, all suits and applications including applications under the Act, 1996, relating to a commercial dispute of specified value shall have to be transferred to the Commercial Court. Even as per Section 21 of the Act, 2015, Act, 2015 shall have overriding effect. It provides that save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force. \n11. Therefore, considering the afore-stated provisions of the Act, 2015 and the Objects and Reasons for which the Act, 2015 has been enacted and the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts are established for speedy disposal of the commercial disputes including the arbitration disputes, Sections 3 & 10 of the Act, 2015 shall prevail and all applications or appeals arising out of arbitration under the provisions of Act, 1996, other than international commercial arbitration, shall be filed in and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Courts, exercising the territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial courts have been constituted. If the submission on behalf of the Appellants that of Act, 1 civil other than the international commercial arbitration, shall lie before the principal civil Court of a district, in that case, not only the Objects and Reasons of enactment of Act, 2015 and establishment of commercial courts shall be frustrated, even Sections 3, 10 & 15 shall become otiose and nugatory. If the submission on behalf of the Appellants is accepted, in that case, though with respect to other commercial disputes, the applications or appeals shall lie before the commercial courts established and constituted Under Section 3 of Act, 2015, with respect to arbitration proceedings, the applications or appeals shall lie before the principal civil Court of a district. There cannot be two fora with respect to different commercial disputes. \nUnder the circumstances, notification issued by the State of Odisha issued in consultation with the High Court of Orissa to confer jurisdiction upon the court of learned Civil Judge (Senior Division) designated as Commercial Court to decide the applications or appeals arising out of arbitration under the provisions of Act, 1996 cannot be said to be illegal and bad in law. On the contrary, the same can be said to be absolutely in consonance with Sections 3 & 10 of Act, 2015. We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court holding so.\" \n35) There cannot be two courts/fora:- one for the dispute resolution and one for execution of the decree passed. \n36) Section 38 of C.P.C. clearly states that the decree may be executed by the Court that passed it or the Court to which it was sent for execution. Therefore, this Court holds that a commercial court can execute a decree passed by itself or even execute a decree sent for execution under Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act or by transfer from another Commercial Court. \n37) For all the above mentioned reasons it is held that the Commercial Court has the jurisdiction to execute its own decree or a decree transferred / sent to it, where the value is above the specified limit. \n38) This Court respectfully agrees with the views of the Kerala and Chhattisgarh High Courts and respectfully disagrees with the view taken by the other learned Judges of the Gujarat, Delhi and other High Courts. \n39) In conclusion this Court would like to again rely upon para 35 of the Division Bench judgment of the Gujarat High Court reported in OCI Corporation case (11 supra). The question that was specifically raised in that matter was whether the Execution Petition would fall within the ambit of Section 15 (2) of the Commercial Courts Act and which court would have jurisdiction. This was ultimately answered by the Division Bench by considering the law on the subject. In para-10 the following question as posted and in para-11 the answer is given as follows:\n\"10. Now, next question posed for consideration of this Court is whether execution petitions pending before the concerned District Court as on 23.10.2015 which are filed for execution / enforcement of the foreign award are required to be transferred, and if yes, to which Court? \n11. The sum and substance of the above discussion would be, \"(1) Where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, all the applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such commercial Division has been constituted in the High Court i.e. in the present case High Court of Gujarat. \n(2) Where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute but not of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, considering the provisions of Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 the same shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the concerned High Court. (3) Where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is other than international arbitration, all the applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 shall be filed in and heard, decided and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial court has been constituted.\" \nConsidering section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act, all the applications/appeals in question under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, therefore are required to be transferred to the concerned Commercial Division of the High Court of Gujarat or before the Gujarat High Court or before the concerned commercial court and as observed hereinabove and as the case may be.\"\n40) The SLP filed against this judgment was also dismissed. The essence and ratio of this judgment is that arbitration Awards can be executed by the Commercial Court / Commercial Division of the High Court respectively. This view supports the conclusion of this Court. \n41) The next and equally important question that arises out this discussion is about the progress of this particular award / execution in various Courts. \n42) As far as the history of the Execution Proceedings is concerned, the following dates are important:\ni) Award was passed by the Arbitrator on 13.10.2015. \nii) On 23.10.2015 the Commercial Courts Act came into force. \niii) On 18.01.2016 the respondent DHr., filed E.P.No.13 of 2016 before the Principal District Judge, Anantapuramu. \niv) On 10.06.2016 the 1st G.O.MS.No.74 was issued by the State of Andhra Pradesh, by which all the Principal District and Sessions Courts were designated as Commercial Courts in the State of Andhra Pradesh. \nv) On 16.05.2019 the G.O.Ms.No.78 was issued constituting only two commercial Courts in the State of Andhra Pradesh at Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam.\n43) It is therefore, clear that by 18.01.2016 when the E.P.No.13 of 2016 was filed the Commercial Courts were not formally constituted in the State of Andhra Pradesh. \n44) On 10.06.2016 by virtue of G.O.Ms.No.74 all the Courts of the District and Sessions Courts in the State of Andhra Pradesh were designated as Commercial Courts. \n45) From 10.06.2016 till 15.05.2016 this position continued. However, with effect from 16.05.2019 only two Commercial Courts were designated as having jurisdiction over the 13 districts of the State of Andhra Pradesh. \n(G.O.Ms.No.78) \n46) The Family Court, Anantapuramu District was entertaining the present E.P., consequent on the transfer of the case by the District Judge, Anantapuram on 27.08.2019. \n47) Thereafter, the matter was pending before the 7 th Additional District Judge-cum-Family Court, Anantapuramu. \n48) In view of the conclusions arrived at by this Court that it is only the Commercial Courts that have the jurisdiction and authority to execute the judgment and entertain the Execution Petition, this Court has to hold that with effect from 16.05.2019 it is only the Commercial Court at Anantapuram, which could entertain the Execution Petition or pass orders thereon. No other Court could pass orders, in view of the conferment of the exclusive jurisdiction on the Commercial Court at Anantapuramu. \n49) The counsel for the revision petitioner argues that the orders are void ab intio and that no further declaration is necessary. According to him with effect from 16.05.2019 no other Courts, except the Commercial Court at Anantapuram, has the jurisdiction and consequently the 7th Additional District Court-cum-Family Court, Anantapuram is a corum non-judice. He cites a large volume of case law on this aspect including Meenakshi Naidoo case (1 supra); Nammi Ganga Raju case (2 supra) and other cases to argue that the defect of jurisdiction strikes at the very root of the authority of the Court to pass the order and that the \"participation\" of the revision petitioner or the failure to raise an objection will not clothe the Family Court, Anantapuramu with jurisdiction. He also argues that the question relating to such inherent lack of jurisdiction can be raised in any proceeding and even in collateral proceeding. According to him all the orders passed after 16.05.2019 by the Family Court, Anantapuramu are a nullity in the eye of law. He submits that he has raised this ground in the CRP, which is taken up as a lead case and is arguing the matter. \n50) Sri Challa Kodanda Ram, learned senior counsel defended this case and argued that the submissions made by Sri M. Radha Krishna do not meet the tests laid down in Dhulabhai case (12 supra). He also argues that the petitioner had adequate and proper remedies under the provisions of the CPC to raise the issues and that instead of doing so he filed the present CRP No.2183 of 2022 under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. He submits that this Court will have to exercise its very restricted jurisdiction and the discipline necessary to reject the application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India when there is a remedy of appeal provided for. He also relies upon extensive case law including Virudhunagar Hindu Nadargal Dharma Paribalana Sabai v. Tuticorin Educational Society16 to argue this point. \n51) While the submissions of the learned senior counsel appear to be attractive the fact remains that in view of the conclusion reached by this Court about the inherent lack of jurisdiction in the Family Court, Anantapuramu, with effect from 16.05.2019, this Court need not deter itself or impose restrictions on its power. The conclusion reached by this Court is that all the actions taken in E.P.No.13 of 2016 on and from 16.05.2019 are bad in law. These orders cannot be sustained under law. If the orders are non-est no further (2019) 9 SCC 538 declaration is necessary. The E.P. cannot be continued in the Court of the 7th Additional District Judge-cum-Family Court, Anantapuramu. \n52) In view of the power vested in this Court under Section 15(3) of the Commercial Courts Act, and in view of the submissions made by both the learned counsel it is directed that the E.P.No.13 of 2016 shall be immediately transferred to the Commercial Court, Vijayawada, which has the jurisdiction over the Anantapuramu District. It is reiterated that all orders passed after 16.05.2019 in the Execution Petition are non-est in the eye of law. This Court is conscious of the Judgment in Dhulabhai case (12 supra), wherein it is held that the exclusion of Civil Court's Jurisdiction should not be lightly presumed or entered. By virtue of the case law and the provisions of the Commercial Court's Act, this Court has to conclude that as it is a case of an inherent lack of jurisdiction and a statutory embargo or bar the judgment of the Constitution Bench in Dhulabhai case (12 supra) will not apply to the facts and circumstances of the case. As it is a limitation on jurisdiction due to a statute; the Family Court, Anantapuramu, cannot take up the cause or the matter. Its orders are a nullity in the eye of law. \n53) Therefore, the following conclusions are reached by ironing out the creases:\na) The Commercial Court alone is competent to execute decrees, which are above the specified value. The regular Civil Court will not have the jurisdiction to entertain such Execution Petitions with effect from 16.05.2019 in the State of Andhra Pradesh. \nb) It is only the Commercial Court, Vijayawada or the Commercial Court at Visakhapatnam which can entertain the Execution Petitions if they are above the specified value in view of the G.O.Ms.No.78.\nc) All orders passed after 16.05.2019 are orders passed by a coram non-judice. They suffer from an inherent lack of jurisdiction and they are held to be per se bad in law. \nd) The pending E.P.No.13 of 2016 shall be transferred to the Commercial Court, Vijayawada, and both the parties are given liberty to start the proceedings afresh from the said date i.e., 16.05.2019. \n54) In view of these findings CRP No.2183 of 2022 is allowed, since it questions the order, dated 05.05.2022, which is an order without jurisdiction. Similarly, CRP No.701 of 2022 is also allowed as the order dated 17.01.2022 is held to be passed by a Court which has no jurisdiction. C.R.P.No.1797 of 2022 is also allowed as it deals with the Sale Certificate, dated 18.08.2022, which is granted by a Court which has no jurisdiction. C.R.P.No.1254 of 2022 is also allowed as it questions the order, dated 18.01.2022, setting aside the sale of D & E properties in E.P.No.13 of 2016. No costs. \n55) Consequently, the Miscellaneous Petitions pending, if any, in these Civil Revision Petitions shall also stand closed. \n__________________________ D.V.S.S.SOMAYAJULU, J _________________________________ DUPPALA VENKATA RAMANA, J Date:12.09.2023 Note: LR copy be marked. \nIssue CC in 7 days B/o Ssv THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE D.V.S.S.SOMAYAJULU and HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE DUPPALA VENKATA RAMANA C.R.P.Nos.1254; 701; 1797 AND 2183 of 2022 Dated: .09.2023 Ssv",

(b) whether a commercial court can condone a delay beyond 30 days, after expiry of three months from the date of receipt of the arbitral award? (c) whether the explanation offered by the respondent for seeking condonation of delay is sufficient to condone the delay? (d) whether the learned commercial court is competent to hear and adjudicate a commercial appeal? 11. in support of the grounds, learned senior counsel for the appellant has submitted that from a plain reading of the substantive provisions of section 34(3) of the act, it would be clear that it provides for twin limitations for presentation of a petition for setting aside an arbitral award, namely, (i) three months from the date on which the party making that petition had received the arbitral award; or (ii) if a request under section 33 of the act is made, three months from the date on which that request is disposed of by the arbitral tribunal. 12. according to the appellant, the period of limitation is to be counted from the date the party had received the arbitral award, i.e. 25.07.2022. section 5 of the act mandates that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by part-i, no judicial authority shall intervene, except where so provided in the said part-i of the act. since section 34 falls within part-i, it is subject to section 5 of the act. therefore, the judicial authority which empowers a commercial court under section 34 of the act or a commercial appellate court under section 37 of the act could not intervene in matters governed by part-i unless the same is expressly authorized to intervene. it is further submitted that an issue of limitation ousts the jurisdiction of a court. therefore, the court would not have jurisdiction, if a subject matter is otherwise barred by limitation. in view of the express provision contained in section 5 of the act, the aid of section 12(1) of the limitation act, 1963 cannot be taken. even otherwise, section 29(2) of the limitation act, 1963 expressly provides where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application, a period of limitation, different from the period prescribed by the schedule of the said act, the provisions of section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period prescribed by the schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions of section 4 to 24 of the limitation act shall apply insofar as, and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. 13. it is further submitted that a contrast of section 12(1) of the limitation act, 1963 and the substantive part of section 34(3) of the act would show that the date of commencement of limitation, prescribed in the two different statutes are at variance and in fact, they run in tangents. therefore, the special limitation, provided in section 34(3) of the act would override the general prescriptions contained in the limitation act, 1963 both under the principles of (i) special law always supersedes a general law (generalia specialibus non derogant); and (ii) section 29(2) of the limitation act, 1963 mandates that when a special prescription is made in a special law, the provisions of sections 4 to 24 of the limitation act would yield to the prescriptions contained in the said special act; and (iii)section 43(1) of the act mandates that the limitation act, 1963 shall apply to the arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in court. learned counsel for the appellant has, therefore, submitted that the period for limitation for presentation of a petition under section 34 of the act commences from the date of receipt of the arbitral award by a party and not from the day following the receipt of the award. he has placed reliance on the following decisions in support of his submission: (i) union of india vs. tecco trichy enginers & contractors, (2005) 4 scc 239 (para 4, 6, 8 & 9) (ii) state of maharashtra & ors. vs. ark builders pvt. ltd., (2011) 4 scc 616 (para 1 & 14) (iii) anil kumar jinabhai patel vs. pravin chandra jinabhai patel & ors., (2018) 15 scc 178 (para 13.2 & 18) (iv) p radha bai & ors. vs. p ashok kmar & anr. (2019) 13 scc 445 (para 32.1, 32.2 & 32.3) (v) dakshin haryana bijli vitran nigam ltd., vs navigant technologies private limited., (2021) 7 scc 657 (para 2, 10, 11, 18, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34 & 35) 14. learned senior counsel for the appellant submits that applying the principles laid down in the aforesaid decisions and the language of section 34(3) of the act the period of limitation for filing objection to the award would commence from the day the copy of the award was received, i.e. 25th july, 2022. according to the appellant, the expressions ̳three months' and ̳thirty days' used in substantive part of section 34(3) and its proviso in cumulative effect would be interpreted to mean a total period of 90 + 30 days, total 120 days to be reckoned from the date of receipt of a signed award from the arbitral tribunal. he has further placed reliance upon bhimashankar sahakari sakkare karkhane niyamita vs. walchandnagar industries limited (wil), reported in (2023) 8 scc 453 (para 3, 45, 52 & 58). as per the calculation of the appellant, the period of 120 days reckoned from the date of receipt of the award expire on 21st november, 2022. therefore, the application under section 34 of the act filed on 24.11.2022 was barred by delay of three days which is not condonable, in view of the specific decision rendered by the apex court in union of india vs. tecco trichy engineers & contractors, reported in (2005) 4 scc 239 and the expression ―but not thereafter‖ contained in the proviso to section 34(3) of the act. therefore, the learned commercial court fell into patent error of law in computing the period of limitation in both the section 34 petitions and condoning the delay. 15. in respect of issue no. (ii), learned senior counsel for the appellant has submitted that admittedly the works were executed at longtharai valley, which fall under the subject matter jurisdiction of the learned commercial court, dhalai district, ambassa, and therefore, applying the statutory prescriptions contained in section 2(1)(e) of the act read with section 5 and section 42 thereof, it is beyond any dispute that only the learned commercial court, dhalai district would have jurisdiction to decide and adjudicate a petition under section 34 of the act. 16. in respect of issue no. (iii), learned senior counsel for the appellant has referred to the provisions of section 2(1)(e) of the act and submitted that learned commercial court, holding the substantive post of additional district judge (as contradistinguished from district judge) is incompetent to hear and adjudicate the commercial appeal. it suffers from the vice of coram non judice and inherent lack of jurisdiction. 17. in respect of issue no.(iv), learned senior counsel for the appellant has submitted that from a reading of the condonation application it would transpire that the respondent has offered stereotype explanation referring to red tape which cannot be accepted under the proviso to section 34(3) of the act. based on these submissions it is prayed that the impugned orders may be set aside and wholly unsustainable in law. 18. the counting of 90+30, total 120 days from the date of receipt of the award, i.e. 25th july, 2022 has been placed in a tabular chart which is also extracted hereunder: ―i. july, 2022 from 25.07.2022 to 31.07.2022 (both days + 7 days inclusive) ii. august, 2022 + 31 days iii. september, 2022 + 30 days iv. october, 2022 + 31 days v. 21.11.2022 + 21 days total = 120 days thus, 120 days had expired on 21.11.2022.‖ 19. on behalf of the respondent, it has been submitted that the appellant entered appearance before the learned commercial court, west tripura on receipt of the summons but chose not to file any written objection against the condonation petition filed by the respondent herein in each of the cases. however, at the time of hearing the counsel for the appellant verbally raised two fold legal objection: (i) learned commercial court, west tripura has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the section 34 application as the subject matter of the case is situated within longtharai valley sub-division, dhalai tripura within the jurisdiction of learned commercial court, dhalai ambassa; and (ii) the delay is beyond 30 days after the expiry of three months from the date of receipt of the award which expired on 23.11.2022. this fact is admitted as stated in the memo of appeal. 20. however, the learned court allowed the condonation application holding that in view of section 2(1)(e) of the act read with section 20 of the cpc, the court had the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the application under section 34. it further held that there is only a delay of 30 days under section 34(3) and in view of section 12(1) of the limitation act and the decision rendered in the case of himachal techno engineer (supra) the reasons for delay were successfully explained in the condonation application., it is, however, submitted that in the memo of appeal the appellant has set out four questions of law for consideration by this court which are available at para 2.1 (i) to (iv) at page 21 of the paper book. 21. learned counsel for the respondent has in answer to those issues made the following submissions. in reply to issue no. (i) it has been submitted by the respondent that in view of section 20 of the cpc, since the appellant-sole defendant resides at agartala within the jurisdiction of the district commercial court, west tripura the cause of action in part arose at agartala as the impugned award was also passed at agartala. therefore, the learned court rightly held that it had territorial jurisdiction over the case to decide the petition under section 34 of the act and the connected condonation petition. 22. it is further submitted that though the appellant has challenged the jurisdiction of the district commercial court, west tripura, agartala but he has himself filed an execution application against the above awards on 23rd march, 2023 being execution (m)19/2023 and execution(m)20/2023 arising out of the same awards which are under challenge and subject matter of application under section 34 of the act. so the appellant cannot be allowed to take dual stand before two different forums of law for two different subject matters. even if for sake of argument it is presumed that the court below had no territorial jurisdiction to deal with the subject matter of the case then the remedy lies under order vii rule 10 & 10a of cpc to return the plaint/application to present it before the appropriate court by fixing a date for presentation and appearance of parties and hearing from the same stage but not dismissal of the application. he has referred to the decision of the apex court in oriental insurance company ltd. vs. tejparas associates and exports pvt. ltd., reported in (2019) 9 scc 435, paragraphs 3, 8, 11 and 14. 23. in response to the 2nd issue i.e. whether a commercial court can condone a delay beyond 30 days after expiry of three months from the date of receipt of the arbitral award the learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that it is the settled law that no application under section 34(3) of the act beyond the period of ―three months‖ plus 30 days from the date of receipt of award is maintainable and the same is barred by law of limitation and no court can condone the delay ―thereafter‖. it is the case of the respondent that in preferring the application under section 34 of the act there was a delay of 30 days and the same has been explained. to decide the actual period of limitation as prescribed under section 34(3) of the act, i.e. ―may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award‖ and if the appellant is prevented by sufficient reason within three months period it may entertain the application ―within further period of thirty days but not thereafter‖ there is need to understand the meaning of the period of ̳three months' and ̳from' and to know the true intention of the legislature for using the term ̳three months' and not ̳90 days' wherein the proviso mentions 30 days but not ̳one month'. the terms ̳month' has been defined under section 3(35) of the general causes act, 1897. ̳month' means a month reckoned according to the british calendar. section 4 of the said act further provides that this definition will be applicable to all central acts made after the 3 rd january, 1868 and all regulations made on or after the fourteenth day of january, 1887. so, it is applicable to find out the actual period of ̳three months' as per said act. 24. the learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that as per british calendar month a month may be of 28/29/30 or 31 days. so the period of three months will vary as per actual calendar month which may be 89/90/91 or 92 days. as per section 9(1), (2) of the general clauses act, 1897 the term ̳from' be used by excluding the first in a series of days or any other period of time, and for the purpose of the use of the word ̳to' to include the last day in a series. similar provisions [section 12(1) and (2)] contained in the limitation act, 1963 provide for calculation of limitation, whereby the first day from which the period is reckoned shall be excluded. therefore, the respondent has submitted that in calculating the period of limitation the date of receipt of award will be excluded as per section 12(1) of the limitation act, 1963 read with section 9(1) and (2) of the general clauses act, 1897. 25. it is further submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent that on a plain reading of sections 43(1) & (3) of the arbitration and conciliation act read with section 29(2) of the limitation act, 1963 it becomes clear that the provisions of limitation act applies to arbitration matters and thereby sections 4 to 24 of the limitation act will be applicable in proceeding under section 34 of the act as operation of these provisions are not specifically excluded by the arbitration & conciliation act except section 5. therefore, the submission of the appellant regarding nonapplicability of section 12(1) of the limitation act in counting the period of limitation, and expiry of period of ̳three months plus 30 days' on 23.11.2022 and thereby the application filed on 24.11.2022 being barred by law is nothing but a misconceived one. the period of ―three months‖ as prescribed under section 34(3) of the act does not mean 90 days. in support of his above contentions, the learned counsel for the respondent has referred to the following decisions of the apex court: (i) consolidated engineering enterprises vs. principal secretary, irrigation department & ors., (2008) 7 scc 169, para 10,11,13,14 & 15 (ii) state of himachal pradesh & anr., vs. himachal techno engineers & anr., (2010) 12 scc 210 , para 3, 5, 8, 9, 10,11 & 12 (iii) simplex infrastructure limited vs. union of india (2019) 2 scc 505 : air 2019 sc 505, para 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 & 12 26. in response to issue nos. (iii) & (iv), learned counsel for the respondent submits that these issues have been raised for the first time before this court. as such, these should not be entertained. it is further submitted that the constitution of commercial court for the west tripura district, i.e. the court of the additional district judge, court no.2, agartala as commercial court, west tripura was done as per section 3(1) & (3) of the commercial courts act, 2015 by the state government after consultation with the high court by notification in the official gazette and till date there is no challenge to the appointment or designation of the said post. as such, the same cannot be raised before this court at the appellate stage. if the submission of the appellant is accepted it would create a judicial chaos as regards the fate of all the orders passed by that court since its designation. 27. we have considered the submission of the parties at length. we have also gone through the relevant provisions of the arbitration & conciliation act, 1996 as amended, the commercial courts act, 2015, the limitation act, 1963 and the general clauses act, 1897. the basic issue which seeks an answer in the present appeal is whether the application under section 34 of the act was barred by delay or not. in order to appreciate this issue, it is relevant to refer to the provisions of section 34(3) of the act. ―(3) an application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal: provided that if the court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.‖ 28. section 34(3) provides that an application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making the application had received the arbitral award. rest of the provision following thereafter under section 34(3) does not have relevance in determination of the issue at hand. 29. according to the appellant, this expression does not permit any other interpretation relying upon section 12(1) of the limitation act, 1963 or section 9 of the general clauses act, 1897 in view of the specific language used in section 5 of the act and section 29(2) of the limitation act. 30. on the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent has placed reliance on the provision of section 12(1) of the limitation act and section 9(1) and (2) of the general clauses act. both the parties have placed reliance upon certain decisions in support of their submissions. in order to answer this issue, we proceed to deal with the cases cited on behalf of the parties hereinafter. 31. in the case of union of india vs. tecco trichy engineers & contractors, reported in (2005) 4 scc 239 the question which arose for decision in appeal was: which is the effective date on which the appellant was delivered with and received the arbitral award as that would be date wherefrom the limitation within the meaning under section 34(3) of the act would be calculated. the apex court held that under section 34(3) of the arbitration and conciliation act, the limitation of three months commences from the date on which the party making the application had received the arbitral award. in the facts of the said case it was held that the service of arbitral award on the general manager by way of receipt in his inwards office could not be taken to be sufficient notice so as to activate the department to take appropriate steps in respect of and in regard to the award passed by the arbitrators to constitute the starting point of limitation for the purposes of section 34(3) of the act. it was further held that delivery of an arbitral award under section 31(5) is not a matter of mere formality rather a matter of substance. the stage of termination of the arbitral proceedings under section 32 arises only after the stage under section 31 has passed. the delivery of arbitral award to the party, to be effective, has to be received the party. the opinion of the apex court at para 8 of the report is extracted hereunder: \"8. the delivery of an arbitral award under sub-section (5) of section 31 is not a matter of mere formality. it is a matter of substance. it is only after the stage under section 31 has passed that the stage of termination of arbitral proceedings within the meaning of section 32 of the act arises. the delivery of arbitral award to the party, to be effective, has to be ―received‖ by the party. this delivery by the arbitral tribunal and receipt by the party of the award sets in motion several periods of limitation such as an application for correction and interpretation of an award within 30 days under section 33(1), an application for making an additional award under section 33(4) and an application for setting aside an award under section 34(3) and so on. as this delivery of the copy of award has the effect of conferring certain rights on the party as also bringing to an end the right to exercise those rights on expiry of the prescribed period of limitation which would be calculated from that date, the delivery of the copy of award by the tribunal and the receipt thereof by each party constitutes an important stage in the arbitral proceedings.‖ 32. in the case of state of maharashtra vs. ark builers (p) ltd., reported in (2011) 4 scc 616, the question which arose for consideration in the appeal was whether the period of limitation for making an application under section 34 of the act for setting aside an arbitral award is to be reckoned from the date a copy of the award is received by the objector by any means and from any source, or it would start running from the date a signed copy of the award is delivered to him by the arbitrator. the apex court laid emphasis on para 8 of the decision of tecco trichy engineers & contractors (supra) and held that the period of limitation prescribed under section 34(3) of the act would start running only from the date a signed copy of the award is delivered to or received by the party making the application for setting it aside under section 34(1) of the act. if the law prescribes that a copy of the order/award is to be communicated, delivered, dispatched, forwarded, rendered or sent to the parties concerned in a particular way and in case the law also sets a period of limitation for challenging the order/award in question by the aggrieved party, then the period of limitation can only commence from the date on which the order/award was received by the party concerned in the manner prescribed by law. at para 15 of the judgment the apex court held: \"15. the highlighted portion of the judgment extracted above, leaves no room for doubt that the period of limitation prescribed under section 34(3) of the act would start running only from the date a signed copy of the award is delivered to/received by the party making the application for setting it aside under section 34(1) of the act. the legal position on the issue may be stated thus. if the law prescribes that a copy of the order/award is to be communicated, delivered, dispatched, forwarded, rendered or sent to the parties concerned in a particular way and in case the law also sets a period of limitation for challenging the order/award in question by the aggrieved party, then the period of limitation can only commence from the date on which the order/award was received by the party concerned in the manner prescribed by the law.‖ 33. in the case of anil kumar jinabhai patel vs. pravin chandra jinabhai patel & ors., reported in (2018) 15 scc 178 some of the parties were not individually served with copy of the award. in those circumstances it was observed that receipt of the signed copy of award by all the parties is not necessary when such parties were represented by the head/common power-ofattorney holder who received the award on their behalf, he being the person directly connected with and in control of the proceedings. by cumulative reading of section 34(3) and section 31(5) of the act, it was clear that the limitation period prescribed under section 34(3) of the act would commence only from the date of signed copy of the award delivered to the party making the application for setting it aside. 34. in the case of oriental insurance company limited, vs. tejparas associates & exports (p) ltd., reported in (2019) 9 scc 435 the proceedings under section 34 of the act were dismissed on grounds of limitation which also led to the dismissal of the appeal under section 37 of the act. the primary consideration in the said appeal was whether the dismissal of the section 34 petition on limitation grounds was justified. in that case, the petition under section 34 was initially filed within the prescribed time frame but was returned and re-presented after a delay, leading to a contention regarding the condonation of delay. the apex court referred to subsequent amendments to the cpc which provided clarity on the procedure for representation, indicating that it may not always be treated as a fresh filing. the appellant's petition under section 34 of the act was initially filed within the limitation period but was returned by the court at jaipur under order 7 rule 10 cpc for re-representation before the competent court fixing a date for appearance. the appellant failed to re-present the petition on the specified date, resulting in an 8-day delay when it was re-presented eventually at the district court in jodhpur. the respondent filed an application under section 3 of the limitation act, prompting the appellant to file an application under section 14 of the limitation act seeking condonation of delay. the delay in this case pertained to the re-presentation of the petition, not the initial filing, and thus, the application for exclusion of time was available under section 14 of the limitation act. therefore, the apex court held that denying consideration of the proceedings under section 34 of the act on its merits based solely on the delay in re-presentation would not be justified in that context. 35. in p radha bai & ors. vs. p ashok kumar & anr., reported in (2019) 13 scc 445, the apex court explained the scheme of limitation for challenging the arbitral award under section 34(3) and held that provisions of limitation act are excluded. the scheme of section 29(2) of the limitation act was explained. it was held that the period of limitation under section 34(3) of the act commences from the date of receipt of the award. the apex court also considered the decision in himachal techno engineers (supra), assam urban water supply and sewerage board vs. subash projects and marketing limited, reported in (2012) 2 scc 624, consolidated engineering enterprises vs. principal secretary, irrigation department & ors., reported in (2008)7 scc 169 (cited by the respondent herein) and union of india vs. popular construction co., reported in (2001) 8 scc 470 and at para 44 held as under: ―44. in view of the above, we hold that once the party has received the award, the limitation period under section 34(3) of the arbitration act commences. section 17 of the limitation act would not come to the rescue of such objecting party.‖ 36. in the case of dakshin haryana bijli vitran nigam ltd. v. navigant technologies (p) ltd., reported in (2021) 7 scc 657 the issue was whether the period of limitation for filing the petition under section 34 of the act would commence from the date on which the draft award was circulated to the parties, or the date on which the signed copy of the award was provided. it was held that the period of limitation for challenging the award under section 34 would commence from the date on which the party making the application had received a signed copy of the arbitral award, as required by section 31(5) of the act, i.e. only after a valid delivery of the award (including dissenting opinion, if any). the decision in himachal techno engineers (supra) was also considered by the apex court. para 46 of the judgment is extracted as under: ―46. we are of the considered opinion that the period of limitation for filing objections would have to be reckoned from the date on which the signed copy of the award was made available to the parties i.e. on 19-5-2018 in the instant case.‖ 37. in the case of bhimashankar sahakari sakkare karkhane niyamita v. walchandnagar industries ltd., reported in (2023) 8 scc 453 the central issue in the case was whether on the last day of condonation period of 30 days under section 34(3) of arbitration and conciliation act falls on a holiday or during the court vacation, would the benefit of section 10 of the general clauses act, 1897 be available? the apex court upheld the decision of the high court and the ld. additional district and session judge. it held that the benefit of exclusion of period during which court is closed is available only when application setting aside award is filed within prescribed period of limitation i.e., the period of 3 months prescribed in the main part of section 34(3) of the act. the same is not applicable in respect of period which may be extended by court in exercise of its discretion under proviso to section 34(3) of the act. the apex court, therefore, held that section 4 of limitation act and section 10 of general clauses act would not be applicable. 38. learned counsel for the respondent has also relied on simplex infrastructure limited vs union of india, reported in (2019) 2 scc 445. the issue concerning this case relates to condonation of delay amounting to 514 days for filing application under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act where the learned single judge of the high court allowed the application. one of the pleas raised by the respondent relates to the fact that application was presented before the wrong forum. analyzing the issue, the hon'ble apex court, highlighted two underlying points: (i) whether benefit under section 5 and section 14 of the limitation act can be extended to the respondents? (ii) whether delay beyond the specific statutory limitation prescribed under section 34(3) of the 1996 act could be condoned? answering the same, the apex court relied on the decision of union of india v. popular construction company, (2001) 8 scc 470, which held that section 5 of the limitation act has no application to an application challenging an arbitral award under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act. the issue of applicability of section 14 of limitation act was also addressed by the apex court and reliance was placed on the decision of consolidated engg enterprises v. irrigation dept, (2008) 7 scc 169. it held that indeed section 14 of the 1963 act is applicable to section 34 of the 1996 act for setting aside the arbitral award but it does not provide for a fresh period of limitation instead exclusion of certain period of limitation. however, the apex court set aside the order of the ld. single judge on the ground that analyzing facts no justification for administration difficulties as reason for delay can be condoned. this decision does not support the case of the respondent that the period of limitation under section 34(3) of the act commences from the date following the date of receipt of the award. 39. the principle which falls from a reading of the aforesaid decisions is that the period of limitation commences from the date of receipt of the award under section 34(3) of the act and not from the date following the date of receipt of the award as is the principle enshrined under section 9(1) and (2) of the general clauses act, 1897 and also section 12(1) of the limitation act, 1963. the reason being that in terms of section 29(2) of the limitation act, 1963, the provisions of section 34(3) providing a limitation period of three months and the outer limit of 30 days therefrom are a special law in themselves. therefore, the provisions of the limitation act or the general clauses act would not apply. in fact, proviso to section 10 of the general clauses act, 1897 which relates to computation of time, provides that nothing in this section would apply to any act or proceeding to which the indian limitation act, 1877 applies. section 12(1) of the limitation act, 1963 provides that in computing the period of limitation for any suit, appeal or application, the day from which such period is to be reckoned, shall be excluded. however, in view of the express language used in section 34(3) of the act that ―an application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award .‖ and the decisions rendered by the apex court, there is no scope for any other interpretation. 40. learned counsel for the respondent has heavily relied upon the case of himachal techno engineers & anr. (supra) to support the argument that section 9 of the general clauses act and application of provisions of section 12 of the limitation act, particularly sub-section (1) thereof is not excluded in reckoning the period of limitation under section 34(3) of the act of 1996. this judgment is also on the proposition that the period of three months provided under the substantive part of section 34(3) would not mean a period of thirty days but the actual period of a calendar month. the proviso uses the word 30 days while referring to the outside limit of condoning the delay. the legislature had the choice of describing the periods of time in the same units, that is to describe the periods as ̳three months' and ̳one month' respectively or by describing the periods as ̳ninety days' and ̳thirty days' respectively. it did not do so. therefore, the legislature did not intend that the period of three months used in sub-section (3) to be equated to 90 days, nor intended that the period of thirty days to be taken as one month. 41. in the said case, the award was delivered in the office of the party on a non-working day, the date of such physical delivery is not treated as the date of receipt. it was held that the delivery of the award to the beldar or watchman present on a non-working day would not amount to delivery to a party. the date of receipt necessarily had to be the next working day. the award delivered to a beldar on a holiday could not be construed to be a valid receipt by the appellant. however, it is worthwhile to mention here that in the subsequent decision rendered by the apex court in the case of p radha bai & ors. vs. p ashok kumar & anr., reported in (2019) 13 scc 445 and in the case of dakshin haryana bijli vitran nigam limited vs. navigant technologies private limited reported in (2021) 7 scc 657 the decision in the case of himachal techno engineers & anr. (supra) have been specifically taken note of and, thereafter, the apex court has held that the date of commencement of limitation would be reckoned from the date of receipt of the award in view of the specific language used in section 34(3) of the act. as such, this court is bound to follow the subsequent decisions of the apex court on this issue which has been rendered after taking due notice of the decision in the case of himachal techno engineers & anr. (supra). 42. treating the date of receipt of the award as the effective date for calculation of the period of limitation, the three months and thirty days have been counted as reflected in the tabular chart below: no. of days in relevant months monthwise calculation 1st month julyaugust 25.07.2022 to 24.08.2022 2nd month augustseptember 25.08.2022 to 24.09.2022 3rd month septemberoctober 25.09.2022 to 24.10.2022 total3 months octobernovember (7 days) 25.10.2022 to 31.10.2022 november23 days 01.11.2022 to 23.11.2022 extended 30 days 43. the legislature has categorically used the expression ̳three months' in the substantive part of section 34(3) of the act whereas the proviso thereto has used the expression ̳thirty days' for the purposes of condoning the delay in making such an application under section 34(3) beyond the period of three months. the legislature has consciously used two expressions in the same provision instead of using ̳three months' and ̳one month' respectively or ̳90 days' and ̳30 days' respectively. therefore, the expression ̳months' has to be understood as ̳calendar months'. the manner in which computation of ̳calendar months' has to be done is dealt with in the case of rameshchandra ambalal joshi vs. state of gujarat & anr. reported in (2014) 11 scc 759 by the apex court. the case relates to filing of a complaint under section 138 of the negotiable instruments act, 1881. however, for the purposes of calculation of the three months period, the apex court has laid down the following principle in line with the meaning of the expression ―calendar month‖ used in the general clauses act, 1897 and referred to the halsbury's laws of england which provide for calculation of a calendar month as under: ― 21. at this stage, we would also like to refer to halsbury's laws of england, vol. 37, 3rd edn., para 143 at p. 83 which provides for calculation of a calendar month: ―143. calendar month running from arbitrary date.--when the period prescribed is a calendar month running from any arbitrary date the period expires with the day in the succeeding month immediately preceding the day corresponding to the date upon which the period starts; save that, if the period starts at the end of a calendar month which contains more days than the next succeeding month, the period expires at the end of the latter month.‖ 44. learned counsel for the respondent has also relied upon the same meaning of the expression ―month‖ as ―calendar month‖ for the purposes of computation of the period of limitation under section 34(3) of the act though the period of thirty days thereafter has to be counted in number of days. on the other hand, learned counsel for the appellant has harped upon the plea that the period of 90 days + 30 days = 120 days is to be counted for the purposes of the period of limitation and condonation of delay in presenting the application under section 34(3) of the act by the respondent before the district commercial court, agartala on 24th november, 2022. it is the case of the appellant that such period has to be reckoned from the date of receipt of the award i.e. 25th july, 2022. for the purposes of illustration, the period of limitation prescribed under section 34(3) read with its proviso as 90+30 days has also been computed in the form of a tabular chart hereinbelow: date of award passed by the ld. arbitrator .25.07.2022 date of presentation of section 34 petition .24.11.2022 along with condonation petition/ filing date no. of days in relevant months monthwise calculation july7 days 25.07.2022 to 31.07.2022 august31 days 01.08.2022 to 31.08.2022 september30 days 01.09.2022 to 30.09.2022 october22 days 01.10.2022 to 22.10.2022 total-90 days october8 days 23.10.2022 to 30.10.2022 november22 days 01.11.2022 to 22.11.2022 extended 30 days 45. it is but obvious that the limitation period i.e. 3 months and 30 days expired on 23rd november, 2022 i.e. one day before the date of its presentation, i.e. 24.11.2022 whereas if the limitation period is treated as 90+30 days, it expired on 22nd november, 2022, i.e. two days before the date of presentation of the application on 24th november, 2022. 46. considered in either manner, the application under section 34(3) of the act was beyond the period of limitation which could not be condoned by the learned commercial court. the principle in this regard has been authoritatively laid down in union of india vs popular construction co. reported in (2001) 8 scc 470 and followed thereafter consistently. as such, the impugned order by which the delay of 30 days has been condoned and the application under section 34(3) had been treated to be within time is unsustainable in law. it is accordingly set aside. the application under section 34(3) of the act is held to be barred by limitation. 47. since the appeal succeeds on the first point itself, we do not deem it necessary to answer the other issues raised by the appellant herein. accordingly, both the appeals are allowed. consequently, the matters pending before the district commercial court, west tripura, agartala being cm (arb) 06/2022 and cm (arb) 07/2022 are held to be barred by delay. pending application(s), if any, also stand disposed of.
