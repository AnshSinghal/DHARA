Challenge of this revision application is the order dated 22.12.2022 passed by the Ld. Judge, Commercial Court, Alipore in connection with I.A. 24 of 2022 corresponding to Title suit no. 20 of 2021 wherein the claim of defendant no. 24/ petitioner herein for rejection of plaint invoking the provision of Order Vii Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for short Cpc) was refused. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said order the petitioner has preferred the present civil application under Section 227 of the Constitution of India. \nBackground Facts:-\n2. The opposite party nos. 1 & 2 herein being the plaintiffs jointly filed the Title Suit being no. 20 of 2021 for declaration, recovery of possession of the suit property along with claim of money and damages together with permanent injunction in the Court of the Ld. Commercial Judge, Alipore against opposite party nos. 3 to 25 herein as well as defendant nos. 1 to 23 therein including the revisionist herein as well as the defendant no. 24 therein specifically on the ground that the plaintiffs by the virtue of 23 registered deeds of lease executed by defendants nos. 1 to 23 therein acquired the lease hold right and interest over the suit property. Those said deeds were executed and registered on 25.04.2008. During that relevant point of time the nature of the suit property was Jal Jami/waterbody. Subsequently, the plaintiffs therein/opposite party nos. 1 & 2 herein constructed the brick filed under the name and style of Dream Bricks Industries along with appropriate structures and machineries for the functioning of the said brick field. \n2.1. But, in the year of 2013 vide agreement dated 18.04.2013 the said brick filed business was transferred to the defendant no. 24 therein / revisionist herein where after some time dispute and difference cropped up between the plaintiffs and defendant no. 24 therein over the issue of alleged breach of the terms of the agreement mentioned above, especially non-compliance of the payment as per schedule. As a result, the impugned Title Suit was preferred with prayer for reliefs already mentioned hereinabove. \nArgument Advanced:- \n3. Ld. Counsel, Mr. Aniruddha Chatterjee, appearing on behalf of the petitioner has advanced his arguments on the ground :-\n The Commercial Court adjudicating the Title Suit actually has no jurisdiction over the present dispute because the suit property is Jal Jami and it was not used exclusively for trade or commerce within the meaning of Section 2(1) (c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.\n From the averments of the plaint it is apparent that the initial lease was granted for a period of 9 years with effect from 25.04.2009 and with validity up to 24.04.2018. Therefore, that particular lease has already expired and in addition to that Mr. Chatterjee has contended that no documents has been produced on behalf of the plaintiffs to show whet her the lease period was either extended or a new fresh deed was executed between the original owner of the schedule property and the plaintiff. The impugned Title Suit was filed only on 2021 i.e more than 4 years of expiry of the original leasehold agreement. In continuation of that argument it was further submitted that lease deed of 2013 was challenged in this suit which was filed in the year 2021 i.e. beyond the period of limitation of 3 years.  The provision envisaged in Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 has not been complied with by filing the suit without making any endeavour for pre institution mediation as per rules prescribed therefor.  Before parting with, Mr. Chatterjee has submitted that the plaintiffs/ opposite party nos. 1 & 2 filed the Title Suit only on the basis of their alleged leasehold interest in the suit property and it is squarely based on certain statutory rights under the Transfer of Property Act which at best can be mitigated before a Civil Court and not by the Commercial Court. As a sequel, the impugned order is liable to be quashed. \n3.1. In support of his contention, Mr. Chatterjee has relied on the following cases which stand as follows:-\n Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Limited vs. K. S. Infraspacellp and another reported in (2020) 15 Supreme Court Cases 585  Deepak Polymers Private Limited vs. Anchor investments Private Limited in C.O. No. 759 of 2021  Jaspal Singh Chandhok and others vs. Sandeep Poddar and another reported in 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 361  C. Natarajan vs. Ashim bai & Anr. reported in AIR 2008 Supreme Court 363  Hardesh Ores (P) Ltd. Vs. Hede and Company & Sociedade De Fomento Industrial (P) Ltd. Vs. Hede and Company reported in (2007) 5 Supreme Court Cases  Dahiben vs. Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali ((Gajra) dead through legal representatives and others reported in (2020) 7 Supreme Court Cases 366  Raghwendra Sharan Singh vs. Ram Prasanna Singh (dead) by Lrs. reported in AIR 2019 Supreme Court 1430  P. Subramaniyam vs. union of India and others reported in AIR 2019 Supreme Court 1438  Laxmi Polyfab pvt. Ltd. Vs. Eden Realty Ventures Pvt.\nLtd. And another reported in AIROnline 2021 Cal 278  Prabha Surana vs. jaideep Halwasiya reported in AIROnline 2021 Cal 347Patil Automation Private Limited and others vs. Rakheja Engineers private Limited reported in (2022) 10 Supreme Court Cases 1 4. Ld. Sr. Counsel, Mr. Jishnu Saha, appearing on behalf of the opposite party no. 1 & 2 has mainly focused his argument which can be summarized as follows:-\n As per Section 2 (1) (c) (vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 commercial dispute means a dispute arising out of agreement relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. In support of his contention Mr. Saha has relied on a case of Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Limited (supra) wherein the Honble Apex Court has held that the word used occurring in Section 2 (1) (c) (vii) denotes actual use and that it must appear from records that at the time when the concerned agreement was entered into, the property was being exclusively used in trade and commerce. In the instant case the agreement dated 08.04.2013 shows that the suit property and the structures standing thereon were on the date of such agreement being actually and exclusively used for commercial purpose. Therefore, Mr. Saha has duly supported the impugned order passed by the Commercial Court, Alipore. \n There arises no question of title suit being barred as there is no averment in the plaint with regard to the suit property or any portion thereof being Jal Jami. So the question of whether suit property was actually Jal Jami or not, if at all raised, is an issue in the suit that can only be determined during the course of trial. \n Now coming to the contention of the revisionist with regard to the suit being a civil dispute, the Commercial Courts are also Civil Courts and also have the power to conduct trials of matters identical to the case at hand.\n4.1. In support of his contention, Mr. Saha has placed his reliance on the following cases:-\n Kamala and others vs. K. T. Eshwara Saand others reported in (2008) 12 Supreme Court Cases 661  Sopan Sukhdeo Sable and others vs. Assistant Charity Commissioner reported in (2004) 3 Supreme Court Cases 137  Liverpool & London S.P. & I Association Ltd. Vs. M. V. Sea Success I and another reported in (2004) 9 Supreme Court Cases 512 5. Ld. Counsel, Mr. Debdutta Basu, appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 3 to 25 except respondent nos. 4,12,15 & 17 has virtually supported the points raised by the revisionist and advanced his argument mainly on the point of maintainability of the proceeding initiated by the opposite party no. 1 & 2 herein before the Commercial Court Alipore. With regard to maintainability Mr. Basu has highlighted some points which are as follows:-\n The suit property is an agricultural land in question and the business of manufacturing of bricks are being carried on the said land through some machineries which are mostly movable properties and not mentioned particularly in the description of suit property. The plaintiffs argument that the suit is not in respect of the landed property but regarding the transfer of business only is baseless since the business of brick manufacturing is non-existent without the land i.e the suit property. \n Therefore, as the suit property was not being exclusively used in trade or commerce on the date of lease deeds between the plaintiff no. 1 & defendant nos. 1 to 23/ the land owners, the plaint is liable to be rejected.  Before parting with, Mr. Basu has also placed his reliance on Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Limited (supra) wherein Honble Apex Court while defining commercial dispute as provided in the said act made it clear that for the purpose of Commercial Courts jurisdiction the nature of immovable property is to be exclusively used for trade/ commerce as on the date of the agreement, but in the present case the suit property as on date are in the nature of agricultural land as per Record of Rights. Thus, the dispute between the parties to the present suit should be tried under the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act and not under Commercial Courts Act. \n5.1. In support of his contention, Mr. Basu has also taken assistance of following cases:-\n Dahiben vs. Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali ((Gajra) dead through legal representatives and others reported in (2020) 7 Supreme Court Cases 366  Deepak Polymers Private Limited vs. Anchor investments Private Limited in C.O. No. 759 of 2021  Jaspal Singh Chandhok and others vs. Sandeep Poddar and another reported in 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 361 Main issues for consideration:-\n6. After careful perusal of the arguments advanced on behalf of both the parties three main points of consideration have arisen which are to be determined for adjudication. These three points are as follows:-\n Whether the suit preferred by the opposite party no. 1 & 2 herein before the Commercial Court is sustainable in the eye of law or not with respect to the present dispute.  Whether that very suit is barred by limitation or not.  Whether the nature of the subject property of this suit can be a matter of determination by the Commercial Court. Analysis:- \n7. Before delving into the merit of the case at hand first, I would like to discuss about the ratio of the cases relied on behalf of the parties for brevity of discussion. \n8. The cases relied on behalf of the petitioner mainly canvassed on the following ratios: -\n Mainly because the property is likely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same cannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court.  Whether a land is an agricultural land or not is essentially a question of fact which has to be answered after consideration of all the relevant factors.  A dispute can only be determined by the cause of action of the suit and not the preceding backdrop. Even, Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act deals with termination of the jural relationship of lessor and lessee, pre supposing a prior lease agreement, the bundle of facts comprising the cause of action of the suit is the sole determinant of the dispute involved in the suit. \n An application for rejection of the plaint can be filed if the allegations made in the plaint even if given face value and taken to be correct in their entirety appear to be barred by any law. The question as to whether a suit is barred by limitation or not would, therefore, depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. For the said purpose only the averments made in the plaint are relevant. At this stage, the Court would not be entitled to consider the case of the defence. \n The language of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC is quite clear and unambiguous. The plaint can be rejected on the ground of limitation only where the suit appears from statement in the plaint to be barred by any law. \n It is well settled that whether a plaint discloses a cause of action is essentially a question of fact, but whether it does or does not must be found out from reading the plaint itself. For the said purpose the averments made in the plaint in their entirety must be held to be correct. The test is whether the averments made in the plaint, if taken to be correct in their entirety a decree would be passed. The averments made in the plaint as a whole have to be seen to find out whether clause (d) of Rule 11 of Order 7 is applicable. It is not permissible to cull out a sentence or a passage and to read it out of the context in isolation. \n If on a meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious and without any merit and does not disclose a right to suit, the Court would be justified in exercising the power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. However, if by clever drafting of the plaint an illusion of a cause of action is created then it should be nipped in the bud, so that bogus litigation will end at the earliest.  A plaint can be rejected in exercise of power under Order 7 Rule 11 (d) CPC if the averments in the plaint clearly show that the suit is barred by law of limitation.  Section 12 A (1) of the Commercial Courts Act has debarred a plaintiff from instituting a suit relating to a commercial dispute without exhausting the remedy of pre-institution mediation, unless the plaintiff seeks urgent relief.\n9. Now coming to the cases relied on behalf of the opposite party no. 1 & 2/ plaintiffs, they have tried to focus on the following points:-\n The question of law of limitation is essentially a mixed question of law and facts which can be decided only after the parties lead the evidence which is a matter of trial. Therefore, a suit cannot be rejected by exercise of power under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC. \n The basic question to be decided while dealing with an application filed under Order 7 Rule 11 (a) CPC is whether a real cause of action has been set out in the plaint or something illusory has been stated with a view to get around Order 7 Rule 11.\n In ascertaining whether the plaint shows a cause of action, the Court is not required to make an elaborate enquiry into doubtful or complicated question of law or fact by the statute the jurisdiction of the Court is restricted to ascertaining whether on the allegations a cause of action is shown. The Court need not see whether the claim made by the petitioner is likely to succeed or not. It has merely to satisfy itself that the allegations made in the petition, if accepted as true, would entitle the petitioner to the relief he claims. If accepting those allegations as true no case is made out for granting the relief he claims, no cause of action is shown then that petition is to be rejected. \n10. Finally coming to the cases relied on behalf of the opposite party no. 3 to 25, which have already been referred by the petitioner/revisionist, need not be discussed again as the ratio of those cases have been stated above. Issue no. 1 - Whether the suit preferred by the opposite party no. 1 & 2 herein before the Commercial Court is sustainable in the eye of law or not with respect to the present dispute 11. Now coming to the first contentious issue i.e. the maintainability of the suit preferred by the opposite party no. 1 & 2 herein before a Commercial Court and the interlocutory application filed invoking Order VII Rule 11 of CPC especially Sub Clause (d) by the revisionist herein which was rejected by the Trial Court, I think it would be profitable to refer the provision of Order VII Rule 11(d) of CPC first which provides that the plaint shall be rejected \"where the suit appears from the statement made in the plaint to be barred by any law\". Hence, in order to decide whether the suit is barred by law, it is the statement in the plaint which will have to be construed. The Court while deciding such an application under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC must have due regard only to the statements made in the plaint. Whether the suit is barred by any law must be determined from the statements in the plaint and it is not open to decide the issue on the basis of any other material including the written statement in the case. \n12. In Kamala (supra) The Honble Apex Court examined the ambit of Order VII Rule 11(d) CPC and observed :-\n\" 21. Order 7, Rule 11(d) of the Code has limited application. It must be shown that the suit is barred under any law. Such a conclusion must be drawn from the averments made in the plaint. Different clauses in Order 7, Rule 11, in our opinion, should not be mixed up. Whereas in a given case, an application for rejection of the plaint may be filed on more than one ground specified in various sub-clauses thereof, a clear finding to that effect must be arrived at. What would be relevant for invoking clause (d) of Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code is the averments made in the plaint. For that purpose, there cannot be any addition or subtraction. Absence of jurisdiction on the part of a court can be invoked at different stages and under different provisions of the Code. Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code is one, Order 14 Rule 2 is another. \n22. For the purpose of invoking Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code, no amount of evidence can be looked into. The issues on merit of the matter which may arise between the parties would not be within the realm of the court at that stage. All issues shall not be the subject matter of an order under the said provision.\" \n13. The Honble Apex Court in a catena of decisions has summarized the legal position pertaining to the said provision as follows:--\n\" The plaint can be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 if conditions enumerated in the said provision are fulfilled. It is needless to observe that the power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC be exercised by the Court at any stage of the suit. The relevant facts which need to be looked into for deciding the application are the averments of the plaint only. If on an entire and meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious and meritless in the sense of not disclosing any right to sue, the court should exercise power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. Since the power conferred on the Court to terminate civil action at the threshold is drastic, the conditions enumerated under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC to the exercise of power of rejection of plaint have to be strictly adhered to. The averments of the plaint have to be read as a whole to find out whether the averments disclose a cause of action or whether the suit is barred by any law. It is needless to observe that the question as to whether the suit is barred by any law, would always depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The averments in the written statement as well as the contentions of the defendant are wholly immaterial while considering the prayer of the defendant for rejection of the plaint. Even when the allegations made in the plaint are taken to be correct as a whole on their face value, if they show that the suit is barred by any law, or do not disclose cause of action, the application for rejection of plaint can be entertained and the power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC can be exercised. If clever drafting of the plaint has created the illusion of a cause of action, the court will nip it in the bud at the earliest so that bogus litigation will end at the earlier stage.\" \n14. From the aforesaid consistent decisions of the Honble Apex Court in adjudicating plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC it can be summarized that rejection of the plaint is a drastic power conferred in the Court to terminate a civil action at the threshold. The conditions precedent to the exercise of power under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, therefore, are stringent. It is the averments in the plaint that have to be read as a whole to find out whether it discloses a cause of action or whether the suit is barred under any law. At the stage of exercise of power under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, the stand of the defendants in the written statement or in the application for rejection of the plaint is wholly immaterial. It is only if the averments in the plaint ex facie do not disclose a cause of action or on a reading thereof the suit appears to be barred under any law, the plaint can be rejected. In all other situations the claims will have to be adjudicated in the course of trial. \n15. In the present case, from reading of the Original Application as a whole and proceeding on the basis that the averments made therein are correct, which is what the Court is required to do so, it cannot be said that the said pleadings ex facie disclose that the suit is barred by any law as the dispute mainly cropped up because of non-compliance of specific terms and conditions prescribed in the deed of transfer dated 18.04.2013 between the opposite party no. 1 & 2 herein and the revisionist. In this context, it would be pertinent to refer the case of Ambalal (supra) wherein the Honble Apex Court held that the disputes arising out of the agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce on the date of said agreement would be within the purview of adjudication of the Commercial Court. In the case at hand, the plea of the revisionist as well as opposite party no. 3 to 25 that the subject land would not come under the purview of Commercial Act as during the initial deed of transfer the subject land was not used for commercial purpose and it was just a water body would not suffice as the subsequent deed of transfer in the year 2013 clearly shows that at that relevant point of time there was a brick field and possession of the same along with the land was given as a lease to the revisionist and there was clear commercial activity on the subject land. The dispute that arose which gave rise to the impugned proceeding was mainly because of mismatch in profit of shares and accounts from the said business arising out of the brick field. As a sequel, I do not find any infirmity or irregularity in the order impugned with regard to the sustainability of the said suit before the Commercial Court as per the provision of Section 2 (1) (vii) of The Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Issue no. 2 - whether the preferred suit is barred by limitation. \n16. Now coming to the next issue pertaining to the question of limitation, the argument advanced on behalf of the revisionist as well as the opposite party nos. 3 to 25 was that the suit filed by the opposite party no. 1 & 2 before the Commercial Court was barred by limitation as it was filed after the statutory period as prescribed under the specific law. In Dahiben (supra) the suit was filed after over 5 and  years of cause of action which clearly made that suit barred by limitation. But, that case does not necessarily match with the factual position of the case at hand as it is pleaded by the plaintiff that alleged cause of action arose only after the expiry of 15 days from date of service of the notice dated 23.03.2021 given by the plaintiff no. 1 to the revisionist herein. Thereafter, on 16.07.2021 when the plaintiff no. 1 therein received a frivolous reply from the revisionist as against to the notice dated 23.03.2021 with regard to the suit property the opposite party no. 1 & 2 herein filed that instant suit and according to them that suit is not barred by limitation. \n17. Moreover, the opposite party no. 1 & 2 herein have conceded that nowhere in the plaint there is any indication that the deed of 2013 was ever challenged by them as argued by the revisionist. The whole dispute cropped up mainly because of violation of the terms and agreement of the said deed between the revisionist and the opposite party no. 1 & 2 herein with regard to misappropriation of huge sum of money by the revisionist with the assistance of assets and properties of the opposite party no. 1 & 2 herein appertaining to the suit property. \n18. It is settled that question of limitation is generally a mixed question of law and fact. The Honble Apex Court in a plethora of decisions while dealing with the issue of limitation has held that a plea of limitation cannot be decided as an abstract principle of law divorced from facts, as in every case, the starting point of limitation has to be ascertained which is entirely a question of fact to be determined during extensive course of trial by properly evaluating the evidence led by the parties. \n19. In the aforesaid view of the matter, so far as the contention raised by learned counsel for the petitioner that the suit itself was filed after a lapse of more than 9 years and the opposite party no. 1 never acknowledged the claim against revisionist during this period and also other submissions made by the petitioner cannot be looked into at the stage of considering the provisions of Order VII Rule 11(d) of CPC. The question of limitation cannot be answered with conviction at this stage of the proceeding without evaluating the entire evidence thereon. This question has to be kept open for proper adjudication by the Trial Court later on during trial in accordance with the relevant provision of law after taking into account the entire necessary evidence. \nIssue no. 3 - Whether the nature of the subject property of this suit can be a matter of determination by the Commercial Court. \n20. This issue is interlinked with issue no. 1 which has already been discussed hereinabove. At the risk of repetition I would like to reiterate that the impugned suit arose out of the agreement dated 18.04.2013 between the opposite party no. 1 & 2 herein and the revisionist mainly due to non-compliance of specific terms and conditions of the aforesaid agreement by the revisionist later on. Therefore, plea taken by the revisionist on the point of nature of land or conversion thereof can only be the subject matter of trial but not of an application under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC. \n21. In the aforesaid view of the matter, I find neither any irregularity or illegality in the order impugned. \n22. Thus, the instant revision application being no. C.O. 137 of 2023 stands dismissed. No order as to costs. \n23. Ld. Judge, Commercial Court is requested to proceed with the suit and dispose of the same as expeditiously as possible in accordance with law. \n24. Interim order, if there be any, stands vacated. \n25. Connected applications, if there be any, stand disposed of accordingly. \n26. All parties to this revisional application shall act on the server copy of this order downloaded from the official website of this Court. \n27. Urgent Photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be supplied to the parties upon compliance with all requisite formalities. \n[BIBHAS RANJAN DE, J.]",

justice tara vitasta ganju judgment vibhu bakhru, j introduction 1. the appellant (chacha nehru bal chikitsalaya, delhi), is an autonomous institute funded by the government of national capital territory of delhi. the appellant has filed the present appeal under section 37(1)(c) of the arbitration & conciliation act, 1996 (hereafter 'the a&c act') impugning an order dated 28.07.2023 (hereafter 'the impugned order') passed by the learned commercial court rejecting the appellant's application being omp(comm) no.22/2022 captioned chacha nehru bal chikitsalaya v. m/s indusction corporate solutions pvt. ltd. the appellant had filed the said application under section 34 of the a&c act impugning an arbitral award dated 26.09.2019 (hereafter 'the impugned award'). the learned commercial court found that the appellant's application was beyond the period of limitation. the learned commercial court further held that in the facts of the case, the appellant was not entitled to the benefit of section 14 of the limitation act, 1963 (hereafter 'the limitation act') as there was no assertion that the appellant had pursued the proceedings before the district judge (commercial courts), east district, karkardooma courts in the bonafide belief that it had jurisdiction to pursue the same. the facts 2. the brief facts relevant to address the controversy are as under: 2.1 the disputes arose between the parties in connection with an agreement dated 17.03.2015 (hereafter 'the agreement'). the said agreement included an arbitration clause. consequently, the disputes were referred to an arbitral tribunal comprising of a sole arbitrator. 2.2 the arbitral tribunal rendered the impugned award on 26.09.2019. the appellant received the impugned award on 03.10.2019 and filed an application under section 34 of the a&c act assailing the impugned award before the learned commercial court, east district, karkardooma on 07.01.2020 omp (comm) no.01/2020 (hereafter 'the first petition'). 2.3 admittedly, the said petition was filed beyond the period of three months from the date of receipt of the impugned award, which expired on 03.01.2020. however, the delay in filing the first petition did not exceed thirty days. thus, the concerned court could condone the same in terms of the proviso to section 34(3) of the a&c act, if the appellant established that there was sufficient cause, which prevented it from filing the same within the stipulated period of three months from the receipt of the impugned award. 2.4 however, the learned commercial court returned the first petition on 08.01.2020 on the ground that the appellant had not complied with the provisions of pre-institution mediation as required under section 12a of the commercial courts act, 2015. 2.5 the appellant did not appeal the order dated 08.01.2020 and filed an application for pre-institution mediation before the east, district legal services authority (hereafter 'the dlsa') on 04.02.2020. notices were issued to the respondent but it did not join the mediation proceedings. consequently, on 26.02.2020, the dlsa furnished a report that the mediation was a non-starter. 2.6 thereafter on 19.03.2020, the appellant once again filed an application under section 34 of the a&c act for setting aside the impugned award omp (comm) no.07/2020 (hereafter 'the second petition') before the commercial court, east district, karkardooma. 2.7 the second petition continued to be pending before the learned commercial court, east district, karkardooma till 30.10.2021. the application was returned to the appellant on 30.10.2021 as the learned commercial court held that it lacked the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the second petition under section 34 of the a&c act. the said conclusion was founded on the basis that the arbitral proceedings were conducted in an office in rajiv chowk (connaught place) and therefore, the commercial courts, new delhi district alone would have the jurisdiction to entertain the application. 2.8 the certified copy of the order dated 30.10.2021 was made available to the appellant on 23.12.2021. 2.9 the appellant filed an application under section 34 of the a&c act assailing the impugned award, omp(comm) no.22/2022 (hereafter 'the third petition'), before the commercial court, new delhi (patiala house courts) on 24.01.2022. as noted above, the same was dismissed as being barred by limitation by the impugned order. submissions 3. ms. avni singh, learned counsel appearing for the appellant assails the conclusion that the application filed by the appellant was beyond the period of limitation that could be condoned by the court. she submits that the period between 08.01.2020 and 19.03.2020 that is the period between the return of the first petition and filing of the second petition is liable to be excluded under section 14 of the limitation act as the said period was spent in pursuing mediation as directed by the commercial courts, east district, karkardooma courts. she submits that the second petition was directed to be returned on 30.10.2021. the certified copy was made available on 23.12.2021 and the appellant had filed the third petition immediately on the next day, that is, on 24.01.2022, and was listed on 27.01.2022. she submitted that the period between 19.03.2020 and 24.01.2022 was also liable to be excluded by virtue of the order passed by the supreme court in re: cognizance for extension of limitation1. 4. mr. chirag alagh, learned counsel appearing for the respondent disputed the aforesaid submission. he submitted that the first petition was filed beyond the period of limitation, that is, after three months from the date of receipt of the impugned award. he submitted that the delay was of four days, which could be condoned, however, the learned commercial court had returned the petition by an order dated 08.01.2020. he submits that the said order was non est as the provision of section 12a of the commercial courts act, 2015 are not applicable to an application under section 34 of the a&c act for setting aside an arbitral award and therefore, it was incumbent upon the appellant to challenge the same. since, the appellant had failed to do so, the time spent by the appellant in pursuing the mediation proceedings could not be excluded under section 14 of the limitation act. he submitted that since, the benefit of exclusion of the period between 08.01.2020 and suo motu writ petition (c) no.3/2020 26.02.2020 is denied to the appellant, the second petition would be barred by limitation and the period of delay would be in excess of the period of thirty days that could be condoned by the court. 5. he also submitted that the benefit of the order passed by the supreme court in re: cognizance for extension of limitation1 cannot be extended to the appellant as the period of limitation had already expired prior to 15.03.2020. he referred to the decision of the supreme court in sagufa ahmed & ors. v. upper assam plywood products limited & ors. 2 in support of his contention. 6. ms. avni singh, learned counsel appearing for the appellant countered the aforesaid submission and submitted that the benefit of the order passed by the supreme court in re: cognizance for extension of limitation1 would also be available to exclude the period between 15.03.2020 to 26.02.2022 for computing the outer limit of 30 days delay, which could be condoned by the court under the proviso to section 34(3) of the a&c act. she relied on the decision of the supreme court in aditya khaitan & ors. v. il and fs financial services limited3 in support of her contention. reasons and conclusion 7. at the outset, it is material to note that the appellant's first petition was delayed by four days. undisputedly, the learned commercial court could condone the said delay of four days, in filing (2021) 2 scc 317 (2023) 9 scc 570 the first petition in terms of the proviso to section 34(3) of the a&c act. it is incomprehensible that the said delay would not have been condoned if the appellant provided a credible explanation for the same. however, it is disappointing to note that the appellant has been vexed by repeated erroneous orders. the appellant's pursuit of its legal remedy has been reduced to an obstacle course. 8. the first petition was returned by an order of the learned commercial court, karkardooma court, delhi by an order dated 08.01.2020. the said order reads as under: \"08.1.2020 present:shri aashish uppal ld. counsel for the petitioner none for the respondent/defendant this is a petition under section 34 of the arbitration act received by way of assignment. however, it is observed that though it has been captioned as a commercial dispute but the mandatory provision of section 12-a of the commercial disputes act, i.e. pre-institution mediation has been followed. hence, the petition is returned with liberty to the petitioner to approach the mediation centre for the pre-institution mediation and thereafter approach the court. (sanjay sharma-i) district judge (commercial courts) east district karkardooma courts08.1.2020\" 9. it is clear that the aforesaid order has been passed mechanically, without application of mind and being oblivious of the provisions of section 12a of the commercial courts act, 2015. a plain reading of section 12a(1) of the commercial courts act, 2015 indicates that institution of a suit, which does not contemplate any urgent relief, is proscribed until the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of pre-institution mediation. the appellant had not filed a suit; it had filed an application under section 34 of the a&c act to set aside the impugned order. the learned commercial court had merely referred to the section 12a of the commercial courts act, 2015 which was cited to return / reject the appellant's application. as is apparent from the plain language of section 12a of the commercial courts act 2015, it has no application to filing of an application under section 34 of the a&c act for setting aside an arbitral award. 10. mr. chirag alagh, learned counsel for the respondent, submitted that the order dated 08.01.2020 should have been treated as non-est and the since the appellant had not appealed the order, it was disentitled to seek the benefit of section 14 of the limitation act. the said contention is unmerited. the order dated 08.01.2020 being a judicial order could not be treated as non-est and was required to be implemented till it was set aside. the appellant may have had recourse of appealing the said decision but did not do so. the appellant chose to comply with the order and made a reference to mediation. in terms of sub-section (3) of section 12a of the commercial courts act, 2015, the period during which the parties are in mediation is required to be excluded for the purpose of limitation under the limitation act, 1963. thus, in any view of the matter, the period till 26.02.2020 is required to be excluded. the substratal rationale of law of limitation is to deny a person who sleeps over his right the recourse to courts. the general rule of limitation is based on the latin maxim: vigilantibus, et non dormientibus, jura subveniunt (the vigilant, and not the sleepy, are assisted by the laws) 11. in the context of the present facts, the appellant has not slept over its right; it filed the first petition to set aside the impugned award in a court of competent jurisdiction. however, as noted above, the learned commercial court had rejected the first petition on palpably erroneous premise that the appellant was required to exhaust its recourse to mediation. 12. the appellant, within few weeks of the mediation failing, filed the second petition before the learned commercial court. in our view, since the rejection of the first petition was palpably erroneous, the second petition must necessarily be construed as one re-instating the appellant's first recourse (the first petition) to set aside the impugned award. 13. the second petition was also dismissed by the learned commercial court by an order dated 30.10.2021 on the ground that the learned commercial court (east district) lacked territorial jurisdiction. this order also proceeds on an erroneous assumption that the seat of arbitration was at connaught place, new delhi, which fell outside the territorial jurisdiction of the learned commercial court. 14. the learned commercial court referred to the decision of the supreme court in indus mobile distribution pvt. ltd. v. datawind innovations pvt. ltd. & ors.4: bgs sgs soma jv v. nhpc ltd.5; and the decision of this court in ion exchange (india) ltd. v. panasonic electric works co. ltd.6 in concluding that the court in whose jurisdiction the juridical seat of arbitration is located would alone have the jurisdiction to entertain an application under the a&c act. however, the learned commercial court misapplied the ratio of the said decisions by assuming that connaught place, new delhi was the juridical seat of the arbitration. 15. the arbitration agreement between the parties, (the arbitration clause) expressly provides that the arbitration would be held in delhi. the said arbitration clause is set out below: \"23. dispute resolution:(a) any dispute and / or difference arising out of or relating to this contract will be resolved through joint discussion of the authorized representatives of the concerned parties. however, if the disputes are not resolved by joint discussions, then the matter will be referred for adjudication to a sole arbitrator to be appointed by the lt. governor, delhi. (b) the award of the sole arbitrator shall be final and binding on all the parties. the arbitration proceedings shall be governed by indian arbitration and conciliation act 1996, as amended from time to time. (c) the cost of arbitration shall be borne by the respective parties in equal proportions. during the pendency of the arbitration proceeding and if the period of contract is still valid, neither party shall be entitled to suspend the work / service to which the disputes relates on account of the arbitration and payment to the contract shall continue to be (2017) 7 scc 678 (2020) 4 scc 234 2014 scc online del 973 made in terms of the contract. arbitration proceedings will be held in delhi only.\" 16. the parties had agreed that the arbitration proceedings will be held in delhi. it is apparent that the parties had chosen delhi as the seat of the arbitration. there was no agreement between the parties that the seat of the arbitration would be connaught place. there is nothing in the impugned award which even remotely suggests that the arbitral tribunal had determined the place of arbitration to be connaught place, new delhi. 17. there is no cavil with the proposition that once the parties agree to the seat of arbitration, the court exercising jurisdiction over the seat of arbitration would have the exclusive jurisdiction for the purpose of arbitral proceedings, as held by the supreme court in indus mobile distribution pvt. ltd. v. datawind innovations pvt. ltd. & ors.4. however, the learned commercial court was required to determine whether the seat of arbitration was outside its jurisdiction. 18. the a&c act does not mention the seat of arbitration. however, section 20 of the a&c act uses the expression 'place of arbitration'. the expression 'place of arbitration' mentioned under section 20(1) of the a&c act is akin to 'seat of arbitration'. in bharat aluminium co. v. kaiser aluminium technical services inc.7, the supreme court had referred to the definition of the term 'court' [section 2(1)(e) of the (2012) 9 scc 552 a&c act] as well as provisions relating to the place of arbitration (section 20 of the a&c act) and inter alia held as under: \"96. section 2(1)(e) of the arbitration act, 1996 reads as under: '2. definitions.--(1) in this part, unless the context otherwise requires-(e) \"court\" means the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the high court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a suit, but does not include any civil court of a grade inferior to such principal civil court, or any court of small causes;\" we are of the opinion, the term \"subject-matter of the arbitration\" cannot be confused with \"subject-matter of the suit\". the term \"subject-matter\" in section 2(1)(e) is confined to part i. it has a reference and connection with the process of dispute resolution. its purpose is to identify the courts having supervisory control over the arbitration proceedings. hence, it refers to a court which would essentially be a court of the seat of the arbitration process. in our opinion, the provision in section 2(1)(e) has to be construed keeping in view the provisions in section 20 which give recognition to party autonomy. accepting the narrow construction as projected by the learned counsel for the appellants would, in fact, render section 20 nugatory. in our view, the legislature has intentionally given jurisdiction to two courts i.e. the court which would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is located and the courts where the arbitration takes place. this was necessary as on many occasions the agreement may provide for a seat of arbitration at a place which would be neutral to both the parties. therefore, the courts where the arbitration takes place would be required to exercise supervisory control over the arbitral process. for example, if the arbitration is held in delhi, where neither of the parties are from delhi, (delhi having been chosen as a neutral place as between a party from mumbai and the other from kolkata) and the tribunal sitting in delhi passes an interim order under section 17 of the arbitration act, 1996, the appeal against such an interim order under section 37 must lie to the courts of delhi being the courts having supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and the tribunal. this would be irrespective of the fact that the obligations to be performed under the contract were to be performed either at mumbai or at kolkata, and only arbitration is to take place in delhi. in such circumstances, both the courts would have jurisdiction i.e. the court within whose jurisdiction the subject-matter of the suit is situated and the courts within the jurisdiction of which the dispute resolution i.e. arbitration is located. * * * * 98. we now come to section 20, which is as under: \"20. place of arbitration.--(1) the parties are free to agree on the place of arbitration. (2) failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (1), the place of arbitration shall be determined by the arbitral tribunal having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the convenience of the parties. (3) notwithstanding sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the arbitral tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, meet at any place it considers appropriate for consultation among its members, for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, or for inspection of documents, goods or other property.\" a plain reading of section 20 leaves no room for doubt that where the place of arbitration is in india, the parties are free to agree to any \"place\" or \"seat\" within india, be it delhi, mumbai, etc. in the absence of the parties' agreement thereto, section 20(2) authorises the tribunal to determine the place/seat of such arbitration. section 20(3) enables the tribunal to meet at any place for conducting hearings at a place of convenience in matters such as consultations among its members for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties. 99. the fixation of the most convenient \"venue\" is taken care of by section 20(3). section 20, has to be read in the context of section 2(2), which places a threshold limitation on the applicability of part i, where the place of arbitration is in india. therefore, section 20 would also not support the submission of the extra-territorial applicability of part i, as canvassed by the learned counsel for the appellants, so far as purely domestic arbitration is concerned.\" 19. the venue where the hearings are held cannot be conflated with the place of arbitration. in the present case, the parties had agreed that the arbitral proceedings would be held in delhi as is apparent from the plain language of the arbitration clause in the agreement. in the absence of any contra indication, it would follow that the parties had agreed that the seat of arbitration is delhi. there was no plausible reason to assume that the seat of arbitration is connaught place, new delhi. merely because the hearings were held in an office in connaught place, new delhi does not mean that the seat of arbitration was connaught place, new delhi. the said presumption is flawed. 20. the supreme court in indus mobile distribution private limited v. datawind innovations private limited & anr.4 after referring the law commission's recommendations to amend section 20 of the a&c act, observed as under: \"18. the amended act, does not, however, contain the aforesaid amendments, presumably because the balco judgment in no uncertain terms has referred to \"place\" as \"juridical seat\" for the purpose of section 2(2) of the act. it further made it clear that section 20(1) and 20 (2) where the word \"place\" is used, refers to \"juridical seat\", whereas in section 20 (3), the word \"place\" is equivalent to \"venue\". this being the settled law, it was found unnecessary to expressly incorporate what the constitution bench of the supreme court has already done by way of construction of the act.\" 21. thus, the word 'place' as used in sub-section (3) of section 20 of the a&c act refers to the venue of the arbitration. the fact that the arbitral proceedings are held at a convenient office, does not confer any exclusive jurisdiction to a court having the territorial jurisdiction in respect of the said venue. in terms of sub-section (1) of section 20 of the a&c act, the parties may agree to a 'place' of an arbitration. failing such an agreement, the arbitral tribunal may determine the same in terms of sub-section (2) of section 20 of the a&c act. the reference to a 'place' under sub-sections (1) and (3) of section 20 of the a&c act is to the seat of an arbitration. the fact that the parties have agreed to the place of arbitration which is akin to the juridical seat of arbitration -does not preclude the parties or the arbitrator from holding hearings at a convenient location in terms of sub-section (3) of section 20 the a&c act. it is necessary not to conflate the office where the arbitral proceedings are held with the juridical seat of arbitration. 22. the supreme court4 had explained that the moment the parties agree to a seat of arbitration, it amounts to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. this conclusion was not founded on the premise that the court as defined under section 2(1)(e) the a&c act, would not have the jurisdiction in respect of the arbitral proceedings. the court's conclusion was founded on the basis that both the courts the court as defined under section 2(1)(e) the a&c act as well the court exercising jurisdiction where the juridical seat of arbitration is located would have the jurisdiction in respect of the arbitral proceedings. however, it is settled law that where two or more courts have jurisdiction, the parties may agree that one of those courts would alone exercise jurisdiction. the supreme court reasoned that the agreement between the parties as to the juridical seat of arbitration would amount to such an agreement. the agreement being that the courts exercising jurisdiction over the seat of arbitration would have the exclusive jurisdiction in respect of arbitral proceedings. paragraphs no.19 and 20 of the supreme court's decision4, clearly indicates the aforesaid reasoning. the same are set out below: \"19. a conspectus of all the aforesaid provisions shows that the moment the seat is designated, it is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. on the facts of the present case, it is clear that the seat of arbitration is mumbai and clause 19 further makes it clear that jurisdiction exclusively vests in the mumbai courts. under the law of arbitration, unlike the code of civil procedure which applies to suits filed in courts, a reference to \"seat\" is a concept by which a neutral venue can be chosen by the parties to an arbitration clause. the neutral venue may not in the classical sense have jurisdiction that is, no part of the cause of action may have arisen at the neutral venue and neither would any of the provisions of section 16 to 21 of the cpc be attracted. in arbitration law however, as has been held above, the moment \"seat\" is determined, the fact that the seat is at mumbai would vest mumbai courts with exclusive jurisdiction for purposes of regulating arbitral proceedings arising out of the agreement between the parties. 20. it is well settled that where more than one court has jurisdiction, it is open for parties to exclude all other courts. for an exhaustive analysis of the case law, see swastik gases private limited v. indian oil corporation limited, (2013) 9 scc 32. this was followed in a recent judgment in b.e. simoese von staraburg niedenthal and another v. chhattisgarh investment limited, (2015) 12 scc 225. having regard to the above, it is clear that mumbai courts alone have jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts in the country, as the juridical seat of arbitration is at mumbai. this being the case, the impugned judgment is set aside. the injunction confirmed by the impugned judgment will continue for a period of four weeks from the date of pronouncement of this judgment, so that the respondents may take necessary steps under section 9 in the mumbai court. appeals are disposed of accordingly.\" 23. thus, the principal question to be addressed is whether the parties had agreed that connaught place (rajiv chowk) would be the seat of arbitration and the court having jurisdiction in respect of rajiv chowk alone would have the jurisdiction to the exclusion of the court as defined under section 2(1)(e) the a&c act. the answer to the said question is clearly in the negative. the parties had agreed that the seat of arbitration would be delhi and not rajiv chowk (formerly known as connaught place). thus, it cannot be inferred that the commercial court, new delhi (patiala house courts) would have the exclusive jurisdiction to entertain the application for setting aside the impugned award. 24. admittedly, both parties are carrying on their business activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the learned commercial court (east district), karkardooma courts, delhi. therefore, the agreement between the parties that the seat of the arbitration would be delhi cannot be construed as an agreement to exclude the jurisdiction of the learned commercial court (east district), karkardooma, delhi, which, concededly, is the court within the meaning of section 2(1) (e) the a & c act. the principle that courts where the seat of the arbitration is located would have the exclusive jurisdiction is applicable only in cases where the court exercising jurisdiction in respect of seat of arbitration is other than the court exercising jurisdiction over the subject matter, that is, the court covered under definition under section 2(1) (e) the a&c act. 25. both the parties carry on their business activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the karkardooma courts and therefore, the commercial court in karkardooma undoubtedly has the jurisdiction to entertain the application under section 34 of the a&c act. 26. in our view, the decision of the learned commercial court to return the second petition to the appellant is ex facie erroneous. 27. admittedly, the appellant had immediately on receiving the order, filed the application under section 34 of the a&c act before the commercial court, new delhi (patiala house courts). in the given facts, we are unable to accept the conclusion that the appellant's petition was filed beyond the outer limit of thirty days delay (beyond the initial period of three months available for filing an application under section 34 of the a&c act) which could be condoned. 28. the contention that the orders passed by the supreme court in re: cognizance for extension of limitation1 would not apply for extending the period for which the courts can condone the delay is also unpersuasive in view of the later decisions. in aditya khaitan & ors. v. il and fs financial services limited3 the supreme court had clarified as under:23. as would be clear from hereinabove, the very basis of the judgment in sagufa ahmed [sagufa ahmed v. upper assam plywood products (p) ltd., (2021) 2 scc 317 : (2021) 2 scc (civ) 178] that under the 23-3-2020 [cognizance for extension of limitation, in re, (2020) 19 scc 10 : (2021) 3 scc (cri) 801] order, only the period of limitation has been extended and not the period up to which delay can be condoned, has been taken away by expanding the protection by excluding the period even for computing outer limits within which the court or tribunal can condone delay. this is an important subsequent aspect which has a great bearing in deciding the present controversy. * * * * 26. as would be seen from the above, the outer limit within which the court or tribunal can condone the delay is 120 days from the date of summons. 29. in the present case, we find that the appellant has been effectively deprived of pursuing its application under section 34 of the a&c act by successive erroneous orders. 30. we are of the view that the maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit (the act of the court shall not prejudice no man) is required to be applied in the present case to remedy the prejudice caused. 31. the impugned order is thus, set aside. the appellant is at liberty to seek appropriate orders for return of the petition and for refiling the petition before the learned commercial court. 32. the appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms. the pending application is also disposed of. vibhu bakhru, j tara vitasta ganju, j march 12, 2024 'gsr'"
