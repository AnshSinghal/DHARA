COMCA Nos.33 and 34 of 2018 are filed by CCS Infotech Limited, COMCA Nos.40, 41, 42, 48, 49 of 2018 and COMCA Nos.4, 17, 18, 19, 20 of 2019 are filed by ESD (Mee Seva) of both States respectively and COMCA Nos. 51 and 52 of 2018 are filed by United Telecoms Ltd. As the issues raised in all the above COMCAs are same, they are heard and considered and common judgment is passed.\n3. With the avowed object of providing various services to the citizens of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, as part of e-Goverance initiative, the Government of the then combined State of Andhra Pradesh proposed to start E-Seva (later called as Mee-Seva) centers. These services were later extended to several other Municipal areas in the combined State. It has sought for expression of interest to be part of the initiative as Technical Partners. Several Software Companies responded to the tender notification. The CMS Computers Limited was the successful bidder in respect of Zone-I, IV, V, VI, United Telecoms PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch Limited was the successful bidder in respect of Zone-II and CCS Infotech Limited and Data Management Corporation was the successful bidder in respect of Zone-III. All of them entered into agreements with the MEE-SEVA Organisation on 19.05.2003. The agreements envisaged to build, operate, maintain and transfer. Under the said agreement, the claimants were to be paid remuneration as per the rates per transaction and other terms and conditions stipulated under Article 3 of the Agreement. The agreements are valid for a period of five years from the effective date defined in Article 4.1. As per the agreement, CMS opened 14 centers in Zone-I, 27 centers in Zone-IV, 12 centers in Zone-V and 7 centers in Zone-VI. Similarly UTL opened 25 centers in Zone-II, whereas CCS opened 15 centers in Zone-III. Subsequently, supplemental agreements were also entered into between the claimants and the MEE-SEVA Organization on 01.12.2003, 18.02.2004 and 10.02.2004 for establishing additional centers in all the six zones. As per the supplemental agreements, CMS opened 16 additional centers in Zone-I, 16 additional centers in Zone-IV, 16 additional cetners in Zone-V and 15 additional centers in Zone-VI. Thus, in all CMS opened 30 centers in Zone-I, 32 centers in Zone-IV, 28 centers in Zone-V and 22 centers in Zone-VI under the original and supplemental agreements put together. Similarly, UTL opened 26 additional centers in all 51 centers. CCS also opened 15 additional centers in addition to the 15 centeres as per the original agreement making in all 30 centers in Zone-III. \nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch 4. Disputes arose between the parties relating to determination of the effective date of the agreements, the downward revision of rates and fixation of the transaction slabs etc. The disputes were referred to arbitration. Hon'ble Justice V.V.N.Sastry (Retired) was appointed as Arbitrator. \n5. The learned Arbitrator formulated following issues for consideration:\n(1) Whether the determination of effective dates by the respondent vide proceedings dated 01.10.2007 is erroneous and contrary to the terms of the agreements ?\n(2) Whether the revision/reduction of rates by the respondent is illegal and unsustainable ?\n(3) Whether the slabs fixed for the transactions have to be proportionately increased with the increase in the number of centers ?\n(4) Whether the claimants are entitled to all or any of the reliefs claimed ?\n6. On considering the oral and documentary evidence, the learned Arbitrator passed a preliminary award holding the issue Nos.1 and 3 against the claimants and issue Nos.2 and 4 in favour of claimants. \n7. In brief, the findings of Arbitrator in his preliminary award are as under:\nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch Issue No.1:\n\"Accordingly, I hold on issue no.1 that the effective dates as determined by the respondent in proceedings dated 01.10.2007 are in accordance with the terms of the contract agreements and they are correct. It, therefore, follows that the contract period of all the claimants have already expired long ago and the respondent is at liberty to finalize the arrangements for further contracts. The interim order granted earlier for maintaining status quo is discharged.\" \nIssue No.2:\n\"I hold on issue No.2 that the claimants are entitled to be paid at the contract rates for all categories of transactions till 01.03.2008 and thereafter at the revised rates for the entire period for which the claimants rendered service. However, with regard to electricity bills, in view of the orders passed by the government in G.O.Rt.No.205, dated 30.06.2009, I am of the view that it is just and proper to direct payment at the rate of 5/- per transaction to the claimants from 01.03.2008 onwards.\" \nIssue No.3:\n\"Arbitrator held that in the absence of a specific provision in the agreement and in the absence of mutual agreement between the parties only the transaction slab as indicated in the agreement alone to be binding.\" \nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch Issue No.4:\n\"For determining the differential amounts if any, to which the claimants are legitimately entitled in the light of findings recorded above, both parties are directed to file calculation memos with full details within four weeks from today.\"\n8. Learned Arbitrator has also awarded interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date on which amount was due till date of payment. \n9. Against the preliminary award of the Arbitrator on issues 2 and 4, Mee-seva preferred O.P.No.1122 of 2012 under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 in the Civil Court, later transferred to Commercial Court and renumbered as C.O.P.No.124 of 2016. \n10. The learned Arbitrator passed two separate final awards quantifying the amount by TRANSCO and directing to determine BSNL transaction amounts due and to pay the dues with interest at 12% per annum from the due date till the date of payment. \n11. Against the final award of the Arbitrator, Mee-seva preferred O.P.No.1121 of 2012 under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 before civil Court, later transferred to the Commercial Court and renumbered as C.O.P.No.119 of 2016. \n12. On issue No.2, the Commercial Court held that Arbitrator erred in applying revision of rates at 5/- per transaction w.e.f. 01.03.2008. \nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch It amounted to applying the revision retrospectively, whereas Government Order dated 30.06.2009 was prospective only. The Commercial Court accordingly modified the decision of the Arbitrator. On issue no.4, the Commercial Court modified the rate of interest from 12% per annum to 6% per annum. \n13. This triggered the present batch of appeals by the claimants, the MEE-SEVA of State of Telangana and MEE-SEVA of the State of Andhra Pradesh. \n14. Learned counsel for claimants made following submissions:\n(a) The remedy under section 34 is not an appeal against the award. Parameters to consider the award are limited to the aspects provided in Section 34. The Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Section 34 can either affirm or set aside the award, but has no competence to modify the award;\n(b) The Commercial Court erred in holding the entitlement to levy 5/- per transaction as prospective from the date of issue of G.O.Rt.No.205, dated 30.06.2009;\n(c) The Commercial Court grossly erred in reducing the rate of interest from 12% to 6% per annum;\n(d) According to learned counsel, the award of learned Arbitrator commends acceptance in toto.\nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch 15. Learned Special Counsel for State of Andhra Pradesh Sri Goverdhan Reddy submitted as under:\n(a) He would submit that the G.O.Rt.No.205 dt.30.06.2009 has no application to the existing contractors. It is applicable to fresh contracts. On electricity bills conclusions recorded by the learned Arbitrator are contrary to his findings on issue no.2. As can be seen from paragraphs 8 and 9 of the preliminary award, all findings are in favour of MEE-SEVA. Thus, the conclusion of Arbitrator is perverse;\n(b) He would submit that there cannot be two awards in the same arbitral proceedings, more so, like preliminary award and final award. As can be seen from Section 32 of the Act, once an award is passed by the Arbitrator, he becomes functus officio and he is no more competent to deal with any aspect of a dispute inter-parties; \n(c) He would further submit that against preliminary award, O.Ps., were filed. As per section 34 of the Act as it stood at the relevant point of time, once O.Ps are filed, it is a deemed stay and, therefore, the Arbitrator could not have passed final award after institution of O.Ps. Though the fact of filing O.Ps., was informed to the learned Arbitrator, he passed final award. It is a patently illegal course adopted by the Arbitrator. \n(d) According to learned counsel, Article 3.1 of the contract specifies the rates per transaction. According to Article 3.2.1 the rates PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch specified are liable to be reviewed at the end of three years which may lead to reduction of transaction cost on due review on various parameters set out therein. The letter dated 31.03.2007 shows that the Technology Partners consented to collect 2/- per transaction instead of 5/- from 01.04.2007. However, later the issue was reviewed and 5/- per transaction was continued upto 01.03.2008; \n(e) He would submit that the term of contract with Technology Partners came to an end between the years 2008 to 2009 on various dates respectively. That being so, by way of interim order, the learned Arbitrator extended the contract. Such course adopted by the Arbitrator is in excess of jurisdiction. By virtue of interim order, the contract continued far beyond the period envisaged in the contract;\n( f ) Learned counsel fairly submits that in an application under Section 34, Commercial Court cannot modify the award. However, as the award is vitiated on several counts, having regard to the findings arrived at, the Commercial Court ought to have remanded to the Arbitrator for passing fresh award. \n16. Learned Government Pleader for Arbitration State of Telangana submitted that entire arbitration proceedings are vitiated on several counts as submitted by the learned Special counsel for Government of Andhra Pradesh. \nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch 17. In reply, learned counsel for claimants submitted that in a Section 34 application re-appreciation of evidence is not permissible. Learned counsel justified passing two awards. According to learned counsel, at the stage of passing award in the first instance the calculations of amounts due were not submitted by parties. Therefore, learned Arbitrator directed the parties to submit actual amounts due and on receiving the details, he passed final award. It is within the competence of the Arbitrator to make assessment of amounts due to the claimants and to award interest. Therefore, merely because the award was split and two separate awards are passed do not vitiate the awards on that ground. \n18. Having regard to the issue involved in these cases, all the counsel have submitted that in the event of the court holding that the matter should go back to the stage of commencement of arbitral proceedings, a new Arbitrator may be appointed. \n19. Following issues arise for consideration:\n(1) Whether the Arbitrator is competent to pass preliminary award and final award ?\n(2) Whether in applications filed under Section 34, can the Commercial Court modify the awards of the Arbitrator ? \n(3) Whether the findings recorded and conclusions arrived at by the Arbitrator on issues 2 and 4 are legal and valid ? \n(4) What relief ? \nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch Issue No.1:\n20. To consider this issue, it is necessary to look into the definition of 'arbitral award' and the provisions in Sections 171, 322, and 333 of the Act, 1996. Section 2(1)(c)4 has not specifically defined what is meant to be an arbitral award but holds that 'arbitral award' includes interim award. Interim award is referable to Section 17. Section 17 vests power in the arbitrator to pass orders as interim measures pending conclusion of arbitral proceedings in various aspects mentioned in Section 17. Section 32 deals with termination of S.17. Interim measures ordered by arbitral tribunal.--\n(1) A party may, during the arbitral proceedings apply to the arbitral tribunal-- (i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely: -- (a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement; (b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration; (c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken, or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence; (d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver; (e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the arbitral tribunal to be just and convenient, and the arbitral tribunal shall have the same power for making orders, as the court has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it. (2) Subject to any orders passed in an appeal under section 37, any order issued by the arbitral tribunal under this section shall be deemed to be an order of the Court for all purposes and shall be enforceable under the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 (5 of 1908), in the same manner as if it were an order of the Court. \nS.32. Termination of proceedings.--(1) The arbitral proceedings shall be terminated by the final arbitral award or by an order of the arbitral tribunal under sub-section (2). (2) The arbitral tribunal shall issue an order for the termination of the arbitral proceedings where -- (a) the claimant withdraws his claim, unless the respondent objects to the order and the arbitral tribunal recognizes a legitimate interest on his part in obtaining a final settlement of the dispute, (b) the parties agree on the termination of the proceedings, or (c) the arbitral tribunal finds that the continuation of the proceedings has for any other reason become unnecessary or impossible. (3) Subject to section 33 and sub-section (4) of section 34, the mandate of the arbitral tribunal shall terminate with the termination of the arbitral proceedings. S.33. Correction and interpretation of award; additional award.--(1) Within thirty days from the receipt of the arbitral award, unless another period of time has been agreed upon by the parties-- (a) a party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to correct any computation errors, any clerical or typographical errors or any other errors of a similar nature occurring in the award; (b) if so agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to give an interpretation of a specific point or part of the award. (2) If the arbitral tribunal considers the request made under sub-section (1) to be justified, it shall make the correction or give the interpretation within thirty days from the receipt of the request and the interpretation shall form part of the arbitral award. (3) The arbitral tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1), on its own initiative, within thirty days from the date of the arbitral award. (4) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party with notice to the other party, may request, within thirty days from the receipt of the arbitral award, the arbitral tribunal to make an additional arbitral award as to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the arbitral award. (5) If the arbitral tribunal considers the request made under sub-section (4) to be justified, it shall make the additional arbitral award within sixty days from the receipt of such request. (6) The arbitral tribunal may extend, if necessary, the period of time within which it shall make a correction, give an interpretation or make an additional arbitral award under sub-section (2) or sub-section (5). (7) Section 31 shall apply to a correction or interpretation of the arbitral award or to an additional arbitral award made under this section. S.2. Definitions:- (1) in this Part, unless the context otherwise requires,- (a)&(b) xxx (c) 'arbitral award' includes an interim award;\nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch proceedings. According to this section, the arbitral proceedings should be terminated by the final arbitral award or by an order of the arbitral Tribunal under sub-section (2). This Section does not envisage passing of more than one award and passing of preliminary award and final award, unlike civil Court passing preliminary decree and final decree in a suit. \n21. Section 33 deals with 'correction' and 'interpretation of award'. According to this provision, within 30 days from the date of receipt of arbitral award, a party can request the Arbitral Tribunal to correct any computation errors, any clerical or typographical errors or other errors of similar nature occurring in the award. The provision also enables a party to request the Arbitrator 'to give an interpretation' of a specific point or part of the award. If the Arbitral Tribunal accepts the request made under sub-section (1), it should make corrections or to give interpretation. The Arbitral Tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1) on its own initiative. Interpretation or correction made shall form part of the arbitral award. \n22. It is permissible to pass such additional award, party to the dispute may make a request within 30 days of the award to pass additional arbitral award. However, both parties should agree for such a course, and it should be confined to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings, but omitted from arbitral award. If the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with such application, it can pass additional arbitral award. From the provision of the Act, the scheme is very clear that it does not PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch envisage passing of preliminary award and final award and it is apparent that only one award can be passed by the Arbitrator. An additional arbitral award can be passed only in case where claim presented in the arbitral proceedings was omitted from the arbitral award. \n23. From the reading of sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 33, it is also apparent that the Arbitrator should resort to computation of entitlement before the award is passed and include in the award. If there are any errors in computation, a party to the dispute can file an application and on filing such application, if errors are noticed the errors can be corrected. The arbitrator can suo-motu correct any clerical errors, but nothing more. The scheme also makes it clear that once an award is passed by the Arbitrator, he becomes functus officio except in the contingencies mentioned in section 33 noted above. That being so, splitting the award and passing preliminary and final awards by the Arbitrator is vitiated on this ground. \nIssue No.2:\n24. Section 345 vests right in a party to a dispute to challenge the award passed by the Arbitrator before the Civil Court or before the S.34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.--(1) Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3). (2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if-- (a) the party making the application establishes on the basis of the record of the arbitral tribunal that-- (i) a party was under some incapacity, or (ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or (iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration: Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch Commercial Court. The Civil Court/Commercial Court can either allow the application setting aside the award or dismiss the application or set aside the award and remand it to the Arbitrator for fresh consideration, but cannot alter or modify the award passed by the Arbitrator. 25.1. In The Project Director, National Highways Nos.45E and 220, National Highways Authority of India vs. M.Hakeem and others6, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:\n\"16. What is important to note is that, far from Section 34 being in the nature of an appellate provision, it provides only for setting aside awards on very limited grounds, such grounds being contained in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 34. Secondly, as the marginal note of Section 34 indicates, \"recourse\" to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-sections (2) and (3). \"Recourse\" is defined by P. Ramanatha Aiyar's Advanced Law Lexicon (3rd Edn.) as the enforcement or method of enforcing a right. Where the right is itself truncated, enforcement of such truncated right can also be only limited in nature. What is clear from a reading of the said provisions is that, given the limited grounds of challenge under sub-sections (2) and (3), an application can only be made to set aside an award. This becomes even clearer when we see sub-section (4) under which, on receipt of an application under sub-section (1) of Section 34, the court may adjourn the Section 34 proceedings and give the Arbitral Tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or take such action as will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. Here again, it is important to note that it is the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal which counts in order to eliminate the grounds for setting aside the award, which may be indicated by the court hearing the Section 34 application. xxx contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or (v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this Part from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this Part; or (b) the Court finds that-- (i) the subject- matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force, or (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India. Explanation 1.--For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India, only if,-- (i) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81; or (ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law; or (iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice. Explanation 2. --For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute. (2A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the Court, if the Court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the award: Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence. (3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal: Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter. (4) On receipt of an application under sub-section (1), the Court may, where it is appropriate and it is so requested by a party, adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of arbitral tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. (5) An application under this section shall be filed by a party only after issuing a prior notice to the other party and such application shall be accompanied by an affidavit by the applicant endorsing compliance with the said requirement. (6) An application under this section shall be disposed of expeditiously, and in any event, within a period of one year from the date on which the notice referred to in sub-section (5) is served upon the other party. \n(2021) 9 SCC 1 PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch 42. It can therefore be said that this question has now been settled finally by at least 3 decisions [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] , [Kinnari Mullick v. Ghanshyam Das Damani, (2018) 11 SCC 328 : (2018) 5 SCC (Civ) 106] , [Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd. v. Navigant Technologies (P) Ltd., (2021) 7 SCC 657] of this Court. Even otherwise, to state that the judicial trend appears to favour an interpretation that would read into Section 34 a power to modify, revise or vary the award would be to ignore the previous law contained in the 1940 Act; as also to ignore the fact that the 1996 Act was enacted based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, 1985 which, as has been pointed out in Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration, makes it clear that, given the limited judicial interference on extremely limited grounds not dealing with the merits of an award, the \"limited remedy\" under Section 34 is coterminous with the \"limited right\", namely, either to set aside an award or remand the matter under the circumstances mentioned in Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. \nxxxx 48. Quite obviously if one were to include the power to modify an award in Section 34, one would be crossing the Lakshman Rekha and doing what, according to the justice of a case, ought to be done. In interpreting a statutory provision, a Judge must put himself in the shoes of Parliament and then ask whether Parliament intended this result. Parliament very clearly intended that no power of modification of an award exists in Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. It is only for Parliament to amend the aforesaid provision in the light of the experience of the courts in the working of the Arbitration Act, 1996, and bring it in line with other legislations the world over.\" 25.2. The Division Bench of this Court in Ragya Bee and others vs. P.S.R. Constructions and others7, held as under:\n\"22. The scope of power of Civil Court under Section 34 is no more res-integra, in view of the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in McDermott International Inc Vs Burn Standard Company Limited8. In the said decision and the decisions that followed, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that in a petition under Section 34 of the Act, 1996, the Court cannot correct errors of Arbitrator. It can only quash the award. Paragraphs 51 and 52 of McDermott International Inc read as under:\n\"52. The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. So, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it.\" \n(emphasis supplied) \n23. The decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.Hakeem (supra) puts the issue beyond pale of doubt. It is affirmation of statement of law that stood the test of times. On review of precedent decisions, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that Section 34 of the Act, 1996 cannot be held to include within it a power to modify the award. ...\" 25.3. In Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd., Hon'ble Court held as under:\n\"28. This Court has in several other judgments interpreted Section 34 of the 1996 Act to stress on the restraint to be shown by Courts while examining the validity of the arbitral awards. The limited grounds available to Courts for annulment of arbitral awards are well known to legally trained minds. However, the difficulty arises in applying the well- established principles for interference to the facts of each case that come up before the 2022 (3) ALD 151 (2006) 11 SCC 181 (2022) 1 SCC 131 PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch Courts. There is a disturbing tendency of Courts setting aside arbitral awards, after dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases to come to a conclusion that the award needs intervention and thereafter, dubbing the award to be vitiated by either perversity or patent illegality, apart from the other grounds available for annulment of the award. This approach would lead to corrosion of the object of the 1996 Act and the endeavours made to preserve this object, which is minimal judicial interference with arbitral awards. That apart, several judicial pronouncements of this Court would become a dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by categorizing them as perverse or patently illegal without appreciating the contours of the said expressions. \n29. Patent illegality should be illegality which goes to the root of the matter. In other words, every error of law committed by the Arbitral Tribunal would not fall within the expression \"patent illegality\". Likewise, erroneous application of law cannot be categorised as patent illegality. In addition, contravention of law not linked to public policy or public interest is beyond the scope of the expression \"patent illegality\". What is prohibited is for Courts to reappreciate evidence to conclude that the award suffers from patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, as Courts do not sit in appeal against the arbitral award. The permissible grounds for interference with a domestic award under Section 34(2-A) on the ground of patent illegality is when the arbitrator takes a view which is not even a possible one, or interprets a clause in the contract in such a manner which no fair-minded or reasonable person would, or if the arbitrator commits an error of jurisdiction by wandering outside the contract and dealing with matters not allotted to them. An arbitral award stating no reasons for its findings would make itself susceptible to challenge on this account. The conclusions of the arbitrator which are based on no evidence or have been arrived at by ignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. Also, consideration of documents which are not supplied to the other party is a facet of perversity falling within the expression \"patent illegality\". \" \n26. Having regard to the provision in Section 34 and the law governing the field, the Court below grossly erred in modifying the award. \n27. As per then provision in Section 34, once application is filed under Section 34, it would be amounting to deemed stay against the award passed by the Arbitrator. The application under section 34 was filed challenging the preliminary award before the final award was passed by the Arbitrator and this fact was informed to the Arbitrator. Though Arbitrator took note of the filing of OP, he proceeds to pass final award. The final award passed by the Arbitrator is in clear violation of the statutory mandate and, therefore, nonest in the eye of law. \nPNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch 28. In the preliminary award, the Arbitrator has not quantified the amounts claimed by the claimants and payable by the respondents. Thus, excluding the final award, preliminary award is incomplete. In view of the statutory mandate of Section 34 as obtained then, the Arbitrator could not have passed final award after OP was filed under Section 34 of the Act challenging the preliminary award. \n29. Cumulatively, we have noticed that the decision of the Arbitrator to split the award into two awards and passing preliminary award and final award is ex facie illegal and in the application filed under Section 34 the Commercial Court modifying the award is without competence and jurisdiction and, therefore, both are vitiated. These aspects go to the root of the matter. In view of the above conclusion arrived at by us, we restrain from deciding the issue no.3 and leave it open. Issue No.4. To what relief :\n30. As the award of the Arbitrator and the decision of the Commercial Court in application filed under Section 34 are not sustainable the COMCAs are allowed. However, as the dispute requires resolution, we deem it proper to remit the matter to the Arbitral Tribunal. As both parties are in agreement for referring the matter to a new Arbitrator, we are inclined to accept the request of learned counsel to appoint Sri Justice Vilas V.Afzulpurkar, Retired Judge of this Court, as sole Arbitrator. The parties are directed to place all the pleadings and documents forming part of arbitral PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch proceedings before the earlier Arbitrator with Hon'ble Sri Justice Vilas V.Afzulpurkar. As the issue is very old, we request Hon'ble Sri Justice Vilas V.Afzulpurkar to conclude the arbitral proceedings expeditiously, preferably within a period of 16 weeks from the date of submission of all the documents by both parties. The parties are directed to prepare compilation and submit all the documents to the Hon'ble Sri Justice Vilas V.Afzulpurkar within four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order. It is made clear that there is no expression of opinion on merits. Pending miscellaneous petitions if any shall stand closed. \n_______________________ P.NAVEEN RAO, J _______________________ DR.G.RADHA RANI, J Date: 26.08.2022 Kkm /tvk PNR,J & Dr.GRR,J COM CA No.33 OF 2018 & batch HONOURABLE SRI JUSTICE P.NAVEEN RAO & HONOURABLE DR.

(f) be pleased to pass any other and further order as may be deemed just, fit and proper.\" 2. the brief facts leading to the filing of the present petition reads thus: 2.1 the petitioner firm was awarded the work of construction of railway over bridge at gotegaon bypass road in narsinghpur, district narsinghpur by the government of madhya pradesh through the executive neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined engineer, pwd bridge construction division, jabalpur, which was valued at rs.893.05 lakh. the said work was awarded on 4.1.2016, which was to be completed within the stipulated period of 18 months and therefore the work was required to be completed on or before 3.7.2017 the time was extended and presently the work is in progress. the respondent herein belongs to patan district and had acquaintance with the petitioner as the respondent is also doing business of construction. it is stated that the respondent herein wanted to join the petitioner in the midst of the said work and therefore, approached the petitioner at mehsana and entered into a sub-let agreement dated 10.3.2018. 2.2 it is stated that there is no jurisdiction clause in the agreement between the parties. it is further stated that the work in question was too big for the respondent and the respondent was not able to manage for funds, etc. and as such he was not able to execute the work as per the time schedule and therefore the respondent requested the petitioner to execute by ratio of 50% each, neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined inter alia, each party was to invest 50%and the profit earned out of the project after deduction qua purchases, expenses and administrative charges and taxes, the net profit was to be shared 50% of each party. 2.3 it is stated that the respondent abandoned the work half-way and in fact committed breach of the agreement dated 10.3.2018. it is further stated that even by accommodating the respondent to share 50% profit by making investment for the purchase of construction material and sharing profit by the same ratio, the respondent though initially brought a sum of rs. 15 lakh, but later on could not bring the funds and completely stopped working. the petitioner being under contract with the government proceeded with the work by terminating the agreement dated 10.3.2018 by his letter dated 27.11.2019. it is stated that the respondent did not like that the petitioner had proceeded with the work with his own men, material and machinery and therefore raised the dispute and subsequently filed a special civil suit no.33 of 2019 on 6.11.2019. on service of process neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined on 26.11.2019, the petitioner gave an application seeking time and on 13.1.2020 another application was given by the petitioner under section 12-a, chapter iii-a of the commercial courts act, 2015 seeking direction from the court upon the defendant to exhaust the remedy of preinstitution mediation. the petitioner also filed written statement along with 6 documents on 13.1.2020 itself specifically raising the issue of jurisdiction of the court on the strength of averments made in the plaint. 2.4 it is stated that on 20.2.2020, the petitioner gave an application at exh-18 requesting the court to decide the issue of jurisdiction as preliminary issue and subsequently on 23.9.2020, the petitioner had pointed out to the court that his application at exh-18 is not decided so also the respondent with a view to pressurize the petitioner, moved an application vide exh-21 under the provisions of o.39, r. 1 & 2 on 15.9.2020 to which the petitioner pointed out that before respondent's application the petitioner's application about jurisdiction is required to be decided first. neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined 2.5 the trial court rejected the respondent's stay application on execution of work on merits. the application below exh-18 with regard to the jurisdiction of the court which came to be filed by the petitioner herein came to be rejected. it is further stated that there are no outstanding dues of the respondent but on the contrary the petitioner has claimed against the respondent which could not be settled in mediation ordered through the court and the petitioner is in the process of filing suit before the competent court at mehsana for recovering his dues. it is against this order passed below exh-18 the petitioner is approaching this hon'ble court by way of filing the present petition. the paras-5 and 6 of the said order rejecting the application below exh-18 for deciding the preliminary issue of jurisdiction dated 27.10.2020 read thus: \"(5) in the present case, both the parties have relied on section-20. further, in the drafting and pleadings of the present suit, the jurisdiction is stated to be patan only because the payment has been made through r.t.g.s. and the plaintiff is residing in the jurisdiction of patan. the jurisdiction cannot be determined only on the basis of drafting and pleadings. if jurisdiction is determined in this neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined manner, there would a number of litigation among the parties. further, the documentary evidence produced by the respondent himself is produced at mark-12/2. considering the same, at the heading of the document it is mentioned as \"jurisdiction subject to patan\". which means, there is a reason to believe that whatever communication is made in name of his firm, the jurisdiction is subject to patan, because he has consented that the suit be tried in jurisdiction of patan and if the suit is tried in the jurisdiction of patan, no loss is likely to be caused either to the plaintiff or the respondent. further, in the agreement between the two parties in the present case which is produced at mark-12/1, it is not agreed between the parties as to which court is having jurisdiction. further, the respondent in the present case has rendered a payment to the plaintiff through r.t.g.s. within the jurisdiction of patan district. an r.t.g.s. transaction can be executed only if the bank, its address and its code is known. moreover, the respondent does not deny the fact that he had rendered a payment through r.t.g.s. to the plaintiff. therefore, there is no reason for not admitting the fact as to the r.t.g.s. transaction. as the payment is made in such a manner and the respondent has rendered the payment through r.t.g.s. it is in his knowledge that the bank is located in the jurisdiction of patan district. id est, the rendering of payment itself can be said to be a cause of action, partly. moreover, when the respondent's place of occupation, its office and the respondent's permanent residential address is located in the jurisdiction of patan district and as both the parties have relied on section-20 of c.p.c., which reads, neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined \"20. other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action arises.subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction(a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the leave of the court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution; or (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises. considering the above stated section, section-20(c) reads the expression \"the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises\" which interprets that the court under whose jurisdiction the cause of action, whether fully or party, has arisen is competent to try the suit. in the present case, the d-list produced by the respondent at mark-12/2, it is mentioned, \"subject to patan jurisdiction\". id est, the letter which is addressed to the plaintiff was sent in such a manner that the jurisdiction is patan. moreover, the address of head office shown in this document reads \"lakhibhano madh, sander, neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined taluka & district patan\". further, the letter is signed at the bottom with a seal which reads \"m/s. amar construction co.\" and \"patan\" is mentioned below it. this document has been produced by the respondent. therefore, there is no reason to not rely on it. on the basis of this document, the fact emerges on record that, the office of the respondent in the present case is located within the jurisdiction of patan district and as per section-20, the jurisdiction can be the place of permanent residence or the place from a business is operated. moreover, the payment which was rendered by the respondent to the plaintiff was rendered through rtgs and in the jurisdiction of patan. as the amount has been remitted to an account in the bank located in patan, on that basis too, this court at patan is having jurisdiction with regard to the present suit. as discussed above, the jurisdiction is vested in this court as per section-20(c) of c.p.c. in the same manner, when the respondent's head office is located in the jurisdiction of patan and the same fact is evident in the document produced by the respondent, the jurisdiction is vested in this court as per section-20(a). further, with regard to section-20(a), it can be said that; \"actually and voluntarily resides\" or \"personally works for gain\" meaning of. each of the clauses (a), (b) and (c) of section 20 is disjunctive and makes provision for a distinct and different situation. in so far as clause (a) is concerned the requirement is that the time of commencement defendants than one, each of the defendants, at the time of commencement of the suit must be actually and voluntarily residing or carrying on business or personally working for gain neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the court before which the suit is laid. the expressions \"actually and voluntarily resides\" or \"personally works for gain\" can have reference to natural only and not to legal entities. the crucial question hence is whether at the time of commencement of suit the petitioner herein did \"actually and voluntarily reside\" within the jurisdiction of the court at attingal. this, in turn calls for a construction of the words 'actually and voluntarily resides' appearing in section 20(a) of the cpc. the expression 'residence' has to be distinguished from mere stay or presence. the expression 'residence' carried with it the concept of continuity. a person resides at such, a place where he eats, drinks, sleeps and lives. in language that is the, concept of 'residence. but the expression 'residence' would certainly admit different meanings depending on the context. there can be permanent residence and temporary residence. there can be actual residence and constructive residence. there can be voluntary residence and involuntary residence. the legislature was conscious of these nice distinctions' evidently when it employed the expression 'actually and voluntarily' to qualify 'the word 'resides' in section 20(a) of the cpc to' confer jurisdiction on a court. the purpose of section 20(a) which confers jurisdiction on a plaintiff to file the suit at a place where the neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined defendant resides did come up for consideration of the supreme court in the decision reported in union of india v. ladulal. the principle appears to be clear and wholesome that is to facilitate convenient opportunity to the defendant to resist the suit to enable him to resist the suit without undue jurisdiction must rest at convenient trouble. normally, jurisdiction must rest at that place where the clause of action arose. section 20 incorporates a rule by which suits can be filed not merely at the place where the cause of action wholly or in part arose but also at other venues. the provisions of section 20(a) and (b) have to be understood in this background. at a place where the defendant a. oo gt, actually and voluntarily resides or where he carries on business or where he personally works for gain it should be easy for the defendant to conduct his defence without undue trouble and that appears to be the rationale underlying. section 20(a) and (b)\" which permit the suits be filed not only at the place where the cause of action arose as stipulated in clause c but also at the place where defendant so resides or carries on. business or personally works for gain. if the expression 'resides' were not qualified with the expressions 'actually and voluntarily', the court would have been been obliged to ascertain the meaning of the word 'resides'. court had occasion to consider the sweep of the expression 'resides'. the supreme court had occasion to consider the sweep of the expression 'resides' in the context of section 19(3) of the hindu marriage act and the following passages neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined appearing in paras 12 and 13 appear in the decision reported in jeewanti v. kishan chandra, to be relevant extract them below: 12. in order to give jurisdiction on the ground of 'residence' something more than a temporary stay is required. it must be more or less of a permanent character, and of such a nature that the court in which the respondent is: sued, is his 'natural 'forum. the word 'reside\" is by no means free from all ambiguity and is capable of a variety of meanings according to the circumstances to which it is made applicable and the context in which it is found. it is capable of being understood in its ordinary sense of having one's own dwelling permanently as well as in its extended sense. in its ordinary sense 'residence' is mor or less of a permanent character. the expression 'resides' means to make an abode for a considerable time to dwell permanently or for a for a length of time; to have a settled abode for a time. it is the place where a person has a fixed home or abode. in webster's dictionary, 'to reside' has been defined as meaning 'to dwell permanently or for any length of time' and words like 'dwelling place' or 'abode' are held to be synonymous. where there is such fixed home or such abode at one place the person cannot be said to reside at any other place where he had gone on a casual or temporary visit e.g. for health or business or for a change. if a person lives with neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined his wife and children, in an established home, his legal and actual place of residence is the same. if a person has no established home and is compelled to live in hotels, boarding houses or houses of others his actual and physical habitation is the place where, actually or personally resides. (6) perusing section-20(a) and 20(c) of c.p.c., within the meaning of this section, the plaintiff in the present case has instituted the suit in the jurisdiction of patan. further, the respondent himself has mentioned \"subject to patan jurisdiction\" on the documentary evidence produced by him, his head office is in the jurisdiction of patan district and the respondent has rendered the payment through r.t.g.s. within the jurisdiction of patan. further, for last two adjournments, the negotiation as to settlement between both the parties is going on, but the could not reached a settlement. therefore, with a view to ensure that the precious time of the court is utilized for a purpose, the order is passed today. as this court is vested with the jurisdiction to try the present suit, the following order is passed in the larger interest of justice.\" 3. heard mr. n.l. ramnani, learned advocate appearing for mr. dayani, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner and mr. siddharth dave, learned advocate appearing for the respondent herein. 4. learned advocate mr. n.l.ramnani vehemently neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined submitted that the court below has erred in rejecting the said application below exh-18. the said order is required to be quashed and set aside, as the basis that the respondent's action is sub-let agreement dated 3.10.2018, which was admittedly executed at mehsana and that there is no averment as to how the court at patan could have the jurisdiction in view of the settled position of law. 4.1 it was submitted that the agreement between the parties is executed at mehsana, all the terms were settled at mehsana, the work is done at jabalpur m.p. therefore, in absence of any pleadings or averments legally sustainable showing cause of action under sub-clause (c) of section 20 at patan, the order impugned is erroneous. 4.2 it was submitted that the trial court failed to appreciate that for deciding the preliminary issue the jurisdiction, only the pleadings of the plaint and cause of action are required to be considered and considering the same, it is clear that no cause of action, as alleged, said to have been arisen in the territorial jurisdiction of patan. neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined considering para-8 of the plaint, which pertains to jurisdiction, it is averred that the plaintiff is residing in patan at village: sarsav and since he is having account with corporation bank, patan, he received the money through rtgs at patan and therefore the court at patan has jurisdiction, is erroneous. 4.3 it was submitted that the trial court ignored the admitted position that the rtgs has been done by the petitioner from the bank at mehsana and thereby committed serious error in law by ignoring the facts of the case and has relied upon the letter head produced as a document by which the petitioner along with the written statement wherein the petitioner's mehsana address is shown and also the head office is shown at village sandhel of patan district, which cannot be considered as working place of the petitioner firm. 4.4 it was submitted that in respondent's reply to application at exh-18 filed below exh-25 dated 28.9.2020 there is no reference by the respondent to the letter head neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined which mentioned head-office of the petitioner being at patan and it was only during the arguments the respondent pointed out this fact, which was explained and replied by the petitioner that no averments are made in the plaint, agreement is executed at mehsana, no cause of action has arisen and averred by the respondent at patan either about the head office or subject to patan jurisdiction as on the date of commencement of the suit, nothing has been done at patan and all this was irrelevant. 4.5 it was submitted that there is no averment that the petitioner firm is operating from the head office from patan. it is not even alleged by the respondent that activity of any kind is done at patan relating to the suit transaction. the respondent was aware about the fact that sub-let contract is executed at mehsana, the petitioner firm is operating from mehsana office since many years and merely because partners of the petitioner firm originally belonged to patan, which was shown in the past, as their operating office as per the letter head and it neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined is for this reason that no averment of any kind, alleging any act having been done at patan is made in the pleadings. placing reliance on the aforesaid submissions, it was submitted that the court below committed an error in reading the letter dated 8.11.2019 in which while stamping as \"m/s. amar construction co.\" and signing as \"partner\" has been misconstrued and resulted in error in passing the aforesaid order. merely mentioning of \"subject to patan jurisdiction\" in the past and incidentally using the letter head would not give any jurisdiction to the court as the same is also not averred by the respondent in the plaint. placing reliance on the aforesaid submission, it was submitted by the learned advocate appearing for the petitioner that the order passed by the trial court dated 27.12.2020 wherein application filed below exh-18 under order 7 rue 10 came to be rejected by the court below, is required to be quashed and setaside. 5. mr. ramnani, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner placed reliance on: neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined (1) in the case of a.b.c. laminart pvt. ltd. and another v. a.p. agencies, salem, reported in air 1989 sc 1239; (2) in the case of shridhar vyapaar pvt. ltd. v. gammon india ltd., passed by division bench in of 2016 of the calcutta high court. 6. placing reliance on the aforesaid judgment, it was submitted that the transfer of the amount by rtgs at patan would not confer patan court the jurisdiction to hear the suit. 7. heard mr. siddharth dave, learned advocate appearing for the respondents. mr. dave, learned advocate submitted that the present suit in question is a commercial suit. the parties relegated themselves to pre-institution mediation under section 12a of the commercial courts act, 2015 and, therefore, the said suit is pending at commercial court, patan. the mediation, however, failed and thereafter the petitioner filed neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined application below order 7 rule 10 on the ground that no cause of action or any part of the cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the concerned trial court at patan. 8. it was submitted that the respondent herein i.e. defendant has entered his appearance and filed reply. along with the same as well as along with the present petition filed by the petitioner, the petitioner has annexed a communication dated 8.11.2019, which is annexed at annexure-'e'(page-23) of the petition. the said communication as well as the admission on the part of the defendant, clearly go to show that the head office of the defendant is at lakhibhano madh, sander, ta. & dist patan. the letter head also clearly envisages that the same was issued, clearly reflecting that the same is subject to the patan jurisdiction. it was submitted that the petitioner herein has tried to mislead the hon'ble court by submitting that the said letter head which is dated 8.11.2019, is old letter head which is used by the neutral citation c/sca/15744/2021 order dated: 19/01/2023 undefined defendant otherwise the defendant does not have an office at patan. the said letter head clearly go to show that the same was issued on 8.11.2019 and it cannot be said that the said letter-head duly produced on record by the petitioner is an old letter head and that the suit was filed by respondent herein in the month of
