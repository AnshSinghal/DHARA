Respondent (s)\n\n\n\n                                                     Judgment\nIndira Banerjee, J.\nLeave granted.\n2. The short question of law raised in this appeal is, whether the Court has the power to entertain an application under Section 9(1) of the Arbitration and Concilia tion Act, 1996, hereinafter referred to as the Arbitration Act, once an Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted and if so, what is the true meaning and purport of the expression entertain in Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act. The next question is, whether the Court is obliged to examine the efficacy of the remedy under Section 17, before passing an order under Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act, once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted. \n3. The Appellant and the Respondent entered into an agreement for Cargo Handling at Hazira Port. The said Cargo Handling Agreement was amended from time to time. \n4. Article 15 of the said Cargo Handling Agreement provided that all disputes arising out of the Cargo Handling Agreement were to be settled in Courts, in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration Act and be referred to a sole Arbitrator appointed mutually by the parties. \n5. Disputes and differences having arisen under the said Cargo Handling Agreement, the Appellant invoked the arbitration clause by a notice of arbitration dated 22nd November 2020. According to the Appellant, the Respondent did not respond to the notice of arbitration. \n6. The Appellant approached the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, for appointment of an Arbitral Tribunal. On or about 30th December, 2020, the Respondent replied to the notice of arbitration, contending that the disputes between the parties were not arbitrable and further contending that the total amount due and payable by the Appellant as on 24 th December, 2020 was Rs.673.84 crores inclusive of interest of Rs.51.11 crores.\n7. On or about 15th January, 2021, the Appellant filed an application being Commercial Civil Miscellaneous Application No.2 of 2021 under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act in the Commercial Court and the 12 th Additional District Judge, District & Sessions Court at Surat. On 16 th March 2021, the Respondent also filed an application being Commercial Civil Miscellaneous Application No.99 of 2021 in the Commercial Court under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act. \n8. Section 9 of the Arbitration Act is set out hereinbelow for convenience:-\n9. Interim measures, etc. by Court (1) A party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with Section 36, apply to a Court (i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely:\n(a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement;\n(b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration;\n(c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence;\n(d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver;\n(e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the Court to be just and convenient, and the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it. (2) Where, before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, a Court passes an order for any interim measure of protection under sub- section (1), the arbitral proceedings shall be commenced within a period of ninety days from the date of such order or within such further time as the Court may determine. \n(3) Once the arbitral tribunal has been constituted, the Court shall not entertain an application under sub-section (1), unless the Court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious. \n9. Section 9 as originally enacted, has been renumbered as Section 9(1) by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act (Act 3 of 2016) with effect from 23rd October 2015. The said 2015 Amendment also incorporated sub-Section (2) and sub-Section (3) reproduced above. \n10. Before the enactment and enforcement of the said 2015 Amendment, Section 17 read:-\n17. Interim measures ordered by arbitral tribunal.- (1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a party, order a party to take any interim measure of protection as the arbitral tribunal may consider necessary in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute. \n(2) The arbitral tribunal may require a party to provide appropriate security in connection with a measure ordered under sub-section (1). \n11. After enactment of the said 2015 Amendment, Section 17 reads:- \n17. Interim measures ordered by arbitral tribunal.- (1) A party may, during the arbitral proceedings, apply to the arbitral tribunal (i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely (a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject matter of the arbitration agreement;\n(b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration;\n(c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken, or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence;\n(d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver;\n(e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the arbitral tribunal to be just and convenient, and the arbitral tribunal shall have the same power for making orders, as the court has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it.\n(2) Subject to any orders passed in an appeal under Section 37, any order issued by the arbitral tribunal under this section shall be deemed to be an order of the Court for all purposes and shall be enforceable under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), in the same manner as if it were an order of the Court. \n12. The Commercial Court and 12 th Additional District Judge, District & Sessions Court at Surat, heard both the applications filed by the Appellant and the Respondent respectively, under Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act and reserved the same for orders on 7th June, 2021. \n13. On 9th July 2021, the application filed by the Appellant under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act was disposed of by appointing a three-member Arbitral Tribunal, comprising of three retired Judges of this Court, to adjudicate the disputes between the Appellant and the Respondent.\n14. On or about 16th July 2021, the Appellant filed an interim application being Commercial Civil Miscellaneous Application No.2 of 2021, praying for reference of both the applications filed by the Appellant and the Respondent respectively under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, to the learned Tribunal. \n15. Paragraph 3 of the said application filed by the Appellant is set out hereinbelow for convenience. \n3. I say and submit that this Honble Court had heard the AMNS Petition and the EBTL Petition extensively, and reserved the petitions for pronouncement of orders. The matters are listed on 20 July 2021 for pronouncement of orders. \n16. By an order dated 16th July 2021, the Commercial Court dismissed the said application filed by the Appellant. The Commercial Court however granted the Appellant 10 days time to challenge the order of the Commercial Court if it so desired. \n17. The Appellant filed an application being R/Special Civil Application No.10492 of 2021 in the Gujarat High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India challenging the order of the Commercial Court. \n18. The said application under Article 227 of the Constitution was heard by a Division Bench of the High Court and listed for final arguments on 2nd August, 2021. In the meanwhile, the High Court directed the Commercial Court to defer the pronouncement of orders in the applications under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act till 9 th August, 2021. \n19. On 5th August 2021, the application under Article 227 of the Constitution was heard again and reserved for orders on 9 th August, 2011. The Commercial Court adjourned the pronouncement of orders in the two applications for interim relief till 31st August, 2021. \n20. In the meanwhile, by an order dated 17 th August, 2021, which is impugned in this Appeal, the High Court dismissed the application filed by the Appellant under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, holding that the Commercial Court has the power to consider whether the remedy under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act is inefficacious and pass necessary orders under Section 9 of the said Act. The High Court held:- \n24. Considering the submissions made before us as well as the judgments cited before us by both the sides, though the learned trial court has not given proper reasons for dismissing the application filed by the petitioner, the trial court has committed no error in not granting the prayer prayed for by the petitioner in the interim application filed in CMA No.2 of 2021. In our opinion the trial court should be permitted to pronounce the order on both the applications under Section 9 pending before it keeping in mind the observations made by us in this judgment and taking into consideration the provisions of Section 9(3) of the Act. \n21. Mr. Darius Khambata, Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the Appellant submitted that Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act, as amended, restricts the power of the Court to entertain an application under sub-Section (1) of Section 9 of the Arbitration Act once an Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted. \n22. Mr. Khambata argued that an Arbitral Tribunal having been constituted, the Commercial Court cannot proceed further with the application under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act. \n23. Mr. Khambata argued that, the purpose of insertion of Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act was to curtail the role of the Court. Even though Section 9(3) does not oust the jurisdiction of the Court under Section 9(1), it restricts the role of the Court, post the constitution of an Arbitral Tribunal. Once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the Court is not to entertain an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act unless it finds that circumstances exist, which may render the remedy under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act inefficacious. \n24. Mr. Khambata submitted that the High Court rightly held that the Commercial Court had erred in construing the word entertain narrowly, observing that entertain would not mean admitting for consideration, but would mean the entire process upto its final adjudication and passing of an order on merits. \n25. Mr. Khambata referred to the observations of the 246th Report of the Law Commission of August 2014, that the insertion of Section 9(3) seeks to reduce the role of the Court in relation to grant of interim measures once the Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted. Mr. Khambata submitted that this also appears to be the spirit of the UNCITRAL Model Law as amended in 2006. Accordingly, Section 17 has been amended to infuse the Arbitral Tribunal with the same powers as a Court. \n26. Mr. Khambata submitted the Report dated July 30, 2017 of the High Level Committee to Review the Institutionalisation of Arbitration Mechanism in India, chaired by Honble Mr. Justice B. N. Srikrishna also referred to the insertion of Section 9(3) and observed that the 2015 amendments, in two important respects, signal a paradigm shift towards minimizing judicial intervention in the arbitral process. First, the amendment to Section 9 of the ACA provides that Courts should not entertain applications for interim relief from the parties unless it is shown that interim relief from the Arbitral Tribunal would not be efficacious. In the aforesaid report, the Arbitration Act is referred to as ACA in short. \n27. Mr. Khambata cited Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC v. Future Retail Limited & Ors.1, where this Court, speaking 1 2021 SCC Online SC 557 through Nariman J. held that the object of introducing Section 9(3) was to avoid Courts being flooded with Section 9 petitions when an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted for two good reasons  (i) that the clogged Court System ought to be decongested, and (ii) that an Arbitral Tribunal, once constituted, would be able to grant interim relief in a timely and efficacious manner. \n28. Mr. Khambata contended that Section 9(3) has been introduced to reduce the burden on Courts. Therefore, Section 9(3) must be construed purposively and any attempt to thwart the mandate of Section 9(3) must be discouraged. \n29. Mr. Khambata argued that Section 9(3) was a measure of Negative Kompetenz-Kompetenz. This is substantiated by the corresponding introduction of Section 17(2) which lends further efficacy and enforceability to orders passed by the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 17. Mr. Khambata further argued that it is well settled that a Court becomes functus officio, only after it pronounces, signs and dates the judgment. Mere dictation of a judgment after it is reserved, does not constitute pronouncement of a judgment. In support of the aforesaid submission Mr. Khambata cited State Bank of India and Ors. v. S. N. Goyal2.\n30. Mr. Khambata argued that the fact that an order is reserved does not mean that the District Court stopped entertaining the Section 9 petitions. Referring to State Bank of India v. S. N. Goyal (supra), 2 (2008) 8 SCC 92 : AIR 2008 SC 2594 Mr. Khambata argued that a judge can make corrections to a judgment and/or in other words continue to adjudicate and thus continue to entertain a proceeding even after a judgment is pronounced, until it is signed. \n31. Mr. Khambata argued that, in this case the Commercial Court had not passed its orders in the Section 9 applications. It had not even pronounced its orders. Thus, as on the date of the impugned order, the Commercial Court was entertaining the Section 9 applications. Even today the Commercial Court is entertaining the applications under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act. The fact that orders were reserved on 7th June 2021 does not mean that the Commercial Court stopped entertaining the said petitions. \n32. Referring to Deep Chand & Ors v. Land Acquisition Officer & Others3, Mr. Khambata submitted that the term adjudication means ..formal giving or pronouncing a judgment or decree in a Court proceeding.. and implies a hearing by a Court. Thus, the term entertain in Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act, is to be interpreted to mean adjudicate and implies the passing of an order and/or judgment. \n33. Mr. Khambata argued that the word entertain in Section 9(3) has to be interpreted in the context of Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act. Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act provides for the making of orders for the purpose of grant of interim relief. The internal aid to 3 (1994) 4 SCC 99 : AIR 1994 SC 1901 construction provided under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act further substantiates the Appellants submission that entertain would necessarily mean all acts including the act of making orders under Section 9(1) of the act. \n34. Mr. Khambata submitted that while the Respondents nominee Arbitrator has withdrawn, the Respondent has not nominated a new Arbitrator. Instead of nominating a new arbitrator, the Respondent has filed an application in the Commercial Court, stating that since the Arbitral Tribunal is not functioning, the remedy before the Tribunal would be inefficacious. The same submission has been advanced in this Court. \n35. Relying on the judgment of this Court in A.V. Venkateswaran, Collector of Customs, Bombay v. Ramchand Sobhraj Wadhwani & Anr4, Mr. Khambata argued that it is well settled that a party cannot allege inefficacy of a remedy when that party disables itself from availing the remedy. \n36. Mr. Khambata also cited Manbhupinder Singh Atwal v. Neeraj Kumarpal Shah5, where the Gujarat High Court held that a party which is intentionally trying to render the remedy under Section 17 inefficacious, cannot be permitted to approach the Court under Section 9 to secure interim reliefs which can be granted by the 4 AIR 1961 SC 1506 (para 11) 5 2019 GLH (3) 234 (para 6.1 to 6.3) Tribunal. Mr. Khambata submitted that the intention of the Respondent to avoid the Arbitral Tribunal, is evident all through. \n37. Mr. Khambata argued that even though the Section 11 proceedings had finally been disposed of by consensus, the appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal was delayed by reason of the conduct of the Respondent. Moreover, after the Appellant issued notice invoking arbitration on 22nd November, 2020, and called upon the Respondent to mutually agree to the appointment of a sole Arbitrator, the Respondent did not respond within 30 days as mandated in Section 11(4)(a) of the Arbitration Act. \n38. Mr. Khambata also submitted that the Respondent filed its objection to the Section 9 application of the Appellant in the Commercial Court on 16th March, 2021 and also initiated other proceedings against the Appellant. The Respondent, however, refused to file a reply to the petition under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act. The Respondent filed a belated reply on 7 th June, 2021, after the hearing of the applications under Section 9 had concluded. \n39. Mr. Khambata submitted that it is well settled that a party invoking Section 9 of the Act must be ready and willing to go to arbitration. In support of his submission Mr. Khambata cited Firm Ashok Traders and Anr. v. Gurumukh Das Saluja and Ors.6. Mr. Khambata contended that the Respondent had itself delayed the 6 (2004) 3 SCC 155 nomnation of the substitute Arbitrator, but is now is taking the plea of inefficacy of the remedy under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act. \n40. Mr. Khambata submitted that the High Court had erred in directing the District Court to pass orders in the applications under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, despite the fact that no party had filed any application in the Commercial Court, challenging the efficacy of the arbitral proceedings. Mr. Khambata submitted that the High Courts interpretation of Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act is in accordance with the prevalent law as settled by this Court and the various High Courts. \n41. Mr. Khambata referred to the meaning of entertain in Black's Law Dictionary (Bryan A. Garner, 8th edition, 2004), which is to \"bear in mind or \"to give judicial consideration to\". Mr. Khambata also cited the judgment of a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Sri. Tufan Chatterjee v. Sri. Rangan Dhar 7, authored by one of us, (Indira Banerjee, J.). In Tufan Chatterjee (supra), the word entertain was interpreted to mean considering an application on merits, even at the final stage\". Mr. Khambata argued that the interpretation of the term entertain by the Gujarat High Court in the judgment and order impugned, is consistent with the interpretation of the expression in Tufan Chatterjee (supra).\n42. Mr. Khambata argued that in Energo Engineering Projects Limited v. TRF Ltd8, authored by one of us (Indira Banerjee, J.) the 7 2016 SCC Online Cal 483 (Paras 35, 43) 8 2016 SCC Online Del 6560 (Para 34) Division Bench of the Delhi High Court observed that once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, an application for interim relief should ordinarily be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal. Moreover, a Court can only grant interim relief under Section 9, if circumstances exist which might not render the remedy under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act efficacious. \n43. In Energo Engineering Project Limited v. TRF Limited (supra), the Delhi High Court noted that the Tribunal was non- functional because the challenge against the Appellant's nominee arbitrator was pending and the Supreme Court had stayed the arbitration proceedings till the challenge proceedings were decided. In the circumstances, the High Court held that the Court could pass orders under Section 9 as the remedy under Section 17 was inefficacious. \n44. Mr. Khambata submitted that in Lakshmi Rattan Engineering Works Ltd. v Asstt. Commissioner Sales Tax, Kanpur and Anr. 9, this Court cited with approval the judgment of the Allahabad High Court in Kundan Lal v. Jagan Nath Sharma 10, and held that entertain would mean adjudicate upon and consider for the purpose of adjudication on merits. In support of the aforesaid proposition, Mr. Khambata also cited Hindustan Commercial Bank Ltd. v Punnu Sahu11, Martin & Harris Ltd. v VIth Additional District Judge and Others12.\n45. In conclusion Mr. Khambata submitted that the High Court had erred in directing the District Court to pass orders in the petitions under Section 9, even though it had interpreted the word entertain to 9 (1968) 1 SCR 505 (Para 9) : AIR 1968 SC 488 10 AIR 1962 All 547 (Para 7) 11 (1971) 3 SCC 124 12 (1998) 1 SCC 732 (Paras 8-10) mean the whole gamut upto its final adjudication and passing of an order on merits. Mr. Khambata argued that, having observed that the Commercial Court had erred in interpreting entertain narrowly and also that there was no challenge to the efficacy of the arbitral proceedings before the District Court as on the date of the impugned order, the High Court should not have directed the Commercial Court to pass orders. \n46. Mr. Kapil Sibal appearing on behalf of the Respondent submitted that the question before this Court, of whether Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act would be applicable in respect of the aforesaid two applications under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, filed by the Appellant and the Respondent respectively, has to be answered in the negative since the applications were finally heard on merits and reserved for orders on 7th June 2021, before the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal on 9th July, 2021. \n47. Mr. Sibal argued that the application under Article 227 filed in the Gujarat High Court was not maintainable for the following reasons:\n(i) The Arbitration Act being a self-contained Code providing the right of appeal at various stages, Article 227 cannot be invoked to circumvent the procedure under Arbitration Act.\nPower under Article 227 can only be exercised where a party is left either remediless or where clear bad faith is shown. \n(ii) An application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India lies where the lower Court has acted outside the bounds of its authority, without jurisdiction, in violation of principles of natural justice, or if the order suffers from patent perversity. \n(iii) The application before the Gujarat High Court under Article 227 was premature and speculative, since the issue of whether the Trial Court had acted outside the bounds of its authority or without jurisdiction or whether the order suffered from patent perversity, could only be determined after an order had been passed by the Trial Court in the Section 9 Applications. \n48. Mr. Sibal argued that Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act provides that a party will apply to the court before, during or after the arbitral proceedings. The Courts therefore do not lose jurisdiction upon constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. \n49. Mr. Sibal argued that Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act was neither a non-obstante clause nor an ouster clause, that would render the courts coram non judice, immediately upon the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. \n50. Mr. Sibal argued that subject to the checks and balances provided under the Arbitration Act itself, a Court would continue to have powers to grant interim relief under Section 9. In support of his argument, Mr. Sibal cited the judgment of Delhi High Court in Benara Bearings and Pistons Limited v. Mahle Engine Components India Private Limited13 and in Energo Engineering Projects Limited v. TRF Limited (supra). \n51. Mr. Sibal argued that Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act restrains the court from entertaining an application under Section 9, unless circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious. In this case, only the formality of pronouncing the order in the Section 9 Applications remained. Since the application under Section 9 had been entertained, fully heard and arguments concluded, Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act would not apply. \n52. Mr. Sibal argued that an application is entertained when the court applies its mind to it. Entertain means admit into consideration or admit in order to deal with. In support of his submission Mr. Sibal cited Lakshmi Rattan Engineering Works Ltd. (supra), Anil Kunj Bihari Saraf v. Namboodas S/o Shankarlal and Ors. 14 and Kundanlal v. Jagan Nath Sharma (supra). \n53. Mr. Kapil Sibal further argued that, whether a matter had already been admitted into consideration, would depend on whether the Trial Court had admitted into consideration and applied its mind to the Section 9 Applications, filed by the respective parties, and therefore, the Section 9 Applications had gone past the stage of entertainment, as contemplated under Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act. Mr. Sibal argued that the High Court has erroneously held:\nThe word entertain occurring in sub-section (3) of section 9 would not merely mean to admit a matter for consideration, but it also 13 (2017) SCC Online Del 7226 (Paras 24-25) 14 (1996) SCC Online MP 112 (Paras 5-12) entails the whole procedure till adjudication, i.e., passing of final order. \n54. Mr. Sibal argued that the prayer in the application dated 16 th July, 2021 filed by the Appellant could never have been granted. Mr. Sibal pointed out that the Appellant sought an order for referring all disputes between the parties as mentioned in the two applications under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act to the Arbitral Tribunal for adjudication. However, the Arbitration Act did not confer power under the Arbitration Act on the Court, to relegate or transfer a pending application under Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act to the Arbitral Tribunal, the moment an Arbitral Tribunal were constituted. \n55. Mr. Sibal submitted that the Special Leave Petition filed in this Court was an abuse of process of Court and an attempt to stop the competent Court from passing an order in an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, which had been fully heard. He argued that if the interpretation of the expression entertain as canvassed by the Appellant, were upheld, it would open a floodgate, where litigants who wanted to deny urgent reliefs to another party, would protract litigation by taking procedural defences and avoid the legislated remedy under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act. \n56. Mr. Sibal further submitted that a lot of judicial time, cost and resources of the parties had been spent in agitating the Section 9 Applications. Both parties had approached the Commercial Courts and the pleadings in the Section 9 Applications exceeded 2,200 pages. The Section 9 Applications were listed before the Commercial Courts 36 times and were finally argued extensively for 11 full days. The Section 9 Applications were reserved for orders on 7th June, 2021, before the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted. \n57. As rightly argued by Mr. Sibal unnecessary delay or expense frustrates the very purpose of arbitration as held by this Court in Union of India and Ors. v. Uttar Pradesh State Bridge Corporation Limited15 cited by Mr. Sibal. \n58. Mr. Sibal submitted that since the filing of the Section 9 Applications, the contractual dues of the Appellant to the Respondent for the interim period aggregate to Rs.255 crores. The Respondent is suffering every day. \n59. Mr. Sibal pointed out that an appeal from an order passed by the Arbitral Tribunal in an application under Section 17, lies before the Superior Court. It cannot, therefore, be said that Section 17 proceeding flows any differently from a proceeding in Court under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, or has any distinct hierarchy. \n60. Mr. Sibal categorically denied that the Respondent has delayed commencement of arbitration. He submitted that the disputes raised in the notice of arbitration dated 22 nd November, 2020 given by the Appellant did not correspond to the disputes raised by the Appellant in its Section 9 Application in the Commercial Court. The question of arbitrability of the disputes 15 (2015) 2 SCC 52 (Paras 14-17) raised in the notice is still to be determined. \n61. Mr. Sibal submitted that the Respondent was in contact with the Appellant to agree on the name of the Arbitrator. Eventually the parties consented to have a three member Arbitral Tribunal. On 25 th August, 2021, Justice G.T. Nanavati (Retired) resigned on the ground of health, after which there is no functional Arbitral Tribunal. Even after the Arbitrator appointed by the Respondent resigned, the Respondent promptly commenced the process for appointment of substitute arbitrator, and addressed a letter dated 27.08.2021 to the Appellant. \n62. Distinguishing the judgments cited by Mr. Khambata, Mr. Sibal emphatically argued that the word entertain in Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act would mean the first occasion when the Court takes up the application for consideration, and would have no application to a case where the application is fully heard and orders are reserved. \n63. Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act, as amended enables a party to an arbitration agreement to apply to a Court for interim measures of protection before or during the arbitral proceedings, or at any time after an award is made and published, but before the Award is enforced in accordance with Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. \n64. A Civil Court of competent jurisdiction thus has the jurisdiction to admit, entertain and decide an application under Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act, any time before the final arbitral award is enforced in accordance with Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. \n65. However, sub-Section (3) of Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, on which much emphasis has been placed both by Mr. Khambata and Mr. Kapil Sibal provides that once an Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted, the Court shall not entertain an application under sub- Section (1), unless the Court finds that circumstances exist which may not render, the remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious. \n66. Sub-Section (3) of Section 9 has two limbs. The first limb prohibits an application under sub-Section (1) from being entertained once an Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted. The second limb carves out an exception to that prohibition, if the Court finds that circumstances exist, which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious. \n67. To discourage the filing of applications for interim measures in Courts under Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act, Section 17 has also been amended to clothe the Arbitral Tribunal with the same powers to grant interim measures, as the Court under Section 9(1). The 2015 Amendment also introduces a deeming fiction, whereby an order passed by the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 17 is deemed to be an order of Court for all purposes and is enforceable as an order of Court. \n68. With the law as it stands today, the Arbitral Tribunal has the same power to grant interim relief as the Court and the remedy under Section 17 is as efficacious as the remedy under Section 9(1). There is, therefore, no reason why the Court should continue to take up applications for interim relief, once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted and is in seisin of the dispute between the parties, unless there is some impediment in approaching the Arbitral Tribunal, or the interim relief sought cannot expeditiously be obtained from the Arbitral Tribunal. \n69. There can be no dispute with the proposition as held in State Bank of India and Ors. v. S.N. Goyal (supra), that when a judgment is reserved, mere dictation does not amount to pronouncement. When a judgment is dictated in open Court, that amounts to pronouncement. A judgment not dictated in open Court, has to be pronounced in Open Court. Even after pronouncement, the Judge can make corrections before signing and dating the judgment. Once a judge pronounces, signs and dates the judgment, he becomes functus officio. However, the law enunciated by this Court in State Bank of India and Ors. v. S. N. Goyal (supra) is not attracted in this case. The judgment does not interpret or explain the expression entertain. \n70. In Deep Chand & Ors v. Land Acquisition Officer (supra), cited by Mr. Khambata, the question was, whether objections under Section 49 of the Land Acquisition Act 1894 to acquisition, on the premise that the property proposed for acquisition was only part of the house, manufactory or building amounts to an adjudication. \n71. This Court referred to Blacks Law Dictionary (6 th edition) where adjudication has been defined as hereunder:-\nAdjudication.- The legal process of resolving a dispute. The formal giving or pronouncing a judgment or decree in a court proceeding; also the judgment or decision given. The entry of a decree by a court in respect to the parties in a case. It implies a hearing by a court, after notice, of legal evidence on the factual issue(s) involved. \n72. This Court found that a reading of Section 49 of the Land Acquisition Act showed that a right had been given to the owner of the land to object to acquisition of part of any house, manufactory or other building. Decision on the objection under Section 49(1) to acquisition of only part of a house, manufactory or building would not amount to an adjudication on the question of whether the land proposed to be taken was reasonably required for the full and unimpaired use of the house, manufactory or building. The judgment is not of relevance to the issues involved in this appeal. \n73. There can be no dispute with the proposition in A.V. Venkateswaran. Collector of Customs, Bombay v Ramchand Sobhraj Wadhwani and Anr. (supra) that a party cannot allege inefficacy of a remedy when that party disables itself from availing the remedy. \n74. The judgment in Manbhupinder Singh Atwal v. Neeraj Kumarpal Shah (supra) was rendered in facts and circumstances of that case where proceedings had been pending before the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 17, but the party against whom relief had been sought protracted the proceedings, by indulging in making bare, baseless allegations and insinuations against the Arbitrators of bias and impropriety and thereafter made allegations against the Arbitrators of alleged inaction, to make out a case of inefficacy of the remedy under Section 17. The judgment has no manner of application in this case. \n75. In this case there are no materials on record to show that there were any lapses or laches on the part of the Respondent, which delayed the constitution of an Arbitral Tribunal. The allegation that the Respondent had disabled itself from availing the remedy under Section 17, is unsubstantiated. Moreover, mere delay in agreeing to an Arbitrator does not dis-entitle a party from relief under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act. Section 11 of the Arbitration Act itself provides a remedy in case of delay of any party to the arbitration agreement to appoint an Arbitrator. \n76. Mr. Khambata rightly submitted that a party invoking Section 9 of the Act must be ready and willing to go to arbitration. The law enunciated in Firm Ashok Traders and Anr. v. Gurumukh Das Saluja and Ors. (supra) is well settled. In this case, both the Appellant and the Respondent have invoked the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act. \n77. As argued by Mr. Sibal, in Tufan Chatterjee (supra) the applicant seeking interim relief under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act had referred to Section 26 of the Amendment Act (Act 3 of 2016) and contended that the 2015 Amendment would not apply to proceedings pending when the 2015 Amendment came into force. \n78. It was also argued that arbitral proceedings having commenced before the 2015 Amendment came into effect and/or in other words, before 23rd October 2015, the 2015 Amendments would not apply to the arbitral proceedings, which would be governed by the law as it stood before the amendment. The Arbitral Tribunal would, therefore, not be able to grant relief under Section 17 as amended by the 2015 Amendments. As argued by Mr. Kapil Sibal, the applicability of the 2015 Amendment to pending proceedings under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act in a Court, as also the power of the Arbitral Tribunal to grant relief under Section 17 in pending Arbitration proceedings, were in issue in Tufan Chatterjee (supra).\n79. The High Court distinguished Court proceedings from arbitral proceedings and held that the 2015 Amendment would apply to Court proceedings. The High Court also negated the contention of the applicant under Section 9 that the Arbitral Tribunal was not competent to grant relief under Section 17 as Arbitral proceedings had commenced before the 2015 Amendment. \n80. The judgment in Tufan Chatterjee (supra) was rendered in an appeal against an order of the District Court dismissing the application of the appellant under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, with the observation that since arbitral proceedings had been initiated, the Court was no longer authorized to pass orders on an application under Section 9(1) of the 1996 Act. The High Court interpreted the expression entertain and held:-\n35. However, as rightly argued by Mr. Bhattacharya, there is difference between the expressions institute and the expression entertain. The expression institute is not synonymous with the expression entertain. In Martin & Harris Ltd. v. 6th Additional District Judge reported in (1998) 1 SCC 732 cited by Mr. Bhattacharya, the Supreme Court interpreted the expression entertain in Clause 21(1)(a) of the U.P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972, to mean entertaining the ground for consideration for the purpose of adjudication on merits and not any stage prior thereto. Unlike the Limitation Act, which bars the institution of a suit after expiry of the period of limitation, Section 26 prohibits the Court from entertaining an application under Section 9, except in circumstances specified in Section 9(3), which necessarily means considering application on merits, even at the final stage. \n36. After amendment by the Amendment Act of 2015, the scope of Section 17 has considerably been widened and the Arbitral Tribunal has expressly been conferred the same power, as the Court under Section 9. An order of the Tribunal under Section 17 is also enforceable in the same manner as an order of Court under Section 9, under the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code. \n81. The High Court dismissed the appeal from the order of the District Court dismissing the application under Section 9 on the ground that an application for interim relief would have to be filed before the Arbitral Tribunal. \n82. In Energo Engineering Projects Ltd. v. TRF Limited (supra) authored by one of us (Indira Banerjee, J.), a Division Bench of Delhi High Court held:-\n27. A harmonious reading of Section 9(1) with Section 9(3) of the 1996 Act, as amended by the 2015 Amendment Act, makes it amply clear that, even after the amendment of the 1996 Act by incorporation of Section 9(3), the Court is not denuded of power to grant interim relief, once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted. \n28. When there is an application for interim relief under Section 9, the Court is required to examine if the applicant has an efficacious remedy under Section 17 of getting immediate interim relief from the Arbitral Tribunal. Once the court finds that circumstances exist, which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 of the 1996 Act efficacious, the Court has the discretion to entertain an application for interim relief. Even if an Arbitral Tribunal is non functional for a brief period of time, an application for urgent interim relief has to be entertained by the Court under Section 9 of the 1996 Act. \n29. It is a well settled proposition that if the facts and circumstances of a case warrant exercise of discretion to act in a particular manner, discretion should be so exercised. An application for interim relief under Section 9 of the 1996 Act, must be entertained and examined on merits, once the Court finds that circumstances exist, which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 of the said Act efficacious. \n30. In our view, the Learned Single Bench patently erred in holding there is no impediment or situation where the remedy under Section 17 of the Act is not efficacious. The Learned Single Bench failed to appreciate that the pendency of a Special Leave Petition in which the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal was under challenge, was in itself, a circumstance which rendered the remedy of the parties under Section 17 uncertain and not efficacious. \nxxx xxx xxx 34. An application for interim relief should ordinarily be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal, once an arbitral tribunal is constituted. \nHowever, if circumstances exist which may not render the remedy under Section 17 of the 1996 act efficacious, the Court has to consider the prayer for interim relief on merits, and pass such order, as the Court may deem appropriate. \n35. The Learned Single Bench has not at all considered whether any interim protection was at all necessary in this case. The bank guarantee was apparently unconditional. In effect, the appellants have been restrained from invoking an unconditional guarantee. The application cannot be heard out until the special leave petition is disposed of. \n83. Even after enforcement of the 2015 Amendment Act, an application for interim relief may be filed in Court under Section 9 of the 1996 Act, before the commencement of arbitration proceedings, during arbitration proceedings or at any time after an award is made, but before such award is enforced in accordance with Section 36 of the 1996 Act. The Court has to examine whether the remedy available to the Applicant under Section 17 is efficacious. In Energo Engineering Projects Ltd. v. TRF Limited (supra), the remedy of interim relief under Section 17 was found to be inefficacious in view of an interim order passed by this Court in a Special Leave Petition. \n84. In Banara Bearings & Pistons Ltd. (supra) cited by Mr. Sibal a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court, speaking through Badar Durrez Ahmed J. Held:\n24...... We are of the view that Section 9(3) does not operate as an ouster clause insofar as the courts powers are concerned. It is a well-known principle that whenever the Legislature intents an ouster, it makes it clear. We may also note that if the argument of the appellant were to be accepted that the moment an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the Court which is seized of a Section 9 application, becomes coram non judice, would create a serious vacuum as there is no provision for dealing with pending matters. All the powers of the Court to grant interim measures before, during the arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but prior to its enforcement in accordance with Section 36 are intact (and, have not been altered by the amendment) as contained in Section 9(1) of the said Act. Furthermore, it is not as if upon the very fact that an Arbitral Tribunal had been constituted, the Court cannot deal with an application under sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the said Act. Section 9(3) itself provides that the Court can entertain an application under Section 9(1) if it finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious. \n25. We may also note that there is no provision under the said Act which, even as a transitory measure, requires the Court to relegate or transfer a pending Section 9(1) application to the Arbitral Tribunal, the moment an Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted. \n85. In M. Ashraf v. Kasim V.K.16 a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court speaking through R. Narayana Pisharadi J. held:- \n8. .Even after the amendment of the Act by incorporation of Section 9(3), the Court is not denuded of the power to grant interim relief under Section 9(1) of the Act. What is provided under Section 9(3) of the Act is that, after the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, the Court shall not entertain an application under Section 9(1) of the Act unless the Court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious. Normally, the Court shall not entertain an application under Section 9(1) of the Act after constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. But, the Court has the power to entertain an application under Section 9(1) of the Act even after the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal unless the Court finds that in the circumstances of the case the party has got efficacious remedy under Section 17 of the Act. An application for interim relief under Section 9(1) of the Act shall be entertained and examined on merits, once the Court finds that circumstances exist, which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 of the Act efficacious. \n86. In Srei Equipment Finance Limited (Sefl) v. Ray Infra Services Private Limited & Anr. 17 authored by one of us (Indira 16 (2018) SCC OnLine Ker 4913 17. (2016) SCC OnLine Cal 6765 Banerjee J.), the Division Bench of Calcutta High Court held:\n5. Under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - a party might before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with Section 36, apply to Court under Section 9 for interim relief.\n6. In our view, the learned Single Bench erred in holding that there was no scope for further order in the pending application under Section 9. The learned Single Bench has not considered the question of depreciation of the value of the assets due to constant use. Prima facie, the respondent has defaulted in instalments. In terms of the agreement, the appellant financier is entitled to take possession of the hypothecated assets. After the enactment of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act of 2015 with effect from 23rd October, 2015, the Court is not to entertain an application under Section 9(1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, once the Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted, unless the Court finds that circumstances exist, which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious. \n7. The hearing before the Arbitral Tribunal may have been concluded. Proceedings are, however, still pending before the Arbitral Tribunal. It may have been possible to make an application before the Arbitral Tribunal. However considering the lethargic manner in which the learned Arbitrator has been proceeding the remedy of the Appellant under Section 17 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 does not appear to be efficacious. The amendments being recent, complicated issues of law may also arise with regard to the applicability of the amended provisions to pending arbitral proceedings. \n87. In Avantha Holdings Limited v. Vistra ITCL India Limited18 a Single Bench of the Delhi High Court (C. Hari Shankar J.) held:- \n45 . The Court, while exercising its power under Section 9 of the 1996 Act, has to be acutely conscious of the power, vested in the arbitrator/arbitral tribunal, by Section 17 of the same Act. A reading of Section 9, and Section 17, of the 1996 Act, reveals that they are identically worded. The interim measures, which can be ordered by the arbitral tribunal, under Section 17, are the very same as those which can be ordered by the Court under Section 9. It is for this reason that sub-section (3) of Section 9 proscribes grant of interim measures, by the Court, consequent on constitution of the arbitral tribunal, save and except where the Court finds that circumstances exist, which may not render the remedy, under Section 17, to be efficacious. The Court, while 18 2020 SCC OnLine Del 1717 exercising jurisdiction under Section 9, even at a pre-arbitration stage, cannot, therefore, usurp the jurisdiction which would, otherwise, be vested in the arbitrator, or the arbitral tribunal, yet to be constituted. \n88. We fully approve the view taken by the Single Bench of the Delhi High Court in Avantha Holdings Limited (supra) except for the observation that the Court, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 9, even at a pre-arbitration stage, cannot usurp the jurisdiction which would, otherwise, be vested in the arbitrator, or the Arbitral Tribunal, yet to be constituted. The bar of Section 9(3) operates after an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted. There can therefore be no question of usurpation of jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 17 before the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted. The Court is obliged to exercise power under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, if the Arbitral Tribunal is yet to be constituted. Whether the Court grants interim relief or not is a different issue, for that would depend on the facts of the case - whether the Applicant has made out a good prima facie case, whether the balance of convenience is in favour of relief being granting to the applicant, whether the applicant would suffer irreparable injury by refusal of interim relief etc.\n89. In Lakshmi Rattan Engineering Works Ltd. (supra) the Court held:- \n9. The word entertain is explained by a Divisional Bench of the Allahabad High Court as denoting the point of time at which an application to set aside the sale is heard by the court. The expression entertain, it is stated, does not mean the same thing as the filing of the application or admission of the application by the court. A similar view was again taken in Dhoom Chand Jain v. Chamanlal Gupta [AIR 1962 All 543] in which the learned Chief Justice Desai and Mr Justice Dwivedi gave the same meaning to the expression entertain. It is observed by Dwivedi, J., that the word entertain in its application bears the meaning admitting to consideration, and therefore when the court cannot refuse to take an application which is backed by deposit or security, it cannot refuse judicially to consider it. In a single bench decision of the same court reported in Bawan Ram v. Kunj Beharilal [AIR 1961 All 42] one of us (Bhargava, J.) had to consider the same rule. There the deposit had not been made within the period of limitation and the question had arisen whether the court could entertain the application or not. It was decided that the application could not be entertained because proviso (b) debarred the court from entertaining an objection unless the requirement of depositing the amount or furnishing security was complied with within the time prescribed. In that case the word entertain is not interpreted but it is held that the Court cannot proceed to consider the application in the absence of deposit made within the time allowed by law. This case turned on the fact that the deposit was made out of time. In yet another case of the Allahabad High Court reported in Haji Rahim Bux & Sons v. Firm Samiullah & Sons [AIR 1963 All 326] a Division Bench consisting of Chief Justice Desai and Mr Justice S.D. Singh interpreted the words of Order 21, Rule 90, by saying that the word entertain meant not receive or accept but proceed to consider on merits or adjudicate upon. \n9. In our opinion these cases have taken a correct view of the word entertain which according to dictionary also means admit to consideration. It would therefore appear that the direction to the court in the proviso to Section 9 is that the court shall not proceed to admit to consideration an appeal which is not accompanied by satisfactory proof of the payment of the admitted tax. ... \n90. In Kundan Lal v Jagan Nath Sharma and Ors. (supra), a Division Bench of Allahabad High Court held that the expression entertain did not mean the same thing as the filing of the application or admission of the application by the Court. The dictionary meaning of the word enterain was to deal with or to take matter into consideration. The High Court further held:-\n7. The use of the word entertain in the proviso to R. 90 of Or. XXI denotes a point of time at which an application to set aside the sale is heard by the court. This appears to be clear from the fact that in the proviso it is stated that no application to set aside a sale shall be entertained upon any ground which could have been taken by the applicant on or before the date on which the sale proclamation was drawn up. Surely, the question as to the consideration of the grounds upon which the application is based can only arise when it is being considered by the court on the merits, that is, when the court is called upon to apply its mind to the grounds urged in the application. In our view the stage at which the applicant is required to make the deposit or give the security within the mening of Cl. (b) of the proviso would come when the hearing of the application is due to commence. \n91. In Hindustan Commercial Bank Ltd. v Punnu Sahu (supra), the Court held that the expression entertain in the proviso to clause (b) Order 21 Rule 90 (as amended by Allahabad High Court), means to adjudicate upon or proceed to consider on merits and not initiation of proceeding. \n92. In Martin & Haris Limited (supra), the Court was considering proviso to Section 21 of the U.P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 which provided that where the building was in the occupation of a tenant since before its purchase by the landlord, such purchase being made after the commencement of this Act, no application shall be entertained on the grounds mentioned in Clause (a), unless a period of 3 years has elapsed since the date of such purchase and the landlord has given a notice in that behalf to the tenant, not less than 6 months before such application, and such notice may be given before the expiration of the aforesaid period of 3 years. The Court held :-\n Thus the word entertain mentioned in the first proviso to Section 21(1) in connection with grounds mentioned in clause (a) would necessarily mean entertaining the ground for consideration for the purpose of adjudication on merits and not at any stage prior thereto as tried to be submitted by learned Senior Counsel, Shri Rao, for the appellant. \n93. It is now well settled that the expression entertain means to consider by application of mind to the issues raised. The Court entertains a case when it takes a matter up for consideration. The process of consideration could continue till the pronouncement of judgment as argued by Khambata. Once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted the Court cannot take up an application under Section 9 for consideration, unless the remedy under Section 17 is inefficacious. However, once an application is entertained in the sense it is taken up for consideration, and the Court has applied its mind to the Court can certainly proceed to adjudicate the application. \n94. Mr. Sibal rightly submitted that the intent behind Section 9(3) was not to turn back the clock and require a matter already reserved for orders to be considered in entirety by the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act.\n95. On a combined reading of Section 9 with Section 17 of the Arbitration Act, once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the Court would not entertain and/or in other words take up for consideration and apply its mind to an application for interim measure, unless the remedy under Section 17 is inefficacious, even though the application may have been filed before the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. The bar of Section 9(3) would not operate, once an application has been entertained and taken up for consideration, as in the instant case, where hearing has been concluded and judgment has been reserved. Mr. Khambata may be right, that the process of consideration continues till the pronouncement of judgment. However, that would make no difference. The question is whether the process of consideration has commenced, and/or whether the Court has applied its mind to some extent before the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. If so, the application can be said to have been entertained before constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n96. Even after an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, there may be myriads of reasons why the Arbitral Tribunal may not be an efficacious alternative to Section 9(1). This could even be by reason of temporary unavailability of any one of the Arbitrators of an Arbitral Tribunal by reason of illness, travel etc.\n97. Applications for interim relief are inherently applications which are required to be disposed of urgently. Interim relief is granted in aid of final relief. The object is to ensure protection of the property being the subject matter of Arbitration and/or otherwise ensure that the arbitration proceedings do not become infructuous and the Arbitral Award does not become an award on paper, of no real value. \n98. The principles for grant of interim relief are (i) good prima facie case, (ii) balance of convenience in favour of grant of interim relief and (iii) irreparable injury or loss to the applicant for interim relief. Unless applications for interim measures are decided expeditiously, irreparable injury or prejudice may be caused to the party seeking interim relief. \n99. It could, therefore, never have been the legislative intent that even after an application under Section 9 is finally heard relief would have to be declined and the parties be remitted to their remedy under Section 17.\n100. When an application has already been taken up for consideration and is in the process of consideration or has already been considered, the question of examining whether remedy under Section 17 is efficacious or not would not arise. The requirement to conduct the exercise arises only when the application is being entertained and/or taken up for consideration. As observed above, there could be numerous reasons which render the remedy under Section 17 inefficacious. To cite an example, the different Arbitrators constituting an Arbitral Tribunal could be located at far away places and not in a position to assemble immediately. In such a case an application for urgent interim relief may have to be entertained by the Court under Section 9(1).\n101. As pointed out by Mr. Khambata, the 246 th Report of the Law Commission, submitted in August 2014 states that Section 9(3) seeks to reduce the role of the Court in relation to grant of interim measure, once the Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted. This is also in keeping with the UNCITRAL Model Law which discourages Court proceedings in relation to disputes arising out of an agreement which contains a clause for arbitration. \n102. As held by this Court in Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC v. Future Retail (supra), the object of introducing Section 9(3) was to avoid Courts being flooded with applications under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act. \n103. Negative Kompetenz-Kompetenz is a sequel to the rule of priority in favour of the Arbitrators, that is, the requirement for parties to an arbitration agreement to honour their undertaking to submit any dispute covered by such an agreement to arbitration. This entails the consequence that the Courts are prohibited from hearing such disputes. \n104. In Chloro Controls India Private Limited v. Severn Trent Water Purification Inc.19, this Court observed that majority of the countries admit to the positive effect of kompetenz  kompetenz principle, which requires that the Arbitral Tribunal must exercise jurisdiction over the dispute under the arbitration agreement. Thus, challenge to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement would not prevent the Arbitral Tribunal from proceeding with the hearing and ruling upon its jurisdiction. If it retains jurisdiction, it may make an award on the substance of the dispute, without waiting for the outcome of any court action aimed at deciding the issue of jurisdiction. \n105. As held by this Court in Vidya Drolia and Ors. v. Durga Trading Corporation20 :-\n129. Principles of competence-competence have positive and negative connotations. As a positive implication, the Arbitral Tribunals are declared competent and authorised by law to rule as to their jurisdiction and decide non-arbitrability questions. In case of expressed negative effect, the statute would govern and should be 19 (2013) 1 SCC 641 20 (2021) 2 SCC 1 at page 98 followed. Implied negative effect curtails and constrains interference by the court at the referral stage by necessary implication in order to allow the Arbitral Tribunal to rule as to their jurisdiction and decide non-arbitrability questions. As per the negative effect, courts at the referral stage are not to decide on merits, except when permitted by the legislation either expressly or by necessary implication, such questions of non-arbitrability. \nSuch prioritisation of the Arbitral Tribunal over the courts can be partial and limited when the legislation provides for some or restricted scrutiny at the first look referral stage. We would, therefore, examine the principles of competence- competence with reference to the legislation, that is, the Arbitration Act. [Emphasis supplied] \n106. As held in Vidya Drolia (supra), the Courts do not decide on merits except when permitted by legislation either expressly or by necessary implication. Prioritisation of the Arbitral Tribunal over the the Courts can be partial and limited when the legislation so provides. Vidya Drolia (supra) was referred to a larger Bench, but on a different issue. \n107. It is reiterated that Section 9(1) enables the parties to an arbitration agreement to approach the appropriate Court for interim measures before the commencement of arbitral proceedings, during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of an arbitral award but before it is enforced and in accordance with Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. The bar of Section 9(3) operates where the application under Section 9(1) had not been entertained till the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. Ofcourse it hardly need be mentioned that even if an application under Section 9 had been entertained before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Court always has the discretion to direct the parties to approach the Arbitral Tribunal, if necessary by passing a limited order of interim protection, particularly when there has been a long time gap between hearings and the application has for all practical purposes, to be heard afresh, or the hearing has just commenced and is likely to consume a lot of time. In this case, the High Court has rightly directed the Commercial Court to proceed to complete the adjudication. \n108. For the reasons discussed above, the appeal is allowed only to the extent of clarifying that it shall not be necessary for the Commercial Court to consider the efficacy of relief under Section 17, since the application under Section 9 has already been entertained and considered by the Commercial Court. The judgment and order under appeal does not, otherwise, call for interference. \n..J. [ INDIRA BANERJEE ] ..J. [ J. K. MAHESHWARI ] NEW DELHI; \nSEPTEMBER 14, 2021",

(oral) 1. this hearing has been done through hybrid mode. 2. the present suit is one seeking permanent injunction restraining the defendant from infringement of trademark, passing off, unfair competition, rendition of accounts of profits/damages, delivery up and other reliefs. the plaintiff's case is that the defendant is infringing upon its registered trademark 'letroz' by using the mark 'letero' in respect of its medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations. 3. before the matter could be heard on merits, a query was put to the ld. counsel for the plaintiff as to how the present suit would be maintainable in as much as for this very trademark, an earlier suit being cs (comm.) no. 300 of 2019 titled sun pharma laboratories ltd. v. hetero healthcare ltd. & anr., has already been filed by the plaintiff against the same very defendants before the ld. adj-02, north west district, rohini courts, new this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 delhi (hereinafter \"trial court\"), and the same is still pending. 4. mr. sachin gupta, ld. counsel for the plaintiff, submits that though the said suit being cs (comm.) no. 300 of 2019 was filed in 2017, more than 5 years have passed and no orders have been passed in the interim injunction application in the said suit. he further submits that the judicial officers presiding over the trial court were being changed from time to time. he submits that orders on the injunction application were once reserved on 20th october, 2018, but the same was released vide order dated 7th january, 2019, upon the change of the judicial officer. the plaintiff is also stated to have withdrawn its injunction application before the trial court and filed a fresh application, once, in 2019 due to the defendant's objection that the prayer did not mention the word \"passing off\". 5. today, mr. gupta, ld. counsel, submits that every sale by the defendants constitutes a fresh cause of action and thus, despite the pendency of the first suit before the ld. adj, the present suit before this court would also be maintainable in view of the judgment of the supreme court in bengal waterproof ltd. v. bombay waterproof manufacturing company, (1997) 1 scc 99. ld. counsel refers to the cause of action in both suits and submits that since no interim injunction has been granted in the earlier suit, the continuous use of the infringing mark by the defendants, constitutes a fresh cause of action for the plaintiff. 6. on the other hand, mr. ajay sahni, ld. counsel appearing for the defendants, submits that the judgment of the supreme court in bengal waterproof (supra) cannot be read in the manner it has been read by the plaintiff. the cause of action in both suits is identical. the earlier suit is in fact part-heard before the district court in the fresh injunction application, this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 as recorded in the order dated 30th march, 2021, and filing of the present suit in another court is a gross abuse of process. he relies upon the following decisions: • prapti fashions private limited and ors. v. manoj kumar gupta, 2013 (55) ptc 234 (cal). • hari ram v. lichmaniya & ors., air 2003 raj. 319. • ranbir singh v. dalbir singh & ors., cs(os) 802/2002, decision dated 19th december, 2008 (delhi high court). • vijay kumar gupta v. state of west bengal [slp (crl.) 10951 of 2019, decided on 22nd march, 2022] 7. heard. the court has perused the two plaints and at the outset, notes the following: (i) in the first suit pending before the commercial court, the plaintiff is sun pharma laboratories limited and the defendants are hetero healthcare limited and hetero labs limited. the parties in the second suit before this court are identical. (ii) the cause of action in the first suit reads as under: \"25. the cause of action for institution of the present suit arose on 30th november, 2017, when the plaintiff's representative came across the defendant's medicine under the impugned mark selling at a drug store falling within the jurisdiction of this hon'ble court. the said cause of action is a continuous one and continues to subsist till the defendant is restrained by an order of injunction passed by this hon'ble court.\" (iii) the cause of action in the second suit reads as under: \"40. the cause of action first arose in the 4th week of november, 2017 when the impugned medicine under this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 the impugned mark letero was found selling at delhi. immediately, thereafter on 02.12.2017, the plaintiff filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining infringement of trade mark, passing off, etc. before the rohini district court (north west), new delhi, which was numbered as sun pharma laboratories ltd. vs hetero healthcare ltd. & anr., cs(comm.) no.300 of 2019. the defendants are continuing to use the impugned mark letero and every act of defendant is amounting to infringement, thereby giving a fresh cause of action. therefore, the said cause of action if continuing. the said cause of action is a continuous one and continues to subsist till further manufacturing and marketing of the impugned medicine is injuncted by this hon'ble court.\" (iv) the relief prayed in the first suit is as under: \"28. it is therefore, most respectfully prayed that this hon'ble court may be pleased to grant the following reliefs in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants: (a) a decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendants, their directors, assignees in business, distributors, dealers, stockists, retailers/chemists, servants and agents from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, directly or indirectly dealing

registered under no. 2037862 of the plaintiff; (b) a decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendants, their directors, their assignees in business, distributors, dealers, stockists,

defendants and a decree for an amount so found due; (e) an order for costs in the proceedings; and further orders as this hon'ble court may deem fit and proper under the facts and circumstances of the present case.\" (v) the relief sought in the present suit is as under: \"45. it is, therefore, respectfully prayed that this hon'ble court may be pleased to grant the following reliefs in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants: a. a decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendants, their directors, assignees in business, distributors, dealers, stockists, retailers/

amount so found due; e. an order for cost of the proceedings; f. any further orders as this hon'ble court may deem fit and proper under the facts and circumstances of the present case.\" 8. a perusal of the above two suits would show that: (i) the parties in both cases are identical; (ii) the trademarks are identical; (iii) the rights being asserted are identical i.e., infringement, passing off, etc.; and (iv) the cause of action is also identical. 9. the only difference between the two suits is that in the first suit before the commercial court, an order for rendition of accounts of profit and a decree for the amount found due has been sought. however, in the suit before this court, damages to the tune of inr 2,00,01,000/has been sought. apart from this, there is no perceptible difference between the two suits. this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 10. the justification sought to be given by the plaintiff for preferring the present suit is the delay being caused in the adjudication of even an interim application in the first suit filed by the plaintiff before the commercial court in december, 2017. with regard to this submission, the court has also perused the order sheet of the said suit before the commercial court. the same shows that: • on 3rd january, 2018, summons was issued in the said suit. • by march, 2018, the pleadings were completed and certain technical objections were taken in the replication. • on 4th july, 2018, the matter was adjourned for hearing on the injunction application. • on 20th october, 2018, arguments were heard on the injunction application and the matter was adjourned for orders by mr. siddharth mathur, ld. adj-02 (north-west), rohini courts, delhi. • on 28th november, 2018, again the matter was adjourned for clarification and orders. no orders were pronounced. • on 7th january, 2019, the matter was listed for re-arguments. • again, on 25th february, 2019, the matter was listed for rearguments on the injunction application. • on 30th july, 2019, another judicial officer listed the matter on 24th october, 2019 for hearing on the injunction application. notably, by this time, the judicial officer, to whom this suit was assigned, had been changed. the matter was listed before various judicial officers after that. this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 • on subsequent dates being 24th october, 2019 and 16th december, 2019, the parties sought adjournments. • thereafter, on 2nd december, 2020, a fresh application for interim injunction was filed by the plaintiff and the old injunction application was withdrawn. • the matter was partially heard on 3rd march, 2021 on the fresh interim injunction application. • the matter was adjourned on the next few dates, upon counsels' requests or otherwise. an application for early hearing was also filed by the plaintiff around february, 2022. • however, thereafter on 10th march, 2022, the plaintiff sought an adjournment for filing of an application under order vi rule 17 cpc and the matter was adjourned to 12th april, 2022. 11. in view of this fact situation and in view of the ratio of the decision of the supreme court in bengal waterproof (supra), the question is whether the delay in the adjudication of the interim injunction application in the first suit, would justify the filing of the present suit. 12. the plaintiff has relied upon the decision in bengal waterproof (supra), to support its submissions that this suit is maintainable as a new cause of action arises with every fresh sale of the infringing product. in bengal waterproof (supra), a suit was filed by the plaintiff in 1980, which was dismissed on 9th april, 1982. in 1982, after the dismissal of the first suit, a second suit was filed by the plaintiff on the ground that the defendant continued to use the trademark 'dackback' thereby infringing the plaintiff's trademark 'duckback' despite having been served with two legal notices. the trial court dismissed the second suit on the ground of res this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 judicata and order ii rule 2 cpc. the ld. single judge of the high court agreed with the plaintiff on merits of their case for infringement, but held that the second suit was barred under order ii rule 2 cpc. the high court held that the suit would not be barred under res judicata. the finding on merits was not challenged by the defendant before the supreme court. therefore, the only question before the supreme court was whether the second suit was maintainable. the observations of the supreme court are set out below: \"12.wherever and whenever fresh deceitful act is committed the person deceived would naturally have a fresh cause of action in his favour. thus every time when a person passes off his goods as those of another he commits the act of such deceit. similarly whenever and wherever a person commits breach of a registered trade mark of another he commits a recurring act of breach or infringement of such trade mark giving a recurring and fresh cause of action at each time of such infringement to the party aggrieved. it is difficult to agree how in such a case when in historical past earlier suit was disposed of as technically not maintainable in absence of proper reliefs, for all times to come in future defendant of such a suit should be armed with a licence to go on committing fresh acts of infringement and passing off with impunity without being subjected to any legal action against such future acts. we posed a question to the learned counsel for the defendants as to whether after the disposal of the earlier suit if the defendants had suspended their business activities and after a few years had resumed the same and had started selling their goods under the trade mark 'dackback' by passing them off, the plaintiff could have been prohibited and prevented by the bar of order 2 rule 2 sub-rule (3) from filing a fresh suit in future when such future infringement or passing off took place. he rightly and fairly stated that such a suit would not be barred. but his only grievance this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 was that whatever was the infringement or passing off alleged against the defendants in 1980 had, according to the plaintiff, continued uninterrupted and, therefore, in substance the cause of action in both the suits was identical. it is difficult to agree. in cases of continuous causes of action or recurring causes of action bar of order 2 rule 2 sub-rule (3) cannot be invoked. in this connection it is profitable to have a look at section 22 of the limitation act, 1963. it lays down that 'in the case of a continuing breach of contract or in the case of a continuing tort, a fresh period of limitation begins to run at every moment of the time during which the branch or the tort, as the case may be, continues. as act of passing off is an act of deceit and tort every time when such tortious act or deceit is committed by the defendant the plaintiff gets a fresh cause of action to come to the court by appropriate proceedings. similarly infringement of a registered trade mark would also be a continuing wrong so long as infringement continues. therefore, whether the earlier infringement has continued or a new infringement has taken place cause of action for filing a fresh suit would obviously arise in favour of the plaintiff who is aggrieved by such fresh infringements of trade mark or fresh passing off actions alleged against the defendant. consequently, in our view even on merits the learned trial judge as well as the learned single judge were obviously in error in taking the view that the second suit of the plaintiff in the present case was barred by order 2 rule 2 sub-rule (3), cpc.\" 13. a perusal of the above would show that the supreme court was persuaded by the fact that the earlier suit was disposed of as technically not maintainable in the absence of proper reliefs. such a dismissal of a suit on technical grounds, as per the decision in bengal waterproof (supra), would not come in the way of a fresh suit being filed and being maintained for all times to come in the future. the dismissal of a suit cannot be treated by the defendant as a license to continue the infringement and passing off. thus, this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 the present case is completely distinguishable from the facts in bengal waterproof (supra). herein, the first suit filed by the plaintiff is still pending. the cause of action in the second suit relates to 2017 which is the same cause of action as in the first suit. moreover, the adjudication on merits in the first suit is yet to take place. 14. on the other hand, the defendants have relied upon the following judgments: • hari ram v. lichmaniya & ors., air 2003 raj. 319. • ranbir singh v. dalbir singh & ors., cs(os) 802/2002, decision dated 19th december, 2008. • prapti fashions private limited and ors. v. manoj kumar gupta, 2013 (55) ptc 234 (cal). • vijay kumar gupta v. state of west bengal [slp (crl.) 10951 of 2019, decided on 22nd march, 2022]. 15. the first two judgments relied upon by mr. sahni, ld. counsel, again relate to completely different fact situations. both relate to immovable property and whether a subsequent suit would be barred due to order ii rule 2 cpc or res judicata. 16. in hari ram (supra), the court was considering a situation wherein the plaintiff had filed a suit for possession in respect of agricultural land in 1957. the same was successful in a second appeal and finally a decree for possession was granted in favour of the plaintiff. an execution petition was filed for execution of the decree which was finally dropped after the possession of the land was handed over to the legal representative of the plaintiff. the decree became final in 1960 and the right of mr. ram chandra plaintiffto take possession from the defendant mr. hari ram became this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 final and crystalized. execution proceedings and criminal proceedings were filed. however, the criminal proceedings were dropped on 13 th may, 1982. mr. hari ram wished to seek declaration of his khatedaari tenancy rights for which he instituted a suit in 1983 for recovery of the possession. a second suit was filed by mr. hari ram in 1990. during the pendency of the second suit, the first suit was withdrawn. the question was as to whether the second suit was maintainable. the high court of rajasthan, held that the second suit would not be maintainable in view of order xxiii rule 1 cpc. in respect of filing of the second suit, the court observed as under: \".25. it is immaterial whether plaintiff files another suit with respect to the subjectmatter against the same party during the pendency of his earlier suit or after withdrawal of the earlier suit without leave of the court to file fresh suit, consequence is the same and i.e., abandonment of his claim with statutory restriction against second suit as provided in sub-rule (4) of rule 1 of order 23, c.p.c. even if, the principles of res judicata cannot be applied still the plaintiff cannot have any permission to walk in court and go out of the court after inflicting injury upon the defendant and even upon the court of dragging in litigation and wasting precious time without having any consequence of coming into the court and compelling other party to face the litigation may it be for long period or for shortest period. the complete scheme of the civil procedure code makes it unambiguously clear that a party can have one opportunity to approach the court for getting decision on all the issues raised and on all the issues which could have been raised by the plaintiff at the time of filing suit by the plaintiff and further even on the issues which arise on the pleas of the defendant taken in defence to destroy plaintiffs claim by establishing hollowness of the plaintiffs claim or by establishing his right, title or interest in the subject-matter necessary to destroy plaintiffs claim. if the plaintiff withdraws from the suit, this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 he is at liberty to do so only with consequence of losing all his claims with respect to the subject-matter of the suit. once defendant is invited by the plaintiff and who is contesting the suit, not agreeing to satisfy the plaintiff for his claim and reliefs expressly in terms of sub-rule (3) of rule 1 of order 23, c.p.c. to the satisfaction of the court, the plaintiff unilaterally cannot walk out of the court by saying that he himself feels satisfied about his claim and reliefs for which defendant never conceded and plaintiff cannot take away right of the defendant to get the decision on the issues involved in the suit on the basis of the pleading of both the parties to the suit irrespective of the burden of proving the issues. it is true that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant can be compelled to litigate, but after filing suit any of them may not contest or can withdraw from contest but only with by conceding other's claim or withdrawal of his claim for ever. litigant after start of litigation cannot avoid its lawful and final decision nor have right to prevent court from deciding the dispute as it is not convenient to them at this point of time and to keep the dispute alive for adjudication by the court at the time which suits them or suits them by changing their capacity, plaintiff to defendant or vice versa. the proposition is in consonance with number of provisions of the civil procedure code, which are enacted to avoid multiplicity of the proceedings by the parties in the court.\" 17. in ranbir singh (supra), relied upon by the defendant, again the suit related to immovable property. permanent injunction was sought by both the parties against each other in two suits. the plaintiff then filed a third suit and the court observed that mere addition of one prayer would not change the character of the earlier suit. the plaintiff did not wish to withdraw the first suit and hence the third suit was held to be not maintainable, since the foundation of both the suits was the same. the third suit was, therefore, dismissed by the ld. single judge. the ld. single judge of this court this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 observed as under: \"25. the first suit filed by the plaintiff herein before the district judge is still pending. plaintiff has not withdrawn the said suit under order xxiii, rule 1 of the code with liberty to file a fresh suit. plaintiff herein does not want to withdraw the said suit. there is no adjudication or decision by the additional district judge that the first suit filed by the plaintiff is not maintainable or requires amendment. this court while examining whether the second suit is maintainable cannot decide the question and pass an order in the first suit holding that the same suffers from a technical defect and therefore should be dismissed as withdrawn under order xxiii, rule 1 of the code with liberty to file a fresh suit. no such prayer is made nor any such prayer can be entertained in the present suit. it may be noted that the plaintiff is not inclined to withdraw the first suit. further even if there is a technical defect, the plaintiff herein can always amend the plaint. plaintiff, however, cannot file a second suit, ignoring provisions of code and embroil the defendant no. 1 in a second litigation. the plaintiff does not have permission to file a second suit. if the plea of the plaintiff is accepted, a plaintiff can keep on filing repeated suits by making averments in the plaint that the earlier suit suffers from a technical defect but he need not withdraw the earlier suit. in the plaint filed in the present suit there is no averment that the suit filed before the district judge is not maintainable due to a technical defect and therefore the plaintiff is filing the present suit with the intention and desire to withdraw the first suit pending before the learned additional district judge. 26. the present suit should not be allowed to continue as it amounts to abuse of the process of court. it should be disposed of at this stage itself, lest it creates further complications or conflicting decisions and further time and costs are incurred. the present suit is mere duplication of suit no. 300/1997 filed. both suits, the present suit and the suit pending before the district court being suit no. 300/1997 is filed by the same this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 person, i.e. the plaintiff himself. provisions of order ii, rules 1 and 2 read with sections 9 and 12 of the code are therefore clearly applicable and the present suit is barred under the said provisions. the plaintiff cannot be permitted and allowed to file multiple litigations on the same cause of action. this amounts to sheer abuse of the process of court and harassment of defendant no. 1 who has been dragged to this court and made to incur expenses\". 18. this order was upheld by the division bench on 18th july, 2012 in ranbir singh v. dalbir singh & ors., [rfa(os) 50/2009, decision dated 18th july, 2012]. 19. insofar as immovable property is concerned, therefore, it is clear that following hari ram (supra) and ranbir singh (supra), two suits relating to the same relief and the same immovable property, would not be maintainable. in matters concerning trademarks which relate to intangible property, apart from bengal waterproof (supra), there are further decisions which discuss the issue of maintainability of multiple suits. 20. in this regard, mr. sahni, ld. counsel had also relied upon prapti fashions private limited and ors. v. manoj kumar gupta, 2013 (55) ptc 234(cal), a decision of the ld. single judge of the calcutta high court. however, it has been thereafter mentioned by ld. counsel for the plaintiff that the said decision was overruled by the ld. division bench and later on the slp was dismissed. thus, this court considers the view of the division bench in prapti fashions private limited and ors. v. manoj kumar gupta, 2014 (59) ptc 667(cal). in this case, the grievance of the plaintiff was in respect of the use of the mark 'prapti' by the defendant. the first suit was filed in 2012, which was not pursued and was dismissed. at the this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 time of dismissal, a second suit was already filed in 2013 before the high court, and was pending for similar reliefs. the ld. single judge held that the second suit was not maintainable as no liberty was sought while withdrawing the first suit. however, the ld. division bench held that since the second suit was already pending, no liberty was required to be sought. the observations of the ld. division bench are as under: \"14.section 10, 11, order xxiii read together, would unequivocally suggest, legislature did not want any conflict of decision on the same issue as also wanted to stop multiplicity of proceeding. in the present case, the plaintiff filed two suits on the identical cause of action. his later suit could be stayed till the disposal of the earlier suit however, no suit could be dismissed because of pendency of the other suit. once the former suit is decided the result would preclude the court to hear the later suit. to avoid such situation, the plaintiff prayed for withdrawal of the earlier suit that could at best help the defendant/respondent to criticize the conduct of the plaintiff and pray for adequate damage for the harassment.\" 21. accordingly, in this judgement, the calcutta high court holds that a second suit can only be stayed under section 10 cpc but cannot be dismissed. 22. in indian herbs research & supply co. ltd. and ors. v. lalji mal & ors., 95 (2002) dlt 723, the plaintiff sought an injunction in respect of the trademark 'himalayan batisa'. the defendant was using 'himalaya batisa no. 777'. the plaintiff had served a notice in 1985 upon the defendant and had thereafter filed a suit in 1986, before the district judge, saharanpur. the suit was decreed in favour of the plaintiff in terms of a settlement which was entered into in march, 1987 stating that in the future this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 the defendant would not use the mark 'himalaya batisa no. 777'. the defendant had closed its firm thereafter. however, the defendant started a new firm and in 1995 started using the mark 'himalayan batisa'. accordingly, an execution application was filed by the plaintiff. the said execution application was initially dismissed but the high court reversed the said dismissal and remanded the execution matter back to the district court in bhiwani. in july, 2000, the defendant had continued to use the mark and a fresh suit was filed by the plaintiff in the delhi high court, as the plaintiff came to know that the defendant was using the said mark 'himalayan batisa' in delhi also. the question was whether the new suit was maintainable in view of the previous suit which had been settled by a compromise decree and the pending execution proceedings in bhiwani. in this context, the ld. single judge relied upon bengal waterproof (supra) and held as under: \"11. learned counsel for the defendants has tried to distinguish this authority saying that in the said case, previous suit was dismissed whereas in the case in hand, previous suit was decreed in terms of compromise. the distinction drawn by learned counsel, to my mind, is of no avail. in a case of infringement of trade mark or copyright or passing off action, dismissal or decreeing of the earlier suit is immaterial as by each deceitful act of the defendant by way of committing breach of registered trade mark of another person, he commits a recurring act of breach and infringement of such trade mark which gives rise to a recurring and fresh cause of action each time.\" 23. in the recent case of m/s allied blenders and distillers pvt. ltd. & ors. v. amit dahanukar & anr. 261 (2019) dlt 692, the plaintiffs sought protection of the marks 'manson house' and 'savoy club' in this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 respect of alcohol. the defendants were ex-licensees of the plaintiffs. the plaintiff had filed a suit in 2009 in the bombay high court wherein the bombay high court had held in favour of the defendants by dismissing the plaintiffs' interim injunction application and the counter claim of the defendants had also been allowed. the bombay high court had also passed an interim order restraining the plaintiffs from introducing any products with the subject trademarks in the market without leave of the bombay high court. the defendants argued that the filing of the subsequent suit before the delhi high court by the plaintiffs, would be a case of forum shopping and owing to the principle of comity, the delhi high court ought not to adjudicate in favour of the plaintiffs. it was also observed by the bombay high court that the plaintiffs had filed the suit before the delhi high court while proceedings in bombay were ongoing and injunction had been rejected already, and therefore the bombay high court restrained the plaintiffs from taking steps in the delhi proceedings for some time. in view of all these facts, i.e., the parties being the same and the suits having commonality of interest, the ld. single judge of the delhi high court, held this to be a case of forum shopping and observed as under: \"29. the facts of the present case are glaring. the parties to the suit in bombay and the present suit are virtually identical/have a commonality of interest. the said suit in bombay was filed in 2009. interim injunction application was dismissed on 22.02.2011 and a clear prima facie findings of fact were recorded in favour of the defendants and against the plaintiffs. it is thereafter that the present suit has been filed on 10.10.2014. the plaintiffs seek interim orders from this court despite being declined relief by the bombay high court. 30. keeping in view the legal position it is manifest that this court has to give due deference to the enunciation this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 made by another court especially when the litigants are the same. in my opinion, the above legal proposition squarely applies to the facts of the case. the plaintiff having filed suit based on identical facts before the bombay high court and having been declined an interim injunction cannot now try to overreach the said order of the bombay high court and file the present suit in delhi high court seeking an interim injunction. if this court were to agree with the contentions of the plaintiff and were to pass an interim order in favour of the plaintiff it would be passing an order wholly contrary to the order of the bombay high court.\" 24. therefore, the court dismissed the defendants' application under order xxxix rule 1 and 2 cpc. insofar as the application under order ii rule 2 cpc filed by the defendants was concerned, the court dismissed the said application, relying upon bengal waterproof (supra), on the ground that in the suit before the bombay high court, relief relating to infringement of trademark had not been sought, but the same was sought in the suit before the delhi high court. 25. a perusal of all these decisions shows that the decisions in bengal waterproof (supra), prapti (supra), indian herbs (supra) and m/s allied blenders and distillers pvt. ltd. (supra) are completely distinguishable from the facts of the present case. the judgment in bengal waterproof (supra) and the decisions following the said judgment have to be read in the context and the facts in those cases. in bengal waterproof (supra), the first suit was dismissed due to technical reasons. in prapti fashions (supra), the first suit had been withdrawn and there was no adjudication on merits, when the maintainability of the second suit was considered. in indian herbs (supra) a decree which was already granted in favour of the defendant which was not being complied with. in m/s allied blenders and distillers this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 pvt. ltd. & ors. (supra), the issue of infringement of registered trademark was not raised before the bombay high court in the first suit. thus, the second suit was held to be maintainable but the delhi high court still showed deference to the orders in the first suit and rejected the injunction application. 26. as opposed to the facts in the above decisions, in the present case there are two suits based on the same cause of action, for the same time period. in this regard, the plaintiff has also made a statement in the plaint that it would withdraw the first suit. the said plea reads as under: \"the plaintiff in the year 2019, withdrew its injunction application filed in the year 2017 as the defendant's took a technical objection that the interim injunction prayer does not mention the word passing off. therefore, out of abundant caution, a fresh injunction application. it is pertinent to note that even after lapse of 5 years post the filing of the suit and despite the best efforts of the parties, the matter is still at the stage of interim injunction and the said application has not been decided till date. the plaintiff shall be withdrawing the said suit.\" 27. there can be no doubt to the legal proposition that whenever there is a fresh cause of action, a fresh suit would lie. however, the same has to be within the four corners of law. the plea of continuing cause of action cannot be stretched to an impermissible limit so as to permit multiple suits between the same parties relating to the same trademarks in different fora. this would constitute clear forum shopping, since if the plaintiff's submission is accepted, a party would be permitted to file multiple suits in different courts until it hits upon a forum where relief is granted in its favour. in the present case, as recorded earlier, the reliefs sought in both the suits in the present matter are identical, except for the relief of rendition of accounts which has this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 now been projected as a relief for damages. 28. as for the reliefs of rendition of accounts and relief for damages, this court also notes that in any suit for infringement of registered trademark and passing off, as per section 135(1) of the trademarks act, 1999, the plaintiff can sue either for relief for damages or on accounts of profits. the said provision reads as under: \"(1) the relief which a court may grant in any suit for infringement or for passing off referred to in section 134 includes injunction (subject to such terms, if any, as the court thinks fit) and at the option of the plaintiff, either damages or an account of profits, together with or without any order for the delivery-up of the infringing labels and marks for destruction or erasure.\" 29. this bar of seeking only either rendition of accounts or damages cannot be circumvented by filing two separate suits. it would be impermissible for the plaintiff to avoid the impact of this provision by seeking to distinguish the two suits, by claiming that one is a suit for rendition of accounts and the other is a suit for damages. only one relief can be claimed for infringement of the same mark either damages or rendition of accounts. 30. having discussed that changing one relief from rendition of accounts to damages is not permissible, the only other ground on which the plaintiff seeks to justify the filing of the present suit is the non-grant of relief in the first suit in the form of interim injunction by the commercial court. admittedly, the order sheets of the commercial court show that the matter has been adjourned sometimes unnecessarily. but can the plaintiff rely on this fact as the sole ground to maintain the present suit? the answer is an emphatic no. a perusal of the order sheet of the trial court as recorded this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 above shows that the commercial court is seized of the matter and submissions have been partly heard on the injunction application. the entertaining of this suit before this court, would in effect mean that the plaintiff would be permitted to argue again on merits and seek an interim injunction here, while the same matter is part-heard before the commercial court. 31. in view of all these reasons including identity of the cause of action, multiple reliefs being impermissible under section 135 of the trademarks act and the present suit being filed during the pendency of the first suit, if the present suit is entertained by this court, this would clearly encourage forum shopping by a litigant who has been unable to get relief in a particular forum and hence decides to knock the doors of this court. the principle of forum shopping has been recently decried by the supreme court in vijay kumar gupta (supra) where the court has held as under: \"7. predominantly, the indian judiciary has time and again reiterated that forum shopping take several hues and shades but the concept of 'forum shopping' has not been rendered an exclusive definition in any indian statute. forum shopping as per merriam webster dictionary is: the practice of choosing the court in which to bring an action from among those courts that could properly exercise jurisdiction based on determination of which court is likely to provide the most favourable outcome. 8 . the indian judiciary's observation and obiter dicta has aided in streamlining the concept of forum shopping in the indian legal system. this court has condemned the practice of forum shopping by litigants and termed it as an abuse of law and also deciphered different categories of forum shopping. xxx xxx xxx 10. forum shopping has been termed as disreputable this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 practice by the courts and has no sanction and paramountcy in law. in spite of this court condemning the practice of forum shopping, respondent no. 2 filed two complaints i.e., a complaint under section 156(3) code of criminal procedure before the tis hazari court, new delhi o 06.06.2012 and a complaint which was eventually registered as fir no. 168 under section 406, 420, 120b indian penal code before ps bowbazar, calcutta o 28.03.2013. i.e., one in delhi and one complaint in kolkata. the complaint filed in kolkata was a reproduction of the complaint filed in delhi except with the change of place occurrence in order to create a jurisdiction. 11. a two-judge bench of this court in krishna lal chawla and ors. v. state of u.p. and anr. manu/sc/0161/2021 : (2021) 5 scc 435 observed that multiple complaints by the same party against the same accused in respect of the same incident is impermissible. it held that permitting multiple complaints by the same party in respect of the same incident, whether it involves a cognizable or private complaint offence, will lead to the accused being entangled in numerous criminal proceedings. as such he would be forced to keep surrendering his liberty and precious time before the police and the courts, as and when required in each case.\" 32. this court is clearly of the view that the present case would be a classic case of forum shopping. it is a mis-adventure to say the least. 33. in so far as the delay in adjudication in the commercial court is concerned, any grievance which the plaintiff may have in respect of the delays caused in the first suit, the plaintiff would be free to seek its remedies in accordance with law in respect of the said delays. 34. pertinent to note that such a situation was also not contemplated in the decision of bengal waterproof (supra). while there is no doubt that intangible property such as a trademark deserves to be protected from this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 misuse, owners of trademarks also cannot be permitted to misuse the court's process. principles such as res judicata, res subjudice, bar under order ii rule 2 cpc, forum shopping, which apply in general to civil and criminal proceedings would also be applicable to trademark suits as well. a trademark owner cannot drag a defendant to multiple fora, being a higher court or before a court of coordinate jurisdiction, when the matter is pending before the first court, especially when the matter is part heard before the first court, until the plaintiff finds a forum where it is able to get relief. 35. therefore, this court is clearly of the opinion that while the ld. adj is seized of the same very matter between the same very parties, the present suit cannot be entertained on the basis of the plea that there is a fresh cause of action. this would be a gross abuse of the process and would in fact be contrary to public policy. if such a suit is entertained, it would encourage litigants to indulge in forum shopping which cannot be the objective of the provisions of section 10 and 11 of the cpc. this would also result in unnecessary burden on the defendant who would be forced to incur repeated legal costs and undue harassment. such a course of action cannot be condoned by the court. 36. moreover, an analysis of the position in the first suit would show that the plaintiff has sought interim injunction and permanent injunction coupled with rendition of accounts of profits till the date an injunction order is passed. therefore, if the plaintiff is successful in the first suit, the relief that would be granted by the court would also cover the period for which the fresh cause of action is being sought to be portrayed in the present suit before the high court. additionally, if the plaintiff is successful, rendition of accounts may also be granted by the commercial court which would this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 include the accounts for the period sought to be covered by the present suit. thus, the cause of action by itself of the present suit would be subsumed in the first suit since the first suit is still pending. in none of the judgements cited by the parties or which the court has come across, such a fact situation has arisen. 37. as for the proceedings before the commercial court in the present matter, this court notes with some consternation that this state of affairs has arisen because of the fact that the presiding officer who had heard the matter and had to pass orders chose to delay the decision in the interim injunction application indefinitely until he got transferred from the said posting. this court has repeatedly emphasised on the need for judicial officers to pronounce orders after hearing arguments and not releasing matters. in fact, whenever transfer of a judicial officer is effected, if orders are pending to be passed in a matter that the said judicial officer is seized of, a note is issued to the effect that the order has to be pronounced. the supreme court has, repeatedly, in anil rai v. state of bihar, (2001) 7 scc 318 and balaji baliram mupade & anr. v. state of maharashtra & ors. [civil appeal no. 3564/2020, decided on 29th october, 2020] emphasised the importance of timely pronouncement of judgments and orders once submissions are heard. the said judgements were also considered by this court in deepti khera v. siddharth khera [cm (m) 1637/2019, decided on 18th november, 2019], the observations in deepti khera (supra) where anil rai (supra) is also extracted are set out below: \"6. it is the settled position in law, as per the judgment of the hon'ble supreme court in anil rai v. state of bihar, (2001) 7 scc 318 that once matters are reserved for orders, usually, the same should be this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 pronounced within a time schedule. in anil rai (supra) it has been observed as under: \"8. the intention of the legislature regarding pronouncement of judgments can be inferred from the provisions of the code of criminal procedure. sub-section (1) of section 353 of the code provides that the judgment in every trial in any criminal court of original jurisdiction, shall be pronounced in open court immediately after the conclusion of the trial or on some subsequent time for which due notice shall be given to the parties or their pleaders. the words \"some subsequent time\" mentioned in section 353 contemplate the passing of the judgment without undue delay, as delay in the pronouncement of judgment is opposed to the principle of law. such subsequent time can at the most be stretched to a period of six weeks and not beyond that time in any case. the pronouncement of judgments in the civil case should not be permitted to go beyond two months.\" 7. the hon'ble supreme court in anil rai (supra) has also passed certain guidelines regarding pronouncement of judgments. the same are reproduced below: (i) the chief justices of the high courts may issue appropriate directions to the registry that in a case where the judgment is reserved and is pronounced later, a column be added in the judgment where, on the first page, after the cause-title, date of reserving the judgment and date of pronouncing it be separately mentioned by the court officer concerned. (ii) that chief justices of the high courts, on their administrative side, should direct the court officers/readers of the various benches in the high courts to furnish every month the this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 list of cases in the matters where the judgments reserved are not pronounced within the period of that month. (iii) on noticing that after conclusion of the arguments the judgment is not pronounced within a period of two months, the chief justice concerned shall draw the attention of the bench concerned to the pending matter. the chief justice may also see the desirability of circulating the statement of such cases in which the judgments have not been pronounced within a period of six weeks from the date of conclusion of the arguments amongst the judges of the high court for their information. such communication be conveyed as confidential and in a sealed cover. (iv) where a judgment is not pronounced within three months from the date of reserving it, any of the parties in the case is permitted to file an application in the high court with a prayer for early judgment. such application, as and when filed, shall be listed before the bench concerned within two days excluding the intervening holidays. (v) if the judgment, for any reason, is not pronounced within a period of six months, any of the parties of the said lis shall be entitled to move an application before the chief justice of the high court with a prayer to withdraw the said case and to make it over to any other bench for fresh arguments. it is open to the chief justice to grant the said prayer or to pass any other order as he deems fit in the circumstances. 8. the civil procedure code, 1908, prescribes thirty days as the time in which a judgment should be pronounced. order xx rule 1 of the cpc reads as this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 under: \"1. judgment when pronounced. -[(1) the court, after the case has been heard, shall pronounce judgment in an open court, either at once, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable and when the judgment is to be pronounced on some future day, the court shall fix a day for that purpose, of which due notice shall be given to the parties or their pleaders: provided that where the judgment is not pronounced at once, every endeavour shall be made by the court to pronounce the judgment within thirty days from the date on which the hearing of the case was concluded but, where it is not practicable so to do on the ground of the exceptional and extraordinary circumstances of the case, the court shall fix a future day for the pronouncement of the judgment, and such day shall not ordinarily be a day beyond sixty days from the date on which the hearing of the case was concluded, and due notice of the day so fixed shall be given to the parties or their pleaders.]\" 9. while this court is conscious of the fact that there are pressures on the trial courts, non-pronouncement of orders for more than a year cannot be held to be justified. it has been observed in several matters that trial courts keep matters `for orders' for months together and sometimes orders are not pronounced for even 2-3 years. thereafter the judicial officer is transferred or posted in some other jurisdiction and the matter has to be reargued. such a practice puts enormous burden on the system and on litigants/lawyers. the usual practice ought to be to pronounce orders within the time schedule laid down in the cpc as also the various judgements of the supreme court. in civil cases maximum period of two months can be taken for this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 pronouncing orders, unless there are exceptional cases or there are very complex issues that are involved. 10. accordingly, in respect of pronouncement of orders, the following directions are issued: i. when arguments are heard, the order sheet ought to reflect that the matter is part-heard; ii. upon conclusion of arguments, the order sheet ought to clearly reflect that the arguments have been heard and the matter is reserved for orders. if the court is comfortable in giving a specific date for pronouncing orders, specific date ought to be given; iii. orders ought to be pronounced in terms of the judgment of the supreme court in anil rai (supra); iv. the order ought to specify the date when orders were reserved and the date of pronouncement of the order.\" 38. this has been reiterated repeatedly, most recently in sandhya srivastava v. dr. neelam mishra & ors. [w.p.(c.) 2207/2021, decided on 18th february, 2021]. 39. accordingly, it is deemed appropriate to bring the present judgment to the notice of the inspecting committee of the concerned judicial officer by the worthy registrar general of this court. copy of this order be sent to the concerned inspecting committee through the worthy registrar general, as also for circulation to all judicial officers in the trial court. 40. the present suit is dismissed as not maintainable. all pending applications are disposed of. 41. it is made clear that this would, however, not affect the merits of the pending suit being cs (comm.) no. 300 of 2019 before the trial court. 42. needless to add, any remedies which the plaintiff may have in respect this is a digitally signed judgement. neutral citation no: 2022/dhc/001212 of proceedings qua the first suit being cs (comm.) no. 300 of 2019, pending before the ld. adj-2, rohini courts, delhi, or the delay caused therein, are left open for the plaintiff to avail in accordance with law. 43. the order in this matter was dictated in open court on 28th march, 2022. however, before the order was signed, certain further submissions and judgments were filed later by the ld. counsels. hence the said judgments and submissions have been considered while finalizing this order. 44. the digitally signed copy of this order, duly uploaded on the official website of the delhi high court, www.delhihighcourt.nic.in, shall be treated as the certified copy of the order for the purpose of ensuring compliance. no physical copy of orders shall be insisted upon by any authority/entity or litigant. prathiba m. singh judge march 28, 2022/aman/rahul/ms (corrected & released on 5th april, 2022) this is a digitally signed judgement."
