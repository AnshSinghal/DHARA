The brief facts leading to the Revisions are as follows:\n(i) The respondent in the first two Revisions, viz., CRP Nos.3672 and 3800 of 2022, viz., Madhanraj, HUF represented by its Kartha Madhanraj filed commercial original suit in C.O.S. No. 118 of 2021 [Lateron, on the formation of Commercial Court transferred from the Principal District Court, Salem and renumbered as C.O.S.No.9 of 2022]. As per said the plaint averment, the defendant who is the revision petitioner in C.R.P. Nos.3672 and 3800 of 2022 and 2123 of 2023 and respondent in CRP No.338 of 2023 was then and there borrowing money from the respondent / plaintiff herein on from various dates from 21-11-2013 onwards either by bank account transfer or by cash for the defendant/petitioner's urgent personal and business requirements by assuring to the repay the debt with interest at the rate of Rs.1/- per 100 per month. As per the account maintained by the plaintiff, the defendant was liable to pay a sum of Rs.2,09,72,300/- towards principal and interest as on 7-12-2019. On which day, the amount due was rounded off to Rs.2,05,00,000/- to which, the defendant acknowledged and executed the promissory note for Rs.2,05,00,000/- on 7-12-2019. \nThereafter, on 18-02-2021, the defendant borrowed Rs.29,00,000/- from the plaintiff for the urgent personal use and executed a promissory note on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 18-2-2021 in favour of the plaintiff assuring to repay the same with an interest at the rate of Rs.1 per 100 per month to the plaintiff.\n(ii) It is further alleged in the plaint that when the plaintiff demanded the defendant to repay the debt, the defendant issued cheques on 08-05-2021 dated 21-7-2021 for a sum of Rs.20,00,000/- and cheque dated 25-06-2021 for a sum of Rs 25,00,000/- and two cheques dated 26- 7-2021 for a sum of Rs.50,00,000/- each. It is stated in the plaint that when the cheques were presented, it was dishonoured under the endorsement either funds insufficient or exceeds, thereby, entitling the plaintiff to send a statutory legal notice on 10-8-2021 demanding the cheque amounts. Though the notice was received on 11-8-2021 instead of honouring the cheque, the defendant seems to have sent a reply on 16-8-2021 to which the plaintiff sent a rejoinder notice on 21-8-2021 that was received by the defendant and the defendant seems to have issued reply to the rejoinder notice sent by the plaintiff.\n( iii) Thereafter, the plaintiff has initiated criminal proceedings before the Judicial Magistrate - V, Salem on 20-9-2021 for an offence under Section 138 Negotiable Instruments Act. However, reserving his right to file civil suit against the defendant. Therefore the plaintiff, who is the respondent herein has held the defendant / petitioner herein in the first above three Revision Petitions liable to pay Rs.2,34,00,000/- alongwith https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 interest at the rate of Rs.1/- per 100 per month to the plaintiff. Thus, the plaintiff has invoked the Commercial Courts Act 2015 and filed the same before the Commercial Court at Salem, District Judge of Salem. \n(iv) Pending suit, immediately after the receipt of the suit summons, the defendant/the petitioner in the 1st three above referred Revisions has filed I.A. No. 2 of 2022 invoking Order 7 Rule 11(a) and (d) of CPC seeking rejection of plaint on the ground that the Commercial Court has no jurisdiction to try the Money Suit, which is otherwise capriciously drafted to attract the Commercial Courts Act 2015, apart from various among other grounds raised in this petition. Though, the petition under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC was filed and arguments were heard from both the sides, the learned District Judge, Commercial Court, Salem has dismissed I.A No. 2 of 2022 in a one line order without specifying any reasons on merits and discussing the same which is fervous and hence C.R.P.No. 3672 of 2022 is filed challenging the same. \n(v) As far as C.R.P.No.3800 of 2022 is concerned, an application was filed in I.A.No. 4 of 2022 by the respondent / plaintiff seeking to amend the plaint filed in Commercial Original Suit in No.9 of 2022 under Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC and the same was allowed by order dated 3-9-2022 and the same is challenged in this revision petition.\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 (vi) Further, C.R.P.No. 2123 of 2023, is filed by the petitioner / defendant to strike off the plaint in C.O.S.No.10 of 2023 on the file of District Judge, Commercial Court, Salem. The said suit was filed by the respondent, viz., Niranjani, wife of Madhanraj invoking Commercial Court jurisdiction at Salem seeking a decree in favour of her directing the petitioners / defendants to pay a sum of Rs.2,84,85.962/- along with the accrued interest on Rs.2,16,00,000/- at Rs.1 per 100 per month from the date of institution of suit. \n(vii) The C.R.P.No.338 of 2023 is filed by the petitioner / plaintiff as against the order made in I.A.No.6 of 2022 dated 20.10.2022 [which was preferred by the respondent / defendant to file statement of truth under Order 6 Rule 15-A of CPC], on the ground that the statement of truth ought to have been filed within 120 days i.e., 13-2-2022 and has been filed with a delay of 249 days, which according to the plaintiff is an erroneous order passed by the District Judge, Commercial Court at Salem and the court below allowed the said pettion by permitting the statement of truth. \n3. The learned Senior counsel appearing for revision petitioner in C.R.P.3672 of 2022 and C.R.P. No. 3800 of 2022 would contend that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 dismissal of the petition filed under Order 7 Rule 11(a) and (d) seeks intervention of this Court, in as much as the learned District Judge dismissed the same in one line order, despite the petitioner had taken earnest effort to convince the court that the suit itself is not maintainable invoking Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and if at all the same is maintained, the suit is barred by limitation, as contemplated under the Commercial Courts Act 2015 and the Limitation Act. Thatapart, the learned Senior Counsel also urged upon this Court that the commercial courts act is not intended from the suits of ordinary money claim on alleged promissory note to invoke the commercial courts act and the jurisdiction of the court which the very purpose of the act will be defeated. He would further contend that that the claim made by the plaintiff in this suit does not fall under any one of the 22 categories, as mentioned under Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. The plaintiff has pouched his pleadings to fit in the jurisdiction of the Commercial Courts Act, which in otherwise would ordinarily be a money suit rather than being filed under Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The learned counsel further submitted that the promissory notes have not authorized to file under the commercial courts and commercial division, as the same are not mercantile documents as defined in Section 2(1) of the commercial courts act, hence, pleaded the dismissal of the suit in C.O.S.No.9 of 2022 and allow C.R.P.Nos 3672 and 3800 of 2022. \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 4 . Lastly, the learned Senior counsel appearing for revision petitioner in C.R.P.3672 of 2022 and C.R.P. No. 3800 of 2022 would contend that when the suit itself is not maintainable, as not arising under the commercial courts act, the question of permitting the plaintiff to amend the plaint, after filing of the petition under Order 7 Rule 11 (a) and (d) of CPC would not arise and the learned District Judge ought to have dismissed the petition seeking amendment of plaint.\n5. The learned senior counsel for the petitioner in C.R.P.No. 2123 of 2023 submitted that the suit in C.O.S.No.10 of 2023 is breft of the jurisdiction of the court for invoking the Commercial Courts Act 2015, when the act clearly specifies that pre-institutions mediation and settlement under Section 12(a) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, the suit ought not to have been taken on file for want of compliance under Section 12(a) of Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The learned senior counsel relied upon the following Judgments to support his contention. \na. Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2020) 7 Supreme Court Cases 366 [Dahiben Vs.

The learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent in C.R.P. Nos.3672 of 2022, 3800 of 2022 and 2123 of 2023 and petitioner in C.R.P. No.338 of 2023 would contend that the CRP filed by the petitioner / defendant in CRP Nos.3672, 3800 and 2123 of 2023 is not maintainable, as there is a specific bar in approaching this Court, as she ought to have filed only appeal as specified under Section 13 of Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The respondent counsel contended that the transaction between the respondent and the petitioner are the commercial transaction, which is clearly covered under Section 2(1)(c)(i) of Commercial Courts Act. That apart, the learned counsel also contended that the respondent is a licensed money lender and the petitioner borrowed money from the respondent for his business and family expenses by executing promissory notes agreeing to repay the debts with interest. Apart from the same, the learned senior counsel traversing through the plaint averments would state that the documents produced viz., the Promissory notes and communications between the plaintiff and the defendant would itself establish the commercial transaction between the plaintiff and the defendants. Further, the defendant continues to borrow money from the plaintiff for commercial purpose and the plaintiff periodically renewed his lending license will also https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 established the transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant is commercial in nature that would attract the jurisdiction under Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and hence the suit filed invoking the commercial courts act 2015 is maintainable. As far as the revision petition in CRP No.338 of 2023 is concerned, the learned senior counsel emphasized more upon Order 6 Rule 15(a)(4) of CPC, where the learned senior cousel submitted that the defendant was continuously aware that the statement of truth, ought to have been filed within 150 days from the date of service of summon and on an expiry of 120 days, the defendant forfeit the such right to file the written statement. The District Court allowed the I.A. No.6 of 2022, thereby accepted the statement of truth, which cannot be sustained as the same is beyond the competency of the court to accept such statement of truth when the statute prohibits such receival after 120 days. Hence, revision petition filed in CRP No. 338 of 2023 has to be allowed and order passed in I.A. No.\n7. The learned Senior Counsel further submitted as against the argument made by the learned Senior Counsel, Mr.N. Jothi in CRP No. 2123 of 2022 that Section 12(a) of the Commercial Courts Act is only a procedural aspect, which is curable even pending suits. Section 12(a) of the Commercial Courts Act is only a conciliated procedure which can even be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 undertaken for pending suit referring the parties of the suit for mediation as contemplated under section 12(a) of the Commercial Courts Act. Hence, the suit filed by Niranjani in COS No. 10 of 2023 before the District Judge Commercial Court, Salem cannot be rejected that has to be sustained and proceeded for further trial. The learned senior counsel sought dismissal of C.R.P.No. 2123 of 2023.\n8. Further, the learned counsel for the petitioner in CRP No.3672 of 2022 in support of her contention has relied upon the Judgment of the Delhi High Court reported in 2022 SCC Online Del 3636 [IHHR Hospitality (Andhra) Pvt., Ltd., Vs. Seems Swami and Others] at paragraph nos.10 to 12, wherein it is held as follows:-\n10. In the case of Lady Moon Towers Pvt. Ltd. vs. Mahindra Investment Advisors Pvt. Ltd. MANU/WB/0547/2021 it was observed by the High Court of Calcutta that the definition contemplates a commercial dispute and not any other form of dispute where the basis of disagreement between the parties has a non-commercial cause. The gradation of disputes in Section 2(i)(c) takes into account all possible forms of Agreements from which a commercial dispute may arise; it makes it clear that the framers of the statute gave emphasis on the commercial flavour of the transaction as opposed to agreements entered into between the parties without a commercial purpose. The commercial purpose would generally mean a transaction by which a person's commercial or economic interest may be advanced and would result in an economic benefit to that person. It would not include an agreement where profit making is an incidental outcome of the transaction or may happen by accident. Home Loan for example is given by a person or entity to another with the expected outcome of principle sum being returned with interest. The essential commercial flavour in such a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisloan may be lost by way of informal terms under which the money is C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 lent and advanced and the Digitally Signed By:PRIYANKA ANEJA Signing Date:04.11.2022 13:23:37 2022/DHC/004647 consequent uncertainty which may result therefrom. It was further observed that in terms of Section 2(i)(c) ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents implies ordinary transactions between the named persons and the \"mercantile documents\" indicates that all transactions between the specified classes of persons will not result in a commercial dispute where the transaction does not relate to mercantile documents. Only those disputes arising out of a transaction between the named classes of persons which has been formalised by way of a mercantile document would be termed as a commercial dispute. In the said suit, a loan of Rs. 50 lakhs had been given by the plaintiff Company to the defendant since the Directors of the Plaintiff Company were known to the defendant since long. It was held that simplicitor because a loan transaction was involved would not attract a commercial flavour to it and was held to be not a commercial dispute. \n11. This Court in Kailash Devi Khanna vs. DD Global Capital Ltd. 2019 SCC OnLine Del 9954 held that all suits for recovery of monies cannot brought under Section 2(1)(c)(i) of the Act where the suit is not based on any transaction relating to mercantile documents. The Bombay High Court in Bharat Huddanna Shetty vs. Ahuja Properties & Developers (Interim Application (L) No.14350 of 2021; decided on 13 th July, 2021) rejected the contention that the suit should be treated as a commercial summary suit on the mandate that the transaction had occurred between merchants, bankers, financiers and traders and further clarified that transactions between individuals where the plaintiff gives a friendly loan to a needy friend will not be seen as a transaction in the course of ordinary business. The Madras High Court in R. Kumar vs. T.A.S Jawahar Ayya MANU/TN/4159/2020 was Digitally Signed By:PRIYANKA ANEJA Signing Date:04.11.2022 13:23:37 2022/DHC/004647 of the view that since the plaintiffs did not transact in the capacity of financiers, the dispute was not a \"commercial dispute\" and that an ordinary transaction of the four classes of persons mentioned in 2(1)(c)(i) arising out of mercantile documents alone would fall within the definition of a commercial dispute. The Calcutta High Court in Associated Power Co. Ltd. Vs. Ram Taran Roy AIR 1970 Cal 75 focused its gaze on a \"mercantile document\" within the meaning of the First Schedule of the City civil Court Act, 1953 as a document between merchants and traders where the construction, interpretation and meanings of words and clauses of the mercantile documents would assume significance. \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 12 . It should also be pointed out that the words used in sub- clause (i) of clause(c) are \"ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents.....\". The placement of the underlined words between ordinary transactions of the named persons and the mercantile documents indicates that all transactions between the specified classes of persons will not result in a \"commercial dispute\" where the transaction does not relate to mercantile documents. Hence, only a dispute arising out of a transaction between the named classes of persons which has been formalised by way of a mercantile document will be a \"commercial dispute\" under Section 2(1)(c)(i) of the 2015 Act. \n9. That apart, the learned counsel for the petitioner in CRP No.3672 of 2022 in support of her contention has relied upon the Judgment of the High Court of Calcutta reported in 2022 SCC Online Cal 3010 [Venkatesh Vincom Pvt., Ltd., Vs. Spice of Joy, Multicuisine Restaurant cum Bar and Others] 7. Reverting to the core issue the eventuality enshrined in Clause (i) of Section 2(1)(c) of the said Act postulates that a dispute arising out of the ordinary transaction of financer relating to mercantile documents including its enforceability and interpretation are the important factors to be borne in mind. The said Clause can be segregated into 3 parts. Firstly, the dispute must arise out of ordinary transaction of financer and secondly, such ordinary transaction must relate to a mercantile document and thirdly, the enforceability and the interpretation of such document is involved. Admittedly, the appellant is a non banking financial corporation which would be evident from the averments made in the plaint and the certificate of incorporation annexed thereto. The primary function of the non banking corporation is to extend financial supports and can be regarded as an FMAT 20 OF 2022 Page-8 ordinary https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judistransaction of the financer. We find no ambiguity in this regard that C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 lending money by the appellant is fundamentally the transactions which it does and can be regarded as the ordinary transaction. The parties are not ad idem on the expression \"mercantile document\"\nappearing in the said clause for the reason that there was no agreement in writing nor any document evincing the money given as loan to the respondents. The mercantile document is not defined in the said Act. However, the said Act defines 'document' in Section 2(1)(f) to mean any matter expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures, or marks, or electronic means or, by more than one of those means, intended to be used, or which may be used, for the purpose of recording that manner. The definition of a document is expansive and is not restricted to any agreement to be executed by and between the parties recording the transactions at the beginning thereof. The definition is wide enough to include any expression or a description of any substance by means of letters, marks or figures or electronic means which would be sufficient enough to bring clarity of the matter. The word 'mercantile' in ordinary parlance means a document relating to a merchant or trading or a document which is commercial in nature. In Black's Law Dictionary, 8th Edition 'mercantile' is defined as in \"BLD\"\n8. Since the word 'mercantile' includes the transaction which is of commercial nature the \"commercial paper\" is also defined in the Black's Law Dictionary as an instrument other than the cash for the payment of money and include negotiable instrument of a particular kind in the following:\nFMAT 20 OF 2022 Page-9 \"Commercial Paper: 1. An instrument, other than cash, for the payment of money. Commercial paper - typically existing in the form of a draft (such as a check) or a note (such as a certificate of deposit) - is governed by Article 3 of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 UCC. But even though the UCC uses the term commercial paper when referring to negotiable instruments of a particular kind (drafts, checks, certificates of deposit, and notes as defined by Article 3), the term long predates the UCC as a business and legal term in common use. Before the UCC, it was generally viewed as synonymous with negotiable paper or bills and notes. It was sometimes applied even to nonnegotiable instruments. - Also termed mercantile paper; company's paper. See NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT.\" \n\" 'Commercial paper' is rather a popular than a technical expression, often used, however, both in statutes and in decisions of courts, to designate those simple forms of contract long recognized in the world's commerce and governed by the law merchant.\" \n\"Defined most broadly, commercial paper refers to any writing embodying rights that are customarily conveyed by transferring the writing. A large subset of commercial paper consists of such writings that are negotiable, which means that the law enables a transferee to acquire the embodied rights free of claims and defences against the transferor.\" \nFMAT 20 OF 2022 Page-10 \"Sec. 2 (c) \"Commercial dispute\"\nmeans a dispute arising out of - (ii) Ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents, including enforcement and interpretation of such documents. \n9. The Stroud's Judicial Dictionary defines the commercial action to mean and include any cause arising out of ordinary transactions of merchants and traders and without prejudice to generosity of the following words: any cause relating to construction of a mercantile document, the export or import of mercantile, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 insurance, banking, mercantile agency and mercantile uses. It, thus, engulfed within itself any action or undertaking with an object to make a profit therefrom (see Punjab University vs. Unit Trust of India & Ors., (2015) 2 SCC 669). In Ladymoon Towers Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) the Single Bench of this Court has relied upon various judgments of the Delhi High Court, Bombay High Court and Madras High Court as well as the Calcutta High Court to ascertain the meaning of a mercantile document. It has been held therein that all suits of recovery of money may not come within the purview of Section 2(1)(c)(i) of the Act if not based on any transaction relating to mercantile document. The view of the Bombay High Court has also been noticed to the effect that the suit cannot be treated as a commercial suit unless the transaction has occurred between the merchants, traders, bankers and financers and, therefore, any transaction of two individuals in extending a friendly loan cannot be regarded as a commercial transaction or a transaction in an ordinary course of business. The view of the Madras High Court as relied on by the Single FMAT 20 OF 2022 Page-11 Bench in Ladymoon Towers Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) was that if the plaintiffs have not transacted in a capacity of a financer it cannot come within the purview of the aforesaid definition clause. So far as the Calcutta High Court view as noticed by the Single Bench in the above noted decision was based on the definition of a mercantile document appearing in the First schedule of City Civil Courts Act, 1953 to be a document between merchant and traders and the construction, interpretation and meaning of the words and clause of the mercantile document would assume a greater significance. Though the aforesaid judgments were noticed by the Single Bench in the above referred cases but ultimately it was held that the suit for recovery of money lend and advanced as friendly loan does not satisfy the definition of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 a commercial dispute. It is no doubt true that every nature of the monetary transaction cannot come within the ambit of a commercial dispute defined in the said Act. Such monetary transaction in an ordinary course of business transacted by the merchants, bankers, financers and traders based upon a mercantile documents are regarded as a commercial transactions and a suit before the Commercial Court is maintainable. Taking a clue from the definition of a 'merchant', what was a conservative view at one point of time have seen a radical change with the varied varieties of transaction which can be manifestly seen from the expansive definition of a commercial dispute under Section 2(1)(c) of the said Act. By advancement of technology the mode and the nature of transactions have also been changed and what was earlier known as a negotiable instrument in a primitive stage has been gradually taken out of practice and the mode of the transaction has been well accepted in electronic form. The interpretative tool FMAT 20 OF 2022 Page-12 is an evolving process and changes with the behavioural pattern of the society more particularly in commercial transactions and, therefore, any rudimentary form of the interpretation may not be compatible with the changing pattern of the commercial transactions. \n12. It leads to another question whether the loan extended to one of the partners for and on behalf of the firm can be regarded as a transaction with the firm. The answer can be traced from the provisions contained in Chapter IV of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. Section 18 of the said Act postulates that the partner is an agent of a firm for the purpose of business of the firm. Section 19 contemplates the implied authority of the partner as an agent of the firm and Section 22 thereof binds the firm for any act of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisinstrument done or executed by the partner or other persons on C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 behalf of the farm to be regarded as done or executed by the firm. Undisputedly, the cheque was issued by the appellant to the Respondent no. 2 and the receipt or a note evincing such transaction, was issued by the Respondent no. 1 firm. It is not a case where the Respondent no. 2 utilised the money for his individual purposes but in fact the money given by the appellant was used and utilised by the Respondent no. 1 firm and the TDS certificate also corroborate the same. Even the interest is paid by the Respondent no. 1 firm and, therefore, even if the cheque covering the loan amount was issued in the name of one of the partners but shall be regarded as a payment to the firm. As indicated above, there is no condition laid down in the said definition 'commercial dispute' that the mercantile document must be executed at the beginning or before the transaction having affected rather the document defined in Section 2(1)(f) of the Act includes any matter expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures or marks or electronic means intended to be used or which may be used for the purpose of recording the FMAT 20 OF 2022 Page-16 matter. We, therefore, find no difficulty in considering that the mercantile document as an instrument by any other means coming within the ambit of the definition of a document executed by a merchant in an ordinary course of business and any restrictive interpretation would frustrate the legislative intent and the object and purpose underlying the promulgation of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. We, therefore, have no hesitation to hold that the dispute involved in the instant pattern satisfies the definition of a commercial dispute and the order of the Commercial Court cannot be sustained. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 10. Heard the learned senior counsels and learned counsels for the C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 appropriate parties and perused the records carefully.\n11. Though the parties to the C.R.P. Nos. 3672 of 2022, 3800 of 2022 and 338 of 2023 are Madanraj, Hindu Undivided Family, as plaintiff and Radha alias Ramalingam, as defendants arising out of C.O.S. No. 9 of 2022 are taken up along with CRP No. 2123 of 2023, arising out of T.Niranjani as plaintiff and R. Radha as defendant in C.O.S. No.10 of 2023 on the file of District Judge, Commercial Court Salem and the parties are described to their respective rank as placed in the suits.\n12. On the perusal of the records it is seen that the plaintiff, viz., Madanraj seems to have filed C.O.S.No.118 of 2021, which was subsequently renumbered as C.O.S.No.9 of 2022 on the file of Commercial District Court, Salem. The plaintiff had approached the District Court invoking jurisdiction under Commercial Act, 2015, claiming for a decree in favour of the plaintiff directing the defendant to pay Rs.2,86,67,748/- with accrued interest on Rs.2,34,00,000/- at Rs.1/- per 100 per month from the date of suit till the date of realisation of amount that on the ground that the defendant one Radha Ramalingam bororrwed money from the plaintiff on various dates starting from 21.11.2013 by way of cash or by way of bank account of transfer.\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 13. The plaintiff has further averred that the defendant was liable to pay Rs.2,09,72,300/- to the plaintiff towards principal and interest on 07.12.2019. However, after negotiation with the defendant, the plaintiff and defendant had arrived an amount of Rs.2,05,00,000/- and thereby waiving a sum of Rs.4,72,300/- to satisfy the above amount claimed, which is a debt to be paid by the defendant, he had executed a promissory note dated 07.12.2019 for the above said sum of Rs.2,05,00,000/- apart from he has issued various cheques dating from 08.05.2021 to 26.07.2021. When the cheque was presented for clearing, the defendant had failed to honour the cheque, either it was for want of sufficient funds or returned with an endorsement of 'Exceeds insufficient'. The cheques were returned and the same is evident from the series of exchange of notices between the plaintiff and the defendant and when the amount were not been received by the plaintiff, the plaintiff had initiated criminal proceedings under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. \n14. It is further seen from the records available that the defendant had invoked order 7 Rule 11(a) and (d) of CPC seeking the court's intervention to reject the plaint in C.O.S. No.118 of 2021 by way of I.A.No.2 of 2022, which was filed on 07.02.2022, for the said I.A., a counter was also filed by the plaintiff as early as 11.02.2022. Pending the said I.A., the defendant https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 has also filed a written statement on 01.06.2022. The said I.A.No.2 of 2022 came to be decided by the Learned District Judge, Commercial District Court, Salem on hearing the arguments on both the sides, finally an one line order and decreetal order came to be passed on 28.07.2022 and the said order reads as follows:-\nOrders pronounced in open court. In the result, the petition is hereby dismissed with costs and the decreetal order which reads as follows:\n(1)That the petition be and the same is hereby dismissed. (2)that the petitioner do pay a sum of Rs.1,000/- to the respondents to the cost of the petition. \nIt is seen from the records that the defendant have raised several grounds in the affidavit in support of the petition filed under Order 7 Rule 11(a) and (d) of CPC, which was primarily on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, maintainability of the suit under the Commercial Courts Act, 2019 and not following the mandatory provisions under Commecial Courts Act, 2015. When the defendant has raised several grounds apart from the said grounds, none of them were discussed by the learned Single Judge while dismissing I.A.No.2 of 2022. \n15. The Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as the High Court in various States have consistently held that proper reasons have to be given when the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 lower judiciary is disposing of any applications and no creptic order can be passed, especially one line order dismissing the application, which exhibits clear non application of mind by the said district judge. When the defendant has raised a maintainability and it is the duty of the District Judge to answer the reasons for his dismissal and even though the lower court need not answer all the grounds in favour or against any party when a question is raised in the suit that too when application was filed under Order 7 Rule 11, it becomes the mandatory duty of the District court to discuss the application or non application of order 7 Rule 11 CPC, when it has been raised by the parties concerned. For this reason alone, the order impugned in C.R.P. No.3672 of 2022 has to be set aside and when cryptic order is passed in I.A.No.2 of 2022 in COS No.9 of 2022 is unbecoming of the learned District Judg, the District Court has to rectify. Accordingly, CRP No.3672 of 2022 is allowed and order passed in I.A.No.2 of 2022 dated 28.07.2022 is set aside. \n16. As far as CRP No.3800 of 2022 is concerned, the plaintiff had filed I.A.No.4 of 2022 seeking amendment of plaint under Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC on 06.08.2022 after dismissal of I.A.No.2 of 2022. The amendment petition and the affidavit filed in support to the petition and the details of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 amendment clearly shows that those grounds which were raised for non- maintainability of the suit in the written statement filed by the defendant, the plaintiff has come forward to rectify the mistakes by amending his plaint and the details sought for amendment are extracted hereunder:-\n 1. Add the following in between the words, 'years' and 'Hindu' in the 2nd line in the plaintiff long cause title in the Page No.1 of the plaint, consisting of the Kartha Madhan Raj and its members B.Niranjani aged 43 years the wife of the Kartha and Amitha aged 19 years the daughter of the Kartha,\n2. Add the following in between the words, 'years' and 'the' in the 2nd line in Para No.3 in the Page No.1 of the plaint, The plaintiff is a licensed money lender 3. Add the following in between the words 'plaintiff' and 'Karur' in the 3rd line in Para No.7 in the Page No.2 of the plaint, at the plaintiff's residence at Salem,\n4. Add the following at the end of Para No.11 in the Page No.3 of the plaint, as agreed by the defendant in the Promissory notes, from 07.12.2019 to 16.12.2021 for the 1st promissory note and from 18.02.2021 to 16.12.2021 for the 2nd promissory note which comes totally Rs.52,67,748/- and further accrued interest at the rate of Rs.0.033 per hundred per day after 16.12.2021.\n5. Add the following in between the words, 'plaintiff' and 'to' in the 7th line in para no.15 in the Page No.4 of the plaint, at their residence at Salem. The said petition seeking for the amendment was resisted by the defendant https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, limitation, non joinder of parties and no cause of action arisen for commercial dispute to invoke the jurisdiction of commercial courts act and for want of proper documents, being filed in support of the plaint averments, the said I.A.No.4 of 2022 was also heard and allowed by the Learned District Judge, Commercial Court, Salem by an order dated 03.09.2022 and the relevant portion is extracted hereunder:- \n12. When considering the transaction involved, this is an ordinary transaction of a money lender, who is a financier referred under Section 2(1)(c)(i) of Commercial Courts Act and prima facie this Court is vested with jurisdiction to try this suit. A promissory note is a Negotiable instrument and when filed in a Commercial Transaction, it becomes a mercantile document also, between the merchants and traders. Therefore, the contentions raised by the respondent / defendant that these amendments introduce a new cause of action, that it alters the nature of the suit cannot sustain and question of estoppel cannot be gone into in this stage which has no relevance at all and the defendant does not lose any of his advantage, if any which accrued to him earlier because of this amendment. Though the amendment is allowed, the defence if any which is available to the respondent / defendant is not washed away and he has all the opportunity to raise these aspects in his defence during trial. Hence this petition is hereby allowed and there is no order as to cost. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 17 . On a careful perusal of the above said order, it is seen that the C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 defendant was given an opportunity to raise her defence during the trial. The learned Judge while considering the amendment petition has confined only with regard to the amendment petition, which is the only way to decide the amendment petition as the predecessor has already decided and rejected the petition under order 7 Rule 11 (a) and (b) of CPC. Though the reasons are not acceptable and not in consonance with the Commercial Courts Act, especially under Section 2(1)c(i), this Court is not inclined to interefere with the order for the reason that the defendant has always opportunity to raise his defense during trial. The incumbent learned Judge has taken note of dismissal of I.A.No.2 of 2022 and passed orders in I.A.No.4 of 2022. \n18 . Now, when we consider the facts under which C.R.P. No.338 of 2023 is filed, it is seen that the said Revision is, as against order in I.A.No.6 of 2022, which was filed under Order 6 Rule 15-A and under Section 151 of CPC, seeking to accept statements of truth and the learned District Judge, Commercial Court, Salem by an order and decreetal order dated 20.10.2022 has allowed the petition. It is well settled that the statute prescribed under Order 6 Rule 15-A for filing statement of truth, that ought to have been filed within 120 days from the date of service of summons, i.e., the time limit is 120 days, however, it is seen that the defendant has filed the application to receive the statement of truth on 20.10.2022 with the delay https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 of 249 days. The trial court has allowed the I.A.No.6 of 2022, as the delay is not very huge for the courts not to condone the same and this Court finds no infirmity in the order and decreetal order of the District Judge, especially, when the parties have brought before the Court within the condonable time frame with appropriate reasons stated, the courts have always power to condone the same, hence this Court is not inclined to interefere with the order passed in I.A.No. 6 of 2022 as there is no infirmity. Accordingly, C.R.P. No.338 of 2023 is dismissed. \n19. As far as C.R.P. No.2123 of 2023 is conconcerned, the same has been filed to strike off the plaint in C.O.S. No. 10 of 2023 filed by Niranjani, who is none other than wife of Madanraj, who is the plaintiff in d C.O.S. No.9 of 2022. Though C.O.S.Nos.9 of 2022 and 10 of 2023 are two different suits filed by Husband and wife against the common defendant, the present Revision is also taken along with the three CRPs by all the respective counsels. The C.O.S. No.10 of 2023 is filed by Niranjani, plaintiff therein, invoking Section 2(1)(c) of Commercial Courts Act, 2015, seeking for a decree against the defendants therein to pay her a sum of Rs.2,84,85,962/- along with the accured interest on Rs.2,16,00,000/- at Rs.1/- per hundred per month from the date of suit till the date of realisation of the amount. The plaintiff, viz., Niranjani has claimed that the defendants https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 were borrowing money on various dates from 24.03.2011 to 18.02.2021 and the defendants borrowed additional loan also and to repay the debts, the defendants issued cheques and on various dates, which on presentation on bank returned as insufficient funds. The plaintiff claims that she is a business woman, financier and an licensed money lender authorised to lend money for interest. When the money was not paid back, she initiated the proceedings under 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, before the learned Judicial Magistrate Court, Salem. When the suit summons were served, the defendants have approached this Court by the present Revision on the ground that Section 12 (a) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, which has pre-requisite and mandatory provision for mediation, without which the suit ought not to have been entertained. \n20. In the recent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2022) 10 Supreme Court Cases 11, [Patil Automation Pvt., Ltd., & others Vs. Rakheja Engineers Pvt., Ltd.,], the Hon'ble Apex Court had an occasion to reset 12(A) of Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and the relevant portions are extracted hereunder:-\n24. He would submit that having regard to the purport of Section 12A, the interest of justice would be subserved if the procedure which is adopted by the Court in his case is accepted. In other words, if the Court after the institution of the suit immediately refers the parties to the mediation, the appellants may not be justified in insisting on pre institution https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judismediation. In this regard, he would emphasisethat pre litigation mediation C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 contemplated in Section 12A does not pertain to inherent jurisdiction of a Court. While mediation is to be encouraged, the Court may not lose sight of the fact that a half-way house between the two extremes has been attempted by the Court in the case, which suffices, having regard to the fact also that no penal consequences are provided and no right of the defendant is imperilled. \n25. He next draws our attention to the aspect of court fees. \nHe would submit that the plaintiff is bound to pay the whole court fee under the law in question. When the plaint gets rejected under Order VII Rule 11, the plaintiff suffers a loss of the entire court fee. This is one of the consequences which this Court should not lose sight of, it is contended. Here again, the procedure which has been adopted in the case is commended for our acceptance as substantial compliance with Section 12A which at the same time, will not reach such disastrous consequences for the litigants. He also touches upon the possible consequence of a plea of limitation overwhelming a fresh suit of the plaintiff after rejection of the first suit. \n26. Section 12A of the Act reads as follows:\n12A. Pre-Institution Mediation and Settlement (1) A suit, which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief under this Act, shall not be instituted unless the plaintiff exhausts the remedy of pre- institution mediation in accordance with such manner and procedure as may be prescribed by rules made by the Central Government.\n(2) The Central Government may, by notification, authorise the Authorities constituted under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 (39 of 1987), for the purposes of pre-institution mediation.\n(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 (39 of 1987), the Authority authorised by the Central Government under sub-section (2) shall complete the process of mediation within a period of three months from the date of application made by the plaintiff under sub-section (1):\nProvided that the period of mediation may be extended for a further period of two months with the consent of the parties:\nProvided further that, the period during which the parties remained occupied with the pre-institution mediation, such period shall not be computed for the purpose of limitation under the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963).\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 (4) If the parties to the commercial dispute arrive at a settlement, the same shall be educed into writing and shall be signed by the parties to the dispute and the mediator. (5) The settlement arrived at under this section shall have the same status and effect as if it is an arbitral award on agreed terms under sub- section (4) of section 30 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996). \n27. The Act was enacted in the year 2015. At the time, the monetary limit for a suit liable to be tried by the Commercial Court was fixed at Rs.1 crore. \n51. Lastly, we may notice that in Prem Lala Nahata v. Chandi Prasad Sikaria16, Justice P.K. Balasubramanyan, speaking on behalf of Justice S.B. Sinha, also held as follows:\n16. Order 7 Rule 11(d) speaks of the suit being barred by any law. According to Black's Law Dictionary, bar means, a plea arresting a law suit or legal claim. It means as a verb, to prevent by legal objection. According to Ramanatha Aiyar's Law Lexicon, bar is that which obstructs entry or egress; to exclude from consideration. It is therefore necessary to see whether a suit bad for misjoinder of parties or of causes of action is excluded from consideration or is barred entry for adjudication. As pointed out already, on the scheme of the Code, there is no such prohibition or a prevention at the entry of a suit defective for misjoinder of parties or of causes of action. The court is still competent to try and decide the suit, though the court may also be competent to tell the plaintiffs either to elect to proceed at the instance of one of the plaintiffs or to proceed with one of the causes of action. \nOn the scheme of the Code of Civil Procedure, it cannot therefore be held that a suit barred for misjoinder of parties or of causes of action is barred by a law, here the Code. This may be contrasted with the failure to comply with Section 80 of the 16 (2007) 2 SCC 551 Code. In a case not covered by sub-section (2) of Section 80, it is provided in sub- section (1) of Section 80 that no suit shall be instituted. This is therefore a bar to the institution of the suit and that is why courts have taken the view that in a case where notice under Section 80 of the Code is mandatory, if the averments in the plaint indicate the absence of a notice, the plaint is liable to be rejected. \nFor, in that case, the entertaining of the suit would be barred by Section 80 of the Code. The same would be the position when a suit hit by Section 86 of the Code is filed without pleading the obtaining of consent of the Central Government if the suit is not for rent from a tenant.. (Emphasis supplied) VIEWS OF HIGH COURTS:\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judisDISCORDANT NOTES?\nC.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 52. In Ganga Taro Vazirani v. Deepak Raheja17, the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Bombay, took the view that Section 12A is a procedural provision. The learned Single Judge found further that when urgent relief is applied for, the procedure under Section 12A need not be undergone. It was further observed that it was not, as if, the Court lacks inherent jurisdiction to entertain a Suit without complying with Section 12A. Still further, he refers to Section 80 of the CPC. He refers to AL. AR. 17 2021 SCC Online Bombay 195 Vellayan Chettiar (Decd.) & Others v. Government of the Province of Madras Through the Collector of Ramnad at Madura & Another18, for the proposition that Notice thereunder is given for the protection of the Authority concerned and he can lawfully waive his right to the Notice. Reliance was also placed on the Judgement in State of A.P. and others v. Pioneer Builders, A.P.19, wherein this Court declined to interfere with the finding that having participated in the proceeding without raising objection about the maintainability of the Suit, there would be waiver. Learned Single Judge also took the view that even under Section 12A of the Act, in a given set of facts, the defendant could be held to have waived his right to set up Section 12A. It is further found that, if there is substantial compliance, the plaintiff cannot be non-suited, i.e., if an attempt has been made for settling the dispute, which has failed and, therefore, the plaintiff is constrained to approach the Court. It is this Judgment, which has been relied upon in both the impugned Judgments. \n53. However, as pointed out by Shri Sharath Chandran, a Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay, in an appeal, has found that the Single Judge, has erred in his view that Section 12A is not mandatory. The Division Bench proclaimed that Section 12A of the Act is mandatory. It was further observed that considering the object and purpose of Section 12A, being rooted in public interest, there is no question of it being waived. When it came to the Order to be passed in the appeal, we notice that the plaintiff contended that the suit was allowed to be filed by the Registry because of a confusion in the Registry in the initial period, when the Amending Act came into force. There was oversight. The Division Bench stayed the Suit and the impugned Order for three months and referred the parties for mediation. \n61.Section 35 of the CPC in the Schedule, inter alia, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judiscontemplates that in making an Order for payment of costs, the C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 Court shall have regard to the conduct of the parties and whether any reasonable offer to settle, is made by a party and unreasonably refused by the other party. Sections 35(3) and 35(4) read as follows:\n35(3) In making an order for the payment of costs, the Court shall have regard to the following circumstances, including (a) the conduct of the parties;\n(b) whether a party has succeeded on part of its case, even if that party has not been wholly successful;\n(c) whether the party had made a frivolous counterclaim leading to delay in the disposal of the case;\n(d) whether any reasonable offer to settle is made by a party and unreasonably refused by the other party; and (e) whether the party had made a frivolous claim and instituted a vexatious proceeding wasting the time of the Court. 35(4) The orders which the Court may make under this provision include an order that a party must pay- (a) a proportion of another partys costs;\n(b) a stated amount in respect of another partys costs;\n(c) costs from or until a certain date;\n(d) costs incurred before proceedings have begun;\n(e) costs relating to particular steps taken in the proceedings;\n(f) costs relating to a distinct part of the proceedings; and (g) interest on costs from or until a certain date. [Emphasis supplied] \n66. We have noticed that a settlement arrived at in pre- litigation mediation under Section 12A, is to be treated as an award under Section 30(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. Section 30(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, reads as follows:\n30(4) An arbitral award on agreed terms shall have the same status and effect as any other arbitral award on the substance of the dispute.\n67. A mediation settlement arrived at under Section 89 of the CPC must be scrutinised by the court and only on its imprimatur being given it is effective [see paragraph 40 of Afcons Infrastructure https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 Limited and Another v. Cherian Varkey Construction Company Private Limited and Others25]. Since a settlement under Section 12A of the Act is accorded the status of an award under the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, it unerringly points to the object of the legislature to make pre-litigation mediation compulsory. We again underscore the vital role, the lawyers engaged can and must discharge in arriving at a just and valid settlement translating into an effective award and therefore, a decree. \n68. Rule 7 deals with the procedure to be adopted by the Mediator. Rule 9 enshrines the principle of confidentiality of mediation. The Mediator, the parties, their authorised representatives or Counsel are to maintain confidentiality about the mediation. Rule 9 further declares that the Mediator is not to allow stenographic or audio or video 25 (2010) 8 SCC 24 recording of the mediation sittings. \n84. One of the arguments of Shri Saket Sikri is that, if a plaint is rejected under Order VII Rule 11, the plaintiff would be saddled with the deprivation of the court fee paid. He would contend that this aspect may be considered, when the Court decides the question as to whether the provision is mandatory or not. Whenever a plaint is rejected on the ground that the suit is barred under any law, this consequence is inevitable. [We may only, in this context, observe, that under Section 4A of the Kerala Court Fee and Suit Valuation Act, 1959, the plaintiff needs to pay only one-tenth of the total court fee at the time of institution of the suit. The balance is to be paid not later than fifteen days from the date of framing of issues, inter alia. Section 4A further provides that if the parties further settle the dispute within the period specified or extended by the Court for payment of the balance court fee, the plaintiff shall not be called upon to pay the balance court fee.] If a plaint is rejected for failure to give a notice, as contemplated in Section 80 of the CPC, the court fee paid, may be lost. Equally, for violation of Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, if the plaint is rejected, the plaintiff loses the court fee. While it may appear to be hard on the plaintiff, the effect of the provision contained in Order VII Rule 11, cannot be diluted. \nTherefore, we are not impressed by the argument, subject to what we will hold later on and the Hon'ble Supreme Court while discussing in the said Judgment has also considered various other judgments in the same line of arguments and finally in Paragraph no.84, extracted supra, has decided and declared that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 Section 12A of the Act is mandatory and further any suit instituted violating the mandatory provision of Section 12A must be revisited with the rejection of plaint under Order 7 Rule 11. In fact, the Hon'ble Apex Court has also held that the power to reject can be exercised even suo motu by the courts, applying the said judgment to the present case on hand, this Court finds that the defendant having invoked Order 7 Rule 11 (a) and (d) of CPC in I.A.No.2 of 2022 in C.O.S.No.9 of 2022 and having invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court 's intervention under Article 227 of Constitution of India and superintending power as against COS No.10 of 2023 in both the suits, there are no records to find that the parties have exhausted Rule 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as mandated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above said judgments, which mandates that C.O.S. No.9 of 2022 and 10 of 2023 on the file of Commercial Courts, District Judge, Salem, have failed. \nIn the nutshell, the CRPs are decided in the following manner:\n(i) C.R.P.No.3672 of 2022, which is filed against the one line docket Order passed in I.A.No.2 of 2022 [filed to reject the plaint in COS No.9 of 2022 on various grounds including the ground of mainatainability] dated 28.07.2022 is set aside and the said CRP is Allowed.\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.3672, 3800 of 2022, 338 and 2123 of 2023 & C.M.P.Nos.19457, 20005 of 2022, 12931 of 2023 (ii) Since the above said CRP No.3672 of 2022 is allowed, I.A.No.4 of 2022, seeking amendment of plaint in COS No.9 of 2022, which was allowed by order dated 03.09.2022 is hereby setaside, thereby the CRP No.3800 of 2022 is allowed. \n(iii) C.R.P.No.338 of 2023, which is filed against the Docket Order dated 20.10.2022 in I.A.No.6 of 2022 [filed to accept the statement of truth] cannot be interefered with and the said CRP is dismissed. \n(iii) C.R.P.No.2123 of 2023, which is filed to strike off the plaint in COS No.10 of 2023 on the file of learned District Judge, Commercial Court, Salem is hereby allowed and the plaint in COS No.10 of 2023 is hereby rejected for want of compliance of Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n(iv) It is left open to the parties to work out their remedies available under the Act, as held and directed by the Hon'ble Apex Court.

(original respondent no.4), which directly or indirectly hold 100% of the paid-up capital of sipl. 16. the appellants dispute the aforesaid claims. according to the appellants, the osa is not independent of the other agreements and the documents executed between some of the skypower entities and swpl. 17. it is stated that the concerned state instrumentalities of madhya pradesh had invited bids for setting up of solar power plants. some of the skypower entities had participated in the bids and were successful. accordingly, they were permitted to set up 57.5mwp (50.0 mw ac) photovoltaic solar plant with tracker technologies at chirwel, madhya pradesh. the mp power management company limited (hereafter 'state discom') and sipl along with two other affiliated companies entered into a power purchase agreement dated 18.09.2015. 18. the project included units and auxiliaries such as water supply, treatment or storage facilities, bays for transmission system in the switchyard, dedicated transmission line up to the delivery point, buildings, structures, equipment, plant and machinery and other facilities for generation and supply of power in terms of the power purchase agreement. sipl claims that at the material time, swpl and s&w represented to the concerned skypower entities that they had the experience, expertise, capability and know-how for implementing the project. 19. the appellants claim that the concerned skypower entities entered into a memorandum of understanding (mou) and heads of terms (hot) dated 18.04.2016 with swpl and an amended hot dated 19.12.2016 in respect of the design, supply, construction, development and commissioning of the project. in terms of the amended hot, it was agreed that the offshore supplies for the project would be undertaken by an offshore affiliate of swpl. according to the appellants, it was agreed that separate contracts would be entered into for the offshore supplies and other supplies but swpl would undertake the entire responsibility for the same. the appellants contend that it was always understood that works in relation to the project would be undertaken by swpl and s&w as a single point entity. it claims that reading of all the agreements indicates that the project was awarded to the sterling and wilson group (swpl and s&w) on a turn key basis. the amended hot also stipulate the same. the appellants claim that on 19.05.2017, the several contractual documents including the osa were entered into for executing the project. these also included six contractual documents between sipl and swpl (development agreement, service contract, civil works contract, onshore supply agreement, operation and management agreement, wrap agreement). the osa was signed only by sipl and s&w. although, other entities were not signatories to the offshore supply agreements, s&w had executed a side letter on liquidated damages, indemnity and composite costs, which were linked to other contractual documents. 20. according to the appellants, although separate documents were executed for onshore contracts and offshore supplies, it was always understood and agreed between the parties that these separate contractual agreements were a part of a single consolidated contract, which would be executed by swpl and its affiliate entities. 21. the appellants claim that swpl and its affiliates had breached the terms of the agreements. although the appellants do not deny receipt of the offshore supplies, they dispute their obligation to pay for the same on account of claims in respect of performance of other agreements, which were allegedly breached. 22. since the invoices submitted by s&w had not been paid, s&w sent a letter dated 21.05.2018 to sipl communicating that it had invoked the dispute resolution mechanism under clause 23.1.2 of the osa. 23. sipl responded by a letter dated 19.06.2018 declining to make the payment on the ground that swpl had not complied with its material obligations under the onshore epc (engineering, procurement and construction) contracts including the wrap agreement. it claimed that as per the side letter on liquidated damages executed by s&w, it was not liable to pay the invoiced amount as claimed. 24. thereafter, discussions were held, inter alia, between sipl and s&w. however, the disputes remained unresolved. on 28.07.2018, s&w sent an e-mail to sipl accepting the addition of a dispute resolution provision, that is, arbitration according to the singapore international arbitration centre rules (hereafter 'the siac rules') to be included in the osa. 25. subsequently, on 18.09.2018, sipl sent an e-mail to s&w claiming that it had scheduled diligence activities for the project. s&w replied on 24.08.2018 stating that no sale will be permitted by it till it is paid its legitimate dues. 26. on 03.10.2018 sipl responded to s&w's e-mails, requesting for details pertaining to the indemnity claims in respect of the project and the osa. further, on 2.11.2018, s&w sent a letter to sipl refuting the objections put forth by it in its letter dated 27.07.2018. it is s&w's case that the provisions of the indemnity letter are in respect of the payment of taxes and the letter is not relevant to the obligation to pay the offshore supply price. 27. it is submitted that on 10.11.2018, a representative of a potential buyer of sipl's affiliate project addressed an e-mail to s&w. the said buyer, inter alia, sought details of s&w's outstanding claims against sipl stating that the same were sought for undertaking due diligence of the said project. 28. s&w claims that after the lapse of 12 months from receiving the invoices, on 5.12.2018, sipl asked s&w to rescind and withdraw the same on the ground that the invoices were not in accordance with the provisions of the osa and the onshore epc contracts on account of alleged deficiencies in the project. 29. on 12.12.2018, s&w refuted the claims raised by sipl in its letter dated 05.12.2018, and reiterated its claim for payment of 90% of the offshore supply price. 30. in view of the aforesaid dispute, s&w commenced arbitration against original respondent nos.1 to 8 on 16.03.2019, to be conducted by siac. 31. thereafter, s&w filed a petition under section 9 of the a&c act being omp (1) comm. 461/2018 titled sterling & wilson international fze v. skypower solar india private limited and others, (arraying the appellants in the present appeals as respondent nos.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) and seeking an interim injunction in order to secure its claim, while the arbitral proceedings were pending. 32. by an order dated 18.12.2018, a learned single judge of this court granted temporary injunction to s&w against the appellants (original respondent nos.1 to 6) in terms of prayer (c) of the said petition. in terms of the said prayer the appellants and its directors, officers, servants, agents were restrained from creating third party rights and/or otherwise encumbering the project. the appellants, skypower canada and cim, were also directed to disclose the extent of shareholdings of each of their companies. the order was subsequently modified on 11.01.2019 to read as under: \"i.a. no. 303/2018 (for modification of the order dated 18.12.2018) 1. this application is allowed and the expression 'respondent no. 1' written in the third line of paragraph 3 of the order dated 18.12.2018 will be read as 'respondent no.4'. 2. also, the figure of 'usd 31,250,711.70' written in paragraph 1 of the order be read as 'usd 34,723,013', without in any manner observing the merits of the cases of the respective parties. 3. i.a. stands disposed of.\" 33. thereafter, by an order dated 21.01.2019, the learned single judge recorded that the entire shareholding of holdings 2 ltd. is held by sgc and directed that there will be no further transfer of the said shareholdings. 34. on 22.06.2020, the learned single judge passed the impugned judgment, partly allowing the prayer or for interim relief and directed the original respondents (appellants, skypower canada and cim) to furnish a bank guarantee for 50% of the claim against the offshore supply price. the learned single judge also restrained sgc, holdings 4 ltd. and iv investment ltd. from transferring, disposing off, creating a charge and/or encumbering, in any manner their shares and other securities held by them in sipl, sgc and holdings 4 ltd. 35. aggrieved, the appellants have filed the present appeals. reasoning and conclusion 36. at the outset it is necessary to note that the question whether the court has the jurisdiction to order interim measures for protection under section 9 of the a&c act in aid of the arbitral proceedings conducted overseas, was not agitated before this court. the appellants concede that the learned single judge has rightly held that this court has the jurisdiction to issue interim orders in aid of arbitration being conducted overseas under the aegis of the siac and according to its rules. 37. the memoranda of appeals mention several grounds, other than the impugned order falls foul of the principles under order xxxviii rule 5 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (hereafter 'the cpc'), for assailing the impugned order. but, as noted above, the same were not pressed. it is relevant to note that one of the questions raised before the learned single judge was whether the court could issue any orders of interim measures of protection, under section 9 of the a&c act against the appellants in fao(os)(comm) 30/2022, as they were not signatories to the arbitration agreement. the learned single judge referred to various principles including the group of companies doctrine as accepted by the supreme court in chloro controls india private limited v. severn trent water purification inc. & ors.1, mahanagar telephone nigam limited v. canara bank & ors.2 and ameet lalchand shah & ors. v. rishabh enterprises & anr.3 and expressed a prima facie view that in the given facts, even though the said appellants were not signatories to the arbitration agreement, they could be compelled to arbitrate. the said issue which was stoutly contested before the learned single judge was not pressed in these appeals. however, it is necessary to record that although, mr dayan krishnan had not pressed the said issue before us, he reserved the rights of the appellants to raise the same before the learned arbitral tribunal. 38. the controversy in the present appeals is in a narrow compass. mr dayan krishnan and mr nayar, learned senior counsels, who advanced submissions on behalf of the appellants, confined these appeals to assailing the direction issued for submission of a bank guarantee equivalent to 50% of the amounts claimed by s&w. further, they circumscribed the challenge by founding the same on a singular (2013) 1 scc 641 2019 scc online sc 995 (2018) 15 scc 678 ground that the said direction is contrary to the principles under order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc. 39. in view of the above, the only question to be addressed by this court is whether the impugned directions to furnish a bank guarantee equivalent to 50% of the amount claimed by the respondent, can be faulted on the ground that the conditions for issuing such a direction as stipulated under order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc, are not satisfied. 40. the appellants contend that the direction to furnish a bank guarantee to secure s&w's claims amounts to attachment before decree and no such direction can be issued without satisfying the conditions for issuing such an order under order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc. mr. wadhwa, the learned senior counsel appearing for s&w countered the aforesaid contention and urged that the findings of the learned single judge clearly warrant issuance of such directions. 41. mr wadhwa, referred to the decision of the supreme court in essar house private limited v. arcellor mittal nippon steel india limited4 and submitted that the powers of a court under section 9 of the a&c act are wider than the powers under the provisions of the cpc. he further emphasized that the supreme court had approved the view of this court in ajay singh & ors. v. kal airways private limited & ors.5 as well as the bombay high court in jagdish ahuja & anr. v. 2022 scc online sc 1219 2017 scc online del 8934 cupino limited6 and valentine maritime ltd. v. kreuz subsea pte limited & anr.7. he also relied on the observations of the supreme court to the effect that if a strong prima facie case is made out and the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioner, the court would not withhold relief on a mere technicality of absence of averments. in addition, he referred to the decision of the learned single judge of this court in huawei technologies co. ltd. v. sterlite technologies limited.8. 42. before proceeding further, it would be relevant to refer to the findings of the learned single judge on which the impugned directions rest. the learned single judge had considered clause 12.2.1 of the osa and noted that in terms of the said agreement, s&w was entitled to 90% of the offshore supply price on achieving of the cod. it was further entitled to the remaining 10% of the offshore supply price on final acceptance. the court noted that the commercial operations had commenced, and admittedly, the said milestones were achieved. this was also reflected by the certificates issued by the state discom. thus, the court concluded that, prima facie, s&w would be entitled to 90% of the offshore supply price. the court noted that the osa expressly recorded that it was a complete agreement. and, s&w was not in breach of its obligations in respect of the offshore supplies. 2020 scc online bom 849 2021 scc online bom 75 2016 scc online del 604 43. in view of the above, the learned single judge accepted that s&w had established a prima facie case in its favour. in view of the undisputed facts, the learned single judge returned findings on a prima facie basis, to the following effect: (i) that s&w's obligations under the osa were limited to the offshore supplies; (ii) that s&w had fulfilled its obligations; (iii) that the cover of offshore security cover was not provided to s&w; (iv) that the offshore supply price payable to s&w was required be secured by the shareholding of holdings 2 ltd. (respondent no.4), which was held by sgc (respondent no.3). holdings 4 ltd. was a holding company for sipl (respondent no.1) and the security in respect of the shares of holdings 4 ltd. would effectively secure s&w by an indirect control of the shareholding of sipl, despite s&w completing its supplies which were used in setting up a project and for achieving the cod, no amount was paid to s&w; and (v) that the osa between s&w and sipl was independently executed. 44. the learned single judge found that the balance of convenience was in favour of s&w. the offshore supply price payable to s&w was required to be secured by the shareholding of holdings 2 ltd. (respondent no.4), which was held by sgc (respondent no.3). holdings 2 ltd. was the holding company of sipl and securing the shares of holdings 2 ltd. would effectively secure the indirect control of the shareholding of sipl. however, contrary to the agreement between the parties, the said security was not created. the learned single judge found that s&w was unsecured in respect of the offshore supplies and was not protected by the hypothecation deed or the equitable mortgage documents. 45. the learned single judge additionally observed that the interim directions were required to be issued against the non-signatories [appellant nos. 1 to 5 in fao(os)(comm) 30/2022 as well as skypower canada and cim group, which were arrayed as respondent nos. 7 & 8 in omp(i) (comm) 461/2018 but are not parties to the present appeals]. the learned single judge reasoned that the change in the shareholding pattern of sipl would have a material bearing on the arbitration proceedings and the execution of the arbitral award that may be rendered on culmination of the arbitral proceedings. 46. in view of the above, the learned single judge interdicted respondent no.3 (sgc), respondent no.5 (holdings 4 ltd.) and respondent no.6 (iv investments ltd.) from transferring, disposing of, creating a charge and/or encumbering in any manner the shares and securities held by them in respondent nos.1, 4 and 6 (sipl, holdings 2 ltd. and iv investments ltd.). as noticed at the outset, the appellants have not pressed their challenge to the said directions. 47. there is no finding (prima facie or otherwise) by the learned single judge that, if s&w prevails in the arbitral proceedings, it would be unable to enforce the arbitral award in its favour if the amounts as claimed are not secured. there is no allegation that appellant nos. 2 to 6 are alienating their assets and are acting in a manner that would frustrate the enforcement of an arbitral award that may be delivered in favour of s&w. 48. mr darpan wadhwa, learned senior counsel appearing for s&w contended that powers to pass interim measures of protection under section 9 of the a&c act are wide and not constrained by the provisions of the cpc. he submitted that the learned single judge had clearly made observations to the effect that s&w was unsecured; it had established a prima facie case; and the balance of convenience was in its favour. he submitted that in view of the aforesaid prima facie findings, it was not necessary for s&w to establish that the appellants were acting in a manner that would frustrate the arbitral award that may be in its favour. 49. we have carefully examined the impugned judgment. whilst, the learned single judge has found that s&w has established a prima facie case and that the balance of convenience is also in its favour, there is no finding to the effect that appellant nos. 2 to 6 are alienating their assets or would do so and frustrate s&w's recourse to enforce the arbitral award if it prevails in the arbitral proceedings. there is no finding that absent an order for securing the amounts in dispute, s&w would be unable to enforce the arbitral award that may be made in its favour. the learned single judge had accepted that any change in the shareholding pattern of original respondents no.2 to 8 would have a bearing on the arbitration proceedings as well as the execution of the arbitral award. the observations to the said effect are contained in paragraph 74 of the impugned judgment, which reads as under: \"74. it is clear that under section 9, the court has the power to issue interim directions to non-parties to arbitration agreement. keeping in view the judgements referred to above, in my opinion, petitioner is right in its contention that if the shareholding pattern of respondents changes by transferring shares, there is likelihood of changes in the management, overall control and the decision making power. this would have a significant bearing on the arbitration proceedings as well as the ultimate execution of the award. thus, interim directions are required to be issued against respondent nos. 2 to 8. the judgments relied upon by respondents are distinguishable on the facts of this case and thus of no avail to them.\" 50. in view of the above, the learned single judge had issued directions interdicting original respondent nos. 3, 5 and 6 (sgc, holdings 4 ltd. and iv investments ltd.) from transferring, disposing of, creating a charge and/or encumbering their shares or any securities by original respondent nos.1, 4 and 6 (sipl, holdings 2 ltd. and iv investments ltd.) in any manner. as noted above, there are no findings to the effect that if the original respondent nos. 2 to 8 do not secure s&w by furnishing a bank guarantee, the enforcement of an arbitral award in favour of s&w would be frustrated. however, the learned single judge had observed that if s&w succeeded in securing an award in its favour, realization of its dues from the project \"may be a long drawn battle and may also involve complications due to interest of the state discoms in the same.\" 51. paragraph 85 of the impugned judgement is relevant and is set out below: \"85. prima facie, it appears that the hypothecation deed does not secure the offshore supply price. learned senior counsels for the petitioner are also right in their contention that the project has liabilities towards the state discoms under the various ppas and is also encumbered with swpl. in case the petitioner succeeds in getting an award in its favour, realization of its dues from the project may be a long drawn battle and may also involve complications due to the interest of the state discoms in the same. this court cannot lose sight of the undisputed fact that the project has utilized the offshore supplies made by the petitioner and is functional and generating revenue for the respondents. the dues of the petitioner under the osa need to be secured and preserved as a step in aid of arbitration, which is the purpose and intent of the legislature in enacting section 9 of the act.\" 52. it is material to note that there is no cavil that the direction issued by the learned single judge for furnishing the bank guarantee is in the nature of an order under order xxxviii rule 5 of cpc. 53. the question as to the conditions required to be satisfied for issuance of orders in the nature of attachment before decree, for securing the claims made by a party, under section 9 of the a&c act, has been the subject matter of several decisions. 54. before discussing the same, it would be relevant to refer to section 9(1) of the a&c act. the same is reproduced below: \"interim measures, etc. by court.--(1) a party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36, apply to a court:-(i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely:-(a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement; (b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration; (c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence; (d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver; (e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient, and the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it.\" 55. the last limb of section 9(1) of the a&c act, expressly provides that the courts would have the same powers for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it. thus, the powers to be exercised under section 9 of the a&c act are expressly qualified to be limited to those that are available to a court in respect of any proceedings before it. to put it conversely section 9 of the a&c act does not confer any additional powers, which are otherwise not available in relation to proceedings before courts. 56. in firm ashok traders & anr. v. gurmukh das saluja & ors.9, the supreme court had referred to section 9 of the a&c act and had observed as under: \"13. .the reliefs which the court may allow to a party under clauses (i) and (ii) of section 9 flow from the power vesting in the court exercisable by reference to \"contemplated\", \"pending\" or \"completed\" arbitral proceedings. the court is conferred with the same power for making the specified orders as it has for the purpose of and in relation to any proceedings before it though the venue of the proceedings in relation to which the power under section 9 is sought to be exercised is the arbitral tribunal.\" 57. in adhunik steels ltd. v. orissa manganese and minerals (p) ltd.10, the supreme court had observed as under: \"11. it is true that section 9 of the act speaks of the court by way of an interim measure passing an order for protection, for the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods, which are the subject-matter of the arbitration (2004) 3 scc 155 (2007) 7 scc 125 agreement and such interim measure of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient. the grant of an interim prohibitory injunction or an interim mandatory injunction are governed by well-known rules and it is difficult to imagine that the legislature while enacting section 9 of the act intended to make a provision which was dehors the accepted principles that governed the grant of an interim injunction. same is the position regarding the appointment of a receiver since the position regarding the appointment of a receiver since the section itself brings in the concept of \"just and convenient\" while speaking of passing any interim measure of protection. the concluding words of the section, \"and the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose and in relation to any proceedings before it\" also suggest that the normal rules that govern the court in the grant of interim orders is not sought to be jettisoned by the provision. moreover, when a party is given a right to approach an ordinary court of the country without providing a special procedure or a special set of rules in that behalf, the ordinary rules followed by that court would govern the exercise of power conferred by the act. on that basis also, it is not possible to keep out the concept of balance of convenience, prima facie case, irreparable injury and the concept of just and convenient while passing interim measures under section 9 of the act.\" 58. in natrip implementation society v. ivrcl limited11, a single judge of this court (one of us, vibhu bakhru, j.) had in the context of the powers to secure an amount claimed prior to the passing of the arbitral award observed as under: \"17. it is also clear from the opening sentence of section 9(1)(ii) of the act that the measures that can be ordered are \"interim measures of protection\". it, plainly, follows that the principles that would be applicable for grant of orders under section 9(1)(ii) of the act would be the principles 2016 scc online del 5023 that may be applicable to grant of such orders as are applicable to proceedings before the court. an order for securing the amount claimed prior to an arbitral award is essentially in the nature of attachment before judgement and thus, the principles as applicable for grant of such orders in proceedings before the court that is, as applicable under order xxxviii rule 5 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (hereafter 'the cpc') would be equally applicable for grant of relief under sections 9(1)(ii)(b) or 17(1)(ii)(b) of the act (as amended by act 3 of 2016) prior to the publishing of the arbitral award. in rite approach group ltd. v. rosoboronexport: 111 (2004) dlt 816, global company v. m/s national fertilizers ltd.: air 1998 delhi 397 and gatx india pvt ltd. (supra), this court held that it would take guidance from the principles given in order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc for grant of orders under section 9 of the act. 18. it is also well settled that the granting of orders under section 9 of the act are discretionary in nature and equitable considerations would apply for grant of such orders. thus, orders as prayed under section 9(1) of the act would be granted only if it is necessary and equitable. xxxx xxxx xxxx 20. in order for the court to exercise its powers under order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc, it is necessary that twin conditions be satisfied. first, that the plaintiff establishes a reasonably strong prima facie case for succeeding in the suit; and second, that the court is prima facie satisfied that the defendant is acting in a manner so as to defeat the realisation of the decree that ultimately may be passed. the object of sections 9(1)(ii)(b) and 17(1)(ii)(b) of the act is similar to the object of order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc. the arbitral tribunal while exercising powers under section 17(1)(ii)(b) of the act or the court while exercising power under section 9(1)(ii)(b) of the act must be satisfied that it is necessary to pass order to secure the amount in dispute. such orders cannot be passed mechanically. further, the object of the order would be to prevent the party against whom the claim has been made from dispersing its assets or from acting in a manner to so as to frustrate the award that may be passed.\" 59. in nimbus communication ltd. v. board of control for cricket in india & anr.12 the bombay high court held as under:-\"22. the judgment of the supreme court in adhunik steels has noted the earlier decision in arvind constructions which holds that since section 9 is a power which is conferred under a special statute, but which is exercisable by an ordinary court without laying down a special condition for the exercise of the power or a special procedure, the general rules of procedure of the court would apply. consequently, where an injunction is sought under section 9 the power of the court to grant that injunction cannot be exercised independent of the principles which have been laid down to govern the grant of interim injunctions particularly in the context of the specific relief act, 1963. the court, consequently would be obligated to consider as to whether there exists a prima facie case, the balance of convenience and irreparable injury in deciding whether it would be just and convenient to grant an order of injunction. section 9, specifically provides in sub-clause (d) of clause (ii) for the grant of an interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver. as regards sub-clause (b) of clause (ii) the interim measure of protection is to secure the amount in dispute in the arbitration. the underlying object of order 38 rule 5 is to confer upon the court an enabling power to require a defendant to provide security of an extent and value as may be sufficient to satisfy the decree that may be passed in favour of the plaintiff. the exercise of the power to order that security should be furnished is, however, preconditioned by the requirement of the satisfaction of the court that the defendant is about to alienate the property or remove it beyond the limits of the court with an intent to obstruct or delay execution of the decree that may be 2012 scc online bom 287 passed against him. in view of the decisions of the supreme court both in arvind constructions and adhunik steels, it would not be possible to subscribe to the position that the power to grant an interim measure of protection under section 9(ii)(b) is completely independent of the provisions of the code of civil procedure 1908 or that the exercise of that power is untrammelled by the code. the basic principle which emerges from both the judgments of the supreme court is that though the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 is a special statute, section 9 does not either attach a special condition for the exercise of the power nor does it embody a special form of procedure for the exercise of the power by the court. the second aspect of the provision which has been noted by the supreme court is the concluding part of section 9 under which it has been specified that the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of and in relation to any proceedings before it. this has been interpreted in both the judgments to mean that the normal rules that govern the court in the grant of an interlocutory order are not jettisoned by the provision. the judgment of the division bench of this court in national shipping company (supra) notes that though the power by section 9(ii)(b) is wide, it has to be governed by the paramount consideration that a party which has a claim adjudicated in its favour ultimately by the arbitrator should be in a position to obtain the fruits of the arbitration while executing the award. the division bench noted that the power being of a drastic nature, a direction to secure the amount claimed in the arbitration petition should not be issued merely on the merits of the claim, unless a denial of the order would result in grave injustice to the party seeking a protective order. the obstructive conduct of the party against whom such a direction is sought was regarded as being a material consideration. however, the view of the division bench of this court that the exercise of power under section 9(ii)(b) is not controlled by the provisions of the code of civil procedure 1908 cannot stand in view of the decision of the supreme court in adhunik steels\". (emphasis added) 60. in ajay singh & ors. v. kal airways private limited5, the coordinate bench of this court had observed as under: \"27. though apparently, there seem to be two divergent strands of thought, in judicial thinking, this court is of the opinion that the matter is one of the weight to be given to the materials on record, a fact dependent exercise, rather than of principle. that section 9 grants wide powers to the courts in fashioning an appropriate interim order, is apparent from its text. nevertheless, what the authorities stress is that the exercise of such power should be principled, premised on some known guidelines therefore, the analogy of orders 38 and 39. equally, the court should not find itself unduly bound by the text of those provisions rather it is to follow the underlying principles.\" (emphasis added) 61. in national highway authority of india v. punjab national bank & ors.13, a division bench of this court considered the petition of the respondent bank for disbursement of payment, which it claimed was due to it notwithstanding the arbitrable disputes. in that case the concession agreement expressly provided the obligation to make certain payment on termination of the concession agreement. this court was of the view that notwithstanding the controversy and disputes regarding termination of the agreement in question, undisputedly, such demands would be payable. accordingly, this court directed deposit of the said amount in a petition filed under section 9 of the a&c act. in regard to 2017 scc online del 11312 the exercise of powers under section 9 of the a&c act, this court observed as under: \"37. on the question of exercise of power under section 9 of the a&c act, we have already referred to clauses 37.3.1 of the concessionaire agreement which is an express and mandatory provision when said agreement is terminated on account of concessionaire fault. we have also referred to clauses 3.2 and 4.2 of the tripartite escrow agreement which refers to termination payment. to accept the plea of nhai that section 9 of the a&c act cannot be invoked, would negate and obliterate the aforesaid clauses and their effect. in the aforesaid circumstances the ratio of decision of the division bench of this court in value source mercantile limited v. span mechnotronix limited: (2014) 143 drj 505, is apposite, if not definite and conclusive. referring to section 9 of the a&c act, this decision emphasized that the said provision uses the expression 'interim measure of protection' as distinct from the expression 'temporary injunction' used in rules 1 and 2 of order xxxix of the code of civil procedure, 1908. interim injunction is one of the measures or orders prescribed in clause (d) to section 9(ii) of the a&c act, albeit a party to the arbitration agreement is entitled to apply for an seek 'interim measure of protection'. clause (e) to section 9(ii) is a residuary power of the court to issue or direct other \"interim measures of protection\". thus, the court has the power to issue or direct other interim measurers of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient. section 9 encompass the power of making orders as the civil court has for the purpose of, and in relation to any proceedings before it. this decision refers to rule 10 of order xxxix of the aforesaid code which empowers the court to direct to deposit payment of the admitted amount. therefore the court exercising power under section 9 of the a&c act has the same power as that of a civil court during pendency of the suit.\" 62. as noted at the outset, there is no dispute that the directions issued by the learned single judge to furnish the bank guarantee to partly secure the claims of s&w are in the nature of an order under order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc. order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc, is set out below: \"5. where defendant may be called upon to furnish security for production of property.-(1) where at any stage of a suit, the court is satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise, that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against him,-(a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property, or (b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the court, the court may direct the defendant, within a time to be fixed by it, either to furnish security, in such sum as may be specified in the order, to produce and place at the disposal of the court, when required, the said property or the value of the same, or such portion thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy the decree, or to appear and show cause why he should not furnish security. (2) the plaintiff shall, unless the court otherwise directs, specify the property required to be attached and the estimated value thereof. (3) the court may also in the order direct the conditional attachment of the whole or any portion of the property so specified. (4) if an order of attachment is made without complying with the provisions of sub-rule (1) of this rule, such attachment shall be void.\" 63. the principle for granting orders under order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc are now well settled. in raman tech. & process engineering co. & anr. v. solanki traders14, the supreme court had observed that the power under order xxxviii rule 5 are drastic and extraordinary powers and are required to be used sparingly and in accordance with the rule. the supreme court also observed that the purpose of order xxxviii rule 5 was not to convert an unsecured debt as a secured one. the object of order xxxviii rule 5 was to prevent any defendant from defeating the realization of a decree that may ultimately be passed in favour of the plaintiff. the relevant extract of the said decision is set out below: \"4. the object of supplemental proceedings (applications for arrest or attachment before judgment, grant of temporary injunctions and appointment of receivers) is to prevent the ends of justice being defeated. the object of order 38 rule 5 cpc in particular, is to prevent any defendant from defeating the realization of the decree that may ultimately be passed in favour of the plaintiff, either by attempting to dispose of, or remove from the jurisdiction of the court, his movables. the scheme of order 38 and the use of the words \"to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against him\" in rule 5 make it clear that before exercising the power under the said rule, the court should be satisfied that there is a reasonable chance of a decree being passed in the suit against the defendant. this would mean that the court should be satisfied that the plaintiff has a prima facie case. if the averments in the plaint and the documents produced in support of it, do not satisfy the court about the existence of a prima facie case, the court will not go to the next stage of examining whether the (2008) 2 scc 302 interest of the plaintiff should be protected by exercising power under order 38 rule 5 cpc. it is well-settled that merely having a just or valid claim or a prima facie case, will not entitle the plaintiff to an order of attachment before judgment, unless he also establishes that the defendant is attempting to remove or dispose of his assets with the intention of defeating the decree that may be passed. equally well settled is the position that even where the defendant is removing or disposing his assets, an attachment before judgment will not be issued, if the plaintiff is not able to satisfy that he has a prima facie case. 5. the power under order 38 rule 5 cpc is a drastic and extraordinary power. such power should not be exercised mechanically or merely for the asking. it should be used sparingly and strictly in accordance with the rule. the purpose of order 38 rule 5 is not to convert an unsecured debt into a secured debt. any attempt by a plaintiff to utilize the provisions of order 38 rule 5 as a leverage for coercing the defendant to settle the suit claim should be discouraged. instances are not wanting where bloated and doubtful claims are realised by unscrupulous plaintiffs, by obtaining orders of attachment before judgment and forcing the defendants for out-of court settlements, under threat of attachment.\" 64. the powers of a court under section 9 of the a&c act to direct interim measures are wide and in the given cases, the court can direct furnishing of a security to secure the claims of the applicant pending the conclusion of the arbitral proceedings. further, orders under section 9 of the a&c act can be passed before, during or after the arbitral proceedings. however, it is equally well settled that the powers available to a court for making orders under section 9 of the a&c act are the same as that the court has, for the purpose of, or in relation to, any proceedings before it. thus, the powers under section 9 of the a&c act cannot be exercised in disregard of the provisions of the cpc or their underlying principles. 65. in essar house private limited v. arcellor mittal nippon steel india limited4, the supreme court had approved the view of this court in ajay singh & ors. v. kal airways private limited5 that section 9 of the a&c act grants wide powers to the courts in fashioning an appropriate interim order. however, it is material to note that in ajay singh & ors. v. kal airways private limited5, this court had also stressed that the exercise of such power should be \"principled, premised on some known guidelines.\" the reference to orders 38 and 39 of the cpc was in the aforesaid context. however, the court was not bound by the text of those provisions but had to follow the underlying principles. the decision of the bombay high court in jagdish ahuja & anr. v. cupino limited6 is not materially different. the reading of the said decision indicates that the court had followed its earlier decision in nimbus communications limited v. board of control for cricket in india & anr.12 and emphasized that the court while exercising the powers under section 9 of the a&c act has the discretion to grant a wide range of interim measures of protection. however, the court was required to be guided by the principles which the civil courts ordinarily employ for considering interim relief, particularly, under order xxxix rule 1 and 2 and order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc. however, the court reiterated the view that, in exercise of powers under section 9 of the a&c act, the court is \"not unduly bound by their texts\". this is, essentially, the same view as expressed by this court in ajay singh & ors. v. kal airways private limited5. 66. in valentine maritime ltd. v. kreuz subsea pte limited. & anr.7 a decision relied upon by s&w that was also referred to by the supreme court in essar house private limited v. arcellor mittal nippon steel india limited4 the bombay high court had reiterated the aforesaid principles. contrary to the contentions advanced by mr wadhwa, the high court in the said case had, after referring to the decisions in adhunik steels ltd. v. orissa manganese and minerals (p) ltd.10 and nimbus communications ltd. v. board of control for cricket in india & anr.12, held that the decision of the division bench of the court in national shipping companies of saudi arabia v. sentrans industries limited15 to the effect that exercise of powers under section 9 (ii)(b) of the a&c act was not controlled by the cpc, was not sustainable. paragraph 95 of the said decision is set out below: \"95. insofar as judgment of this court delivered by the division bench of this court in case of nimbus communications limited v. board of control for cricket in india (supra) relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the vml is concerned, this court adverted to the judgment of hon'ble supreme court in case of adhunik steels ltd. v. orissa manganese and minerals (p) ltd., (2007) 7 scc 125 and held that in view of the decision of the supreme court in case of adhunik steels ltd., (supra) the view of the division bench in case of national shipping company of saudi arabia (supra) that the exercise of power under section 9(ii)(b) is not controlled by the provisions of the code of civil 2004 scc online bom 25 procedure, 1908 cannot stand. this court in the said judgment of nimbus communications limited (supra) held that the exercise of the power under section 9 of the arbitration act cannot be totally independent of the basic principles governing grant of interim injunction by the civil court, at the same time, the court when it decides the petition under section 9, must have due regard to the underlying purpose of the conferment of the power upon the court which is to promote the efficacy of arbitration as a form of dispute resolution.\" (emphasis added) 67. it is also relevant to refer to decision of the learned single judge of this court in tahal consulting engineers india pvt. ltd. v. promax power ltd.16 68. in the said case, this court had referred to the earlier decisions and had held as under: \"39. turning then to the powers of the arbitral tribunal to pass an order of attachment before the award is rendered or framing directions for securitising the claim that may be laid before it, the court notes that it is now well settled that while the arbitral tribunal may not be strictly bound by the principles which inform order xxxviii rule 5 of the code, it could adopt principles analogous to those comprised in that provision. courts have repeatedly held that while the power to attach before award may not have been specifically set out in sections 9 and 17 of the act, such an order could be made if circumstances so warrant. indubitably, while the arbitral tribunal or for that matter the court under section 9 may not be strictly bound by the rigidity of the discretion vested upon a court by the code, at the same time when it does choose to exercise that 2023 scc online del 2069 power it must do so guided by the principles accepted as relevant and germane for that power being wielded.\" 69. we concur with the aforesaid view. the law in regard to issuing orders in the nature of securing the claims made by a party are now well settled. whilst the court is not unduly bound by the texts or order xxxviii rule 1 and 2 or order xxxviii rule (5) or any other provisions of cpc, the substantial principles for grant of such interim measures cannot be disregarded. these principles must be duly satisfied for the court to issue any interim measures of protection under section 9 of the a&c act. 70. the principles underlying the object of order xxxviii rule (5) of the cpc are, as noticed earlier, well settled. such orders are required to be issued in case where the court is satisfied that the party has established a strong prima facie case and that the respondents are acting in a manner that would defeat the realization of the decree. these principles must be equally satisfied for securing protective orders under section 9 of the a&c act, which are in the nature of orders under order xxxviii rule (5) of the cpc. 71. mr wadhwa had strongly relied on paragraphs 48 and 49 of the decision of the supreme court in essar house private limited v. arcellor mittal nippon steel india limited.4 the said paragraphs are set out below: \"48. section 9 of the arbitration act confers wide power on the court to pass orders securing the amount in dispute in arbitration, whether before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, during the arbitral proceedings or at any time after making of the arbitral award, but before its enforcement in accordance with section 36 of the arbitration act. all that the court is required to see is, whether the applicant for interim measure has a good prima facie case, whether the balance of convenience is in favour of interim relief as prayed for being granted and whether the applicant has approached the court with reasonable expedition. 49. if a strong prima facie case is made out and the balance of convenience is in favour of interim relief being granted, the court exercising power under section 9 of the arbitration act should not withhold relief on the mere technicality of absence of averments, incorporating the grounds for attachment before judgment under order 38 rule 5 of the cpc.\" 72. the aforesaid observations cannot be read in isolation. although the supreme court had held that an applicant is required to establish a good prima facie case as well as the balance of convenience in his favour, for the grant of interim relief. however, the said observations cannot be read to mean that other underlying principles for the grant of interim orders as contemplated under order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc are required to be ignored or disregarded. in a subsequent paragraph, the supreme court had observed that a mere technicality of the absence of averments incorporating the grounds for attachment before the judgment under order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc should not withhold relief. however, these observations read in the context of the decision, clearly indicate that the same cannot be read to mean that the underlying principles for the grant of interim relief as contemplated under order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc can be disregarded. it is material to note that in essar house private limited v. arcellor mittal nippon steel india limited4, the supreme court was considering an appeal against an order of the commercial court of the bombay high court. in its order, the bombay high court had held that section 9 of the a&c act does not preclude a court to pass an equitable order for securing the claim of the applicant in a case where \"once having rendered a prima-facie finding that the applicant would have good chances of succeeding in the arbitration and if the claim made by the applicant is not secured, he would not be able to enjoy fruits of the arbitral award on its execution.\" thus, the underlying principle that the interim orders for securing a claimant in an arbitral proceeding can be made only in cases where the court is prima facie satisfied that but for securing the claimant, it would be unable to reap the benefits of a favourable award, was satisfied in that case. 73. in sanghi industries limited v. ravin cables ltd. & anr.17 which was delivered after the decision in essar house private limited v. arcellor mittal nippon steel india limited4the supreme court considered a case where the appellant was directed to deposit an amount realized by invocation of the performance guarantees. the respondent had filed a petition under section 9 of the a&c act seeking to interdict the invocation of the bank guarantees. however, before any order could be passed, the bank guarantees were invoked and the appellant had realised the payments in respect of the said bank guarantees. in the 2022 scc online sc 1329 aforesaid context, the learned commercial court had passed an order directing the appellant to deposit the amount realized by it by invoking the bank guarantees, in the court. in the appeal preferred against the said order, the supreme court held as under: \"4. having heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties and in the facts and circumstances of the case, more particularly, when the bank guarantees were already invoked and the amounts under the respective bank guarantees were already paid by the bank much prior to the commercial court passed the order under section 9 of the arbitration act, 1996 and looking to the tenor of the order passed by the commercial court, it appears that the commercial court had passed the order under section 9(ii)(e) of the arbitration act, 1996 to secure the amount in dispute, we are of the opinion that unless and until the preconditions under order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc are satisfied and unless there are specific allegations with cogent material and unless prima facie the court is satisfied that the appellant is likely to defeat the decree/award that may be passed by the arbitrator by disposing of the properties and/or in any other manner, the commercial court could not have passed such an order in exercise of powers under section 9 of the arbitration act, 1996. at this stage, it is required to be noted that even otherwise there are very serious disputes on the amount claimed by the rival parties, which are to be adjudicated upon in the proceedings before the arbitral tribunal. 4.1 the order(s) which may be passed by the commercial court in an application under section 9 of the arbitration act, 1996 is basically and mainly by way of interim measure. it may be true that in a given case if all the conditions of order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc are satisfied and the commercial court is satisfied on the conduct of opposite/opponent party that the opponent party is trying to sell its properties to defeat the award that may be passed and/or any other conduct on the part of the opposite/opponent party which may tantamount to any attempt on the part of the opponent/opposite party to defeat the award that may be passed in the arbitral proceedings, the commercial court may pass an appropriate order including the restrain order and/or any other appropriate order to secure the interest of the parties. however, unless and until the conditions mentioned in order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc are satisfied such an order could not have been passed by the commercial court which has been passed by the commercial court in the present case, which has been affirmed by the high court.\" [emphasis added] 74. in the present case, there are no observations or findings to the effect that if the orders for furnishing of the bank guarantee are not granted, s&w would be unable to enforce the arbitral award against appellant nos. 2 to 6. there is also no material on record to even remotely suggest that appellant nos. 2 to 6 are alienating their assets or acting in a manner that would frustrate the enforcement of the arbitral award, if s&w india prevails in the arbitral proceedings. clearly, an order directing them to furnish a bank guarantee, militates against the principles underlying under order xxxviii rule 5 of the cpc. 75. appellant no.1 (shl) is a special purpose vehicle in respect of the project. in regard to the said company the respondent is protected to the extent that the impugned order effectively restrains any change in the shareholding of the said company. 76. in view of the above, we allow the present appeals to the limited extent of setting aside the direction to the appellants to provide a bank guarantee to partly secure the claims of the respondent. we clarify that all other interim measures of protection granted in terms of the impugned order continue to be operative. 77. it is also clarified that this would not preclude the respondent from seeking such interim relief as advised in the arbitral proceedings. needless to state that any application made by the respondent shall be considered uninfluenced by any observations made in this order. vibhu bakhru, j amit mahajan, j november 10, 2023 rk/gsr"
