This Notice of Motion seeks quashing and setting aside of orders passed by the learned Prothonotary and Senior Master Priya R. Soparkar 2 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.d oc transferring the suit with respect to the Applicants herein viz. the Defendants therein to the list of undefended suits as the Defendants failed to file written statement within time and and to condone the delay of 231 days in filing written statement of the Defendants and thereafter to take the written statement on their behalf on record. \n2. Mr. Palshikar, learned counsel for the Applicants would submit that the Writ of Summons was served upon the Defendants on 2 nd November, 2016. That since the Applicants are based in Vidharbha, they immediately approached their panel Advocates who are based in Nagpur as the Applicants do not have a panel of Advocates for Mumbai. That therefore, the Applicants depended on their panel of Advocates at Nagpur for appointment of Advocate to defend the suit in Mumbai. That accordingly on the suggestion of their panel Advocates they appointed a panel Advocate from Mumbai for representing them in the suit before this Court who filed Vakalatnama on 15th November, 2016. Mr. Palshikar would further submit that the Applicants were coordinating with their Panel Advocate at Nagpur who in turn was coordinating with their panel Advocate at Mumbai. The Applicants were called upon to give parawise remarks for preparation of their written statement. Mr.Palshikar would submit that the Priya R. Soparkar 3 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc Defendant No.1 is specifically constituted under the Maharashtra Act No.XXV of 1997 for the purpose of the irrigation project set up in District Bhandara. That the offices of the Applicants No.1, 3 and 4 are situated at Nagpur while that of Applicant No.2 is at Pauni, District Bhandara. It is further submitted that the plaint filed by the Plaintiff was voluminous having various Exhibits which needed to be verified and countered. It is submitted that the documents in respect of the disputes lying in different branch offices of the Applicants had to be collected and details from various employees stationed at the sites had to be obtained which took considerable time to give appropriate and parawise instructions for preparation of the written statement to their Advocate in Mumbai. \n3. It is submitted that the commercial suit came up before the learned Prothonotary and Senior Master on 3 rd February, 2017 for directions and the Prothonotary passed a conditional order directing the Applicants to file their written statement on or before 8 th March, 2017. \n4. Mr. Palshikar would submit that the Applicants had been taking all efforts to procure instructions and documents from the relevant Priya R. Soparkar 4 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc officers and employees, however, due to workload and pressure to attend the day to day affairs there was delay in obtaining the same. That, therefore, a request was made to the learned Prothonotary and Senior Master to grant time, but despite request, the Prothonotary and Senior Master transferred the suit to the list of undefended suits on 8 th March, 2017 for want of written statement of the Defendants.\n5. It is submitted that the Applicants were advised to initiate appropriate proceedings seeking condonation of delay for filing written statement. Therefore, it is submitted that upon advice of their Advocate, the Applicants, on 7th April 2017, filed Chamber Order (L) No.869 of 2017 alongwith the supporting affidavit setting out their case before the Prothonotary and Senior Master. Mr. Palshikar, learned counsel for the Applicants would submit that the said Chamber Order had been pending hearing and final disposal before the Prothonotary and Senior Master since then. That in the meantime, the panel Advocates for the Applicant No.1 were changed and hence their Advocate in Mumbai requested to take back the case from him. It is submitted that, therefore, the Applicants had to once again search for an Advocate in Mumbai. That accordingly the present Advocate was approached and the contest with respect to the Chamber Order was Priya R. Soparkar 5 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc pursued. It is submitted that finally by order dated 14 th August, 2017, the Prothonotary and Senior Master dismissed the Chamber Order, although the same was not uploaded at the time of filing the Notice of Motion and came to be uploaded only on 18 th January, 2018, whereas the Notice of Motion has been filed on 11 th October, 2017. Mr. Palshikar would submit that the written statement of the Applicants was ready and affirmed on the date of filing of the Notice of Motion and there is only a delay of 231 days of which 122 days have been spent in contesting the Chamber Order before the Prothonotary and Senior Master. \n6. Mr. Palshikar would submit that Defendants had been diligently following up the matter but due to locations of various departments at various places, they could not gather the entire information within time and the written statement could not be filed before 90 days. It is submitted that the Applicants being a Government Corporation and public money being involved, the delay be condoned and the written statement be taken on record for free and fair trial of the suit. It is submitted that the Applicants have a very good case on merits and that grave and irreparable harm and injury would be caused not only to the Defendants but also public money would be lost if they are not Priya R. Soparkar 6 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc allowed to contest the suit by filing their written statement. That no harm or prejudice would be caused to the Plaintiff if the Notice of Motion is allowed and the written statement be taken on record for the suit to be decided on merits. That, the balance of convenience lies heavily in favour of the Applicants and therefore, the Notice of Motion be allowed. \n7. Mr. Palshikar relies upon the decision of this Court in the case of Iridium India Telecom Limited Bombay Vs. Motorola INC and anr. 1 as well as the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court pursuant to the Special Leave Petition2 against the order of this Court in the said matter to submit that this Court as well as the Hon'ble Supreme Court affirming the decision of this Court, in view of Rule 129 of the High Court Original Side Rules, 1980 has observed that the amended provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (\"CPC\") would not apply to the suits on the original side and such suits would continue to be governed by the Original Side Rules which empower the Judge in Chambers to enlarge the time for filing of the written statement under Rule 265. That in the event of a conflict between special law and general law, special law will always prevail the Bombay High Court Original Side Rules, which regulate the 1 2004 (1) Mh.L.J. 532 2 AIR 2005 SC 514 Priya R. Soparkar 7 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc procedure to be followed by the Original Side of the Chartered High Court pursuant to clause 37 of the Letters Patent being a Special Law, in view of the principle elucidated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Iridium India Telecom Limited Bombay Vs. Motorola INC and anr. (supra), will prevail over the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (the \"Commercial Courts Act\") which like the CPC is a general law applicable to all Courts. \n8. Mr. Palshikar would submit that the order dated 4 th September, 2017 also applied to the said principles, but erroneously, to treat the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as a Special Act in contradistinction to the High Court Original Side Rules which in view of the law elucidated in the decision of this Court as the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Iridium India Telecom Limited Bombay Vs. Motorola INC and anr. (supra) would prevail over the Commercial Courts Act. Mr. Palshikar would further submit that on the date of the passing of the order rejecting the Chamber Order viz. 4th September, 2017, Rule 91 of the High Court Original Side Rules pursuant to which written statement could be filed beyond the period of limitation with the leave of the Judge in Chambers upon such terms as to the filing of the written statement as the Chamber Judge may think proper was deleted much later i.e. only Priya R. Soparkar 8 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc on 24th March 2022, whereas the order has been passed on 4 th September, 2017, when the written statement could be filed after the period fixed under Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC with the leave of the Judge in Chambers. That the Chamber Order had also been filed prior to the deletion of the said Rule. Referring to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of SCG Contracts (India) Private Limited Vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Private Limited and ors. 3, Mr. Palshikar would submit that the said decision is effective only from 12th February, 2019 and would not apply with respect to the orders prior to that and would therefore not apply to the facts of this case as the delay pertains to a prior period and even the order on the Chamber order is dated 4th September 2019 which is prior to the date of the said decision. Mr. Palshikar would further submit that the said decision arises from a decision of Delhi High Court and does not consider the impact of the Letters Patent and Bombay High Court Original Side Rules and the fact that the Bombay High Court is a Chartered High Court constituted pursuant to the Letters Patent and that the Letters Patent is a special statute and that, therefore, the said decision would not also apply to the case at hand. Mr. Palshikar would therefore, submit that the Notice of Motion be allowed as prayed for. \n3 (2019) 12 Supreme Court Cases 210 Priya R. Soparkar 9 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc 9. On the other hand, Mr. Ativ Patel, learned counsel appearing for the Plaintiff would at the outset submit that the Applicants had incorrectly calculated the number of days for condonation of delay as 231 days whereas the same should be 313 days. Learned Counsel would submit that even otherwise for the last six years the Defendants had not taken any steps to move the Notice of Motion or even annex a copy of the notarized written statement to their application demonstrating their bonafides that the same is ready. It is also submitted that the reasons furnished by the Applicants to justify the delay are also without substance in the context of the time limit stipulated pursuant to the Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act amending inter alia Rule 1 of Order VIII of the CPC in its application to the commercial disputes and in particular the proviso to Rule 1 in Order VIII of the CPC.\n10. Learned Counsel further submits that the Commercial Courts Act, is a Special Act and the proviso which has been substituted pursuant thereto with effect from 23rd October 2015 in Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC with respect to commercial suits, clearly provides that where the Defendant fails to file the written statement within the period of 30 days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other Priya R. Soparkar 10 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc date as may be specified by the Court for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit but which shall not be later than 120 days from the date of service of summons and on the expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the Defendant shall forfeit the right to file written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. Mr. Patel would submit that this amendment has been brought into effect from the year 2015 and in its application to Commercial disputes and that the order rejecting the Chamber Order is dated 4 th September, 2017. That therefore, in view of the interpretation of Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC as applicable to Commercial disputes by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of SCG Contracts (India) Private Limited Vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Private Limited and ors. (supra) which clearly holds that on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons on the Defendants, the Defendants shall forfeit the right to file written statement and the Court must not allow the written statement to be taken on record, the Notice of Motion be dismissed as admittedly there is a delay of 231 days. Learned counsel would further submit that the judgment of this Court as well as of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Iridium India Telecom Limited Bombay Vs. Motorola INC and anr. (supra) are of the years 2011 and 2014 Priya R. Soparkar 11 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc respectively in the context of the CPC and not in the context of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 which is a special statute as compared to the Bombay High Court Original Side Rules and the Letters Patent and that keeping in mind settled law, that a special statute has to prevail over a general statute, the Commercial Courts Act being a special statute would prevail over the general provisions of the High Court Original Side Rules and the Letters Patent. The learned counsel submits that moreover Rule 91 enabling filing of written statement after the limitation with the leave of the Chamber Judge is also not available to the Applicant as the said Rule clearly provides that the stage at which the leave of the Judge in Chambers can be obtained is if the suit has not been set down as undefended against him which is not the case here, as the suit had already been transferred to the list of undefended suits on 8th March 2017. The learned counsel therefore, submits that the Notice of Motion be dismissed. \n11. I have heard the learned counsel and considered the rival contentions. The basic facts are not in dispute. Admittedly, there is a delay of 231 days in filing the written statement. The Commercial Courts Act amended Rule 1 of Order VIII of the CPC by adding a proviso with retrospective effect from 23rd October, 2015 as under :-\nPriya R. Soparkar 12 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc \"Provided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be late than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.\"\n(Emphasis supplied)\n12. The said proviso clearly provides that after the period of 30 days within which the Defendant is permitted to file written statement, he shall be allowed to file written statement after that period on another date as specified by the Court for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court may deem fit which shall not be later than 120 days from the date of the service of summons and on the expiry of the 120 days from the date of service of summons, the Defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. As can be seen, there is a clear prohibition after a period of 120 days from permitting filing of written statement by the Defendant as the Defendant forfeits such right upon the end of the 120 days period from the date of service of summons. The decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of SCG Contracts (India) Priya R. Soparkar 13 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc Private Limited Vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Private Limited and ors. (supra) has considered the impact of this proviso and concluded that although ordinarily the written statement is to be filed within a period of 30 days, however, grace period of further 90 days is granted which the Court may employ for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as it deems fit to allow such written statement to come on record. That, it is of great importance that beyond 120 days from the date of service of summons, the Defendant shall forfeit the right to file written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. That the proviso in Order VIII Rule 10 of the CPC also adds that the Court has no power to extend the time beyond this period of 120 days. Paragraph No.8 of the said decision is usefully quoted as under:\n\"8. The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 came into force on 23-10-2015 bringing in their wake certain amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure. In Order 5 Rule 1, sub-rule (1), for the second proviso, the following proviso was substituted:\n\"Provided further that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred and twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written Priya R. Soparkar 14 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc statement and the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.\" \nEqually, in Order 8 Rule 1, a new proviso was substituted as follows:\n\"Provided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred and twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred and twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.\" \nThis was re-emphasized by re-inserting yet another proviso in Order 8 Rule 10 CPC, which reads as under:\n\"10. Procedure when party fails to present written statement called for by court.--Where any party from whom a written statement is required under Rule 1 or Rule 9 fails to present the same within the time permitted or fixed by the court, as the case may be, the court shall pronounce judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit and on the pronouncement of such judgment a decree shall be drawn up:\nProvided further that no court shall make an order to extend the time provided under Rule 1 of this Order for filing of the written statement.\" \nA perusal of these provisions would show that ordinarily a written statement is to be filed within a period of 30 days. However, grace period of a further 90 days is granted which the Court may employ for reasons to be recorded in writing and payment of such costs as it deems fit to allow such written statement to come on record. What is of great importance is the fact that beyond 120 days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written Priya R. Soparkar 15 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc statement to be taken on record. This is further buttressed by the proviso in Order 8 Rule 10 also adding that the court has no further power to extend the time beyond this period of 120 days.\" \n13. The decisions of this Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Iridium India Telecom Limited Bombay Vs. Motorola INC and anr. (supra) which have been relied upon by the learned counsel for the Defendants which clearly deal with the Bombay High Court Original Sides Rules in contradistinction to the CPC observe that Rule 265 referred to in the High Court Original Side Rules, in view of the Letters Patent prevails over the CPC in view of Section 129 of the CPC which reads as under :\n\"129. Power of High Courts to make rules as to their original civil procedure. - Notwithstanding anything in this Code, any High Court not being the Court of a Judicial Commissioner, may make such rules not inconsistent with the Letters Patent or order or other law establishing it, to regulate its own procedure in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction as it shall think fit, and nothing herein contained shall affect the validity of any such rules in force at the commencement of this Code.\"\n14. The said Rule empowers the Chartered High Courts to make Rules as to their original civil procedure and it clearly provides that notwithstanding anything in the CPC, the High Court may make such rules not inconsistent with the Letters Patent or order or any other law Priya R. Soparkar 16 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc establishing it, to regulate its own procedure in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction and nothing in the CPC shall affect the validity of any such rules in force at the commencement of the CPC. \n15. In the case of Iridium Indian Telecom Limited Bombay Vs. Motorola INC (supra) a Division Bench of this Court had while considering the provisions of Order VIII Rules 1 and 10 as amended by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002 observed that in view of Section 129 of the CPC read with Rule 265 of the Bombay High Court Original side Rules, 1980, the amended provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC would not apply to suits on the original side and such suits would continue to be governed by the Original Side Rules.\n16. It is to be noted that the amended Rules 1 and 10 of Order VIII of the CPC as considered by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Iridium Indian Telecom Limited Bombay Vs. Motorola INC- Bom H.C. (supra) read as under :\n\"1. Written statement - The defendant shall, within thirty days from the date of service of summons on him, present a written statement of his defence:\nProvided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty Priya R. Soparkar 17 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc days, he shall be allowed to file the same on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, but which shall not be later than ninety days from the date of service of summons.\n10.

By the said amendment, the legislature prescribed an outer limit for filing the written statement expressly limiting the power of a Court to extend time by 90 days. \n18. Rule 265 of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, which empowers a Chamber Judge or a Court to enlarge or abridge the time for doing any Act under the Rules reads as under :\n\"265. Power of Court or judge to enlarge or abridge time The Court or the Judge in chambers shall have power to enlarge or abridge the time appointed by these Rules or fixed by any order for doing any act, or taking any proceedings, upon such terms (if any) as the justice of the case may require and any such enlargement may be ordered although the application for the same is not made and until after expiration of the time appointed or allotted.\"\nPriya R.

Section 129 of the CPC as noted above is a non obstante provision empowering a Chartered High Court to make Rules and it clearly provides that nothing contained in the section shall affect the validity of the Rules even if they are inconsistent with the CPC but not inconsistent with the laws establishing the Chartered High Courts that is the Letters Patent. The Division Bench of this Court therefore observed that where a Rule has been made by a High Court under this section the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure do not apply. It is considering the above provisions that the Division Bench of this Court after considering the rival contentions came to a conclusion that under Rule 265 the power to extend the time was very wide and that the Original Side Rules would prevail over the amended provisions of Order VIII Rules 1 and 10 and the Chamber Judge could condone the delay in filing written statement beyond 120 days pursuant to the said Rule 265.\n20. The Bombay High Court decision was carried to the Supreme Court by way of an SLP and the Hon'ble Supreme Court after recounting the genesis of the Bombay High Court Original Side Rules, 1980 to the Letters Patent or Charter establishing the High Courts of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras in contradistinction to the CPC as well Priya R.

Paragraphs No.7,8,9,12,13 to 23, 25, 26, 37, 42, 46 to 48 of the said decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court are usefully quoted as under :\n\"7. The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is an Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to the procedure of the Courts of Civil Judicature. It would, therefore, govern all actions of civil nature, unless otherwise provided for in the CPC. Some of the provisions of the CPC, however, do make some exceptions, and it is necessary to notice them. \nSection 4(1) provides as follows:\n\"4. Savings: (1) In the absence of any specific provision to the contrary, nothing in this Code shall be deemed to Priya R. Soparkar 20 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc limit or otherwise affect any special or local law now in force or any special jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special form of procedure prescribed, by or under any other law for the time being in force.\n8. Apart from this section, Part IX of the CPC contains the fasciculus of Sections 116 to Section 120 delineating the manner of application of the CPC to the High Courts. Section 116 declares that Part IX applies only to High Courts not being the Court of a Judicial Commissioner. Section 117 provides that save as provided in Parts IX or X or in the rules, the provisions of the Code would apply to such High Courts. Section 120 provides that Sections 16, 17 and 20, which deal with the pecuniary and territorial jurisdictions, shall not apply to the High Court in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. \n9. Then comes Part X, which deals with the rule making power. By Section 121 the rules prescribed in the First Schedule, being rules prescribed by the Legislature itself, have been declared to have the same effect as if enacted in the body of the Code until and or altered in accordance with the provisions of Part X. Section 122 confers power on a High Court, other than the Court of a Judicial Commissioner, to annul, alter or add to all or any of the rules in the First Schedule. This power is conferred with regard to rules regulating their own procedure and the procedure of the Civil Courts subject to their superintendence, but is subject to the condition of previous publication. Section 123 contemplates the constitution of Rule Committees in each of the High Courts as prescribed therein. Such a Committee makes its report to the High Court under Section 124 formulating and forwarding proposals with regard to annulment, alteration or addition in the First Schedule or for making new rules. Section 126 requires that the rules made by the High Court shall be subject to the previous approval of the State Government concerned. Section 127 requires previous publication of the rules so made in the Official Gazette. Section 128 enumerates a number of matters with regard to which Priya R. Soparkar 21 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc rules may be framed by the High Courts. Then comes to Section 129, which is crucial for the present discussion. Section 129 reads as under:\n\"129. Power of High Courts to make rules as to their original civil procedure - Notwithstanding anything in this Code, any High Court not being the Court of a Judicial Commissioner, may make such rules not inconsistent with the Letters Patent or order or other law establishing it to regulate its own procedure in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction as it shall think fit, and nothing herein contained shall affect the validity of any such rules in force at the commencement of this Code.\" \n12. The CPC has been amended from time to time in order to meet with the changing situations. The historical developments as to the application of the CPC to the proceedings in the Chartered High Courts are illuminating. In order to appreciate the merit of the contention so strongly urged by the learned counsel for the appellant, it would be necessary to take a chronological perspective of the law. \nChronological Perspective:\n13. Prior to the establishing of the Chartered High Courts by the British Government in 1862, the Civil Courts in the Presidency of Bombay were governed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1859 (Act No. VIII of 1859, which received the assent of the Governor General on 22-3-1859). This Act, as its preamble suggests, was 'an Act for simplifying the procedure of the Courts of Civil Judicature not established by Royal Charter' and was not intended to apply to High Courts established by Royal Charter. \n14. The First Letters Patent or Charter establishing High Courts were accompanied by a Despatch from the Secretary of State on 14-5-1862, and were in force till revoked by a further Letters Patent on 28-12-1865. The learned counsel drew our attention to paragraph 36 of the Despatch, which explains the purpose of Clause 37 Priya R. Soparkar 22 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc in the First Letters Patent. The said paragraph 36 of the Despatch reads as under:\n\"36. Clause 37 is a very important one, and there is little doubt, will prove a very salutary provision. It has, therefore, been inserted, although the change introduced is somewhat greater and more substantial than is generally aimed at in this Charter. It extends to the High Court the Code of Civil Procedure enacted by the Legislature of India for the Court, not established by Royal Charter, and thus accomplishes the object so long contemplated of substituting one simple Code of Procedure for the various systems (corresponding to its common law, equity and admiralty jurisdiction) which have been in operation in the Supreme CourtSC519 since the date of its establishment.\"\n15. It is therefore seen that clause 37 of the Letters Patent was intended to extend to the High Courts the Code of Civil Procedure enacted by the Legislature of India for the Courts other than the Courts established by the Royal Charter. The intention was to substitute one simple Code of Procedure for the various systems which had been in operation in the Supreme Court since the date of its establishment. \n16. Clause 37 of the Letters Patent of 1865, which deals with \"civil procedure and regulation of proceedings\", reads as follows:\n\"37. And we do further ordain that it shall be lawful for the said High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal, from time to time, to make rules and orders for the purpose of regulating all proceedings in civil cases which may be brought before the said High Court, including proceedings in its Admiralty, Vice-Admiralty, Testamentary, Intestate and Matrimonial Jurisdictions, respectively: Provided that the said High Court shall be guided in making such rules and orders as far as possible, by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, being an Act passed by the Governor- General in Council, and being Act No. VIII of 1859, and the provisions of any law which has been made Priya R. Soparkar 23 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc amending or altering the same, by competent legislative authority for India. \n\"(Letters Patent of the three High Courts, namely, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras are identically worded).\n17. The Code of Civil Procedure, 1877 (Act No. X of 1877), which received the assent of the Governor General on 30-3-1877, and was thereafter brought into force with effect from 1-10-1877, was \"an Act to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the procedure of the Court of Civil Judicature\". Part IX of this Act contained special rules relating to the Chartered High Courts. Chapter XL-VIII of the Act applied only to the Chartered High Courts. Section 632 of the Civil Procedure Code of 1877, in express words, provided: \"except as provided in this Chapter the provisions of this Court apply to such High Courts.\" Section 638 was the exception to the general rule and provided as under:\n\"The following portions of this Code shall not apply to the High Court in the exercise of its ordinary or extra- ordinary original civil jurisdiction, namely Sections 16 and 17, Sections 54, clauses (a) and (b), 57, 119, 160, 182 to 185 (both inclusive), 187, 189, 190, 191, 192 (so far as relates to the manner of taking evidence), 198 to 206 (both inclusive), 261, and so much of Section 409 as relates to the making of a memorandum; and Section 579 shall not apply to the High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. Nothing in this Code shall extend or apply to any High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction as an Insolvent Court.\"\n18. The Legislature recognized the special role assigned to the Chartered High Courts and exempted them from the application of several provisions of the Code in the exercise of their ordinary or extra-ordinary civil jurisdiction for the simple reason that those jurisdictions were governed by the procedure prescribed by the rules made in exercise of the powers of the Chartered High Courts under clause 37 of the Letters Patent. Interestingly, Section 652 of this Act Priya R. Soparkar 24 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc itself empowered the High Courts to make rules \"consistent with this Code to regulate any matter connected with the procedure of the Courts of Civil Judicature subject to its superintendence\", suggesting that consistency with the Code was a sine qua non only when making rules for the subordinate courts. \n19. The Code of Civil Procedure, 1882 (Act No. XIV of 1882) received the assent of the Governor General on 17-3-1882. It also contained Part IX dealing with special rules relating to the Chartered High Courts. Section 638 of this Code also exempted the Chartered High Courts in the exercise of their ordinary or extraordinary original civil jurisdiction from the application of the Code. Section 652 invested with the High Courts with power to make rules \"consistent with this Code to regulate any matter connected with its own procedure or the procedure of the Courts of Civil Judicature subject to its superintendence.\" \n(Emphasis ours). \n20. By an amendment made by Act No. XIII of 1895, Sections 632 and 652 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1882, were amended. Section 632, as amended by this Act, reads as under :Except as provided in this chapter and in Section 652 the provisions of this Code SC520 apply to such High Courts\"\nThe amendment made in Section 652 provides an apercu to the controversy. Section 652 was amended by adding the following \"Notwithstanding anything in this Code contained, any High Court established under the said Act for establishing High Courts of Judicature in India may make such Rules consistent with the Letters Patent establishing it to regulate its own procedure in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction as it shall think fit\" \"All such rules shall be published in the local official Gazette, and shall thereupon have the force of law.\"\n21. The reason for making this amendment is clarified in the Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the relevant Bill No. 13 of 1895 in the Priya R. Soparkar 25 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc following words : \"Section 652 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as it now stands, purports to require that any rules to regulate its own procedure made by the High Court, even although it be established by Royal Charter, shall be consistent with that Code. The Letters Patent of the High Courts at Fort William, Madras and Bombay, appear, however, to recognize the practical expediency of leaving such High Courts some latitude in the direction of adapting the provisions of the ordinary law to meet their requirements. It has been found by experience that these provisions are not in all respects convenient in the case of original proceedings in those Courts, and the object of this Bill is, by an amendment of Section 652 and, an ancillary amendment of Section 632, to bring the Code into perfect harmony with the provisions of those Letters Patent and to enable the High Courts referred to regulate the exercise of their original civil jurisdiction accordingly.\"\n22. Then we come to the 1908 Act, which made a drastic departure from the hitherto pattern of the Code. The Code was now divided into a fascicle of substantive sections and a Schedule containing Rules, which by force of Section 121 were declared to have effect as if enacted in the body of the Code until and or altered in accordance with the provisions of Part X of the CPC. \n23. Despite the sweeping change made by the 1908 Act, interestingly, the amendment introduced in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1882 by the Act No. XIII of 1895, which we have quoted above was retained in a slightly modified form in section 129.The Arguments:\n25. The learned counsel for the respondent, however, justifiably contends that the purpose of retaining Section 129 in the present form is exactly the purpose for which it was inserted, in the first place, in the CPC of 1882 by amending Act No. XIII of 1895, namely, \"to recognize the practical expediency of leaving such High Courts some latitude in the direction of adapting the provisions of the ordinary law to meet Priya R. Soparkar 26 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc their requirements\", and further, \"it had been found by experience that these provisions were not in all respects convenient in the case of original proceedings in those Courts.\" The amendment, therefore, became necessary \"to bring the Code into perfect harmony with the provisions of the Letters Patent and to enable the High Courts referred to to regulate the exercise of their original civil jurisdiction accordingly.\"\n26. It appears to us that this was the real reason why a distinction was drawn between the proceedings in original jurisdiction before the Chartered High Court and those in other Courts. For historical reasons this distinction was maintained right from the time the Letters Patent was issued, and has not been disturbed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, despite the amendments made in the CPC from 1976 to 2002. \n37. Taking into account the extrinsic evidence, i.e. the historical circumstances in which the precursor of Section 129 was introduced into the 1882 Code by a specific amendment made in 1895, we are of the view that the non obstante clause used in Section 129 is not merely declaratory, but indicative of Parliament's intention to prevent the application of the CPC in respect of civil proceedings on the Original Side of the High Courts. \n42. The Full Bench of the High Court of Calcutta in Manikchand v. Pratabmull AIR 1961 Cal 483 para 13 had occasion to consider this very contention with regard to clause 37 of the Letters Patent and observed:\n\".....The restriction upon the power of the Court as contained in the proviso to cl. 37 of the Letters Patent is that the rules framed under that clause should, \"as far as possible\" be in conformity with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. This restriction as the phrase \"as far as possible\" indicates is merely directory. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure are intended for the purpose of guidance of this Court in framing rules under Cl. 37 of the Letters Patent. Consequently, if any rule framed by the High Court under cl. 37 be Priya R. Soparkar 27 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc inconsistent with or confers any additional power besides what is granted by the Code of Civiil Procedure SC524 the rule framed under cl. 37 will prevail over the corresponding provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. This we think is the correct view to be taken in interpreting the words \"as far as possible\" in clause 37 of the Letters Patent. This interpretation would be consistent with the amplitude of the words used in Section 129 of the CPC by which the High Court is empowered to make rules \"not inconsistent with the Letters Patent to regulate its own procedure in the exercise of its original jurisdiction as it shall think fit.\"\n46. Finally, it was argued SC525 Mr. Jethmalani that the Letters Patent, and the rules made thereunder by the High Court for regulating its procedure on the Original Side, were subordinate legislation and, therefore, must give way to the superior legislation, namely, the substantive provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. There are two difficulties in accepting this argument. In the first place, Section 2(18) of the CPC defines \"rules\" to mean \"rules and forms contained in the First Schedule or made under section 122 or section 125\". The conspicuous absence of reference to the rules regulating the procedure to be followed on the Original Side of a Chartered High Court makes it clear that those rules are not \"rules as defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Secondly, it is not possible to accept the contention that the Letters Patent and rules made thereunder, which are recognized and specifically protected by section 129, are relegated to a subordinate status, as contended by the learned counsel. We might usefully refer to the observations of the Constitutional Bench of this Court in P. S. Santhappan (Dead) by L.Rs. v. Andhra Bank Ltd. and Ors. JT 2004(8) SC 464. With reference to Letters Patent, this is what the Constitution Bench said:\n148. It was next submitted that Clause 44 of the Letters Patent showed that Letters Patent were subject to amendment and alteration. It was submitted that this showed that a Letters Patent was a subordinate or subservient piece of law. Undoubtedly, Clause 44 Priya R. Soparkar 28 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc permits amendment or alteration of Letters Patent but then which legislation is not subject to amendment or alteration. CPC is also subject to amendments and alterations. In fact it has been amended on a number of occasions. The only unalterable provisions are the basic structure of our Constitution. Merely because there is a provision for amendment does not mean that, in the absence of an amendment or a contrary provision, the Letters Patent is to be ignored. To submit that a Letters Patent is a subordinate piece of legislation is to not understand the true nature of a Letters patent. As has been held in Vinita Khanolkar's case JT 1997 (9) SC 490 and Sharda Devi's case JT 2002 (3) SC 43 a Letters Patent is the charter of the High Court. As held in Shah Babulal Khimaji's case 1982 (1) SCR 187 a Letters Patent is the specific law under which a High Court derives its powers. It is not any subordinate piece of legislation. As set out in aforementioned two cases a Letters Patent cannot be excluded by implication. \nFurther it is settled law that between a special law and a general law the special law will always prevail. A Letters Patent is a special law for the concerned High Court. Civil Procedure Code is a general law applicable to all Courts. It is well settled law, that in the event of a conflict between a special law and a general law, the special law must always prevail. We see no conflict between Letters Patent and Section 104 but if there was any conflict between a Letters Patent and the Civil Procedure Code then the provisions of Letters Patent would always prevail unless there was a specific exclusion. This is also clear from Section 4 Civil Procedure Code which provides that nothing in the Code shall limit or affect any special law. As set out in Section 4 C.P.C. only a specific provision to the contrary can exclude the special law. The specific provision would be a provision like Section 100A.\"\n47. Far from doing away with the Letters Patent, the amending Act of 2002 has left unscathed the provisions of section 129 and what follows therefrom. The contention must, therefore, fail. \nPriya R. Soparkar 29 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc 48. In the result, we are of the view that no fault can be found with the impugned judgment of the High Court under appeal. There is no merit in the appeal and it is hereby dismissed. However, there shall be no order as to costs.\"\n22. No doubt as observed in the decision quoted above, that as far as the CPC is concerned, the Letters Patent pursuant to which the Bombay High Court Rules, 1980 have been made, is a special law for the concerned High Court and the CPC is a general law applicable to all Courts and that the provisions of the Bombay High Court Original Side Rules would prevail over the CPC. However what is firstly pertinent to note is that Section 129 of the CPC refers only to the Rules under Letters Patent and the CPC but not to the Commercial Court's Act, 2015. \n23. The Commercial Courts Act which was Act 4 of 2016 received the assent of the President on 31.12.2015 and was published in the Gazette of India Extraordinary, Pt-II, S.1 dated 01.01.2016. Thereafter it was amended by act 28 of 2018, S.3 and became the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of the High Courts Act, 2015 with retrospective effect from 3 rd May, 2018. As its preamble suggests the Commercial Courts Act is an Act for the constitution of commercial courts, commercial appellate courts, Priya R.

The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the initial Act 4 of 2016 and the Amendment Act 28 of 2018 suggests that the Commercial Courts Act was enacted to accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the Indian justice delivery system and the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation keeping in mind the increasingly competitive global economic environment and to attract business at the international level India, to further improve its ranking in the World Bank \"Doing Business\" Report which considered the dispute resolution environment in the country as one of the parameters for doing business and for speedy settlement of commercial disputes by widening the scope of the courts to deal with commercial disputes as tremendous economic development had ushered in enormous commercial activities in the country including foreign direct investments, public private partnership etc. prompting initiation of legislative measures and to facilitate ease of doing business to create a positive image amongst the investors about the strong and responsive legal system so that there is an early resolution of commercial disputes. \nPriya R.

The high value commercial disputes involve complex facts and question of law. Therefore, there is a need to provide for an independent mechanism for their early resolution. Early resolution of commercial disputes shall create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive Indian legal system. \n2. The Law Commissioner of India in its 188th Report had recommended the constitution of the Commercial Division in each High Court. Accordingly, the Commercial Division of High Courts Bill, 2009 was introduced and passed by the Lok Sabha. However, during the discussion of the aforesaid Bill in the Rajya Sabha, some Members raised certain issues and in view thereof, the matter was again referred to the Law Commission of India for its examination. The Law Commissioner of India, in its 253 rd Report, has recommended for the establishment of the Commercial Courts, the Commercial Division and the Commercial Appellate Divisions in the High Courts for disposal of commercial disputes of special value. \n3. Based on the recommendations of the Law Commission made in its 253rd Report, a Bill namely, the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 24th April, 2015 and the same is at present under the consideration of the Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice. As provided in the said Bill, 2015, all the suits, appeals or applications related to commercial disputes of specified value, i.e., one crore or above, are to be dealt with by the Commercial Courts or the Commercial Division of the High Court. \n4. By way of the Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act, 2015, the ordinary original jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court has been increased from rupees twenty lakhs to rupees two crore and there is a provision for transfer of pending case from the Delhi High Court to District Courts. \nPriya R. Soparkar 33 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc On the enactment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015, some fo the Commercial Disputes which are to be transferred to the District Courts from the Delhi High Court may again be required to be transferred to the Commercial Division of the High Court of Delhi. It would cause delay in the disposal of cases as well as inconvenience to the parties and counsels and may also result in confusion. Therefore, it became necessary that provisions of the Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act, 2015 and establishment of the Commercial Courts and Commercial Division of the High Courts maybe brought into force simultaneously. \n5. As Parliament was not in session and urgent steps were needed to be taken,t he Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division in High Courts Ordinance, 2015 was promulgated on 23 rd October, 2015. \n6. It is proposed to introduce the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015 to rep;ace the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Ordinance, 2015 which inter alia, provides for the following namely:-\n(i) constitution of the Commercial Courts at District level except for the territory over which any High Court is having ordinary original civil jurisdiction;\n(ii) constitution of the Commercial Divisions in those High Courts which are already exercising ordinary civil jurisdiction and they shall have territorial jurisdiction over such areas on which it has original jurisdiction;\n(iii) constitution of the Commercial Appellate Division in all the High Courts to hear the appeals against the Orders of the Commercial Courts and the Orders of the Commercial Division of the High Court;\n(iv) the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of such Commercial Courts and Commercial Division is proposed as one crore rupees; and Priya R.

The proposed Bill shall accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the Indian Justice delivery system, and the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation. \n8. The Bill seeks to replace the aforesaid Ordinance. Amendment Act 28 of 2018 - Statement of Objects and Reasons- The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 was enacted for the constitution of Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts for adjudicating commercial disputes of specified value and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\n2. The global economic environment has since become increasingly competitive and to attract business at international level, India needs to further improve its ranking in the World Bank \"Doing Business Report\" which, inter alia, considers the dispute resolution environment in the country as one of the parameters for doing business. Further the tremendous economic development has ushered in enormous commercial activities in the county including foreign direct investments, pubic private partnership, etc. which has prompted initiating legislative measures for speedy settlement of commercial disputes, widen the scope of the Courts to deal with commercial disputes and facilitate ease of doing business. Needless to say that early resolution of commercial disputes of even lesser value creates a positive image amongst the investors about the strong and responsive Indian legal system.

As Parliament was not in session and immediate action was required to be taken to make necessary amendments in the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015, to further improve India's ranking in the \"Doing Business Report\", the President promulgated the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 on 3rd May, 2018. \n4. It is proposed to introduce the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts (Amendment) Bill, 2018 to replace the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Court (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018, which inter alia, provides for the following namely:-\n(i) to reduce the specified value of commercial disputes from the existing one crore rupees to three lakh rupees, and to enable the parties to approach the lowest level of subordinate Courts fro speedy resolution of commercial disputes;\n(ii) to enable the State Governments, with respect to the High Courts having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, to constitute commercial courts at District Judge level and to specify such pecuniary value of commercial disputes which shall not be less than three lakh rupees and not more than the pecuniary jurisdiction of the district courts;\n(iii) to enable the Sate Governments, except the territories over which the High Courts have ordinary original civil jurisdiction, to designate such number of Commercial Appellate Courts at district judge level to exercise the appellate jurisdiction over the commercial courts below the district judge level;\n(iv) to enable the Sate Governments to specify such pecuniary value of a commercial dispute which shall not be less than three lakh rupees or such higher value, for the whole or part of the State; and (v) to provide fro compulsory mediation before institution of a suit, where no urgent interim relief is contemplated and for this purpose, to introduce the Pre-Institution Mediation Priya R. Soparkar 36 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc and Settlement Mechanism and to enable the Central Government to authorise the authorities constituted under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 for this purpose.\n5. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.\"\n27. Pursuant to the aforesaid, Chapter VI of the Commercial Courts Act entitled amendments to the provisions of the CPC which contains Section 16 providing for amendments to the CPC in its application to commercial disputes provides that the provisions of the CPC shall in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule and that the Commercial Division of the High Court and the Commercial Courts of the districts shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as amended by the Commercial Courts Act in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value. It is also provided in the said section that where any provision of any rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the CPC by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act shall prevail. Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act is usefully quoted as under:\"\n\"16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes.-- (1) The provisions of the Code of Civil Priya R. Soparkar 37 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule. \n(2) The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value. \n(3) Where any provision of any Rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail.\" \n28. It is therefore clear that in accordance with Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act, the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act shall prevail over any rule of the jurisdictional High Court, which in my view includes the Bombay High Court Original Side Rules and the Letters Patent. \n29. From the above elucidation it emerges that as far as the High Courts are concerned, Commercial Divisions are courts in the High Courts having Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction and are designated as such to try any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value. The Statement of Objects and Reasons as quoted above as well as Section 16 clearly provides that the provisions of the CPC shall in Priya R. Soparkar 38 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule. Clause IV (D) of the Schedule amends Order VIII in the First Schedule of the CPC by substituting the proviso in Rule I as under:\n\"(i) In Rule 1, for the proviso, the following proviso shall be substituted, namely:-\n\"Provided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.\"\n30. As noted above, the proviso clearly provides that if the Defendant has failed to file Written Statement within the 30 day period he shall be allowed to file the Written Statement on such other day as may be specified by the Court for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit but which shall not be later than 120 days from the date of service of Summons and that on the expiry of 120 days from the date of such service, the Defendant shall not only forfeit the right to file Written Statement but the Court shall also not allow the Written Statement to be taken on record. \nPriya R. Soparkar 39 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc 31. The aforementioned provision as can be seen from the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K. S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. And Ors.(supra) is mandatory and there is no way out of it. The proviso as applicable to Commercial Courts clearly mandates that no more than 90 days delay can be condoned by the Commercial Court and that too for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of costs and that there is a prohibition from allowing the Written Statement to be taken on record beyond such period as the Defendant forfeits the right to file the Written Statement upon the expiry of such period. In contradistinction to this, the proviso contained in the CPC as amended by Act 22 of 2002 but not amended pursuant to Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act is the proviso as applicable to any Suit not in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value but simply provides that if the Defendant fails to file the Written Statement within the period of 30 days he shall be allowed to file the same on a day as may be specified by the Court for reasons to be recorded in writing but which shall not be later than 90 days from the date of service of Summons. As can be seen that the mandatory and prohibitory language introduced in the proviso to Rule 1 of Order VIII as applicable to Suits in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value pursuant to Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act is not there. \nPriya R. Soparkar 40 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc 32. Therefore if the Suit is not a Suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value filed on the Original Side of the High Court having Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction then the proviso to Rule 1 of Order VIII of the CPC as amended by Act 22 of 2002 would apply with respect to the time limit for filing Written Statement and in respect whereof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kailash v. Nankhu and Others4 (supra) has held that the provision is directory and not mandatory. That in respect of such a Suit in view of the decision of this Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Iridium India Telecom Ltd. Vs. Motorola INC (supra), Rule 265 of the Bombay High Court Original Side Rules would be available to seek leave of the Court of the Judge in Chambers to file Written Statement beyond the limitation period. \n33. However, since as noted above sub-section (3) of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act clearly provides that the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act will prevail over any rule of the jurisdictional High Court, in my view the proviso in Rule I of Order VIII of the CPC as amended pursuant to Section 16(1) of the Commercial Courts Act clearly forfeiting the right of the Defendant to file Written Statement beyond the period of 120 days from the date of 4 (2005) 4 SCC 480. \nPriya R. Soparkar 41 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc service of Summons and prohibiting filing of Written Statement beyond that period making the proviso in Rule I of Order VIII of the CPC as amended pursuant to Section 16(1) of the Commercial Courts Act as applicable to a Suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value mandatory in nature, thereby to prevail even over the Bombay High Court Original Side Rules including Rule 265, the High Court at such time not merely exercising ordinary civil jurisdiction but acting as a commercial court to which the specially amended provisions of the CPC pursuant to Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act apply. It does not mean that the Letters Patent or the Bombay High Court Original Side Rules would not apply, but in the event of a conflict with any rule under the Original Side Rules, the provisions of the CPC as amended pursuant to the Commercial Courts Act would prevail. \n34. Further, Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act provides that the Commercial Courts Act has an overriding effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law. Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act is usefully quoted as under :\n\"21. Act to have overriding effect - Save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than this Act.\"\n(Emphasis supplied) Priya R. Soparkar 42 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc 35. It is clear from the above that notwithstanding anything inconsistent between the Commercial Courts Act and any other law, the Commercial Courts Act shall have an overriding effect. \n36. Even the decisions in the case of Iridium India Telecom Ltd. Vs. Motorola INC (supra) were concerned with the CPC Amendment of 2002, amending Order 8 Rule 1 and 10 and not with respect to the amendment to the CPC in its application to commercial disputes vide Act 4 of 2016 in its application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value where the amended proviso in contradistinction to the amendment of 2002, clearly provides that where the Defendant fails to file the written statement within a said period of 30 days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day as may be specified by the Court for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit but which shall not be later than 120 days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the Defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. Therefore although there can be no doubt about the principles laid down in Iridium India Telecom Ltd. Vs. Motorola INC Priya R. Soparkar 43 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc (supra), in my view the decision would not be applicable to the facts of this case as this is a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of specified value, which fact has not been disputed. \n37. Therefore, the Commercial Courts Act is a special statute for the purpose of providing for adjudicating commercial disputes of a specified value and the matters connected therewith and/or incidental thereto and applicable only to commercial disputes and commercial courts but not general law applicable to all disputes or all Courts. \n38. Ergo, considering settled law that between the special law and the general law, the special law will always prevail, I am of the view that the Commercial Courts Act will prevail over the Letters Patent and the High Court Original Side Rules, 1980 which prescribes the procedure for the original side of the High Court but not for Commercial Courts which is governed by the Commercial Courts Act. \n39. It has been argued that Rule 91 of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules which permits, with the leave of the Court and Judge in Chambers, filing of written statement where the Defendant has failed to file written statement within the time fixed in the writ of Priya R. Soparkar 44 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc summons has been deleted only on 23 rd March, 2022, whereas the 120 days' period ended much prior to that and even the chamber order was filed prior to that and even the decision on the chamber order is prior to the said deletion and therefore, this Court condone the delay and after setting aside orders dated 3 rd February, 2017 and 8th March, 2017 as well as order dated 4th September, 2017 rejecting the Chamber Order seeking setting aside of the transfer of the suit to the list of undefended Suits, allow the filing of the written statement by the Defendant. I am afraid that the said argument of the Applicants does not hold any water. At the outset, the said Rule would not apply to the case of the Applicants in as much as the said Rule is clearly applicable to the case if the suit has not been set down as an undefended suit against the Defendant. The suit had already been transferred to the list of undefended Suits on 8th March, 2017. Therefore Rule 91 in my view would not be applicable to the facts of this case. Even the chamber order for setting aside the order dated 8 th March, 2017 has been dismissed on 4th September, 2017, and the notice of motion had been filed on 11th October, 2017. Even otherwise, the amended proviso to Rule 1 of Order VIII has been inserted with retrospective effect from 23rd October, 2015, which is much prior to these dates and would apply to the facts of this case. Therefore, in my view, Rule 91 would not Priya R. Soparkar 45 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc apply to the case of the Applicants. That therefore, the fact that the said Rule came to be deleted only on 24 th March, 2022 would not be of any relevance or consequence. Moreover, Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act clearly provides that the Commercial Courts Act has an overriding effect and it is by virtue of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act that the provisions of the CPC apply to the suit in respect of a commercial dispute of specified value, it not being disputed that the suit in question is a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value. Also as observed the Commercial Courts Act being a special statute would prevail over the High Court (Original Side) Rules / Letters Patent. Therefore, also not only Rule 91 would not apply but even Rule 265 of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules which empowers the Court or a Judge in Chambers to enlarge or abridge the time will not be available to the Applicants. \n40. As noted above, in the case of M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K. S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. And Ors.(supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the amended proviso to Order 8 Rule 1 and 10 as applicable to suits relating to commercial disputes of a specified value under the Commercial Courts Act, has clearly observed that on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons on the Defendant, the Defendant shall forfeit the right to file Priya R. Soparkar 46 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc the written statement and the Court must not allow the written statement to be taken on record and that as a consequence the written statement of the Defendant cannot be taken on record beyond this period. Proviso to Rule 1 of Order VIII clearly prohibits any enlargement of time for filing of written statement beyond 120 days and the same being a special provision applying to Commercial Courts will prevail over the Bombay High Court Original Side Rules, 1980 as well as the Letters Patent, which as observed earlier would be overridden by the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. \n41. Further in view of the above discussion, the arguments of Mr. Palshikar, that the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K. S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. And Ors.(supra), arises from the decision of the Delhi High Court and does not consider the impact of the Letters Patent and the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules would not be relevant.\n42. Also the argument that the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K. S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. And Ors.(supra) has been rendered on 12th February, 2019 and that since the limitation and orders under consideration are prior to that date, the said decision would not apply Priya R. Soparkar 47 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc to the facts of this case is only stated to be rejected as being without any substance as it is settled law that any decision of the Supreme Court, unless stated in the decision itself to be effective from a particular date, is effective as if it had always been the law of the land. \n43. It is not in dispute that the suit is a Commercial Summary Suit and the Commercial Courts Act is applicable to the suit. That being the case, in accordance with Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act, the amended proviso to Rule 1 of Order VIII of the CPC which clearly provides that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the same on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit but which shall not be later than 120 days from the date of service of summons and on the expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the Defendant shall forfeit the right to file written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record and the said interpretation having been settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K. S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. And Ors.(supra) , it would not be possible to condone the delay of 231 days or 313 days in filing Priya R. Soparkar 48 of 50 25 coms 177-16 with nmcd 648-17 in coms 177-16-os-1.doc the Written Statement on behalf of the Applicants who are the Defendants in the Commercial Suit. \n44. Once it has been held that the period of 120 days from the date of service of writ of summons is sacrosanct in the sense that this Court does not have power to extend the delay beyond 90 days from the service of writ of summons and the Court cannot allow the written statement to be taken on record, then it is not necessary to consider any argument on sufficient cause or on any explanation proffered by the Applicants explaining the reason for the admitted delay beyond this period or on the bonafides of the Applicants and obviously it would not matter if the Applicants are the State or the constituents of the State or performing functions or duties relating to public projects such as the irrigation project as in the facts of this case.\n45. No fault can therefore be found with the order dated 3 rd February 2017, and the order dated 8th March 2017 transferring the suit against Defendants No.1 to 4 to the list of undefended suits for want of written statement as well as order dated 4 th September 2017 of the learned Prothonotary and Senior Master rejecting the Chamber Order taken out for setting aside order dated 8th March 2017. \nPriya R.

present appeal fao(comm) 54/2022, impugning an order dated 18.02.2022 (hereafter 'the impugned order'), passed by the learned commercial court, whereby the application filed by the respondent (hereafter 'plasto') under order 39 rule 1 and 2 of code of civil procedure, 1908 ('cpc') was allowed and the appellants application under order 39 rule 4 of the cpc was dismissed, thereby restraining the appellants from selling, soliciting, exporting, displaying, advertising, directly or indirectly or dealing in any manner in the impugned label/ trade dress colour scheme of the impugned marks. 2. appellant no. 1 (hereafter 'ganesh gouri') is a partnership firm engaged in the business of manufacturing an array of goods including plastic tanks, water tanks, pipes and fittings and other allied and cognate goods. the appellants claim to have adopted the trademark/label \"aqua plast\", \"gauri aqua plast\" in respect of the said goods including plastic tanks, water tanks, pipes and fittings etc. 3. plasto is part of the plasto group and claims to have adopted the trademark \"plasto\" for its business in the year 1981. 4. plasto had filed a suit before the learned commercial court [being cs (comm) 545/2021], inter alia, seeking permanent injunction, restraining infringement, passing off, delivery up and rendition of accounts etc., against ganesh gouri from using in any manner impugned label/ device/ colour scheme and in relation to their impugned goods and business of water storage tanks or any other trademark/label/artistic feature which is or which may be identical or deceptively similar to plasto's trademark / label / colour scheme being . 5. the learned commercial court by order dated 12.01.2022, passed an ex-parte injunction and appointed a local commissioner to seize goods and hand over the same to plasto on superdari. 6. there is a pre-existing history to the dispute. plasto had on an earlier occasion instituted a suit being trade mark suit no. 3/2018, before the court of the ad hoc district judge of the district court, nagpur for declaration, permanent and mandatory injunction, delivery up, damages etc., under the provisions of the trademarks act, 1999 (hereafter 'tm act') claiming that ganesh gouri's trademark / label being is deceptively similar to their trademark / label being . the said suit was settled and a compromise decree was passed in terms of the settlement on 30.11.2018. 7. in terms of the settlement, one of the agreed terms was that ganesh gouri will not use the mark 'plasto' or plasto's tagline /slogan 'plasto hai toh guarantee hai' or any other similar mark on any of their products, which are similar to plasto's goods. 8. in the present case the ex-parte ad-interim injunction was confirmed by the impugned order. 9. ganesh gouri claims to have started using the label \"aqua plast\" upon receipt of search certificate/no objection of copyright issued by the trades mark registry on 26.07.2021. 10. plasto filed a petition c.o.(comm.ipd-cr) 868/2022, under section 50 of the copyrights act, 1957 seeking cancellation of ganesh gouri's copyright registration a-142047/2022, on the ground that the said registration was in conflict with the terms of the settlement dated 30.11.2018, entered into between the parties in the nagpur suit. the said petition was dismissed by the learned single judge of this court by order dated 20.02.2023. 11. the competing marks/ labels are reproduced as under: the impugned order 12. the learned commercial court held that the earlier suit of the plaintiff in nagpur was separate and had no bearing on the subject suit. the learned judge emphasized that the prayer clauses in both the suits were entirely different, and that the present suit arises on the basis of a fresh cause of action. 13. consequently, the learned commercial court held that it was not incumbent on the plaintiff to file an execution petition or contempt petition in the same court which had disposed of the first case. the court held that it is not binding upon the parties to file all subsequent cases in the same court, which had earlier disposed of the first case. 14. the learned commercial court rejected the contention raised by ganesh gouri on the ground of forum shopping and held that there is a fresh cause of action for filing the present case and thus, it cannot be said that present suit is continuity to the earlier suit. it also held that it cannot be said that plasto / plaintiff has suppressed the fact that it did not get any ad-interim injunction during the pendency of nagpur suit since the said suit was a separate suit and has no bearing on the present case. 15. the learned commercial court held that since plasto / plaintiff had not explicitly pleaded that the impugned mark was registered, it could not be stated that plasto / plaintiff had falsely claimed registration of the mark in the plaint by using the symbol 'r' with the impugned mark to mislead the court. 16. the learned commercial court held that there was no doubt with respect to the its jurisdiction in the relation suit, since there was sufficient material on record to show the activities of plasto/plaintiff within its jurisdiction and also the sale of ganesh gouri/defendant's goods through the e-commerce website, indiamart. 17. the learned commercial court took note of the discrepancy in the dates from which the defendant claimed the usage of the mark in question in their affidavits filed in compliance of an earlier order dated 13.01.2021, their application under order 39 rule 4 of the cpc and their counter affidavit. submissions 18. the learned counsel for ganesh gouri submitted that it had sought no objection certificate from the trademark's registry qua their artistic work in the labels and had received the same on 26.07.2021, whereas plasto only received their no objection certificate on 30.07.2021 qua their marks, which was after the receipt of no objection certificate by ganesh gouri. 19. he submitted that the learned commercial court has erred in dismissing its application under order 39 rule 4 of the cpc and has failed to appreciate the facts while passing the impugned order. 20. he submitted that the present suit is nothing but an attempt of forum shopping since the present suit is inextricably linked to the prior nagpur suit. it is submitted that present suit is the second suit between the parties in relation to the alleged trademark infringement. the first suit was filed in april 2018, by plasto before the nagpur district court alleging infringement of its trademark 'plasto' and its tagline 'plasto hain toh guarantee hain' against ganesh gouri on account of their use of the mark 'aqua plast', along with the tagline 'naam hi guarantee main'. 21. he submitted that the first suit was settled vide settlement agreement dated 30.11.2018 wherein it was specifically recorded that plasto will not object to the use of the mark 'aqua plast' or any other mark consisting of the word 'plast' by ganesh gouri. however, ganesh gouri was to only refrain from using the mark 'plasto' or the taglines similar to that of 'plasto hain toh guarantee hain' or 'naam hi guarantee main'. 22. he submitted that having obtained a compromise decree from the court in nagpur, both parties being registered and carrying on business in nagpur, plasto's choice of delhi for filing its suit is ex facie an instance of forum shopping. 23. he submitted that plasto chose to file the present suit in delhi and not in nagpur, since it had failed to get any ad-interim or interim injunction from the said court. the reliance is placed on the judgements black diamond track parts private limited and others v. black diamond motors private limited: 2021 scc online del 2630 and cipla v. union of india: (2017) 5 scc 262. 24. he submitted that plasto invoked the jurisdiction of the learned commercial court under section 62(2) of the copyrights act, 1958 and section 134(2) of the tm act on the ground that it is carrying its business within the territorial limits of the concerned commercial court on account of its sales through e-commerce websites and through three authorised dealers based within the jurisdiction of the learned commercial court. 25. he submitted that the total amount of e-commerce sales within the territorial jurisdiction of the learned commercial court is only shown as ₹1500/and the two invoices issued by the dealers have no stamp / signatures and name of the buyers. he submitted that there is no averment in the plaint with respect to the physical sales within the local limits of the learned commercial court. 26. he submitted that the learned commercial court did not appreciate the judgement of the hon'ble apex court in the case of union of india and ors. v. cipla ltd. & anr., (2017) 5 scc 262, on the issue of forum shopping, for filing a suit with a similar cause of action, with some minor changes. 27. he submitted that despite apparent forum shopping and the contravened jurisdictional facts pleaded for invoking the jurisdiction of the learned commercial court, the learned commercial court upheld its jurisdiction to entertain the suit and has also granted interim injunction in favour of plasto/ plaintiff. 28. he submitted that ganesh gouri has suffered a lot since the learned commercial court while passing the ex parte ad-interim injunction appointed a local commissioner to seize the goods at the factory in nagpur and directed that the goods be handed over to plasto on superdari. he submitted that given the volume of goods involved, the local commissioner simply sealed the entire factory of ganesh gouri bringing the production of all goods, irrespective of whether they were infringing plasto's alleged rights, to a complete halt for 10 days and the same was only released after the intervention of this hon'ble court by order dated 28.01.2022 passed in fao (comm) 18/2022. 29. he submitted that the impugned order was passed reiterating and confirming the ad-interim injunction granted on 12.01.2022 suggesting pre-determination. he submitted that the learned commercial court while passing the impugned order has completely ignored the dicta laid down in indian performing rights society ltd. v. sanjay dalia & anr : 2014 scc online del 2031. he submitted that the alleged sales of plasto even if taken on the demurrer, are quantitively inadequate to support conclusion that plasto carries on its business within the territorial jurisdiction of the learned commercial court. he submitted that the same also fails the test laid down in the dhodha house v. s.k. maingi: (2006) 9 scc 41. 30. he submitted that the learned commercial court has mechanically relied upon the judgement of wwe inc. v. m/s reshma collection 2014 scc online del 2031, since in the facts of the present case plasto has its registered office in india, which is very unlike the facts of judgement of wwe inc. v. m/s reshma collection (supra). he submitted that plasto / plaintiff in the present case has no subordinate/ branch office within the territorial limits of the learned commercial court and therefore the reliance placed on the judgement of wwe inc. v. m/s reshma collection (supra) is misplaced in view of the subsequent judgements passed in cases of indian performing rights society ltd. v. sanjay dalia & anr (supra), ultra home construction pvt. ltd. v. purushottam kumar chaubey & ors. (2016) 227 dlt 320 and bigtree entertainment pvt ltd. v. saturday sunday media internet & ors. (2015) scc online del 142(17). 31. he submitted that a bare comparison of the competing labels, would show that the labels / marks are distinctive in nature. it is submitted that plasto had supressed the fact that ganesh gouri had already obtained a no objection certificate ('noc') from the copyright board at the time of the filing of the suit and since ganesh gouri had a valid registration, there cannot be a prima facie case of any infringement. 32. the learned counsel for plasto submitted that ganesh gouri's contention with respect to the forum shopping is baseless since plasto had disclosed the factum of the suit filed in nagpur in the plaint filed before the learned commercial court and that, the said suit was decreed in favour of plasto. 33. he submitted that the present suit was filed before the learned commercial court based on a fresh cause of action, since the mark/ label in question is different from the mark/label which was subject matter of challenge before the nagpur court. 34. he submitted that the jurisdiction of the learned commercial court was rightly invoked since ganesh gouri had been making sales and supplying its goods with the impugned mark/ label to the dealers and distributors in the market located within the jurisdiction of the learned commercial court. 35. he submitted that while deciding the issue of jurisdiction, the court has to see only the averments made in the plaint and, in the present case, there is a specific averment made in the plaint conferring the territorial jurisdiction on the learned commercial court. he submitted that, in the plaint, it was also claimed that the authorized dealers of plasto are carrying their business within the jurisdiction of the learned commercial court. 36. he submitted that plasto is also carrying its business through various e-commerce websites/ online platforms like amazon.com, trade india, india mart, and through its own interactive website. 37. he submitted that ganesh gouri itself had applied for the registration of the impugned mark 'gouri aquaplast' in identical label/ traderess bearing no. 4833690 in class i and 4833691 in class xi of the tm act and, therefore, the argument that the traderess/ label being used by ganesh gouri is common to trade is baseless. 38. he submitted that plasto is the prior adopter, prior user and prior registered proprietor of the label / copyright. he submitted that plasto has placed on record various documents in order to show its prior adoption, use and its registrations. he submitted that as per the own admission of ganesh gouri, they are the subsequent adopter of the impugned trade dress / colour combination. 39. he submitted that ganesh gouri itself has made contradictory claim of adoption and user of the impugned label/colour combination. he submitted that in the affidavit dated 15.01.2021, ganesh gouri, claimed that it had adopted the impugned label/colour combination in july/august 2021, whereas in earlier appeal fao (comm) no.18 of 2022, ganesh gouri had contended that it had adopted the impugned label in august 2019. he submitted that in the suit proceedings, ganesh gouri had appeared, and willingly gave an undertaking that it would not use the impugned label/trade dress/colour combination. conclusion maintainability of suit in delhi 40. ganesh gouri contended that since plasto had earlier filed a suit in nagpur therefore the present suit in not maintainable in delhi and the learned trial court has erred in entertaining the suit. 41. it is submitted that since both ganesh gouri and plasto have their registered offices in nagpur and plasto has shown sales only through its dealers and online through its website. 42. it is the submission of ganesh gouri that the present suit is inextricably linked to the earlier suit filed before the court at nagpur and thus the present suit by plasto is only an act of forum shopping in order to obtain a favourable relief. 43. we are unable to agree with the contention of the appellants. 44. it is trite that whenever there is a fresh cause of action, a fresh suit would lie. in the case of allied blenders and distillers pvt. ltd. v. amit dahanukar : (2019) 261 dlt 692, wherein there were two suits one before the bombay high court and a subsequent suit before the delhi high court while the issue of infringement of a registered trademark was not raised before the bombay high court in the first suit, therefore, the second suit was maintainable before the delhi high court, yet the delhi high court showed deference to the orders in the first suit and rejected the injunction application. 45. however, it is pertinent to mention that in allied blenders and distillers pvt. ltd. v. amit dahanukar (supra) case, the appeal against the interim injunction was pending before the bombay high court. the delhi high court, thus, in deference to the orders of the bombay high court, rejected the injunction application. 46. in the present case, however, not only does the earlier suit before the court at nagpur pertain to a different cause of action but the same has also been settled. a compromise decree was passed in terms of the settlement on 30.11.2018. as per the settlement, it was agreed that ganesh gouri will not use the mark 'plasto' or plasto's tagline /slogan 'plasto hai toh guarantee hai' or any other mark similar to plasto on any of their products which are similar to that of plasto's. by way of the present suit before the commercial court, plasto is seeking permanent injunction, restraining infringement, passing off, delivery up, and rendition of accounts etc., against ganesh gouri's from using in any manner in impugned label/ device/ colour scheme and in relation to their impugned goods and business of water storage tanks or any other trademark/label/artistic feature which is or which may be identical or deceptively similar to plasto's mark. the present suit, therefore, is based on a fresh cause of action. 47. the competing marks for which the suit in nagpur was filed are reproduced as under : 48. the competing marks for which the present suit is filed are reproduced as under: 49. it is the contention of ganesh gouri that plasto should have filed the present suit before the courts at nagpur, where the earlier suit was instituted. however, we are of the opinion that merely because a court has considered and decided the earlier suit does not mean that all subsequent cases too would necessarily have to be filed before the same court. a fresh cause of action entitles a party to institute proceedings and both the parties are free to proceed against each other in any court of law that has jurisdiction to hear such dispute. it is also pertinent to note that plasto had disclosed the fact of filing earlier suit before the court at nagpur in the present suit before the learned commercial court and had also placed the settlement deed on record. 50. it is true that in a given case, the test of safe distance rule may be applicable if after being interdicted from using a mark, the defendant makes only insubstantial changes to technically comply with the order. in such case, the party in whose favour the injunction is granted can institute proceedings for violation of the order. however, the safe distance rule does not bar the plaintiff from filing a fresh suit. 51. in view of the same, this court is of the opinion that the present proceedings cannot be held to be barred. in that light, we are in agreement with the view of the learned commercial court and do not find any ground to interfere with the same. 52. the other question to be decided is whether the commercial court at delhi has the territorial jurisdiction to hear the suit. 53. a division bench of this court in kamdhenu dreamz and another v. dina iron and steel ltd : 2024 scc online del 670 while placing reliance on allied blenders and distillers pvt. ltd. v. amit dahanukar (supra) reiterated that the considerations regarding territorial jurisdiction in the context of order vii rule 10 of the cpc are different from those under order xxxix rules 1 & 2 of the cpc as under: \"23. we must make it clear that the considerations with regard to territorial jurisdiction in the context of order vii rule 10, cpc are entirely different from those in the context of an application under order xxxix rules 1 & 2, cpc or in the context of an issue framed in the suit with regard to territorial jurisdiction. while in the backdrop of order vii rule 10, it is only the averments contained in the plaint that have to be seen in the case of an application for the grant of interim relief under order xxxix rules 1&2, the contentions of the defendant in the reply to this application as also those contained in the written statement are required to be examined to arrive at a prima facie view. so, while in the case of an order vii rule 10 cpc application, the issue of jurisdiction is decided on the basis of what is stated in the plaint and, that too, after assuming the statements to be correct, an application under order xxxix rules 1&2, cpc requires the examination of the contentions of the defendants that may be contained in the written statement and/or the reply to the application as also the other material which may be placed by the defendant before the court. here, there is no question of considering the pleas of the plaintiff by way of a demurrer. furthermore, the standards would be higher when an issue with regard to territorial jurisdiction is to be finally decided in the course of trial of the suit. thus, while for the purposes of an examination under order vii rule 10, cpc, the court may come to the conclusion that it has territorial jurisdiction, this would not come in the way of the defendant in raising a question as to territorial jurisdiction, both when the issue of temporary injunction under order xxxix rules 1 & 2, cpc is being considered and when an issue as to territorial jurisdiction is being decided in the course of trial of the suit.\" 54. further, a division bench of this court in wwe inc. v. m/s reshma collection (supra) observed as under: 21. \".because of the advancements in technology and the rapid growth of new models of conducting business over the internet, it is possible for an entity to have a virtual presence in a place which is located at a distance from the place where it has a physical presence. the availability of transactions through the website at a particular place is virtually the same thing as a seller having shops in that place in the physical world. let us assume for the sake of argument that the appellant/plaintiff had a shop in delhi from where it sold its various goods and services. in that case, it could not be denied that the plaintiff carried on business in delhi. this is apart from the fact that the appellant/plaintiff may also have been regarded as having voluntarily resided in delhi. when the shop in the 'physical sense' is replaced by the 'virtual' shop because of the advancement of technology, in our view, it cannot be said that the appellant/plaintiff would not carry on business in delhi.\" 55. further, in v. guard industries ltd. v. sukan raj jain and another : 2021 scc online del 3625, the learned single judge of this court while dealing with the question of jurisdiction with respect to section 20 of the cpc and section 134 of the tm act observed as under: \"36. if under section 20 cpc, jurisdiction of the court is attracted by virtue of location of the defendant's place of business or from where the defendant is carrying on its business or working for gain, under section 134 of the trade marks act, it is the plaintiff's office location or from where he is carrying on business, is a material factor. however, in iprs (sc) (supra), the occurrence of cause of action has been read into section 134 of the trade marks act, as a determining factor, even though not spelt out in the language, on the lines of section 20 cpc. therefore, if some part of cause of action has arisen at a place where the plaintiff has its branch/subordinate office, courts at that place will have jurisdiction to entertain a suit against infringement and passing off. in other words, the occurrence of cause of action or any part thereof, at a place, is held to be a determining factor, both under section 20 cpc, and section 134 of the trade marks act, to attract jurisdiction of the court at such place.\" 56. it is well settled that while deciding the issue of jurisdiction in an application under order xxxix rules 1 & 2 of the cpc, the standard would be higher in as much as an examination of contentions of defendants in the written statement and/or reply to the application as well as other material placed before the court would also be required. 57. further, given the advancement in technology, having a virtual business presence in a jurisdiction would be akin to having a physical presence, as was also observed by a division bench of this court in wwe inc. v. m/s reshma collection (supra). plasto / plaintiff has specifically pleaded that its goods are manufactured in india and are sold, marketed, distributed all across the country, and are also exported world-wide through its interactive website and other ecommerce platforms. further, in the plaint, it is also stated that plasto / plaintiff is selling its goods, within the territorial jurisdiction of the learned commercial court, through its various dealers / distributors namely, m/s sunita sanitary, a. narula sanitary traders, and m/s bajaj traders. given the specific averment that plasto has physical and virtual business presence in the jurisdiction of the commercial court through e-commerce websites online platforms like amazon.com, trade india, india mart, and through its own interactive website coupled with the averments made in the plaint regarding jurisdiction, we do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned order of the learned commercial court in this regard. deceptive similarity 58. the learned commercial court in the impugned order has noted that all though plasto has not been able to make a case for passing off, but had made out a case for grant of interim injunction in respect of infringement of its copyrights in artistic work involved in its registered trademark/ device/ label /trade dress / colour scheme. 59. the infringement action is governed by section 29 of the tm act. in terms thereof, the plaintiff alleging infringement has to establish that the mark used by the defendant is identical or similar to its registered trademark and is being used on goods or services which are also identical or similar. it is presumed that if the identical or similar mark is used on identical or similar goods, the same is likely to cause confusion on the part of consumer public. 60. section 29 of the tm act reads as under: \" 29. infringement of registered trade marks \"(1) a registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which is identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark. (2) a registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which because of-a. its identity with the registered trade mark and the similarity of the goods or services covered by such registered trade mark; or b. its similarity to the registered trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by such registered trade mark; or c. its identity with the registered trade mark and the identity of the goods or services covered by such registered trade mark, is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public, or which is likely to have an association with the registered trade mark. (3) in any case falling under clause (c) of sub-section (2),the court shall presume that it is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public. (4) a registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which a. is identical with or similar to the registered trade mark; and b. is used in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the trade mark is registered; and c. the registered trade mark has a reputation in india and the use of the mark without due cause takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute of the registered trade mark. (5) a registered trade mark is infringed by a person if he uses such registered trade mark, as his trade name or part of his trade name, or name of his business concern or part of the name, of his business concern dealing in goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. (6) for the purposes of this section, a person uses a registered mark, if, in particular, he(a) affixes it to goods or the packaging thereof; (b) offers or exposes goods for sale, puts them on the market, or stocks them for those purposes under the registered trade mark, or offers or supplies services under the registered trade mark; (c) imports or exports goods under the mark; or (d) uses the registered trade mark on business papers or in advertising. (7) a registered trade mark is infringed by a person who applies such registered trade mark to a material intended to be used for labelling or packaging goods, as a business paper, or for advertising goods or services, provided such person, when he applied the mark, knew or had reason to believe that the application of the mark was not duly authorised by the proprietor or a licensee. (8) a registered trade mark is infringed by any advertising of that trade mark if such advertising-(a) takes unfair advantage of and is contrary to honest practices in industrial or commercial matters; or (b) is detrimental to its distinctive character; or (c) is against the reputation of the trade mark. (9) where the distinctive elements of a registered trade mark consist of or include words, the trade mark may be infringed by the spoken use of those words as well as by their visual representation and reference in this section to the use of a mark shall be construed accordingly.\" 61. it is clear that to establish a case of infringement of a registered trademark under section 29(2) of the tm act, it is to be established that the mark used by the defendant is not only identical or similar to the registered trademark but also that the goods and services, on which the defendant is using its mark, are also identical or similar, which is likely to cause confusion on the part of the general public or is likely to have an association with the registered trademark. 62. in the present case, it is not in dispute that the competing marks are used on the similar products, that are, water tanks and other plumbing allied goods. the very fact that the impugned marks are being used on similar types of goods is not sufficient to presume that there is likelihood of confusion unless the marks are identical or similar. 63. it is settled that in any action for the infringement of the trademarks, the question of similarity of the two marks is to be addressed first. the hon'ble apex court, in the case of amritdhara pharmacy v. satya deo gupta : air 1963 sc 449, has held as under: \"you must take the two words. you must judge them, both by their look and by their sound. you must consider the goods to which they are to be applied. you must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods. in fact you must consider all the surrounding circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade-marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods of the respective owners of the marks.\" 64. in relation to the infringement actions where the competing marks are composite logos, it has been held that the mark has to be seen as a whole. the overall mark without minutely comparing the similarities or dissimilarities has to be considered. the test, therefore, when the competing marks are words, is to some extent different when the marks are logos. in the case of logos, the test is that the rival mark should bear a very close resemblance when seen as a whole. therefore, the test is not that one feature of the logo is similar or identical to one feature of the competing mark but the mark as a whole should be similar or identical. the court has to consider the overall presentation of the two marks. 65. it has also been held in several decisions that it is not right to take a portion of the mark and compare it with the corresponding portion of the competing mark. the appropriate test is whether the totality of the alleged infringing trademark is such, that it is likely to cause deception or confusion in the minds of the persons accustomed to the existing trademark. 66. it is also settled that the question whether there is any deceptive similarity between the two marks is to be determined by examining the marks as a whole. the conflicting marks are to be compared by looking at them in its entirety, rather than breaking the marks into parts for a comparison. it is though permissible, to give importance to the dominant feature of the composite mark. the examination of the dominant part of the trademark for the purpose comparing it with the conflicting mark is for determining whether the marks are deceptively similar when viewed as a whole. therefore, it is not permissible to hold a mark as deceptively similar by examining a portion of the mark and comparing it with the portion of another mark when the composite marks, when viewed as a whole, are dissimilar. 67. this court in a recent decision in the case of vasundhra jewellers pvt. ltd. v. kirat vinodbhai jadvani & anr. : 2022:delhi high court:4255-db, has held as under: \"31. in pinto v. badman: (8) rpc (181), lord esher had observed that \"the truth is that the label does not consist of each particular part of it, but consists of the combination of them all\". in registrar of trade marks v. ashok chandra rakhit ltd: air 1955 sc 558, the supreme court had referred to the aforesaid observation and held as under:\"14. it is true that where a distinctive label is registered as a whole, such registration cannot possibly give any exclusive statutory right to the proprietor of the trade mark to the use of any particular word or name contained therein apart from the mark as a whole.\" 32. it is well settled that a composite trademark or label trademark is not required to be dissected to determine whether there is any deceptive similarity with another trademark. the question whether there is any deceptive similarity between two trademarks has to be ascertained by examining the marks in question as a whole. in south india beverages india private limited v. general mills marketing inc: 2014 scc online del 1953, the division bench of this court had explained the 'anti-dissection rule' in some detail. the court reiterated that \"conflicting composite marks are to be compared by looking at them as a whole, rather than breaking the marks up into their components parts for comparison\". however, the court had also observed that \"while a mark is to be considered in entirety, yet it is impermissible to accord more or less importance or 'dominance' to a particular portion or element of a mark in cases of composite marks\". 33. having stated the above, it is also necessary to bear in mind that examining the dominant part of the trademark for comparing it with the conflicting mark is solely for the purpose of determining whether competing marks are deceptively similar when viewed as a whole. it is, thus, not permissible to hold that two competing marks are deceptively similar by examining a portion of one mark and comparing it with the portion of another mark, if the composite marks viewed as a whole are dissimilar. it is relevant to refer to the text from mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition, which explains the said principle as under:\"23.15 comparing marks : differences v. similarities [1] the anti-dissection rule [a] compare composites as a whole : conflicting composite marks are to be compared by looking at them as a whole, rather than breaking the marks up into their component parts for comparison. this is the \"anti dissection\" rule. the rationale for the rule is that the commercial impression of a composite trademark on an ordinary prospective buyer is created by the mark as a whole, not by its component parts. however, it is not a violation of the antidissection rule to view the component parts of conflicting composite marks as a preliminary step on the way to an ultimate determination of probable customer reaction to the conflicting composites as a whole. thus, conflicting marks must be compared in their entireties. a mark should not be dissected or split up into its component parts and each part then compared with corresponding parts of the conflicting mark to determine the likelihood of confusion. it is the impression that the mark as a whole creates on the average reasonably prudent buyer and not the parts thereof, that is important. as the supreme court observed: \"the commercial impression of a trademark is derived from it as a whole, not from its elements separated and considered in detail. for this reason it should be considered in its entirety.\" the anti-dissection rule is based upon a common sense observation of customer behavior : the typical shopper does not retain all of the individual details of a composite mark in his or her mind, but retains only an overall, general impression created by the composite as a whole. it is the overall impression created by the mark from the ordinary shopper's cursory observation in the marketplace that will or will not lead to a likelihood of confusion, not the impression created from a meticulous comparison as expressed in carefully weighed analysis in legal briefs. in litigation over the alleged similarity of marks, the owner will emphasize the similarities and the alleged infringer will emphasize the differences. the point is that the two marks should not be examined with a microscope to find the differences, for this is not the way the average purchaser views the marks. to the average buyer, the points of similarity are more important that minor points of difference. a court should not engage in \"technical gymnastics\" in an attempt to find some minor differences between conflicting marks. however, where there are both similarities and differences in the marks, there must be weighed against one another to see which predominate. the rationale of the anti-dissection rule is based upon this assumption: \"an average purchaser does not retain all the details of a mark, but rather the mental impression of the mark creates in its totality. it has been held to be a violation of the antidissection rule to focus upon the \"prominent\" feature of a mark and decide likely confusion solely upon that feature, ignoring all other elements of the mark. similarly, it is improper to find that one portion of a composite mark has no trademark significance, leading to a direct comparison between only that which remains.\" (emphasis supplied) 68. the question is to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection for whom the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the two marks is likely to cause confusion. 69. there is no dispute that the question as to whether there is any deceptive similarity between the competing marks, which are not identical, is to be determined by comparing the competing marks as a whole to discern that any similarity in the mark(s) in question is likely to cause confusion or deceive a reasonable man [ref: kaviraj pandit durga dutt sharma v. navaratna pharmaceutical laboratories: (1965) 1 scr 737]. 70. at the same time, it is permissible to determine a prominent essential feature of the mark to see whether the same is deceptively similar to the prominent essential feature of the competing mark. it is though not clear from the impugned order, but as argued by the learned counsel for plasto, the word 'plast' appearing in both the marks is considered as an essential and significant feature of the mark of plasto / plaintiff. however, the learned commercial court, in our opinion, erred in holding that the impugned mark/ label of ganesh gouri / defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to the essential feature of the plaintiff's / plasto's mark. 71. in the present case, the injunction passed by the learned commercial court against use of the labels of ganesh gouri, being and , for being similar to that of the label of plasto, being , is completely misplaced. 72. in the present case, as discussed above, the learned commercial court fell into error by granting an injunction in favour of plasto merely on the basis of certain common factors even though the labels of the parties are clearly distinctive in nature when seen as a whole. 73. on a bare perusal of the labels, it can be said that there is no commonality in the labels apart from the background colour being blue and the font colour being white and the appearance of the word \"plast\" and \"plasto\" in the labels. 74. the labels, when compared as whole, can be said to be distinctive of each other as the mark of ganesh gouri bears the mark of 'g' with a hand symbol as its prominent mark whereas the label of plasto has the word 'plasto' in a particular font as its prominent feature. 75. as noted above, the only common feature in both the works is the word \"plast\" which is admittedly a derivative of the word plastic. ganesh gouri uses a prefix \"aqua\" with \"plast\". the mark also contains a graphical representation or alphabet 'g' which is styled as \"okay\" in a hand gesture enclosed with three wavering lines indicating liquid. it also shows the word \"gouri\" and a tagline \"naam hi kaafi hai\" in hindi with additional words being \"tanks, pipe and fitting\". the same cannot be called as a colourable imitation or substantial reproduction of the mark. . 76. the appellant is not using the word 'plast' as a sole mark but the same is accompanied with other essential features. it is also not denied that pursuant to the settlement arrived between the parties in the earlier suit filed before the nagpur court, plasto /plaintiff had undertaken not to take any objection for the registration of any mark, logo or word by the appellant consisting of the word 'plast' or the use of the mark 'aqua plast'. the relevant terms of the settlement dated 21.02.2019 are set out below: \"d. the plaintiffs agrees that it would have no issue if the defendant wishes to use the mark \"aqua plast\" device/logo and/or wither word per se or in any other representation which is neither identical nor deceptively similar to the said trademark/label of the plaintiff in the course of its business. e. that the plaintiff undertakes not to take any objection for registration of any mark logo/ word by defendant consisting of the word \"plast\" if the same is not infringing the logo/ word/ mark of the plaintiff in any whatsoever, and if any such objection is already raised than the same shall be withdrawn by the plaintiff forthwith.\" 77. thus, when admittedly plasto / respondent had no objection on the appellant / ganesh gouri using the word 'plast' or 'aqua plast' in its logo / mark, no interim injunction can be sought alleging infringement when the said words are used in conjunction with other features. 78. the other ground on which the objection in regard to use of the impugned label by the appellant is taken is the background colour being used in both the competing marks, that is, sky blue and font colour being white. a person cannot claim monopoly on use of a colour unless, the same used in a particular configuration with attended features has acquired secondary meaning and serves as a source identifier for the purpose of protection and registration. the marks with 'blue' colour background are used in relation to water tanks. it is a common knowledge that 'blue' is a colour often associated with water. 79. the test in the present case would be to see the mark as a whole and as noted above, the only common feature in both the marks is the appearance of the word 'plast' which admittedly, is a derivative of 'plastic' of which the products of both the parties are made of. the mark, therefore, when seen as a whole even with the common background colour, cannot be considered as similar so as to cause confusion in the mind of the consumer. moreover, no evidence has been placed on record to prima facie indicate that the consumer public has been confused in any manner by the use of the impugned label by the appellant. the same would be tested after evidence is led. 80. the pictorial device used by ganesh gouri, therefore, prima facie, cannot be held to be similar to plasto's pictorial device. thus, prima facie, plasto's trademark is not infringed under the provisions of section 29 of the tm act. 81. there is no cavil as to the principles laid down by the hon'ble courts in the judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent. the same, however, in our opinion, are not applicable to the facts of the present case. the judgements are passed in relation to the marks which are in dispute in the said cases, however, it is well settled that the trademark is to be looked at its entirety. 82. it is well settled that an appellate court would normally not interfere with the prima facie view of the learned trial court unless it finds that the trial court has exercised the jurisdiction arbitrarily, capriciously or in ignorance of the settled principle of law. in this case, we find that the learned commercial court has erred in finding that the competing marks / labels are similar and plasto's trademarks are infringed merely on the on the basis of appearance of parts of those marks, without considering the overall commercial impression of the competing marks. 83. it is true that the court, while hearing an appeal against an interim order ought not to disturb the prima facie findings, however, the appellate court can substitute its own discretion when it is found that the trial court has exercised the jurisdiction arbitrarily, capriciously or in ignorance of settled principles of law relating to grant of injunction. in the present case, the learned commercial court, in our opinion, has not followed the settled principles of law relating to the grant of injunction and the law in relation to infringement when it relates to a mark / label containing a pictorial device. 84. in view of the above, we are of the opinion that the learned commercial court erred in holding that ganesh gouri's mark / label is deceptively similar to that of plasto's mark / label, by comparing features of a part of a device mark without reviewing the overall commercial impression of the impugned mark(s) / label(s). 85. in view of the above, the impugned judgment is set aside. 86. we make it clear that the observations made in the present order are only, prima facie, for the purpose of deciding the present appeal against the impugned order passed in the application under order xxxix rule 39 (1) & (2) of the cpc. amit
