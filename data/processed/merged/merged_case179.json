The petitioner assails order dated 15.5.2023, passed by learned Commercial Court, Ludhiana, vide which a petition filed by the petitioner under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter, referred to, in short, as 'the Act'), has been returned back to the petitioner, after 5 years of its institution on the ground that the Court at Ludhiana has no territorial jurisdiction and that the same is to filed in the Courts at Delhi.\n2. A few facts, necessary to notice are that the respondent is owner of a plot situated in Ludhiana which he had leased out in favour of the petitioner. A 'Memorandum of Agreed Terms' (Moat) dated 28.2.2008 (Annexure P-1) Cr-6898-2023 (O&M) (2) 2024:Phhc:004418 with regard to said lease was executed at Ludhiana. The said Moat provided for resolution of disputes by way of arbitration. The relevant extract from Moat, pertaining to arbitration reads as under:\nArbitration:\nIn case of any disputes and differences arising out of the Lease, between the Lessor and the Lessee shall be settled mutually between the Parties, failing which the same shall be settled by arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or the then prevailing Arbitration laws. \nThe venue for arbitration shall be at Delhi and the proceedings shall be conducted in English only. \n3. A perusal of aforesaid arbitration clause reveals that it is only the 'venue' of arbitration which had been agreed upon by the parties in the Moat (Annexure P-1) and no 'seat' of arbitration was specifically or impliedly designated by the parties. \n4. Some relevant development which took place ever since a dispute arose amongst the parties are stated herein-under, chronologically:\n11.09.2009 : Respondent filed a petition under Section 11 of the Act in this Court (Annexure P-8).\n16.11.2010 : High Court ordered for appointment of an Arbitrator (Annexure P-10). \n27.03.2017 : A 'Majority Award' (Annexure P-11) was passed by two arbitrators against the petitioner whereas 'Minority Award' (Annexure P-12) by one arbitrator was passed in favour of the petitioner. However, there was no determination of seat by the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 20 (2) of the Act. \n                 Cr-6898-2023 (O&M)                      (3)                2024 : Phhc:004418 \n\n                30.5.2017 :     Although, the Majority Award was in favour of the\nrespondent, yet the respondent filed a petition under Section 34 of the Act before the Commercial Court at Ludhiana, i.e. Arbitration Case No. 1855 of 30.5.2017 (Annexure P-13) so as to seek some enhancement by way of modification of majority award. \n3.7.2017 : The petitioner also filed a petition under Section 34 of the Act before the Commercial Court at Ludhiana, i.e. Arbitration Case No. 1859 of 3.7.2017 (Annexure P-14) seeking setting aside of the Majority Award. Petitioner categorically mentioned therein that Ludhiana Court has the jurisdiction. \n11.07.2018 : Respondent filed his reply dated 11.7.2018 (Annexure P-16) to the petition under Section 34 of the Act filed by petitioner at Ludhiana. In reply to para 19 of the petition regarding jurisdiction at Ludhiana, the respondent did not specifically deny the aver ments regarding jurisdiction but simply replied that the same is a matter of record. \n12.03.2022 : The respondent filed an application for execution of the Majority Award vide Execution Application No. 501 of 2022 (Annexure P-17) in the Court at Ludhiana. \n14.05.2022 : Respondent unconditionally withdrew 'Arbitration Case No. 1855 of 2017' by simply stating that he does not wish to pursue 'modification' of the award, as is evident from order dated 14.5.2022 (Annexure P-18). \n28.09.2022 : Subsequently, an application dated 28.9.2022 (Annexure P-19) under Section 151 CPC was filed by respondent seeking dismissal of objection petition filed by the petitioner under Section 34 of the Act, on the ground that the Court at Ludhiana does not have jurisdiction to entertain the matter. \n                 CR-6898-2023 (O&M)                          (4)               2024: PHHC:004418                 15.05.2023 :        The aforesaid application (Annexure P-19) filed by respondent was allowed vide order dated 15.5.2023 (Annexure P-23) by the Commercial Court, Ludhiana, while holding that the Court at Ludhiana does not have jurisdiction and that the Courts at Delhi have the exclusive jurisdiction. The petition was accordingly returned back. \n5. The learned counsel for the petitioner, while assailing the impugned order dated 15.5.2023, made the following submissions:\n(i) that the Commercial Court, Ludhiana fell in error in relying upon the view taken by Hon'ble Supreme Court in BGS SGS Soma JV v.\nNHPC Limited, (2020) 4 SCC 234, so as to hold that the venue of arbitration as designated in agreement defines absolutely the seat as well whereas the said judgment has been read down in a subsequent judgment by a Bench of equal strength of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mankastu Impex Private Limited Vs. Airvisual Limited (2020) 5 SCC 399;\n(ii) that Mankastu's case (supra) virtually reiterates the view taken earlier by a three Judges Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India vs. Hardy Exploration and Production (2019) 13 SCC 472 to the effect that venue of arbitration cannot be treated as seat;\n(iii) that the respondent is estopped from raising the plea that Court at Ludhiana lacks jurisdiction as he himself has admitted in his pleadings that Court at Ludhiana does have jurisdiction and which otherwise also stands established by his conduct. The learned counsel, in order to hammer forth his aforesaid submission placed CR-6898-2023 (O&M) (5) 2024:PHHC:004418 reliance upon Mankastu's case (supra) to contend that conduct of the parties is a defining factor in determining seat of arbitration;\n(iv) that the Commercial Court, Ludhiana also fell in error in relying upon BBR (India) Private Limited v. S.P. Singla Constructions Private Limited,(2023)1 SCC 693, as the facts of the said case were entirely different and the issue involved was mainly with regard to a situation wherein the venue of arbitration is shifted pursuant to recusal of previous arbitrator and that it was under these circumstances it was held therein that the 'seat' which stood fixed previously could not be changed upon shifting of venue of arbitration. \n6. On the other, the learned counsel for the respondent, while opposing the petition, made the following submissions :\n(i) that since the arbitration clause specifically provides for the venue of arbitration to be at Delhi, without there being any reference to seat of arbitration, the venue as agreed amongst the parties has to be treated as seat of arbitration as well in view of ratio of Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd. v. Kaiser Aluminum Technical Services 2012 (9) SCC 552 (in short BALCO's case);\n(ii) that the impugned order, holding that it is the Court at Delhi which is the seat of arbitration, is a well reasoned order, wherein the Commercial Court, Ludhiana has duly taken into account the well settled position of law, as settled in BGS Soma's case (supra) and which has been followed consistently by all the High Courts;\n(iii) that judgment in Mankastu's case (supra) has not set aside the earlier judgment rendered in BGS Soma's case (supra);\nCR-6898-2023 (O&M) (6) 2024:PHHC:004418 (iv) that the High Court, while exercising powers under Section 11 of the Act cannot be termed as 'Court' within the meaning of Section 2(1)(e) of the Act so as to attract provisions of Section 42 of the Act;\n(v) that the respondent had approached this Court under section 11 of the Act and also the Court at Ludhiana for filing a petition under Section 34 of the Act at Ludhiana under a mistaken belief that Court at Ludhiana has jurisdiction and that when the respondent realized his mistake, he immediately withdrew his petition under Section 34 of the Act and as such the factum of filing such petitions cannot operate as any kind of estoppel upon the respondent from raising plea of jurisdiction;\n(vi) that in case the factum of respondent having approached this Court or the Court at Ludhiana is taken into account so as to confer jurisdiction upon Courts at Ludhiana, the same will encourage a dangerous trend and the litigating parties will approach different or far-off Courts in the first instance so as to assert jurisdiction of such Court. The learned counsel cites BBR (India) Private Limited v. S.P. Singla Constructions Private Limited,(2023)1 SCC 693, to contend that the concept of 'fastest fingers first' has been deprecated by Hon'ble Supreme Court. \n7. The contentions made by both the learned counsel would show that it is mainly the applicability of BGS Soma's case (supra), particularly in light of ratio of subsequent judgment in Mankatsu's case (supra) which is in question in the instant case. The controversy may be addressed by finding answers to the following questions:\n(i) Whether Mankastu's case is to be interpreted in a manner so as to mean that the judgment rendered in BGS Soma's case stands set aside?\nCR-6898-2023 (O&M) (7) 2024:PHHC:004418 (ii) Whether the view taken in Mankastu's case is in absolute conflict with the view taken in BGS Soma's case ?\n(iii) Whether the judgment in Mankastu's case dilutes the ratio of BGS Soma's case ? \n(iv) Whether, the factum of a party having approached a certain High Court under Section 11 of the Act, is a decisive factor for determining jurisdiction of the Court where petition under Section 34 of the Act is to be instituted? \n(v) Whether the conduct of the parties can be taken into account and can be said to furnish some indication as regards intention of parties with regard to 'seat' of arbitration particularly in a case where 'seat' of arbitration is not defined in agreement amongst parties and only the 'venue' of arbitration is defined? \n8. Before proceeding to find answers to the aforesaid questions, it is apposite to bear in mind the relevant provisions of the Act :\nSection 2 (1)(e) :\n\"Court\" means-- (i) In the case of an arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, the principal Civil court of original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a suit, but does not include any civil Court of a grade inferior to such principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Cause; \n                           (ii)     x x x                         Section 20 :\n                        Place of arbitration. - \n(1) The parties are free to agree on the place of arbitration. \n(2) Failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (I), the place of arbitration shall be determined by the tribunal having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the convenience of the parties. \nCR-6898-2023 (O&M) (8) 2024:PHHC:004418 (3) Notwithstanding sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the arbitral tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, meet at anyplace it considers appropriate for consultation among its members, for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, or for inspection of documents, goods or other property. \nSection 42 :\nJurisdiction.--Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Part or in any other law for the time being in force, where with respect to an arbitration agreement any application under this Part has been made in a Court, that Court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that Court and in no other Court. \n9. A perusal of the aforesaid sections shows that the term 'seat' or 'venue' are nowhere mentioned or defined therein. As a matter of fact, the term 'seat' and 'venue' has not been defined anywhere either under the Arbitration Act, 1940 or under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Section 20 of the Act defines 'place of arbitration' which is used interchangeably for both seat and venue. However, the concept of 'seat' and 'venue', as expounded in various judgments, has assumed humongous significance in arbitration proceedings as it not only determines where the arbitration proceedings are to be conducted but is also crucial in ascertaining the supervisory jurisdiction of Court and the curial law (lex arbitri) which governs such arbitration. While the 'seat' of arbitration defines the curial law or procedural law governing the arbitration and also determines which Court will exercise supervisory jurisdiction over such arbitration, the term 'venue' of arbitration defines the geographical place where such arbitration is conducted. \n10. Interestingly, unlike the civil suits where the jurisdiction is determined strictly in accordance with provisions of Sections 16 to 20 of CPC and the parties CR-6898-2023 (O&M) (9) 2024:PHHC:004418 have no choice in the matter of jurisdiction, the scheme of the Arbitration Act does give an option to the parties to mutually designate place where arbitration proceedings are to be conducted and the Court which is to exercise supervisory jurisdiction, irrespective of the place where cause of action had arisen or where property is situated. \n11. The following three modes for determination of jurisdictional seat can be discerned from the scheme of the Act, particularly upon perusal of Section 20 and 42 of the Act:\n(a) The seat is decided by the parties. \n(b) If the seat is not agreed by the parties then the seat shall be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. \n(c) If the seat has not been decided by the parties or by Arbitral Tribunal then the 'Court' in which an application under Part-I of the Act is made, would have jurisdiction. \n12. In the absence of any definition in statute as regards 'seat' or 'venue' of arbitration, the law has been settled through various judicial pronouncements. The development of law with regard to determination of 'seat' of arbitration, as discussed in various judgments may be chronologically traced briefly as under:\n2009 : 'SHASHOUA's principle' - (English Law) : \nThe famous English principle popularly known as 'Shashoua's principle' was propounded by Justice Cooke in a case titled Roger Shashoua v Mukesh Sharma. The Shashoua principle states that when an agreement expressly designates the venue without any express reference to seat, combined with a supranational body of CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 10 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 laws and no significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that the venue is actually the seat of arbitration. \n2012 : BALCO's case - (Constitution Bench) : \nThe landmark judgement which distinguished between the concept of \"seat\" and \"venue\" of the arbitration was a judgement delivered by a five judges Constitution Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in BALCO's case (supra). The Hon'ble Supreme Court analysed the concept of \"seat\" and \"venue\" at length and held that both the concepts are different. The Court clarified that the \"seat\" of arbitration is the center of gravity of the arbitration i.e. the place where the arbitration is anchored whereas the \"venue\" is merely the geographical location where such arbitration meetings are conducted. The Court further clarified that the term \"place of arbitration\" is used interchangeably under Section 20 of the Act and that while it denotes \"seat\" in context of Section 20 (1) of the Act, it would denote \"venue\" under Section 20 (3) of the Act. However, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, while emphasizing on party autonomy, granted concurrent jurisdiction to two different courts to exercise powers under the Act i.e. the Court with supervisory jurisdiction over the seat of arbitration and the court in whose jurisdiction the cause of action arose. This observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 96 created confusion and led to conflicting decisions by different High Courts. The relevant extracts from BALCO'S case (supra) are reproduced herein-under:\n\"96. ..... ..... ...... ....... We are of the opinion, the term \"subject-matter of the arbitration\" cannot be confused with \"subject-matter of the suit\". The term \"subject-matter\" in Section 2(1)(e) is confined to Part I. It has a reference and connection with the process of dispute resolution. Its purpose is to identify the courts having supervisory control over the arbitration proceedings. Hence, it refers to a court which would essentially be a court of the seat of the arbitration process. In our opinion, the provision in Section 2(1)(e) has to be construed keeping in view the provisions in Section 20 which give recognition to party autonomy. Accepting the narrow construction as projected by the learned counsel for the appellants would, in fact, render Section 20 nugatory. In our view, the legislature has intentionally given jurisdiction to two courts i.e. the court which would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is located and the courts where the arbitration takes place. This was necessary as on many occasions the agreement may provide for a seat of arbitration at a place CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 11 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 which would be neutral to both the parties. Therefore, the courts where the arbitration takes place would be required to exercise supervisory control over the arbitral process. For example, if the arbitration is held in Delhi, where neither of the parties are from Delhi, (Delhi having been chosen as a neutral place as between a party from Mumbai and the other from Kolkata) and the tribunal sitting in Delhi passes an interim order under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, the appeal against such an interim order under Section 37 must lie to the courts of Delhi being the courts having supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and the tribunal. This would be irrespective of the fact that the obligations to be performed under the contract were to be performed either at Mumbai or at Kolkata, and only arbitration is to take place in Delhi. In such circumstances, both the courts would have jurisdiction i.e. the court within whose jurisdiction the subject-matter of the suit is situated and the courts within the jurisdiction of which the dispute resolution i.e. arbitration is located. \n2018 : HARDY's case - (Three Judges Bench) : \nThe first judgment on domestic arbitration for the purpose of determination of jurisdictional seat is Union of India vs. Hardy Exploration and Production (India) INC. (2019) 13 SCC 472 by three Judge bench. Hon'ble Supreme Court deviated from the landmark BALCO's case and the Shashoua principle and held that 'venue' can be 'seat' only if there exists some other concomitant factor to support the same. The relevant extracts are reproduced hereinunder: \n\"30. On a perusal of Articles 20 and 31(3) of the Uncitral Model Law, we find that the parties are free to agree on the place of arbitration. \nOnce the said consent is given in the arbitration clause or it is interpretably deduced from the clause and the other concomitant factors like the case of Harmony Innovation Shipping Ltd. [Harmony Innovation Shipping Ltd. v. Gupta Coal (India) Ltd., (2015) 9 SCC 172 : (2015) 4 SCC (Civ) 341] which states about the venue and something in addition by which the seat of arbitration is determinable. The other mode, as Article 20 of the Uncitral Model Law provides, is that where the parties do not agree on the place of arbitration, the same shall be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. Such a power of adjudication has been conferred on the Arbitral Tribunal. Article 31(3) clearly stipulates that the award shall state the date and the place of arbitration as determined in accordance with Article 20(1). \n35. In the instant case, there has been no adjudication and expression of an opinion. Thus, the word \"place\" cannot be used as seat. To CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 12 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 elaborate, a venue can become a seat if something else is added to it as a concomitant. But a place unlike seat, at least as is seen in the contract, can become a seat if one of the conditions precedent is satisfied. It does not ipso facto assume the status of seat. Thus understood, Kuala Lumpur is not the seat or place of arbitration and the interchangeable use will not apply in strict sensu.\" \n2019 : SOMA's case - (Three Judges Bench) : \nSubsequently, another three Judges bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in BGS SGS SOMA JV v. NHPC Ltd. (2020) 4 SCC 234 held that Hardy's case (supra) did not lay correct law. It reiterated Shashoua's principle and while relying upon the Constitutional Bench decision in BALCO's case (supra), held that sub-section (3) of Section 20 refers to `venue' whereas the `place' mentioned in sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) refers to the `jurisdictional seat'. Hon'ble Apex Court in BGS SGS Soma's case (supra) also dealt with the situation where the parties have not agreed on or have not fixed the jurisdictional `seat of arbitration', and has laid down a broad principle to determine the `seat of arbitration' which would determine the location of the Court that would exercise supervisory jurisdiction. It has broadly been held that when 'venue' of arbitration is defined, the same should be treated as 'seat' of arbitration unless there is any indication to the contrary. Para 61 of the judgment reads as under:\n\"61. It will thus be seen that wherever there is an express designation of a \"venue\", and no designation of any alternative place as the \"seat\", combined with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration, and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that the stated venue is actually the juridical seat of the arbitral proceeding. \nCR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 13 ) 2024 :PHHC:004418 Hon'ble Apex Court in BGS SGS Soma's case (supra), crystallized the law as applicable, where the parties by agreement have not fixed jurisdictional seat, as under:\n\"82. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgements it may be concluded that whenever there is the designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the venue of the arbitration proceedings, the expression arbitration proceedings would make it clear that the venue is really the seat of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression does not include just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award at that place.\n..... ....... ......... further the fact that arbitral proceedings shall be held at a particular venue would also indicate that the parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby, that that place is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled with there being no other significant contrary Indicia, that the stated venue is merely a venue and not the seat of the arbitral proceedings, would then conclusively show that such a clause designates a seat of the arbitral proceedings. \n........ ......... ......... in a national context, this would be replaced by the Arbitration Act 1996 as applying to the stated venue which then becomes the seat for the purpose of arbitration..\" \nHon'ble Apex Court in BGS SGS Soma's case (supra), in concluding paragraphs clearly held that Hardy's case did not lay correct law. Para 96 is reproduced herein-under:\n\"96. The decision in Hardy Exploration and Production (India) Inc. (supra) is therefore contrary to the Five Judge Bench in BALCO (supra), in that it failed to apply the Shashoua principle to the arbitration clause in question. The Hardy Exploration and Production (India) Inc. (supra) decision would lead to the result that a foreign award would not only be subject to challenge in the country in which it was made, but also subject to challenge under Section 34 of Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996, which would lead to the chaos spoken of in paragraph 143 of BALCO (supra), with the concomitant risk of conflicting decisions, as held in Venture Global Engineering (supra) [overruled in BALCO (supra)], which would add to problems relating CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 14 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 to enforcement, and undermine the policy underlying the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law. We, therefore, declare that the judgment in Hardy Exploration and Production (India) Inc. (supra), being contrary to the Five Judge Bench in BALCO (supra), cannot be considered to be good law.\" \n2020 : Mankastu's case : (Three Judges Bench) : \nAnother three Judges bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mankastu Inpex Private Ltd. v. Airvisual Ltd. (2020) 5 SCC 399 observed that judgment in Soma's case being a judgment delivered by a three Judges Bench could not have overruled Hardy's judgment being a judgment delivered by a bench of equal strength. It determined the seat as per the 'venue' of arbitration. In the said case the agreement provided that the arbitration would be administered in Hong Kong and the place of arbitration shall be Hongkong. However, the agreement also stated that the Courts at Delhi will have jurisdiction over the matter. It was held therein that Hongkong is the seat of Arbitration since there was additional 'indicia' in favour of Hong Kong. The relevant paras are as under:\n\"20. It is well settled that \"seat of arbitration\" and \"venue of arbitration\"\ncannot be used interchangeably . It has also been established that mere expression \"place of arbitration\" cannot be the basis to determine the intention of the parties that they have intended that place as the \"seat\" of arbitration. The intention of the parties as to the \"seat\" should be determined from other clauses in the agreement and the conduct of the parties. \n21. In the present case, the arbitration agreement entered into between the parties provides Hong Kong as the place of arbitration. The agreement between the parties choosing \"Hong Kong\" as the place of arbitration by itself will not lead to the conclusion that the parties have chosen Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration. The words, \"the place of arbitration\" shall be \"Hong Kong\", have to be read along CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 15 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 with Clause 17.2. Clause 17.2 provides that \"... any dispute, controversy, difference arising out of or relating to MoU shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered in Hong Kong....\". On a plain reading of the arbitration agreement, it is clear that the reference to Hong Kong as \"place of arbitration\" is not a simple reference as the \"venue\" for the arbitral proceedings; but a reference to Hong Kong is for final resolution by arbitration administered in Hong Kong. The agreement between the parties that the dispute \"shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered in Hong Kong\" clearly suggests that the parties have agreed that the arbitration be seated at Hong Kong and that laws of Hong Kong shall govern the arbitration proceedings as well as have power of judicial review over the arbitration award. \n22. As pointed out earlier, Clause 17.2 of MoU stipulates that the dispute arising out of or relating to MoU including the existence, validity, interpretation, breach or termination thereof or any dispute arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and finally resolved by the arbitration administered in Hong Kong. The words in Clause 17.2 that \"arbitration administered in Hong Kong\" is an indicia that the seat of arbitration is at Hong Kong. Once the parties have chosen \"Hong Kong\" as the place of arbitration to be administered in Hong Kong, the laws of Hong Kong would govern the arbitration. The Indian courts have no jurisdiction for appointment of the arbitrator.\" 2022 : BBR Vs. S.P. Singla's case - (Two Judges Bench) In a recent case, BBR (India) Private Limited v. S.P. Singla Constructions Private Limited,(2023)1 SCC 693, the Hon'ble Supreme Court while taking note of the above referred judgments, expounded on 'seat of arbitration' in the following words:\n\"15. ..... ..... ..... ..... In other words, the term `court' as defined in clause (e) to sub-section (1) of Section 2, which refers to the `subject matter of arbitration ', is not necessarily used as finally determinative of the court's territorial jurisdiction to entertain proceedings under the Act. In BGS SGS Soma (supra), this Court observed that any other construction of the provisions would render Section 20 of the Act nugatory. In view of the Court, the legislature had given jurisdiction to two courts: the court which should have jurisdiction CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 16 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 where the cause of action is located; and the court where the arbitration takes place. This is necessary as, on some occasions, the agreement may provide the `seat of arbitration' that would be neutral to both the parties. The courts where the arbitration takes place would be required to exercise supervisory control over the arbitral process. The `seat of arbitration' need not be the place where any cause of action has arisen, in the sense that the `seat of arbitration may be different from the place where obligations are/had to be performed under the contract. In such circumstances, both the courts should have jurisdiction, viz., the courts within whose jurisdiction `the subject matter of the suit' is situated and the courts within whose jurisdiction the dispute resolution forum, that is, where the arbitral tribunal is located.\" \nIn BBR's case (supra), it was further held that once the jurisdictional `seat' of arbitration is fixed in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 20 of the Act, then, without the express mutual consent of the parties to the arbitration, `the seat' cannot be changed. However, the said observations are in a different context where upon recusal of the earlier arbitrator, the subsequently appointed arbitrator chose to hold arbitration proceedings at a different place. The question as regards significance of intention of parties was never in issue. \n13. Question no. (i), (ii) and (iii) :\n(i) Whether Mankastu's case is to be interpreted in a manner so as to mean that the judgment rendered in BGS Soma's case stands set aside? \n(ii) Whether the view taken in Mankastu's case is in absolute conflict with the view taken in BGS Soma's case ? \n(iii) Whether the judgment in Mankastu's case dilutes the ratio of BGS Soma's case ? \nCR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 17 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 The aforesaid three questions, being inter-related are being taken up together. \nAs already noticed above, almost all the judgments delivered by Hon'ble Apex Court have duly acknowledged the significance of existence of special circumstances, which could be an indicator as regards the intention of the parties. Though, in BBR's case, a judgment by a two Judges Bench, it has been observed that a seat once fixed cannot be changed but said observations are in a different context where upon recusal of earlier arbitrator, the subsequently appointed arbitrator chose to hold arbitration proceedings at a different place. The question as regards significance of intention of parties was never in issue. It is well settled that a judgment has to be construed in the backdrop of the facts and circumstances in which the judgment has been delivered and that a few phrases or sentences in a judgment, cannot be read out of context. As evident upon perusal of the judgments noticed above, Hardy's case and Soma's case are at variance with each other inasmuch as while Hardy's case states that 'venue' ipso-facto will not be a seat unless some 'indicia' in favour of the 'venue' being 'seat' is shown to exist, whereas Soma's case states that 'venue' will be 'seat' unless some contrary indicia shows otherwise. In none of the aforesaid two contrary views, has any absolute principle been laid and in both the views, there is room for exception whenever there is any indicia suggestive of any intention or manner. The relevant lines from para 35 of Hardy's case read as under:\n35. .... ....... ......... Thus, the word \"place\" cannot be used as seat. To elaborate, a venue can become a seat if something else is added to it as a concomitant. \n14. Similarly Soma's case also draws exceptions in para 61, the relevant extract of which is reproduced herein-under:\nCR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 18 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 \"61. It will thus be seen that wherever there is an express designation of a \"venue\", and no designation of any alternative place as the \"seat\", combined with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration, and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that the stated venue is actually the juridical seat of the arbitral proceeding.\n15. While the judgments in Hardy's case and in Soma's case do refer to a certain indicia but apparently it refers to the indicia discerned from various clauses in the agreement between the parties. Thus, the subsequent judgment in Mankatsu's case wherein conduct of the parties has also been held to be a determining factor to infer intention of the parties can only said to have added a new dimension to the term 'indicia' as referred in Soma's case so as not just to be confined to clauses in the agreement but even to look into definite and consistent conduct of the parties indicative of intention of the parties. In other words, the 'indicia' may even be gathered from conduct of the parties. The relevant extract from para 20 of Mankatsu's judgment is reproduced herein- under:\n\"20. It is well settled that \"seat of arbitration\" and \"venue of arbitration\" cannot be used interchangeably. It has also been established that mere expression \"place of arbitration\" cannot be the basis to determine the intention of the parties that they have intended that place as the \"seat\" of arbitration. The intention of the parties as to the \"seat\" should be determined from other clauses in the agreement and the conduct of the parties.\" \n16. Thus, Mankatsu's case has merely reiterated that 'indicia' in an acknowledged exception to the general rule as regards jurisdiction, when sought to be conferred on the basis of 'venue' agreed upon by the parties. It will not be appropriate to hold that Mankatsu's case has over-ruled Soma's case. Nor can it be said that Mankatsu's case is in conflict with ratio of Soma's case. When Soma's case itself leaves room for exceptions, Mankatsu's CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 19 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 case has just added another dimension to the term 'indicia'. Questions no.\n(i), (ii) and (iii) stand answered accordingly. \n17. Question no. (iv) :\n(iv) Whether, the factum of a party having approached a certain High Court under Section 11 of the Act, is a decisive factor for determining jurisdiction of the Court where petition under Section 34 of the Act is to be instituted? \nThe said question essentially pertains to scope of Section 42 of the Act and as to how the term 'Court' existing therein is to be interpreted. Section 2(1)(e) of the Act, which defines the term `Court' and Section 42 of the Act read as under:\n\"2. Definitions.- \n(1) In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires,-\n(e) \"Court\" means- (i) in the case of an arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject- matter of a suit, but does not include any Civil Court of a grade inferior to such principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes;\" \n42. Jurisdiction.- Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Part or in any other law for the time being in force, where with respect to an arbitration agreement any application under this Part has been made in a Court, that Court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that Court and in no other Court.\"\nCR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 20 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 18. The question as to whether term 'Court' as existing in Section 42 of the Act is to be interpreted in the same manner as defined in Section 2(i)(e) of the Act, came to be considered specifically by a three Judges bench of Hon'ble Apex Court in State of West Bengal and others Vs. Associated Contractors 2015(1) SCC 32, upon a specific reference made for settling the said issue. The controversy involved therein was also with respect to the 'Court' which would have jurisdiction to entertain a petition under Section 34 of the Act. \nThe Division Bench, upon noticing certain conflict in earlier judgments on the issue involved, had referred the matter to a larger Bench. The referral order is reproduced reads as under: \n\"4. We have perused the decisions cited by learned counsel for the parties, which are all decisions of two Judges Bench. In our opinion, the law has to be clarified beyond doubt as to which Court will have the jurisdiction to entertain and decide an application for setting aside the Award under Section 34 of the Act read with Section 2(e) of the Act and other provisions, including Section 42 of the Act. We, therefore, refer the matter to a larger Bench to decide this question of law.\" \n19. The three Judges Bench, upon consideration, held as under:\n\"16. ......... .......... .........It is obvious that Section 11 applications are not to be moved before the \"court\" as defined but before the Chief Justice either of the High Court or of the Supreme Court, as the case may be, or their delegates. This is despite the fact that the Chief Justice or his delegate have now to decide judicially and not administratively. Again, Section 42 would not apply to applications made before the Chief Justice or his delegate for the simple reason that the Chief Justice or his delegate is not \"court\" as defined by Section 2(1)(e). The said view was reiterated somewhat differently in Pandey & Co. Builders (P) Ltd. v. State of Bihar & Anr., 2007(2) RCR (Civil) 457 :\n(2007) 1 SCC 467 at Paras 9, 23-26.\n17. That the Chief Justice does not represent the High Court or Supreme Court as the case may be is also clear from Section 11(10):\nCR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 21 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 \"The Chief Justice may make such scheme as he may deem appropriate for dealing with matters entrusted by sub-section (4) or sub-section(5) or sub-section (6) to him.\" \nThe scheme referred to in this sub-section is a scheme by which the Chief Justice may provide for the procedure to be followed in cases dealt with by him under Section 11. This again shows that it is not the High Court or the Supreme Court rules that are to be followed but a separate set of rules made by the Chief Justice for the purposes of Section 11. \nSub-section 12 of Section 11 reads as follows:\n\"(a) Where the matters referred to in sub-sections (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (10) arise in an international commercial arbitration, the reference to \"Chief Justice\"' in those sub-sections shall be construed as a reference to the \"Chief Justice of India\"'.\n(b) Where the matters referred to in sub-sections (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (10) arise in any other arbitration, the reference to \"Chief Justice\" in those sub-sections shall be construed as a reference to the Chief Justice of the High Court within whose local limits the principal Civil Court referred to in clause (e) of sub-section (1) of section 2 is situate and, where the High Court itself is the Court referred to in that clause, to the Chief Justice of that High Court.\"\nIt is obvious that Section 11(12)(b) was necessitated in order that it be clear that the Chief Justice of \"the High Court\" will only be such Chief Justice within whose local limits the Principal Civil Court referred to in Section 2(1)\n(e) is situate and the Chief Justice of that High Court which is referred to in the inclusive part of the definition contained in Section 2(1) (e). This sub- section also does not in any manner make the Chief Justice or his designate \"court\" for the purpose of Section 42. Again, the decision of the Chief Justice or his designate, not being the decision of the Supreme Court or the High Court, as the case may be, has no precedential value being a decision of a judicial authority which is not a Court of Record.\" \n20. Hon'ble Apex Court, while answering the reference, summed up its conclusions as under:\n\"25. Our conclusions therefore on Section 2(1)(e) and Section 42 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 are as follows:\n(a) Section 2(1)(e) contains an exhaustive definition marking out only the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district or a High Court having original civil jurisdiction in the State, and no other court as \"court\" for the purpose of Part-I of the Arbitration Act, 1996.\nCR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 22 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 (b) The expression \"with respect to an arbitration agreement\" makes it clear that Section 42 will apply to all applications made whether before or during arbitral proceedings or after an Award is pronounced under Part-I of the 1996 Act. \n(c) However, Section 42 only applies to applications made under Part-I if they are made to a court as defined. Since applications made under Section 8 are made to judicial authorities and since applications under Section 11 are made to the Chief Justice or his designate, the judicial authority and the Chief Justice or his designate not being court as defined, such applications would be outside Section 42. \n(d) Section 9 applications being applications made to a court and Section 34 applications to set aside arbitral awards are applications which are within Section 42. \n(e) In no circumstances can the Supreme Court be \"court\" for the purposes of Section 2(1)(e), and whether the Supreme Court does or does not retain seisin after appointing an Arbitrator, applications will follow the first application made before either a High Court having original jurisdiction in the State or a Principal Civil court having original jurisdiction in the district as the case may be. \n(f) Section 42 will apply to applications made after the arbitral proceedings have come to an end provided they are made under Part-I.\n(g) If a first application is made to a court which is neither a Principal Court of original jurisdiction in a district or a High Court exercising original jurisdiction in a State, such application not being to a court as defined would be outside Section 42. Also, an application made to a court without subject matter jurisdiction would be outside Section 42. \nThe reference is answered accordingly.\" \n21. It, thus, stands well settled that High Court while dealing with an application under Section 11 of the Act would not be acting as a 'Court of principal jurisdiction' so as to fall within the meaning of 'Court' as defined in Section 2(1)(e) of the Act. Consequently, Section 42 of the Act will not get attracted merely upon filing of a petition under Section 11 of the Act. In other words, filing of a petition in a particular High Court will not ipso-facto confer jurisdiction upon any Court to for entertaining petition under Section 34 of the Act. However, such fact, cannot be absolutely washed off the record and, if such fact coupled with other similar acts, is found to be suggestive of any CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 23 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 other relevant fact, the same could assume some significance. Question no (iv) is answered accordingly. \n22. Question no. (v) :\n(v) Whether the conduct of the parties can be taken into account and can be said to furnish some indication as regards intention of parties with regard to 'seat' of arbitration particularly in a case where 'seat' of arbitration is not defined in agreement amongst parties and only the 'venue' of arbitration is defined? \nWhile answering question no. (i), (ii), and (iii), it has been opined that Mankatsu's case does not over-rule Soma's case but has just added another dimension to the scope of exception carved out in the earlier judgments in the nature of 'contrary indicia' concept. The judgment in Mankatsu's case has the effect of enlarging the scope of exception so as to include the conduct of the parties as a relevant fact for determining existence of any 'contrary indicia' as regards seat of arbitration. In other words, the 'contrary indicia' is not only to be inferred from the agreement but can well be gathered from conduct of the parties. \n23. In this context, a reference also needs to be made to a recent judgment of Hon'ble the Apex Court delivered in the case titled as M/s Ravi Ranjan Developers Private Limited Versus Aditya Kumar Chatterji, 2022 SCC Online 568. In the said case, the issue before Hon'ble the Apex Court was as regards the maintainability of a petition under Section 11(6) of the Act for appointment of an Arbitrator, which had been filed in the Court at Calcutta. The parties in the said case had agreed that the \"sitting of arbitral tribunal\"\nshall be at Calcutta. In other words the 'venue' was defined as Calcutta. The property in question, however, was situated in Muzaffarpur i.e. within the CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 24 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 State of Bihar and the office of the appellant was also situated in Patna (Bihar). The respondent approached the Courts at Muzzarpur under Section 9 of the Act seeking interim relief. The respondent also approached the Municipal Corporatuin at Muzzarpur seeking stoppage of construction, but said application was dismissed. Although, the appellant, while opposing the petition under Section 11(6) of the Act filed in Calcutta High Court by respondent had specifically raised objections as regards jurisdiction at Calcutta but Calcutta High Court accepted the petition under Section 11(6) of the Act. A Review petition filed by appellant was also dismissed. The order of appointment of Arbitrator by the Calcutta High Court was challenged by the appellant. The respondent therein raised a plea in defence to the effect that impugned order was passed upon 'consent' of the appellant and also cited case-law to contend that once venue is designated, the same has to be construed as 'seat as well. Para 15 and para 35, wherein such contentions have been noticed are reproduced herein-under: \n\"15 . The question before this Court is, whether the Calcutta High Court at all had jurisdiction to entertain the application filed by the Respondent and appoint an Arbitrator. Mr. Sanjay Ghosh, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent, argued with force, that the initial order of appointment of Arbitrator was passed by the Court by consent. The Appellant appeared in the arbitration proceedings. In other words, the Appellant acquiesced to the reference of the disputes to the Arbitrator appointed by the High Court.\" \nx x x \"35. In support of his argument that the Calcutta High Court had exclusive jurisdiction to entertain and decide the application under Section 11(6) filed by the Respondent, Mr. Ghosh cited Indus Mobile Distribution Private Limited v. Datawind Innovations Private Limited and Ors., (2017) 7 SCC 678, Hindustan Construction Company Limited v. NHPC Limited and Anr., (2020) 4 SCC 310 and BGS SGS Soma JV v. NHPC Limited, (2020) 4 SCC 234 and argued that once a seat of arbitration is designated, the clause CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 25 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 designating the seat of arbitration becomes an exclusive jurisdiction clause, as a result of which, only the Courts within whose territorial limits, the seat is located would have jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other Courts.\"\n24. Hon'ble Apex Court, while turning down the aforesaid contentions made by respondent therein held as under:\n\" 41. It is well settled that a judgment is a precedent for the issue of law that is raised and decided. The judgment has to be construed in the backdrop of the facts and circumstances in which the judgment has been rendered. Words, phrases and sentences in a judgment, cannot be read out of context. Nor is a judgment to be read and interpreted in the manner of a statute. It is only the law as interpreted by in an earlier judgment, which constitutes a binding precedent, and not everything that the Judges say.\"\nx x x \"48. In this case, the parties, as observed above did not agree to refer their disputes to the jurisdiction of the Courts in Kolkata. It was not the intention of the parties that Kolkata should be the seat of arbitration. Kolkata was only intended to be the venue for arbitration sittings. Accordingly, the Respondent himself approached the District Court at Muzaffarpur, and not a Court in Kolkata for interim protection under Section 9 of the A&C Act. The Respondent having himself invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court at Muzaffarpur, is estopped from contending that the parties had agreed to confer exclusive jurisdiction to the Calcutta High Court to the exclusion of other Courts. Neither of the parties to the agreement construed the arbitration clause to designate Kolkata as the seat of arbitration. We are constrained to hold that Calcutta High Court inherently lacks jurisdiction to entertain the application of the Respondent under Section 11 (6) of the Arbitration Act. The High Court should have decided the objection raised by the Appellant, to the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court, to entertain the application under Section 11 (6) of A&C Act, before appointing an Arbitrator.\"\n25. The judgment in Ravi Ranjan's case (supra), cannot, however be interpreted to mean that a view different from BGS Soma's case has been CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 26 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 taken. Rather an exception in the nature of 'contrary indicia' as carved out in earlier judgments by three Judges Bench has been drawn on the basis of conduct of the respondent therein particularly the fact that the respondent therein had himself approached District Courts at Muzzarpur (Bihar) by way of filing an application under Section 9 of the Act. \n26. The view taken in Ravi Ranjan's case (supra) would also be justified by application of provisions of section 42 of the Act. Para 31 of the said judgment would be indicative of the mandatory nature of Section 42 of the Act, which is reproduced herein under:\n\"31. There could be no doubt, as argued by Mr. Sinha, that Section 42 of the A&C Act is mandatory. The Section has obviously been enacted to prevent the parties from being dragged into proceedings in different Courts, when more than one Court has jurisdiction. Where with respect to any arbitration agreement, any application under Part I of the A&C Act has been made in a Court, that Court alone would have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement, and the arbitral proceedings, would have to be made in that Court and in no other Court, unless, of course, the Court in which the first application had been instituted, inherently lacked jurisdiction to entertain that application. The Section which starts with a non obstante clause, is binding irrespective of any other law for the time being in force, and irrespective of any other provision in Part I of the A&C Act.\" \n27. While the present case can safely be decided on the basis of application of section 42 of the Act, similar to the facts in Mankastu's case (supra) but since question as regards relevance of conduct has been raised, it is necessary to observe that before drawing any inference of contrariety from conduct of either of the parties, it would be expected that such conduct is scrutinized minutely so as to be assured that the act in question is not just a stray act committed with malafide intention by a party in an CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 27 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 attempt to oust or confer jurisdiction upon a certain Court. In case such a practice is encouraged, the same could lead to bench hunting. Any party could conveniently choose to institute any kind of frivolous application before a Court of his choice and later claim that jurisdiction stands conferred upon such Court in terms of Section 42 of the Act. \n28 . The special circumstance in the present case impelling this Court to look into conduct of the respondent is that it is now the respondent himself who is asserting jurisdiction to be of Court at Delhi as against his consistent conduct during the last five years to the contrary. He is trying to wriggle out of his admissions in pleadings which are indicative of the jurisdiction being at Ludhiana. Here is a case where the respondent never chose to raise any objection as regards jurisdiction while filing reply to petition under Section 34 of the Act filed by appellant and had infact himself filed a petition under Section 34 of the Act at Ludhiana even before the petitioner filed his petition under Section 34 of the Act. \n29. Taking into account any recent stray act to infer contrariety as against settled position of law will defeat the very purpose of relevant provisions. Before considering any conduct as an indicator of intention, the existence of malafides has also to be ruled out. Question no. (v) is answered accordingly in affirmative but with the cautions indicated above. \n30. Having answered the questions framed above, the facts need to be adverted to. While in the instant case, the agreement is silent as regards the 'seat' of arbitration but it does provide that the arbitration proceedings were to be conducted in Delhi. If broad principle that 'venue' is 'seat', was simply was to be applied then certainly there would have been no CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 28 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 controversy. However, while applying the said principle, the existence of 'contrary indicia' is to be ruled out, as has been held by BGS Soma's case itself. In the present case, though 'venue' of arbitration was agreed to be Delhi but as regards the 'seat', the conduct of the respondent shows something to the contrary. The said conduct is delineated herein-under:\n(i) the respondent had instituted a petition in this Court under Section 11(6) of the Act. Though, as already discussed above, it is well settled that the High Court while dealing with a petition under Section 11(6) of the Act would not fall within the meaning and ambit of 'Court' as defined by Section 2(i)(e) of the Act, but filing of such petition is indeed a circumstance, which cannot be absolutely overlooked and may be taken into account particularly if some admissions made therein throw light on intention or conduct of any of the parties. In the present case, the respondent, in his aforesaid petition admitted that the cause of action has accrued within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. Para 10 is reproduced herein below: \n\"10. In view of the above, it is evident that disputed has arisen between the parties which can be adjudicated by the Arbitral Tribunal under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. That the cause of action has accrued within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. Therefore, this Hon'ble Court has jurisdiction to try and entertain the present dispute.\" \n(ii) it is the respondent himself who approached the Court at Ludhiana in the first instance and filed a petition under Section 34 of the Act on 30.5.2017 (Annexure P-13), wherein a specific pleading regarding CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 29 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 jurisdiction was made in paragraph No. 4, which is reproduced herein-under:\n\"4. That this Court has the jurisdiction as MOAT was executed at Ludhiana. The property which was leased is situated at Ludhiana. The application under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was filed in the Punjab and Haryana High court as District Ludhiana falls within the jurisdiction of Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court. Otherwise also, when the dispute relate to immovable property, the Lis is to be filed in the Court within whose jurisdiction the said property is situated. Therefore, this Hon'ble Court has the jurisdiction to entertain and try the present petition.\" \n(iii) subsequently, on 3.7.2017, the petitioner also filed a petition (Annexure P-14) under Section 34 of the Act in the Court at Ludhiana, wherein the petitioner in para No. 19 of the petition asserted that the Court at Ludhiana has jurisdiction and there was no specific denial to the said assertion in the reply filed by the respondent, which was merely to the effect that the same is a matter of record. Para 19 and its reply are reproduced herein-under:\nPara 19: \"That this Court has got the jurisdiction to try and entertain the present petition as MOAT was executed at Ludhiana and the property which was to be leased is situated at Ludhiana and the Application U/s 11 of the Arbitration and conciliation Act, was filed within the jurisdiction of Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court. Otherwise also the dispute relates to immovable property which is within jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court and as such this Hon'ble Court is competent to entertain the present petition.\" \nReply : \"That the contents of Para No. 19 of the objection petition are matter of record.\" \n(iv) that the respondent himself chose to file an execution petition (Annexure P-17) in the Court at Ludhiana on 12.3.2022;\n                 CR-6898-2023 (O&M)                      ( 30 )             2024:PHHC:004418                             (v)    that after about 5 years of filing petition under Section 34 of the Act, the respondent chose to unconditionally withdraw his petition under Section 34 by stating that he does not wish to pursue for modification of award;\n31. The aforesaid conduct shows that it is a case where the respondent has consistently been asserting that the Court at Ludhiana has jurisdiction. It is not a case of any isolated application filed at Ludhiana but is a case where the respondent has consciously being instituting and pursuing the petitions at Ludhiana, whether filed by him or against him and never objected to jurisdiction at Ludhiana. The venue which had been as agreed upon amongst the parties for the purpose of conduct of proceedings of arbitration i.e. Delhi, could have been treated as 'seat' as well provided there was no 'indicia' to the contrary. The factum of the respondent having approached the Court at Ludhiana in the first instance for filing petition under Section 34 of the Act coupled with his specific averments as regards Ludhiana having jurisdiction, as noticed above and having regularly pursued the petitions in Ludhiana without ever having raised any doubt regarding jurisdiction for a good 5 years while specifically asserting that Ludhiana has jurisdiction cannot be said to be a stray act on the part of the respondent but is a consistent conduct on his part admitting the jurisdiction at Ludhiana. The respondent himself having chosen to approach the Court at Ludhiana is rather estopped from raising such an argument at this stage with regard to lack of jurisdiction at Ludhiana. Such like consistent conduct, would certainly constitute 'contrary indicia' so as to be excepted from the general principle that 'venue' of arbitration CR-6898-2023 (O&M) ( 31 ) 2024:PHHC:004418 is to be deemed as 'seat' of arbitration in case seat is not defined in agreement. \n32. The Commercial Court, Ludhiana has, however, overlooked the said aspect and applied only the broad principle laid down in BGS Soma's case whereas the instant case is a case falling under exception carved out in BGS Soma's case itself. Keeping in view the existence of 'indicia' contrary to the inference which could normally have been drawn regarding the seat being at Delhi on the basis of agreed 'venue' being at Delhi, it is held that it is the Courts at Ludhiana and not at Delhi which is the 'seat' of arbitration. \n33. In view of the discussion made above, the petition merits acceptance and is hereby accepted. The impugned order dated 15.5.2023 passed by the Commercial Court, Ludhiana is hereby set aside. \n34.

behalf of the petitioner. also heard mr.v.s.r.anjaneyulu, learned senior counsel representing the respondents. 4. perused the material on record as also the written submissions on behalf of both sides. brief facts: 5. the petitioner / m/s.fedora sea foods private limited filed o.s.no.59 of 2021 before the court of viii additional district judge, nellore seeking recovery of a sum of rs.9,55,74,429/-, from the respondents, which is due towards the purchase of aqua feed on credit basis and interest thereon. along with the suit, the petitioner filed i.a.no.88 of 2021 seeking attachment before judgment and an ex parte order of conditional attachment was passed on 20.09.2021. on receipt of notices, the respondents filed an application njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 i.a.no.131 of 2021 before the trial court for rejection of the plaint under section 151 of code of civil procedure (for short 'c.p.c.') r/w order vii rule 11 (d) of c.p.c., stating that the alleged transactions mentioned in the plaint comes under the definition of commercial dispute, that the plaintiff has to file the suit before the commercial court established at vijayawada and nellore district also comes under the jurisdiction of commercial court at vijayawada. thereafter, the petitioner on 08.03.2022 filed the present transfer petition under section 24 (5) r/w section 151 of c.p.c., seeking transfer of the suit i.e., o.s.no.59 of 2021 on the file of the court of the viii additional district judge, nellore to the special court for trial of commercial disputes, ibrahimpatnam, vijayawada. pending adjudication of the transfer petition, stay of all further proceedings in the said suit was sought for and a learned judge, granted interim orders on 15.03.2022. the respondents filed a petition to vacate the interim orders on 28.03.2022. njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 6. in the meanwhile, the respondents on 07.03.2022 filed c.r.p.no.515 of 2022 before this court under article 227 of the constitution of india inter alia contending that the civil court has no jurisdiction and has to dispose of the i.a.no.131 of 2021 for rejection of the plaint before proceeding with the main suit. against the order of attachment before judgment dated 20.09.2021, the respondents filed c.m.a.no.209 of 2023 with a petition to condone the delay in preferring the same, but a hon'ble division bench of this court vide orders dated 17.08.2023 dismissed the petition. thereafter, the respondents on 22.09.2023 filed the above c.r.p.no.2570 of 2023 to reject the plaint by exercising the powers under article 227 of the constitution of india. subsequently, the respondents withdrew c.r.p.no.515 of 2022 on 16.10.2023, in view of filing of c.r.p.no.2570 of 2023. 7. mr.o.manohar reddy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, made elaborate submissions. while stating that the suit o.s.no.59 of 2021 instituted by the petitioner is commercial in nature, he njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 submits that the commercial court at vijayawada started functioning from 04.03.2020 and the presiding officer took charge on 09.07.2020. however, since the said court started functioning during the covid period, the same was not within the petitioner's knowledge, that at the time of numbering the suit, no objections were raised, much less with regard to the institution of the suit in the district court at nellore, when the commercial court for trial of commercial disputes is functioning at vijayawada. after institution of the suit, even the learned district judge granted an order of attachment before judgment and as it was noticed later that the commercial disputes are required to be tried by the commercial courts, the learned senior counsel submits that the petitioner, therefore, filed the above transfer c.m.p., under section 24 (5) of c.p.c., for transfer of the suit. 8. placing strong reliance on the decision of a learned judge of the erstwhile high court of andhra pradesh at hyderabad in thirmala reddy njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 mahalakshmamma v. mulkluri murlidhar rao 1 , the 54th report of law commission of india on the code of civil procedure, 1908 dated 06.02.1973, more particularly, the recommendation with reference to section 24 of c.p.c., and the incorporation of section 24 (5) in pursuance thereof, the learned senior counsel addressed detailed arguments. he submits that prior to incorporation of section 24 (5) of c.p.c., with effect from 01.02.1977, there is no specific provision providing for transfer of cases filed in a court, which is not having a jurisdiction to the court having jurisdiction. in fact, the learned senior counsel submits that some of the high courts followed the said decision, but some of them took a different view. 9. in order to clarify the position and as it is better to adopt a wider view in the light of the decision of the a.p.high court in thirmala reddy mahalakshmamma (referred to 1 supra), the learned counsel submits that the law commission recommended an explanation to be added to section 24 of c.p.c., which is incorporated by way of sub-section (5). while stating that the air 1970 a.p., 194 njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 issue with regard to insertion of section 24 (5) as also order 7, rule 10-a and 10-b of c.p.c., was succinctly discussed in the decision of madhusudan das agarwal v. banaras hindu university 2, the learned counsel emphatically contends that section 24 (5) of c.p.c., empowers the high court to transfer a suit from a court which has no jurisdiction to try it and the prayer seeking transfer of the suit filed by the petitioner, merits acceptance. 10. insofar as the provisions of the commercial courts act, the learned senior counsel submits that section 15 of the said act contemplates that all suits and the applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in a high court or a civil court shall be transferred to the commercial division or commercial court, as the case may be. according to the learned counsel, section 15 (5) of the commercial courts act would not be applicable to the facts of the present case as it deals with a situation with regard to nontransfer of suits or applications, which are pending as on the date of commencement of the commercial courts act, but not in respect of the other 2015 law suit(all) 1864 njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 cases which are instituted of the said act came into force. he reiterates that section 24 (5) of c.p.c., empowers the transfer of a case of a commercial dispute filed after commencement of the commercial courts act in a civil court to the concerned commercial court dealing with such disputes. 11. the learned senior counsel further contends that the commercial court is a court sub-ordinate to the high court, invocation of powers under section 24 (5) of c.p.c., is therefore valid and tenable. the learned counsel also relies on the decisions of different high courts reported in krishna kumar damani v. ramnarain agarwal & other3, c.k.surendran v. kunhimoosa4 and jalagam sitarama rao v. the state of a.p.,5 etc. 12. coming to the revision petition i.e., c.r.p.no.2570 of 2023 seeking rejection of the plaint, the learned senior counsel referring to the averments in the counter-affidavit filed therein submits that the respondents earlier filed c.r.p.no.515 of 2022, withdrew the same and filed c.r.p.no.2570 of 2023 air 1984 calcutta 162 2021 lawsuit(ker) 1432 air 1978 ap 82 njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 on the premise that civil court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit filed by the petitioner. he contends that the petition under article 227 of the constitution of india is not maintainable in as much as the c.p.c a self contained code provides for a remedy and envisages a specific provision under order vii, rule 11 for rejection of the plaint, that it cannot be by-passed. he places reliance on the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in virudhunagar hindu nadargal dharma paribalana sabai & others v. tuticorin educational society6. he submits that having availed the remedy under order vii rule 11 (d) of c.p.c., and filed c.r.p.no.515 of 2022 to dispose of the application i.a.no.131 of 2021 and later withdrew the same, the respondents cannot maintain the present revision petition. the learned senior counsel also points out that against the order of attachment before judgment, the respondents filed c.m.a.no.209 of 2023 and after suffering an adverse order, they filed c.r.p.no.2570 of 2023 and the same is not sustainable. (2019) 9 scc 538 njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 13. the learned senior counsel further argues that though certain amendments were made to c.p.c., about it's applicability to the commercial disputes, in terms of section 16 of the commercial courts act, the same is in respect of some of the provisions as specified in the schedule and the applicability of section 24 of c.p.c., has not been excluded. in such a situation, he emphasizes that section 24 (5) of c.p.c., being an independent provision would empower the high court to transfer a suit from the civil court to the commercial court. strong reliance in this regard is placed on the decision of the delhi high court dated 09.01.2024 in cm(m) 457/2023 & cm appl.13615/2023 (namita gupta v. suraj holdings limited). making the said submissions and placing reliance on the other decisions filed along with the citations compilation, the learned senior counsel seeks to allow the transfer petition and dismiss the civil revision petition. 14. on the other hand, mr.v.s.r.anjaneyulu, the learned senior counsel while referring to the list of dates, advanced arguments at length. drawing the njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 attention of this court to the affidavit filed by the petitioner in support of transfer c.m.p., he contends that the suit o.s.no.59 of 2021 was admittedly filed on 13.09.2021 after the establishment of commercial court at vijayawada and in such circumstances, the civil court at nellore has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit at all, yet an order of attachment before judgment was granted. he submits that though the said aspect with regard to jurisdiction was brought to the notice of the court by way of a memo, the same was returned and therefore, i.a.no.131 of 2021 was filed to reject the plaint. as the said petition is being adjourned at the instance of the petitioner herein, initially c.r.p.no.515 of 2022 seeking disposal of the said i.a., was filed on 07.03.2022 and on the very next day i.e., 08.03.2022, the above transfer c.m.p., was filed. insofar as c.m.a.no.209 of 2023 is concerned, he submits that the hon'ble division bench dismissed the same only on the ground of delay without going into the issue as to the competency of the civil court to grant an order of attachment before judgment when it has no njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 jurisdiction to entertain the suit at all and draws the attention of this court to the observations made by the hon'ble division bench. 15. referring to section 15 (5) of the commercial courts act, he submits that in view of the said specific provision dealing with the transfer of pending cases, any of the parties can make an application, on receipt of which the commercial appellate division of the high court may withdraw such suit or application from the court before which it is pending and transfer the same for disposal by the commercial division or commercial court as the case may be. he submits that when the statute prescribes a specific procedure and a provision with reference to it, the same has to be invoked and filling of a transfer petition under section 24 of c.p.c., which is a general provision is not tenable in law. he also submits that section 21 of the commercial courts act has overriding effect on the provisions of any other law and therefore, the submissions made with reference to section 24(5) of c.p.c., merits no appreciation. in support of his contentions, the learned senior counsel places njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 reliance on the decisions in v.rajeshwar rao(dr.) v. m.yadhagiri reddy7, bank of india cbd belapur branch v. u.a.n.raju8, m.narayana chowdary v. meharbaba plots owners welfare association9. 16. contending that the case on hand is one of total lack of jurisdiction and in such circumstances, the court cannot return the plaint, but has to dismiss the suit, he further pleads that the question of transfer of a case, filed in a court which has no jurisdiction to try the same does not arise at all. he also contends that the transfer of suit under section 24 of c.p.c., from civil court to the special court dealing with the commercial disputes cannot be allowed as the said section has no application to the special courts. he also submits that the commercial court is a special court, it cannot be treated or equated with any other ordinary civil court nor can it be brought with in the fold of section 24 of c.p.c. it is his contention that section 24 of c.p.c., cannot be invoked in the case of a special court although it has all the trappings of a 2007 (1) alt 306 (db) 2004(1) ald 577 (db) 2004 (2) alt 23(s.b.) njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 civil court. he submits that the invocation of section 24 of c.p.c., would arise only if the suit is properly instituted but in the present case, it is the admitted case of the petitioner / plaintiff that the court at nellore has no jurisdiction at all. 17. the learned counsel also contends that the plea of the petitioner that it is not aware of the constitution of commercial court cannot be appreciated, as ignorance of law is not an excuse. he submits that as seen from the plaint, there is no specific pleading that the matter pertains to commercial disputes arising out of commercial transactions and obviously the plaint was drafted to get over the jurisdiction, that if the plaint contains any plea or allegation having semblance of commercial element, the civil court at nellore would not have entertained the suit. 18. the learned senior counsel further contends that as the transactions between the parties are commercial in nature even as per the petitioner, filing of the suit without following the procedure contemplated under section 12-a of njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 the commercial courts act, that too in an incompetent court shall entail the rejection of plaint. placing strong reliance on the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in patil automation private limited & others v. rakheja engineers private limited 10 , the learned senior counsel strenuously contends that the plaint can be rejected in exercise of powers under article 227 of the constitution of india. he also placed reliance on the decisions of high court of madras in muthulakshmi v. vijitha11, crp no.1245 of 2017 & batch dated 09.07.2019. in support of the various contentions advanced by him, the learned senior counsel also referred to the decisions in harshad chiman lal modi v. d.l.f. universal limited12, bhojraj srinivas v. bhojraj divya13, a.p.industrial infrastructure corporation (apiic) vijayawada v. meghavaram power pvt.ltd., hyderabad14, bank of rajashthan ltd., v. vck shares & stock broking services ltd.,(sc)15, vidya shanker

dt.14.02.2011), gulam ismail v. mirza ibrahim ali baig 19 etc., resting his arguments, the learned counsel urges for dismissal of the transfer petition and to allow the civil revision petition. 19. the learned senior counsel for the petitioner, in reply, submits that the jurisdiction of the civil court is not entirely ousted and the matters only of a specified value shall be tried by the commercial court and therefore the contention that the civil court lacks inherent jurisdiction is not tenable. insofar as the contention with reference to section 12-a of the commercial courts act, he submits that the said section has no application where there is an urgency of securing orders and at any rate, the said section is applicable to the cases filed after 20.08.2022 as per the decision of the hon'ble supreme 2013 ls (all) 1829 air 1965 sc 1449 (2020) 15 scc 585 (2003) 5 ald 552 njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 court in patil automation private ltd. he also contends that the analogy sought to be drawn by the learned counsel for the respondents with reference to the special courts established under the andhra pradesh land grabbing (prohibition) act with the commercial courts is not correct. he also made submissions distinguishing the judgments relied on by the learned counsel for the respondents and submits that the same are not applicable to the facts of the present case. consideration by the court:20. at the outset, it may be pertinent to mention that both the learned senior counsel advanced arguments extensively with reference to various propositions of law and the same would be discussed at the appropriate place, to the extent they are relevant for the disposal of the present cases. 21. on an appreciation of the rival contentions, the following points arise for consideration by the court: njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 1. whether the suit o.s.no.59 of 2021 instituted in the district court, nellore after constitution of commercial court at vijayawada can be transferred under section 24 (5) of c.p.c., and whether such a transfer amounts to violation of section 15 of the commercial courts act, a special provision? 2. whether the suit in question without compliance of section 12-a of the commercial courts act is maintainable? 3. whether the suit o.s.no.59 of 2021 is liable to be rejected even without application for rejection of the plaint under order vii, rule 11 of c.p.c., or suo-motu exercising powers under article 227 of the constitution of india when the civil court is incompetent to entertain the suits of commercial nature? 22. before answering the points under consideration, it may be pertinent to state here that there is no dispute that the commercial court dealing with the commercial disputes under the commercial courts act came to be established at vijayawada on 04.03.2020 and the presiding officer had taken charge on 09.07.2020. the submission with regard to institution of the suit i.e., o.s.no.59 of 2021 on 13.09.2021 at nellore made on behalf of the petitioner is that it is not aware of the establishment of commercial division at vijayawada during covid time. generally, such a plea that a party is not aware of establishment of a court having the competent jurisdiction with reference to njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 a dispute may merit no appreciation. but, this court is not oblivious to the fact situation prevailing during the pandemic. therefore, the explanation of the petitioner to the effect that is not aware of establishment of the commercial court in vijayawada as it had happened during covid period, cannot be simply brushed aside. that apart, even the district court at nellore had not raised any objections, scrutinized the plaint and numbered the suit. entertaining the suit as instituted before it, the district court on satisfying that a case is made out, granted an interim order of attachment before judgment, instead of returning the plaint. point no.1: 23. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties, made submissions detailed above with reference to section 24 of c.p.c., and section 15 of the commercial courts act. while it is the broad contention of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that section 24 (5) of c.p.c. empowers transfer of suits instituted in a civil court to the njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 commercial division, the learned senior counsel for the respondents contends that in the light of the specific provisions under the special enactment i.e., commercial courts act, the procedure contemplated under section 15 has to be adhered to. 24. a contention is also raised by the learned senior counsel for the respondents to the effect that the commercial court being a special court constituted under the commercial courts act cannot be treated as a civil court or to make it amenable to section 24 of the c.p.c. though the said contention appears to be attractive at the first blush, the same merits no acceptance. section 24 of the c.p.c., as argued by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner was amended pursuant to the recommendations made by the 54th law commission. though an explanation to section 24 of c.p.c., was recommended, the legislature had incorporated section 24 (5) which contemplates that \"a suit or proceeding may be transferred under the said section from a court which has no jurisdiction to try it.\" the said njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 recommendation came to be made in the light of the decision of a.p.high court in thirmala reddy mahalakshmamma case referred to supra, wherein it was held that \"the language of section 24 of civil procedure code is very wide and there are no restrictions or impediments in the way of high court exercising the power of transfer merely because there is a dispute regarding jurisdiction\" and to clarify the position on account of the contrary views expressed by different high courts. 25. the high court of allahabad in madhusudan das agarwal's case discussed the issue concerning section 24 of cpc vis-à-vis order vii, rule 10 of c.p.c., which was also amended by virtue of civil procedure code (amendment act, 1976). it would be apposite to extract the opinion expressed by the court for ready reference:\"20. on combined reading of the aforesaid provisions of section 24 (5) c.p.c. and order vii rule 10 of c.p.c., it comes out that section 24 (5) is absolutely independent of the provision contained in order vii rule 10 c.p.c., which was also added by the same amendment act no.104 of 1976. in order vii rule 10 (1)(2), 10-a, 10-b c.p.c., the legislature specifically provided a procedure for the court to follow in case the plaint is to be returned to be presented to the court in which the suit should have njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 been instituted. it relates to the suits which are instituted before a court which has no jurisdiction to try the same. in order to cure the defect in jurisdiction, the legislature in these provisions empowered the court where the plaint is instituted, to pass orders for returning the plaint and its institution and trial. in such cases, the trial is always de novo. however, the legislature while incorporating the provision under order vii rule 10 c.p.c., incorporated a separate and independent provision in the shape of sub-section (5) of section 24 c.p.c. conferring power upon the district judge and the high court to exercise the same for transfer of a suit or proceedings, from a court which has no jurisdiction to try. this applies to the case where the suit or proceedings has been instituted in a court which has no jurisdiction. in other words, the initial lack of jurisdiction or inherent lack of jurisdiction to entertain the suit or proceedings is being allowed to be cured by an order which can be passed only by the district judge or the high court under this provision. this provision does not carry any qualification or restriction. the legislature has not provided any conditions on the district court or the high court for such transfer under section 24 (5) c.p.c., while in a transfer of a suit under order vii rule 10 c.p.c., the legislature has provided specific conditions, procedure and the manner in which the power can be exercised.\" 26. in jalagam sitaramarao's case referred 5 supra, the division bench of erstwhile high court of andhra pradesh, was dealing with an issue of transfer of suits from the agency court to the civil court. a plea was taken to the effect that the high court cannot invoke the jurisdiction under section 24 of cpc to transfer a suit from an agency court, that c.p.c., does not apply to agency area or agency court and that in any event, the transfer of suit njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 pending before any agency court could be made only to another agency court, but not a civil court. examining the matter with reference to the provisions of the relevant enactments, the hon'ble division bench opined that \"section 24, among others, empowers the high court to transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending in any subordinate court to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same and for the exercise of the said power by the high court, the suit, appeal or other proceeding must be pending before a court subordinate to the high court.\" it held that the agency court constituted under the schedule districts act and the a.p.agency rules framed therein is a court subordinate to the high court and the high court has power under section 24 of c.p.c., to transfer the suit pending in such agency court either to another agency court or to a civil court. 27. in namita guptha's case referred to above, the high court of delhi dealt with a similar situation like in the case on hand. the respondent before njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 the high court filed a suit seeking recovery of a sum of rs.1,07,37,545.07 ps., along with the interest from namita guptha / defendant in the suit and the learned additional district judge treated the suit as an ordinary civil suit and issued summons. a written statement was filed along with a counter claim for rs.40,62,882/together with interest. thereafter, namita guptha filed an application under order vii, rule 11 cpc contending inter alia that the suit involves a commercial dispute as defined under section 2 (1) (c) (i) of the commercial courts act of the specified value and has been filed without resort to the pre-institution mediation as contemplated under section 12-a of the act, the plaint is liable to be rejected as barred by law. the learned additional district judge on noticing that the dispute raised in the suit is commercial in nature, directed the file of the suit to be placed before the learned principal district & sessions judge for appropriate orders. the learned principal district judge, in turn, transferred the suit to the learned district judge, commercial njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 court. aggrieved by the same, namita gupta carried the matter to the high court of delhi. 28. before the high court, it was inter alia contended that both the learned additional district judge as also district & sessions judge do not have the power to transfer the suit, which is filed as an ordinary suit to a commercial court, that the plaint does not meet the requirements in terms of section 12-a of the commercial courts act and the plaint should have been rejected / returned. a specific contention was also raised with reference to section 24 of c.p.c., that even assuming that the said provision would apply, a commercial court constituted under the act is not a court subordinate to the court of principal district & sessions judge and the learned principal district judge did not have the power to transfer the suit to a commercial court. 29. referring to the provisions of the commercial courts act including section 15 (1) & (5), 16 and 18, the learned judge had recorded a categorical finding at para no.36, which is reproduced hereunder: njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 \"36. a reading of the above provisions would show that the act provides for the constitution of commercial courts and commercial divisions of the high courts to adjudicate on commercial disputes of a specified value. however, the implementation of the said provisions and the overall administrative control over these courts remains vested with the high courts and, therefore, commercial courts would be a court subordinate to the high courts. section 24 of the cpc is not amended by the act or by the schedule appended thereto, therefore, there is no reason for it to be not applied to a suit relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value.\" 30. the learned judge has also referred to the decisions of different division benches of the same court wherein the provisions of c.p.c., i.e., order vii, rule 10 and section 15 of the commercial courts act were dealt with. after detailed analysis of the matter, it was opined that if a suit raises a commercial dispute of a specified value, the ordinary civil court shall have no jurisdiction to entertain the same and it must, therefore return the plaint in exercise of its power under order vii, rule 10 of c.p.c. however, the learned judge further examined the question as to whether a duty to return the plaint under order vii, rule 10 of c.p.c., would take away the power of the court under section 24 of c.p.c. referring to the said provisions, the learned judge had categorically held that \"all proceedings that were undertaken before the njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 court where a suit was earlier instituted, that it lacked jurisdiction to try the suit, can be saved, and the suit on its transfer can be proceeded from the point, at which it was transferred.\" 31. while answering issue no.1 with regard to application of section 24 of c.p.c., to the commercial disputes, the learned judge inter alia held as follows: \"63. as noted hereinabove, section 16 of the act provides that the provisions of the cpc shall apply to any suit in respect of commercial dispute of a specified value, subject to the amended provisions thereof as provided in the schedule appended to the act. section 24 of the cpc is not a provision which has been amended by the said schedule. it, therefore, continues to apply in full force to a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value. if the legislature wanted to take away this power from the court, it would have expressly stated so by deleting the said provision in the schedule to the act; it did not do so. there is also no implied exclusion of this power, as this power, in no manner, is in conflict with any provisions of the act. 64. as far as non-compliance with section 12a of the act is concerned, the transferee court shall consider the said objection on merits upon the transfer of the suit. the transfer of the suit does not, in any manner, affect the right of the defendant to contend that the suit has been filed without any cause of action or is otherwise barred by any provision of law or is liable to be dismissed under order vii rule 11 of the cpc for any other reason, including for the failure of the plaintiff to initiate pre-suit mediation as mandated under section 12a of the act. these objections would remain open to the defendant even on the transfer of the suit under section 24 of the act. 65. as held hereinabove, a commercial court, constituted under section 3 of the act, would be a court subordinate to the high court. reference in this njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 regard may also be made to the judgment of the supreme court in life insurance corporation of india v. nandini j. shah & ors., (2018) 15 scc 356. therefore, there is no reason to exclude the applicability of section 24 of the cpc to a suit in relation to a commercial dispute of a specified value. the first issue is answered accordingly.\" 32. the learned judge, however, while holding that the power under section 24 of the c.p.c., to transfer the suit is not available to the learned district & sessions judge, yet in the interest of justice, in exercise of power vested in the high court under section 24 of c.p.c., transferred the suit from the court of the learned additional district judge to the court of district judge (commercial), to be tried from the stage, it is pending. 33. the said judgment of the learned judge was carried by way of special leave to appeal (c) no.7955 of 2024 to the hon'ble supreme court and the apex court dismissed the same vide order dated 19.04.2024. 34. in the light of the decision in namitha guptha with reference to the provisions of the commercial courts act, the schedule thereunder vis-à-vis the powers of the high court under section 24 of c.p.c., the reasoning whereof was approved by the apex court, this court is of the view that in njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 exercise of powers under section 24 of c.p.c., o.s.no.59 of 2021 instituted before the district court, nellore can be transferred to the commercial court at vijayawada and such a transfer would not amount to violation of section 15 of the commercial courts act. the issue is answered accordingly in favour of the petitioner. point no.2: 35. with reference to section 12-a of the commercial courts act, it was contended on behalf of the respondents that it is a mandatory provision and since the same has not been complied with, the suit itself is liable to be rejected. 36. per contra, it was contended that section 12-a is not applicable to the cases where certain urgent orders are required to be obtained and at any rate, the said section cannot be pressed into service in respect of the subject matter suit which was instituted on 13.09.2021, in the light of the expression of the hon'ble supreme court in patil automation private ltd' that the said njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 section shall be applicable with effect from 20.08.2022. in the said case, the hon'ble supreme court was inter alia, dealing with a question as to whether the statutory pre-litigation mediation contemplated under section 12-a of the commercial courts act as amended by the amendment act of 2018 is mandatory and whether the courts below have committed any error in not allowing applications filed under order vii, rule 11 of c.p.c. the hon'ble apex court after considering the relevant aspects including the various precedents at para 113.1, declared that section 12-a of the act is mandatory and held that any suit instituted violating mandates of s.12-a, must be visited with rejection of plaint under order 7, rule 11 of c.p.c. the hon'ble apex court also held that said power can be exercised even suo-motu by the court, but however made it clear that the said declaration would be effective from 20.08.2022, so that the stakeholders concerned become sufficiently informed. in the light of the said expression of the hon'ble supreme court, the contention advanced on behalf of the learned counsel for the respondents njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 deserves no acceptance. the suit in question is therefore maintainable. point no.2 answered accordingly. point no.3: 37. one of the contentions advanced on behalf of the respondents is that the suit in question can be rejected suo-motu, even without an application for rejection of the plaint under article 227 of the constitution of india on the premise that the civil court is lacking inherent jurisdiction and in such circumstances, the question of transferring the suit would not arise at all. in support of the contention, the learned counsel for the respondents had placed reliance on patil automation private ltd.. the hon'ble supreme court examining the matter with reference to the provisions of the commercial courts act i.e., section 12-a etc., and order vii, rule 11 of c.p.c., in the facts of the said case, while opining that the commercial courts act and the rules reveal the existence of a complete code, expressed the view that where on the allegations of the suit, it is found that the same is barred by any njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 law, the power under order vii rule 11 is available to the court to be exercised suo-motu. however, in the present case, initially the respondents moved an application seeking rejection of the plaint under order vii, rule 11 of c.p.c., then filed c.r.p.no.515 of 2022 aggrieved by non-disposal of the same and thereafter withdrew it, stating that the present revision petition is filed under article 227 of the constitution of india. while there may not be any bar for adopting such a course of action, the institution of the same, in the circumstances as stated in the counter-affidavit filed in c.r.p.no.2570 of 2023 cannot be lost sight of. be that as it may. 38. it is settled law that the powers under article 227 of the constitution of india shall be exercised sparingly. that apart, as contended by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner, the c.p.c., provides for specific provision for rejection of plaint and having filed an application under order vii, rule 11 seeking rejection of the plaint, the respondents had not pursued the same, but filed the present c.r.p.no.2570 of 2023. njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 39. in virudhunagar hindu nadargal dharma paribalana sabai's case, the hon'ble supreme court was dealing with an appeal filed against the order of the high court passed under article 227 of the constitution of india. against the order of the trial court granting an injunction, one of the defendants in the suit filed a regular appeal vide c.m.a.no.1 of 2018 before the jurisdictional sub-court under order 43, rule 1 (r) of c.p.c., whereas some of the defendants instead of filing a regular appeal, filed a civil revision petition before the high court under article 227 of the constitution of india. despite the objections to the maintainability of the revision on the ground of availability of alternative remedy under the code, the high court allowed the civil revision petition. referring to the provisions of the c.p.c., the hon'ble supreme court inter alia held as follows: 11. secondly, the high court ought to have seen that when a remedy of appeal under section 104(1)(i) read with order 43, rule 1(r) of the code of civil procedure, 1908, was directly available, respondents 1 and 2 ought to have taken recourse to the same. it is true that the availability of a remedy of appeal may not always be a bar for the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction of the high court. in a. venkatasubbiah naidu v. s. chellappan [a. venkatasubbiah naidu v. s. chellappan, (2000) 7 scc 695] , this court held that \"though no hurdle njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 can be put against the exercise of the constitutional powers of the high court, it is a well-recognized principle which gained judicial recognition that the high court should direct the party to avail himself of such remedies before he resorts to a constitutional remedy\". 12. but courts should always bear in mind a distinction between (i) cases where such alternative remedy is available before civil courts in terms of the provisions of code of civil procedure, and (ii) cases where such alternative remedy is available under special enactments and/or statutory rules and the fora provided therein happen to be quasi-judicial authorities and tribunals. in respect of cases falling under the first category, which may involve suits and other proceedings before civil courts, the availability of an appellate remedy in terms of the provisions of cpc, may have to be construed as a near total bar. otherwise, there is a danger that someone may challenge in a revision under article 227, even a decree passed in a suit, on the same grounds on which respondents 1 and 2 invoked the jurisdiction of the high court. this is why, a 3-member bench of this court, while overruling the decision in surya dev rai v. ram chander rai [surya dev rai v. ram chander rai, (2003) 6 scc 675] , pointed out in radhey shyam v. chhabi nath [radhey shyam v. chhabi nath, (2015) 5 scc 423 : (2015) 3 scc (civ) 67] that \"orders of civil court stand on different footing from the orders of authorities or tribunals or courts other than judicial/civil courts\". 13. therefore wherever the proceedings are under the code of civil procedure and the forum is the civil court, the availability of a remedy under the cpc, will deter the high court, not merely as a measure of self-imposed restriction, but as a matter of discipline and prudence, from exercising its power of superintendence under the constitution. hence, the high court ought not to have entertained the revision under article 227 especially in a case where a specific remedy of appeal is provided under the code of civil procedure itself. 40. in the light of the above decision and as this court is of the opinion that there are no exceptional circumstances, is not inclined to exercise the powers under article 227 of the constitution of india to reject the plaint. njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 41. at this juncture, it may be appropriate to deal with the decisions referred to by the learned senior counsel for the respondents. 42. in ambalal sarabhai enterprises case, the hon'ble supreme court was dealing with an order where in the high court of gujarat set aside the order passed by the commercial court under order vii, rule 10 of c.p.c., and directed that the plaint be returned to the appellant therein to be presented in the court in which the suit should have been instituted. considering the submissions made with reference to the statement of objects and reasons of the commercial court, the hon'ble court opined that the very purpose for which the commercial courts act has been enacted would be defeated if every other suit merely because it is filed before the commercial court is entertained. while dismissing the appeal, the hon'ble court directed that the commercial court shall return the plaint indicating a date for its presentation before the court having jurisdiction. in the present case, a plain reading of the plaint would go to show that the suit transactions are njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 commercial in nature and even according to the respondents, the commercial court has jurisdiction to try the same. the decision of the hon'ble apex court supports the case of the petitioner herein. 43. bank of rajasthan limited is a case, wherein the hon'ble supreme court was dealing with a reference that arose out of an order noticing an apparent conflict of views of two judges benches in united bank of india, calcutta v. abhijith tea company (p) limited20, indian bank v. abs marine products (p) limited 21 and state bank of india v. ranjan chemicals ltd.22 a three member bench of the hon'ble apex court, examining the provisions of the recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions act, 1993 and section 151 of c.p.c., inter alia held that in the absence of any such power existing in civil court to entertain a suit filed by borrower against bank or financial institution cannot be transferred to be tried along with an application under the said act. the hon'ble supreme court (2000) 7 scc 357 (2006) 5 scc 72 (2007) 1 scc 97 njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 while examining the power of the civil court held that when there is no power of transfer in the civil court, the consent or absence of it is not something which would lend such power to the civil court. however, in the present case, the powers under section 24 (5) seeking transfer of the suit by the high court were invoked. therefore, the decision of the hon'ble supreme court is not applicable to the facts of the present case. 44. in harshad chiman lal modi's case, the hon'ble supreme court was dealing with a review petition. the applicant / appellant filed a suit for specific performance of an agreement and after more than eight years of filing of the written statement, an application was filed by the respondents / defendants under order vi rule 7 of c.p.c., seeking an amendment in the written statement by raising an objection as to the jurisdiction of the court. the said application was allowed and after hearing the parties, the plaint was ordered to be returned to the plaintiff for presentation to the appropriate court and the said order was confirmed by the high court as well as the hon'ble njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 supreme court. in the review petition, a direction was sought to take up the suit from the stage at which, it stands transferred and to decide it expeditiously. the hon'ble supreme court in the facts and circumstances, opining that the provisions of section 24 and / or section 25 of the code has no application to the case on hand, agreed with the submission made by the respondents that it is not a case of 'transfer' of a suit but of lack of jurisdiction of the court. the hon'ble supreme court accordingly dismissed the review petition. this decision is not of much aid to the respondents as section 24 (5) of c.p.c., is invoked in the present case. 45. the hon'ble supreme court in sinnamani's case dealing with the provisions of the trusts act held that the original petition filed under the provisions of the said act cannot be allowed to be converted into a suit. the hon'ble court upheld the decision of the high court confirming the order of the district court in allowing the applications filed under order vii rule 11 of c.p.c., rejecting the trust o.p., and that the same could not be converted into njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 a civil suit. the hon'ble apex court opined that the trusts act contains no enabling the provision to convert the original petition into a suit. the fact situation in the present case is different and the said decision is not applicable. 46. raja soap factory is a case in which the hon'ble supreme court held that jurisdiction to try a suit, appeal or proceeding by a high court under the power reserved by section 24 (1) (b) (i) of c.p.c., arises only if the suit, appeal or proceeding is properly instituted in a court subordinate to the high court. the said decision is prior to the amendment to the c.p.c., and insertion of section 24 (5), which is invoked in the present case. 47. in neha arun jugadar v. kumari palak diwan ji's case (transfer petition (civil) no.182 of 2011), the hon'ble supreme court dealing with transfer of a case pending at the district judge (mact court, gautam budh nagar, u.p.) to the competent court at pune, maharashtra under section 25 of c.p.c., was not inclined to allow the same. whereas in the case on hand, njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 section 24 (5) of c.p.c., which empowers the high court to transfer a suit or proceeding from a court which has no jurisdiction to try it, has been invoked. 48. in v.rajeshwara rao's case, the hon'ble division bench of the erstwhile high court of judicature of a.p., at hyderabad, while dealing with the provisions of the a.p.land grabbing (prohibition) act, vis-à-vis section 24 of c.p.c., held that the special court cannot invoke section 24 of the c.p.c., although it has all the trappings of a civil court and that even the district court cannot withdraw a suit pending before any other subordinate court and direct the transfer of the same to the special court since the jurisdiction of the special court and district court are mutually exclusive and that it cannot be said to be the subordinate court to the other. the proposition of law laid down by the hon'ble division bench, in the opinion of this court is not applicable in as much as the transfer of suit from the civil court to the commercial court, which are subordinate to the high court was sought for in the present case, in exercise of powers under section 24 (5) of c.p.c. njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 49. the decision of the division bench of telangana state high court in bhojraj srinivas referred to above is in respect of an appeal filed against the order of the trial court allowing the application filed under order vii, rule 11 (d) of c.p.c. while upholding the order of the trial court, it was opined that it is a case of inherent lack of jurisdiction for the district court to entertain the suit and the court which does not have jurisdiction to entertain the suit, cannot return the plaint, but has to dismiss the suit for want of jurisdiction. the said decision is not applicable to the case on hand, as the petitioner in the present case had invoked the powers of the high court under section 24 (5) of c.p.c., and no distinction with regard to jurisdiction for transfer of suits in exercise of power by it under the said provision of law is made. 50. in gulam ismail & others, the division bench of the erstwhile high court took a view that section 24 can be invoked to transfer any suit or appeal or other proceedings pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same and rejected the njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 petition to transfer the suit from civil court to special tribunal constituted under the a.p.land grabbing (prohibition) act holding that the tribunal or special court will not fall under section 24 of the civil procedure code. 51. in a.p.industrial infrastructure corporation, a division bench of this court inter alia held that the issue relating to territorial jurisdiction of a court has to be decided by the trial court in the final adjudication of the suit, as a plea has been taken in the trial court relating to the territorial jurisdiction and dismissed the petition filed under section 24 of c.p.c., seeking transfer of the suit. the hon'ble division bench, it would appear that, had no occasion to examine the decision in j.sita rama rao's case and the scope of section 24(5) of c.pc., which provides for transfer of suits by the high court, without any qualification or restriction. 52. in bank of india, cbd, belapur branch, the hon'ble division bench of the erstwhile high court of andhra pradesh was dealing with an issue whether the court can assume jurisdiction merely on the concession of the njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 parties and held that neither the consent nor waiver can cure the defect of inherent lack of jurisdiction. the hon'ble division bench directed the trial court to follow the procedure under order vii rule 10 of c.p.c. 53. in kamadhenu enterprises, secunderabad v. mrs.zara ahmad23, a division bench of the high court for the state of telangana, considering the provisions of the commercial courts act with reference to section 9 etc., as the specified value of the subject dispute is more than rupees one crore in view the specific provisions in section 10 r/w section 12 of the commercial courts act, opined that the application under section 9 of the act has to be filed in a designated commercial court only and civil court has no jurisdiction to deal with such applications. the hon'ble division bench though left it open to the appellant therein to avail appropriate remedy, that may be available under commercial courts act, however, had not considered the remedy of transfer of the cases in terms of the section 24 (5) of c.p.c. 2023(1) alt 739 njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 54. the other decisions relied on by the learned senior counsel for the respondents, in the opinion of this court are of no much aid, more particularly in the light of the decision of the high court of delhi in namitha guptha's case, wherein the provisions of the commercial courts act, the applicability of 24 of c.p.c., which was not specifically excluded even after amendments to the c.p.c., in its application to the commercial disputes except as mentioned in the schedule of the commercial courts act was dealt with. as noted earlier, the said decision of the high court dealing with the similar fact situation like in the present case was carried in appeal and the hon'ble supreme court approved the reasoning of the delhi high court. therefore, the various contentions regarding lack of inherent jurisdiction are rejected. accordingly, the issue no.3 is answered. 55. reverting to the factual aspects of the case and as noted above, the dispute is with regard to the jurisdiction of the district court, nellore in entertaining the suit in respect of transactions which are commercial in nature, njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 while the commercial court at vijayawada is having jurisdiction to try the same. according to the written arguments filed on behalf of the respondents, they do not owe anything to the petitioner, but the petitioner owes to the respondents and the suit is filed with all false allegations, tampering of records, without any supporting documents and by forging signatures of the 2nd respondent. all these aspects can as well be raised by the respondents in the written statement taking a definite stand and contest the matter on merits, on transfer of the suit as sought for by the petitioner. therefore, this court is inclined to exercise its powers under section 24 (5) of c.p.c., in the facts and circumstances of the case and allow the transfer petition. 56. accordingly, the suit o.s.no.59 of 2021 on the file of the court of viii additional district judge, nellore shall stand transferred from the said court to the special court for trial of commercial disputes, ibrahimpatnam at vijayawada. on such transfer, the petitioner shall comply with the requirements of the commercial courts act with respect to the plaint, failing njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 which the respondents are at liberty to move an appropriate application for rejection of the plaint, in accordance with law. 57. in the result, the transfer petition is allowed and the civil revision petition is dismissed. there shall be no order as to costs. as a sequel, pending miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall stand closed. _____________________ ninala jayasurya, j date: 12.08.2024 blv njs,j tr.cmp_83 of 2022 & crp_2570 of 2023 the hon'ble sri justice ninala jayasurya & civil revision petition no: 2570 of 2023
