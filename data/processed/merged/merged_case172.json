Mishra, J.\n1. The Petitioner Company has preferred the Writ Petition challenging the order dated 30.04.2024 passed by the Senior Civil Judge (Commercial Court), Cuttack in Arbp No.14 of 2024, vide which the Court below rejected its application under Order 39 Rule 3 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, shortly, \"the Cpc\", moved in a section 9 application filed under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,1996, shortly, \"the Act,1996\", to grant ex-parte ad interim injunction with an observation that, an order cannot be passed without hearing the Opposite Parties and accordingly, ordered for issuance of notice to the Opposite Parties fixing the date to 25.06.2024 for appearance. \n2. While issuing notice to the Opposite Parties, this Court, vide order dated 13.05.2024, as an interim measure, passed an order to maintain status quo as on the said date till the next date with regard to invocation of Bank Guarantee. Paragraph 3 of the Order dated 13.05.2024 passed in I.A. No.6416 of 2024, being relevant, is reproduced below for ready reference. \n\"Taking into consideration the ratio decided by the apex Court in (2022) 1 Scc 712 (Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel India Limited Vs. Essar Bulk Terminal Limited), (2016) 11 Scc 720 (Gangotri Enterprises Limited Vs. Union of India and others) & (2012) 5 Scc 370 (Maria Margarida Sequeira Fernandes & others Vs. Erasmo Jack De Sequeira (dead) so also after going through the pleadings made in the Writ Petition and documents appended thereto, as an interim measure, it is ordered to maintain the status quo as on date with regard to encashment of Bank Guarantee No.32700IGL0001122, which is valid till 05.09.2024, till the next date.\"\n3. Though it was ordered to list the matter in the week commencing from 17.06.2024, the present Opposite Parties appeared suo motu. Instead of filing Counter, dealing with the specific allegations made in the Writ Petition so also documents appended there to, I.A. No.6777 of 2024 has been filed for vacation of the aforesaid interim order. On being moved showing urgency, the matter was listed for orders and a short adjournment being granted, the Petitioner also filed its Objection to I.A. No.6777 of 2024 opposing to the prayer for vacation of stay. However, on consent of the learned Senior Counsel for the Parties, the Writ Petition along with all I.As. were taken up together for hearing and final disposal. \n4. The factual matrix(as pleaded in the Writ Petition), which led to filing of the Writ Petition, is that Work Order dated 24.01.2022 was issued in favour of the Petitioner by the Opposite Party No.2 for construction of 400 flats at Jindal Nagar, South Block (Sharmik Vihar) at Jindal Steel & Power Limited, shortly hereinafter \"Jspl\". The total amount of the agreement value was Rs.4,39,946,924.13. To execute the said work, the Opposite Party No.2 (Jspl) had given an advance of 8.5% of the contract price amounting to Rs. 3,73,95,490/- and to secure the same, the Petitioner executed Bank Guarantee (B.G.) in favour of Jspl, drawn in Opposite Party Nos.3 and 4 Bank for the said amount. \nThe contract dated 24.01.2022 is a reciprocal one without which it cannot be performed by the Petitioner. As per the said contract, the Petitioner was to complete the work within 8 months from the date of contract. But due to non-fulfillment of the reciprocal promises by Jspl in time, the work could not be executed as per the programme. \nThere are provisions in the contract that the Management of Jspl is to supply free materials in time. However, due to delay in supply of materials, there was massive impact on the work. Further though the Petitioner, as per the work execute d, submitted running bills, the same were not released in time which resulted in suffering from cash inflow and delay in work. The Management of JSPL, without any notice to the Petitioner, reduced the scope of work by 30-40 since March, 2023. It also did not provide sufficient hutment and facilities for the workers as per terms of the contract in terms of the requirement of the Petitioner, for which the work could not run in full swing. \nDue to non-fulfillment of reciprocal promises made by the JSPL, by various letters, the Petitioner drew attention of JSPL in between 22.08.2022 to 20.02.2024 indicating therein as to not handing over a hindrance free site for excavation, non-payment of the deviation quantity of excavation, rock strata found during excavation, nonpayment of deviation quantity of excavation (not estimated at the time of contract allocation) leading to increase in cost and time, continuous delays in providing free issue materials i.e. Backfill material, TMT bars, concrete, structural materials, PS Panel, L-Mesh, u-Mesh, sand, cement, paint etc. labour hutment, free electricity and water. Further there was various revision and rectification of drawings, delay in payment and non reconciliation of accounts and detail deduction sheets. Further the GST payment as per the contract was not released and unilaterally the work was reduced without any intimation or discussion, for which the Petitioner had deployed machinery, equipment, material and manpower. Despite intimation of such hindrances, the Opp. Party has not solved any problem and huge outstanding bill has not been released, for which the Petitioner suffered financial crisis. \nIt is further case of the Petitioner that without clearing the hindrances, as pointed out by the Petitioner, the Opposite Party No.2 (Associate Vice President, Commercial, JSPL) vide letter dated 07.07.2023, issued notice to the Petitioner Company for revision in quantity / termination of contract due to alleged poor performance in the construction work. On receipt of the said letter dated 07.07.2023, the Petitioner, vide letter dated 26.07.2023, wrote to the Opposite Party No.2 that while extension of time has been approved and there is a copy of note sheet reflecting the reason of delay, which is approved by the Petitioner. The Petitioner vide letter dated 11.08.2023, requested the Manager-Contract Cell, JSPL for urgent action for critical material shortage threatening project timeline and considering the situation to take immediate intervention to expedite the resolution of the matter. \nHowever, in violation of terms of the contract from the side of the Management of JSPL, vide letter dated 25.03.2024, the Authorized Signatory of the Management of JSPL communicated to the Petitioner that as per the books of account, there is a debit balance of Rs.4,12,54,904/- towards unadjusted advance and other deductions and it was observed that the Petitioner is not responding to the directions of the Civil Department of the Company, which is allegedly impacting the site progress and such conduct of the Petitioner is against the terms of the work order dated 24.01.2022 and advance against the Petitioner is pending since 18.09.2023. If the payment is not received on or before 30.04.2024, the Management of JSPL will go for encashment of the B.G of Rs.3,73,95,490/- vide B.G. dated 08.03.2022, executed by the Petitioner. \nIn response to the letter dated 25.03.2024, reiterating its stand in reminder letter dated 22.08.2022, a reply was given by the Petitioner to the Opposite Party No.2 vide letter dated 19.04.2024, indicating therein that as the Petitioner has not violated the terms of contract, such communication dated 25.03.2024 is illegal. However, being aggrieved by the action of the Opposite Parties, the Petitioner preferred Arbitration Petition under section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, shortly hereinafter \"the Act, 1996\", before the Senior Civil Judge (Commercial Court), Cuttack, along with Petitions under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 and Order 39 Rule 3 of the CPC for granting ex- parte injunction, prohibiting the Opposite Parties not to encash the B.G. pursuant to the letter dated 25.03.2024. The said Petition was taken up for hearing by the Commercial Court on 30.04.2024. On the very day, the Court below rejected the Petition of the Petitioner Company for ex parte injunction and ordered to issue notice to the Opposite Parties. \n5. As detailed above, knowing about filing of the Writ Petition and passing of the interim order dated 13.05.2024 in I.A. No.6416 of 2024, the Opposite Parties filed I.A. No.6777 of 2024 for vacation of the interim order on the ground that in view of the judgment of this Court reported in AIR 2016 Orissa 103 (M/s Sai Concrete Pavers Pvt. Ltd., Visakhapatnam vs. National Aluminium Company Ltd., Koraput), the Writ Petition is not maintainable. Further, in view of the statutory bar under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, the status quo order dated 13.05.2024 is liable to be vacated. A further stand has been taken in the I.A. that in the matter of invocation of B.G., the Courts can only interfere in exceptional circumstances. The Opposite Party- Company being severely prejudiced due to non-refund of the debit balance totaling to Rs.4,12,54,904/- by the Petitioner, status quo order dated 13.05.2024 needs to be vacated. \nApart from dealing with the judgments referred to in the order dated 13.05.2024 cited by the Petitioner, it has also been stated in the I.A. that Order 39 Rules 1, 2 and 3 of the CPC is not applicable to proceeding under section 9 of the Act, 1996. If such an application is filed, the same can only be considered to be an application under section 9 of the Act, 1996 and any order passed in a section 9 proceeding is appealable under section 37(1) (b) of the Act, 1996. Hence, the writ jurisdiction cannot be invoked to circumvent the procedure under the Act, 1996. \nA stand has also been taken in the I.A. that interpretation and implementation of clause in a contract cannot be the subject matter of a Writ Petition, since the Petitioner has already approached the Commercial Court by way of an Application under section 9 of the Act, 1996 and thus, intended to have the issues decided by an Arbitral Tribunal. \nA further stand has also been taken in the I.A. for vacation of stay on the ground that the Clause 58 of the contract/work order dated 24.01.2022 between the parties provides for arbitration in respect of all disputes and differences of any kind, arising out of or in connection with the contract, whether during the progress of work or after its completion, and whether before or after the termination of contract. \nIt has also been stated in the I.A. that in view of the bar under sections 8 and 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, the Writ Petition assailing an order passed by the Commercial Court rejecting an application under Order 39, Rule 3 of C.P.C. is not maintainable.\n6. In response to the said I.A. filed by the Opposite Parties for vacation of stay so also regarding maintainability of the Writ Petition, the Petitioner has filed an Objection stating therein that the judgment of this Court cited by the Opposite Party Nos. 1 and 2 is not applicable to the present case, as in the said case it was decided that an Appeal under Order 43, Rule 1(r) of the CPC, out of an order passed in an Application under section 9 of the Act, 1996, is not maintainable. In the instant case, the Petitioner has approached this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India to exercise its superintendence power against the order passed by the Commercial Court under Order 39, Rule 3 of the CPC. \nApart from the said stand, it has also been stated that since the B.G. executed by the Petitioner is valid till 05.09.2024, the Opposite Party Nos. 1 and 2 will no way be prejudiced as the Petitioner is to get huge amount of pending bills along with other amounts from the Opposite Party. \nIt has also been stated in the Objection that in view of specific allegations, as detailed in Paragraph 18 of the Writ Petition, the Opposite Party Nos. 1 & 2 issued letter dated 25.03.2024 through their authorized signatory stating therein that as per the books of account, there is a debit balance of Rs.4,12,54,904/- towards unadjusted advance and other deductions. If the payment is not received before 30.04.2024, the Opposite Parties will go for encashment of the B.G. of Rs.3,73,95,490/- vide BG dated 08.03.2022 and the said letter is illegal as the Petitioner is entitled to more amount from the Opposite Parties. \nA stand has also been taken in the Objection that vide letter dated 11.05.2024, addressed to the Opposite Parties, the Petitioner has requested to release all pending bills and issue gate pass for removal of machinery, shuttering materials and other unused building materials, such as tiles, plumbing items etc. so also requested to withdraw the claim of invocation of B.G. and release all outstanding payments and dues.\nA further stand has been taken in the Objection that the contract executed between the parties requires reciprocal promise in which the Opposite Parties failed to discharge their obligations. The Petitioner, vide various letters, including letter dated 26.07.2023, intimated the Opposite Parties regarding non- performance of their contractual obligations. The Petitioner, vide communication dated 26.06.2023, intimated the Opposite Parties regarding their failure to supply free material in time and also proposed to conduct a joint meeting to sort out the issues and prepare collective plan. However, the Opposite Parties have shown no interest, as proposed by the Petitioner. \nIt has also been stated in the Objection that as per the condition of contract, electricity and water supply must be provided by the owner (Opposite Party) at one point free of cost to the Contractor. The Petitioner, vide letter dated 24.02.2022 and 30.03.2022, pointed out that it did not receive the same properly at the beginning. In fact, almost for a month or two, the Petitioner was told that it must take the same from other Contractor namely, SPD, and the same would not be provided to the Petitioner by the Opposite Parties, which resulted in a huge hindrance to start the work. It has also been alleged in the Objection that the Petitioner has not received all the drawings as on 26.07.2023 from the Management of JSPL, which in fact, is one of the reasons for extension that has been applied and approved by the Opposite Parties. Further, there have been several revisions in drawing which also affected the progress of work. \nIt has also been alleged in the Objection that the Opposite Party Nos.1 and 2 did not intend to pay the bills of the Petitioner and have incorrectly taken measurements to reduce the quantity of work completed and consequently, undervalued the bills. Also, the Opposite Parties have not released previously withheld quantities nor finalized the deviation items, for which payment is due. It has also been alleged that the Opposite Party Nos. 1 and 2 are refusing to allow the Petitioner to remove its machineries and materials from the site, which may have criminal conspiracy to exploit the Petitioner's survival without payment. \nA stand has also been taken in the Objection that the issues regarding pending bills, deviation from the original scope, withheld amounts, claims for delay in supply of materials and idling of machinery, manpower, interest and overhead, have been pending since long and the Opposite Party Nos. 1 and 2 did not address these issues nor deputed any person for reconciliation or meeting, despite repeated reminders and letters given by the Petitioner. Further, the contract being a reciprocal one, due to non-fulfillment of the reciprocal promise by the Opposite Party Nos. 1 and 2 in time, the work could not be executed as per the programme. Further, the Opposite Party Nos. 1 and 2 arbitrarily stopped issuing gate pass from September, 2023 to February, 2024 for which the personnel of the Petitioner could not enter the premises and thereby work was stopped and it suffered loss of huge amount of money and the Petitioner is entitled to running bills and other cost and damage to the tune of near about Rs.20 crores from the Opposite Party Nos. 1 and 2. \nIt has also been stated in the Objection that it is stand of the Opposite Party Nos. 1 and 2 that vide letter dated 07.07.2023 it issued notice for revision in quantity / termination of contract due to poor performance in the construction work. It is well evident from the documents appended to the I.A. that the Opposite Party Nos. 1 and 2 prepared minutes dated 30.04.2024 in which 30 days' time was allowed to the Petitioner to rectify the defects. On the other hand, before expiry of 30 days, vide letter dated 07.05.2024 under Annexure-H to the I.A., the Opposite Party No.2 issued letter to the Bank for encashment of B.G., which shows that the Opposite Party No.2 has acted in a very unfair and mala fide manner. The prayer to vacate the interim order has also been opposed to on the ground that the Petitioner has huge outstanding against the Opposite Party and though it has submitted the R/A bills to the Opposite Parties, the same are yet to be cleared. \nFurther, it has been averred that reconciliation of account would be sufficient to establish that allegation of refund towards unadjusted advance of Rs.3,12,64,904/- is incorrect whereas, the B.G. amount is Rs.3,73,95,490/-. As such, without reconciliation of the bills of the Petitioner, the letter dated 25.03.2024 for encashment of B.G. is illegal and arbitrary. \nA stand has also been taken in the Objection that the judgments cited by the Petitioner seeking for interim relief are applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case and as per the letter dated 29.11.2023 submitted by the Petitioner, as at Annexure-9 of the Writ Petition, the payment due against the Opposite Parties is for an amount of Rs.514.01 lakhs. The Opposite Parties, without paying the same, arbitrarily issued letter dated 25.03.2024. After receiving the letter dated 25.03.2024, the Petitioner issued a letter dated 19.04.2024 under Annexure-11. Apart from that, the Petitioner has already invoked the arbitration clause and nominated Hon'ble Justice B.N. Rath (Former Judge of this Court) as its Arbitrator, but the Opposite Parties have not yet responded to the same. \nIt has also been stated in the Objection that there is no clear bar in the Arbitration Act as well as in Commercial Courts Act not to exercise the power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Rather, in exceptional circumstances, when the action of a party is completely perverse and acted in bad faith, the interference of the writ court is permissible. A stand has also been taken in the Objection that if the encashment of BG is not stayed, it will cause irretrievable injustice to the Petitioner as the letter dated 07.05.2024 to encash the B.G. was only issued after notice was issued to the Opposite Parties by the Commercial Court pursuant to the impugned order dated 30.04.2024. Thus, the action of the Opposite Parties is not fair and mala fide. Accordingly, it has been stated that the prayer of the Opposite Parties to vacate the interim order passed by this Court is liable to be rejected. \n7. To substantiate the stand taken in the Application for vacation of stay, Mr. Mukherjee, learned Senior Counsel for the Opposite Parties, relying on the judgment in Perin Hoshang Davierwalla vs. Kobad Dorabji Davierwalla, reported in 2014 SCC Online Bombay 534 and in Deepak Mittal vs. Geeta Sharma, reported in 2017 SCC OnLine Del 10365, submitted that an order making or rejecting an Application for ex parte ad-interim injunction is essentially an order under section 9 of the Act, 1996 only and not otherwise. Mr. Mukherjee further submitted that the scope and ambit of the Act, 1996 does not empower the Commercial Court to entertain any Application beyond the scope of the Act, 1996 be it an Application under Order 39 Rules-1 and 2 or 3, CPC. Even if such an application is filed, the same can only be considered to be an application under section 9 of the Act, 1996. \nMr. Mukherjee further submitted that in view of the specific provisions under section 37 (1)(b) of the Act, 1996, any order passed in a section 9 application, including interlocutory order, is an appealable order under the said provision. Hence, as there is a specific alternative remedy of Appeal against the interlocutory order passed in a section 9 proceeding, the Writ Petition is not maintainable. To substantiate such submission the following judgments were cited:- \nMr. Mukherjee, learned Senior Counsel, relying on the judgment of the apex Court in Gujarat Maritime Board vs. L & T Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd. and others, reported in (2016) 10 SCC 46, submitted that the scope of interference with regard to encashment of B.G. is very limited and the Court can only interfere with regard to encashment of B.G., where allowing encashment of an unconditional B.G. or a letter of credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned or in case of fraud of an egregious nature, which would vitiate the very foundation of such B.G. or letter of credit and the beneficiary seeks to take advantage of such situation. \nMr. Mukherjee, learned Senior Counsel further submitted that whether the cancellation of contract is legal and proper, and whether on such cancellation, the B.G. could have been invoked on the extreme situation of the party justifying its inability to perform its obligations under the contract, etc. are not within the purview of an inquiry under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Between the Bank and the Opposite Parties, the moment there is a written demand for invoking the B.G., pursuant to breach of the covenants between the parties is satisfied, the Bank is bound to honour payment under the guarantee. It was also submitted by the learned Senior Counsel that the Writ Petition is not maintainable and the Court below was justified to reject the Petition to pass an ad interim ex parte injunction before hearing the Opposite Party and since the section 9 Application is pending before the Court below, at this juncture, the Writ Petition is not maintainable. To substantiate the said submission, the following judgments were cited:\ni) National Highway Authority of India Vs. Ganga Enterprises and others, reported in (2003) 7 SCC ii) Adani Agri Fresh Ltd. Vs. Mahaboob Sharif and others, reported in (2016) 14 SCC 517. \niii) Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board vs. CCL Products (India) Ltd., reported in (2019) 20 SCC iv) Trafalgar House Construction (T) Satyam Shankaranarayana (JV) vs. State of Orissa and others, reported in 2007 (Suppl. 2) OLR 822 : CLT (2007) Supp 394.\nv) Deep Industries Limited Vs. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited and others, (2020) 15 SCC vi) Deepak Mittal & another Vs. Geeta Sharma & others, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 10365,\n8. In response to the submissions made by the learned Senior Counsel for the Opposite Parties, Mr. Mishra, learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that even if it is accepted that against an interim order passed in a Section-9 proceeding alternative remedy is available under section 37 (1)(b) of the Act, 1996 to prefer an Appeal, the present Writ Petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is maintainable. Mr. Mishra, further submitted that the Petitioner preferred the Writ Petition in view of lack of clarity under Section 37(1)(b) of the Act, 1996 that even interlocutory orders passed by the Commercial Court in a Section-9 application are also appealable and under such bonafide impression that only final order granting or rejecting an application under Section-9 is appealable, being remediless, the Petitioner has preferred the present Writ Petition.\nTo substantiate such submission Mr. Mishra cited the following judgments:-\ni) Santosh Kumar Acharya Vs. Ratnakar Swain, reported in 2023 SCC OnLine Orissa 2301 ii) Odisha State Road Transport Corporation, Bhubaneswar vs. ARSS Bus Terminal Pvt. Ltd., Bhubaneswar, reported in 2023 (I) ILR-CUT-253 iii) Bhaven Construction through authorized signatory Premjibhai K. Shah Vs. Executive Engineer, Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited and another, reported in (2022) 1 SCC 75.\niv) Baburam Prakash Chandra Maheshwari vs. Antarim Zila Parishad Now Zila Parishad, Muzaffarnagar, reported in AIR 1969 SC 556 Mr. Mishra, learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner, relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel India Ltd. Vs. Essar Bulk Terminal Ltd., reported in (2022) 1 SCC 712, submitted that Applications for interim relief are inherent applications, which are required to be disposed of urgently. Interim relief is granted in aid of final relief. The object is to ensure protection of the property being the subject matter of arbitration and/or otherwise to ensure that the arbitration proceedings do not become infructuous and the arbitral award does not become an award on paper, of no real value. \nSimilarly, relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Gangotri Enterprises Ltd. vs. Union of India and others, reported in (2016) 11 SCC 720, Mr. Mishra, learned Senior Counsel submitted that the Opposite Parties are now claiming alleged unadjusted amount given to the Petitioner as advance to carry out the contractual job so also penalty, which is yet to be adjudicated upon in an arbitral proceeding and the Petitioner's running bills and other demands are yet to be honoured by the Opposite Parties. Hence, the Petitioner has made out a prima facie case in its favour for grant of injunction against the Opposite Parties not to invoke the B.G. Relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Union of India and another vs. Millenium Delhi Broadcast LLP and others reported in (2022) 7 SCC 67, Mr. Mishra, learned Senior Counsel submitted that the B.G. given by the Petitioner was executed as security against the advance given by the Opposite Party-Company and is not a performance B.G. Hence, the alleged unadjusted advance needs computation. Unless and until the claim made by the Petitioner is decided by the Arbitral Tribunal, the Opposite Parties will not be justified to encash the B.G. Relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Maria Margarida Sequeira Fernandes and others vs. Erasmo Jack De Sequeira (dead) through L.Rs. reported in (2012) 5 SCC 370, Mr. Mishra, learned Senior Counsel further submitted that unless the Petitioner is protected, so far as invocation of B.G., it will cause irretrievable injustice to the Petitioner, as huge amount in crores are laying unpaid at the end of the Opposite Party Company despite repeated demands made by the Petitioner to make the payment. If the Opposite Parties are permitted to encash the B.G., which is valid till 05.09.2024, there will be a great set back to the Petitioner Company affecting its financial condition, which may lead to irretrievable harm and injustice to the Petitioner Company, as the conduct of the Opposite Parties have weakened the financial condition of his client. Mr. Mishra further submitted that the pleadings made in the present Writ Petition and the documents annexed hereto to substantiate the said stand are same as in ARBP No.14 of 2024.The Court below failed to take note of the pleadings and contents of the documents appended to the section 9 Application. \n9. Upon hearing the learned Counsel for the parties and after going through the record so also case laws cited by the learned Senior Counsel for the parties, the following points emerge for consideration. \n(I) Whether an interlocutory order passed by the Commercial Court in a section 9 application under the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, rejecting the prayer of the petitioner for exemption of notice to the opposite party and pass an ad interim ex parte injunction, is appealable under section 37(1) (b) of the said Act, 1996 so also Section 13 of the C.C. Act, 2015? \n(II) If not what is the remedy available to an aggrieved party to challenge the said interlocutory order? (III) Whether the Commercial Court was justified to reject the application filed under Order 39, Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure in the section 9 application? \n(IV) Whether injunction against invocation of unconditional bank guarantee is permissible? If so, when and under what circumstances? \n10. So far as Point Nos.i) & ii), the same being interrelated, are dealt with and answered together. \nBefore dealing with the said points, it would be apt to extract below Sections 8 and 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, Order 43 Rule 1(r) of C.P.C and Sections 9 and 37 of the Act, 1996 for ready reference:\nCommercial Courts Act, 2015 \"Section-8.

Though the High Court of Gouhati in Sati Oil Udyog Ltd. Vs. Avanti Projectrs & infrastructure, reported in 2010 1 GLT 141, High Court of Mumbai in Perin Hoshang Davierwalla and ors. Vs.

Cocosath Health Products, reported in 2020 SCC OnLine Ker 5476 have taken a contrary view as to maintainability of an Appeal under section 37(1) (b) of the Act, 1996 against an interlocutory order passed by the Commercial Court in a section 9 application, during pendency of the said application. \n12. So far as judgment of this Court in M/s. Sai Concrete Pavers Pvt. Ltd.(supra) , cited by the learned Senior Counsel for the Opposite Parties, the issue before the coordinate Bench was as to whether separate applications under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 so also Rule 3 of CPC are required to be filed in application moved under section 9 of the Act,1996 and if an application moved before the Court under Order 39 Rule 3 of CPC seeking for an ad interim ex parte injunction stands rejected, is the said order appealable under Order 43 Rule-1(r) C.P.C.? Paragraphs 5 to 8, 11 and 12 of the said judgment, being relevant, are extracted below:\n\"5. Mr. Rao, learned counsel for the appellant placing reliance upon paragraph-11 of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of A. Venkatasubbiah Naidu v. S. Chellappan, reported in AIR 2000 SC 3032 contended that order passed either refusing or granting an application under Rule-3 of Order 39, CPC is appealable one. Mr. Rao further submits that there are two provisions under the Act, namely, Section-9 and Section 17 of the Act, which enable either the Court or the Arbitrator to pass interim orders or make an interim arrangement. Section 9 of the Act empowers the Court to pass interim orders or make interim arrangement in contemplation of an arbitral proceeding. Though the provisions of Section 9 of the Act deals with entertaining an application for interim measure it does not make any provision as to how the interest of the aggrieved party is to be protected before the petition under Section 9 of the Act is taken up on merit. Thus, the application filed for injunction can only be entertained under the provisions of Order 39 Rules 1 and 2, CPC and not otherwise. Thus, the appeal against the said order is maintainable before this Court. \n6. Right of appeal is not inherent one. It is a creature of the statute, and should be considered on interpretation of the relevant provision. Thus, it is to be examined as to whether the appellant has a statutory right to prefer an appeal against rejection of an application under Order 39 Rule-3, CPC. On a plain reading of Section 104 as well as Order 43 Rule-1, CPC, which provides an appeal against order does not include an order of rejection of an application under Order 39 Rule-3, CPC. \n7. Law is no more res integra on this issue. This Court in a decision in the case of Sri. Rabindra Kumar Mohanty v. Smt. Sujata Mohapatra (FAO No. 86 of 2012 disposed of on 10.07.2015) relying upon A. Venkatasubbiah Naidu (supra) as well as decisions reported in 1989 (II) OLR 455 and AIR 1993 (Orissa) 78 held as under : -\n\"6. In view of the discussion made above and the law laid down (supra), I have no hesitation to hold that an appeal is maintainable as against an ex parte ad interim order of injunction as provided under Order XLIII Rule (1)(r) C.P.C., but not against the order refusing to exercise power under Order 39 Rule 3 C.P.C......\"\n8. Thus, it can be unhesitatingly held that no appeal lies against an order rejecting an application under Order 39 Rule-3, CPC\".\nxxx xxx xxx 11. Section 9(1)(ii)(d) of the Act empowers the Court, namely, the District Judge to make any interim arrangement including that of injunction or appointment of receiver. The language employed in Section 9 of the Act, more particularly the words \"and the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it\"\nmakes it clear that the Court shall have the same power to make any order in any proceedings under Section 9 of the Act. Thus, an order making or rejecting an application for ad-interim injunction is essentially an order under Section 9 of the Act only and not otherwise. Further, the scope and ambit of the Act does not empower the District Judge to entertain any application beyond the scope of this Act, be it an application under Order 39 Rules-1 and 2 or 3, CPC. Even if such an application is filed the same can only be considered to be an application under the provisions of Section 9 of the Act. \n12. Learned counsel for the parties made arguments at length on merits of the case relying upon different case laws of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. This Court does not feel it prudent to delve into the merit of the case at this stage which can be effectively gone into at the time of hearing of the petition under Section 9 of the Act. Thus, in view of the discussions made above, this Court holds that the appeal under Order 43 Rule-1(r), CPC is not maintainable and the same is accordingly dismissed.\" \n(Emphasis supplied) \n13. From the discussions made above, legal provisions enshrined under the relevant Acts and C.P.C., as extracted above, so also judgments of various High Courts for and against the point regarding maintainability of an Appeal under Section 37 (1)(b) of the Act,1996, this Court is in respectful agreement with the views taken by various High Courts to the effect that interlocutory order passed by the Court, refusing to entertain an application under Order 39, Rule 3 of C.P.C. to pass an ad interim exparte injunction order in a section 9 application filed under the Act,1996 is not appealable. However, the reasons to agree with the said views are slightly different, as detailed below:\ni) As per the settled position of law, it is to be presumed that while enacting the subsequent law i.e. C.C. Act, 2015, the legislature is conscious of the provisions of the Act, 1996 prior in time and therefore, the later Act shall prevail. \nii) As provided under section 21 of the C.C. Act, 2015, the said Act shall have overriding effect. It provides that, save as otherwise provided, the provisions of the said Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force. \niii) As held by the Supreme Court in Kandala Export Corporation & Another Vs. M/s OCI Corporation & Another, reported in (2018) 14 SCC 715, both the Act, 1996 and C.C. Act, 2015 call for a harmonious interpretation. If at all there is any conflict, as to the substantive provisions, the Act, 1996 prevails; but it has left the procedural niceties to the C.C. Act, 2015. \niv) Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 provides, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, \"subject to the provisions of section 13\", shall be raised only in an Appeal against the decree of the Commercial Court.\n(Emphasis supplied)\nv) Proviso under section 13 of the C.C. Act, 2015 mandates that an Appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court, that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of C.P.C. and Section 37 of the Act, 1996.\nvi) In view of the proviso under section 13 of the C.C. Act, 2015, read with Order 43 Rule 1(r) C.P.C., orders passed by the Court, exercising power under Order 39 Rules 1, 2, 4 & 10, are appealable.\nvii) Order 39 Rule 3 of C.P.C. mandates, the Court shall in all cases, except where it appears that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay, before granting an injunction, direct notice of the application to the Opposite Party. However, if the Court grants injunction before noticing the Opposite Party, it shall record the reasons for ordering so. \n(Emphasis supplied) \nviii) There is no such provision of appeal under Order 43 or Section 104 of C.P.C, if the Court declines to exercise its exceptional/special power under Order 39, Rule 3 C.P.C. (which would be subject to recording the reasons for ordering so) to exempt notice to the Opposite Party before passing an ad interim injunction under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 of C.P.C.\nix) In view of the provisions under Order-43, Rule 1(r) of C.P.C., an order passed in a section 9 application filed under the Act, 1996, granting the injunction under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 C.P.C. or refusing to vacate the order of injunction on filing application under Order 39 Rule 4 C.P.C. are appealable, but not an order declining to exempt notice to the Opposite Party before passing an ad interim injunction. \nx) As held by the coordinate Bench in M/s. Sai Concrete Pavers Pvt. Ltd. (supra), even if separate applications are filed under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 or Rule 3 C.P.C. in a section 9 proceeding, the same is to be considered as an application under Section 9 of the Act,1996. In addition to the said views of the coordinate Bench, this Court is of the view that such an interlocutory order of refusal to exempt notice to the Opposite Party before passing an ad interim injunction in a section 9 proceeding, being akin to rejection of prayer made in an application under Order 39 Rule 3 C.P.C., is not appealable, as held in the said case. \nxi) In view of the above, this Court is of further view that interlocutory order passed in a section 9 application moved before the District Judge/ Commercial Court under the Act, 1996, rejecting the prayer of the Applicant to exempt notice to the Opposite Party and pass an ex parte ad interim injunction is not an appealable order and the party aggrieved has to approach the writ court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.\nBoth the Point Nos.i) & ii) are answered accordingly.\n14. So far as Point Numbers iii) and iv), regarding justification to reject the application for exemption of notice to the Opposite Parties and scope of judicial interference as to granting injunction against invocation of an unconditional Bank Guarantee, the said points are dealt with together for the sake of clarity and being interconnected. \n15. A Bank Guarantee is an independent and distinct contract between the bank and the beneficiary and is not qualified by the terms of the underlying transaction, or the primary contract between the person at whose instance the bank guarantee is given and the beneficiary. As held by the Supreme Court in Hindustan Steel Works Construction Ltd. Vs. Tarapore & Co reported in (1996) 5 SCC 34), the nature of obligation of the bank is absolute, and not dependent upon the inter se disputes or proceedings. The bank is liable to pay as soon as the demand is made by the creditor as held in National Thermal Power Corpn. Ltd. Vs. Flowmore Pvt. Ltd, reported in (1995) 4 SCC 515.\n16. In Himadri Chemicals Industries Ltd. Vs. Coal Tar Refining Co, reported in (2007) 8 SCC 110, the Supreme Court has held that in the matter of invocation of a bank guarantee or of credit, a bank guarantee is an independent and a letter separate contract and is absolute in nature. The existence of disputes between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of a bank guarantee, or letter of credit. In the matter of invocation, it is not open to a bank to rely upon the terms of the underlying contract between the parties. The Supreme Court has enunciated the following principles in the matter of injunction for restraining encashment of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit:-\n\"(i) While dealing with an application for injunction in the course of commercial dealings, and when an unconditional bank guarantee or letter of credit is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee or a letter of credit in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes relating to the terms of the contract. \n(ii) The bank giving such guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms, irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. \n(iii) The courts should be slow in granting an order of injunction to restrain the realization of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit. \n(iv) Since a bank guarantee or a letter of credit is an independent and a separate contract and is absolute in nature, the existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of bank guarantee or letter of credit. \n(v) Injunction against encashment may be granted if there is fraud of an egregious nature which would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee or letter of credit, and the beneficiary seeks to take advantage of the situation. \n(vi) Allowing encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee or a letter of credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned.\" \n17. The principle laid down in Himadri Chemicals Industries Ltd. (supra) was followed by the Supreme Court in the matter of Vinitec Electronics Pvt. Ltd. v. HCL Info Systems Ltd, reported in (2008) 1 SCC 544 , wherein it was held that in the case of an unconditional bank guarantee, the same are payable by the guarantor on demand. When in the course of commercial dealings, unconditional guarantees have been given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realise such a bank guarantee in terms thereof, irrespective of any pending disputes. The bank guarantee is an independent contract between the bank and the beneficiary thereof. For a party to claim that the case falls under the exception of fraud or special equities, proper pleadings must be made out which lay down the factual foundation of the allegation of fraud or special equities. \n18. However, in NHAI v. Ganga Enterprise, reported in AIR 2003 SC 3823 : (2003) 7 SCC 410, the Supreme Court has held that a bank guarantee has to be strictly construed as per the terms of the guarantee. The invocation must be in accordance with the terms of the bank guarantee, and any deviation therefrom, would render the invocation bad in law. If the enforcement is in terms of the guarantee, the courts would normally refrain from interfering with the enforcement of the bank guarantee. Interference would be justified if the invocation is contrary to the terms of the guarantee, or in the case of fraud. \n19. A bank guarantee must be honoured strictly in accordance with the terms of the guarantee, subject to two exceptions. The first is in a clear case of fraud, which the bank has notice of, and the beneficiary seeks to take advantage of. \n20. The Supreme Court in General Electric Technical Jasp Services Company Inc. v. M/s. Punj Sons (P) Ltd. and another, reported in AIR 1991 SC 1994, held that by interim injunction under Order 39 Rule 1 of the CPC, bank guarantee cannot be interdicted by Court in the absence of fraud or special equities in the form of preventing irretrievable injustice between the parties. It was further held that it is the fraud of beneficiary, not the fraud of somebody else. \n21. In Svenska Handelsnbanken v. Indian Charge Chrome, reported in (1994) 1 SCC 502, the Supreme Court has held that fraud in connection with the bank guarantee would vitiate the very foundation of the bank guarantee. The fraud must be of an egregious nature such as to vitiate the entire underlying transaction. \n22. As held by the Supreme Court in B.S.E.S. Ltd. (Now Reliance Energy Ltd.) v. Fenner India Ltd., reported in (2006) 2 SCC 728,the second exception to the general rule of non- intervention is if there are 'special equities' in favour of injunction, such as when 'irretrievable injury or 'irretrievable injustice' would occur if such an injunction was not granted. \n23. The Supreme Court in Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board , reported in (2019) 20 SCC 669 , while taking note of its earlier decisions in the matters of Ansal Engg. Projects Ltd. v. Tehri Hydro Development Corpn. Ltd., reported in (1996) 5 SCC 450, SBI v. Mula Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd., reported in (2006) 6 SCC 293, and Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar, reported in (1999) 8 SCC 436, held that in absence of a case of fraud, irretrievable injustice and special equities, the Court should not interfere with the invocation or encashment of a bank guarantee so long as the invocation was in terms of the bank guarantee. \n24. Thereafter, in Standard Chartered Bank , reported in (2020) 13 SCC 574 the Supreme Court again noticed its earlier decision in Himadri Chemicals Industries Ltd.(supra) and held that bank guarantee is an independent contract between bank and the beneficiary and the bank is always obliged to honour its guarantee as long as it is unconditional and irrevocable one. It has been further held that the dispute between the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the bank has given the guarantee is immaterial and is of no consequence, however, exceptions to this rule are when there is a clear case of fraud, irretrievable injustice or special equities. It was also held that the Court ordinarily should not interfere with the invocation or encashment of the bank guarantee so long as the invocation is in terms of the bank guarantee. It was held that once the demand was made in due compliance with bank guarantees, it was not open for the bank to determine as to whether the invocation of the bank guarantee was justified so long as the invocation was in terms of the bank guarantee. Relevant paragraphs of the said judgment are reproduced below:\n\"19. The law relating to invocation of bank guarantees with the consistent line of precedents of this Court is well settled and a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Ansal Engg. Projects Ltd. v. Tehri Hydro Development Corpn. Ltd. [Ansal Engg. Projects Ltd. v. Tehri Hydro Development Corpn. Ltd., (1996) 5 SCC 450] held thus: (SCC p. 454, paras 4-5) \"4. It is settled law that bank guarantee is an independent and distinct contract between the bank and the beneficiary and is not qualified by the underlying transaction and the validity of the primary contract between the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given and the beneficiary. Unless fraud or special equity exists, is pleaded and prima facie established by strong evidence as a triable issue, the beneficiary cannot be restrained from encashing the bank guarantee even if dispute between the beneficiary and the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given by the bank, had arisen in performance of the contract or execution of the works undertaken in furtherance thereof. The bank unconditionally and irrevocably promised to pay, on demand, the amount of liability undertaken in the guarantee without any demur or dispute in terms of the bank guarantee. The object behind is to inculcate respect for free flow of commerce and trade and faith in the commercial banking transactions unhedged by pending disputes between the beneficiary and the contractor. \n5. ... The court exercising its power cannot interfere with enforcement of bank guarantee/letters of credit except only in cases where fraud or special equity is prima facie made out in the case as triable issue by strong evidence so as to prevent irretrievable injustice to the parties.\"\n(emphasis supplied)\n20. A bank guarantee constitutes an independent contract. In Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar [Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar, (1999) 8 SCC 436] , a two-Judge Bench of this Court formulated the condition upon which the invocation of the bank guarantee depends in the following terms:\n(SCC p. 442, para 9) \"9. What is important, therefore, is that the bank guarantee should be in unequivocal terms, unconditional and recite that the amount would be paid without demur or objection and irrespective of any dispute that might have cropped up or might have been pending between the beneficiary under the bank guarantee or the person on whose behalf the guarantee was furnished. The terms of the bank guarantee are, therefore, extremely material. Since the bank guarantee represents an independent contract between the bank and the beneficiary, both the parties would be bound by the terms thereof. \nThe invocation, therefore, will have to be in accordance with the terms of the bank guarantee, or else, the invocation itself would be bad.\" \n22. Taking note of the exposition of law on the subject in Himadri Chemicals Industries Ltd. v. Coal Tar Refining Co. [Himadri Chemicals Industries Ltd. v. Coal Tar Refining Co., (2007) 8 SCC 110] , a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Gujarat Maritime Board v. Larsen & Toubro Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd. [Gujarat Maritime Board v. Larsen & Toubro Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd., (2016) 10 SCC 46 : (2017) 1 SCC (Civ) 458] has laid down the principles for grant or refusal for invocation of bank guarantee or a letter of credit. The relevant paragraph is as under: (Himadri Chemicals Industries Ltd. case [Himadri Chemicals Industries Ltd. v. Coal Tar Refining Co., (2007) 8 SCC 110] , SCC pp. 117-18, para 14) \"14. From the discussions made hereinabove relating to the principles for grant or refusal to grant of injunction to restrain enforcement of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit, we find that the following principles should be noted in the matter of injunction to restrain the encashment of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit:\n(i) While dealing with an application for injunction in the course of commercial dealings, and when an unconditional bank guarantee or letter of credit is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realise such a bank guarantee or a letter of credit in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes relating to the terms of the contract.\n(ii) The bank giving such guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer.\n( iii ) The courts should be slow in granting an order of injunction to restrain the realisation of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit. \n(iv) Since a bank guarantee or a letter of credit is an independent and a separate contract and is absolute in nature, the existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of bank guarantees or letters of credit. \n(v) Fraud of an egregious nature which would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee or letter of credit and the beneficiary seeks to take advantage of the situation.\n(vi) Allowing encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee or a letter of credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned.\" \n23. The settled position in law that emerges from the precedents of this Court is that the bank guarantee is an independent contract between bank and the beneficiary and the bank is always obliged to honour its guarantee as long as it is an unconditional and irrevocable one. The dispute between the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the bank has given the guarantee is immaterial and is of no consequence. There are, however, exceptions to this rule when there is a clear case of fraud, irretrievable injustice or special equities. The Court ordinarily should not interfere with the invocation or encashment of the bank guarantee so long as the invocation is in terms of the bank guarantee. \n26. In our considered view, once the demand was made in due compliance with bank guarantees, it was not open for the appellant Bank to determine as to whether the invocation of the bank guarantee was justified so long as the invocation was in terms of the bank guarantee. The demand once made would oblige the bank to pay under the terms of the bank guarantee and it is not the case of the appellant Bank that its defence falls in any of the exception to the rule of case of fraud, irretrievable injustice and special equities. In absence thereof, it is not even open for the Court to interfere with the invocation and encashment of the bank guarantee so long as the invocation was in terms of the bank guarantee and this is what has been observed by the Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned judgment [Heavy Engg. Corpn. Ltd. v. Standard Chartered Bank, 2019 SCC OnLine Cal 617 : (2019) 3 Cal LT 133] and that reflected the correct legal position.\" \n(Emphasis supplied) \n25. So far as the judgment cited by the Petitioner, in Arcelormittal Nippon Steel (India) Ltd. (supra), the Supreme Court has held as follows:-\n\"88. Applications for interim relief are inherently applications which are required to be disposed of urgently. Interim relief is granted in aid of final relief. The object is to ensure protection of the property being the subject-matter of arbitration and/or otherwise ensure that the arbitration proceedings do not become infructuous and the arbitral award does not become an award on paper, of no real value.\"\n(Emphasis supplied) In Gangotri Enterprises Ltd. (supra), the Supreme Court, vide Paragraph Nos.39, 40 & 43, held/observed as follows:-\n\"39. Coming now to the facts of the case at hand, we find that wordings of Clause 62 of the contract in question with which we are concerned is identical to that of Clause 18 of Raman Iron Foundry case [Union of India v. Raman Iron Foundry, (1974) 2 SCC 231] . Clause 62 of GCC provides for determination of contract owing to default of contractor. The relevant portion of Clause 62 reads as under:\n\"The amounts thus to be forfeited or recovered may be deducted from any monies then due or which at any time thereafter may become due to the contractor by the Railways under this or any other contract or otherwise.\" \n40. On perusal of the record of the case, we find that firstly, arbitration proceedings in relation to the contract dated 22-8-2005 are still pending. Secondly, the sum claimed by the respondents from the appellant does not relate to the contract for which the bank guarantee had been furnished but it relates to another contract dated 22-8-2005 for which no bank guarantee had been furnished. Thirdly, the sum claimed by the respondents from the appellant is in the nature of damages, which is not yet adjudicated upon in arbitration proceedings. Fourthly, the sum claimed is neither a sum due in praesenti nor a sum payable. In other words, the sum claimed by the respondents is neither an admitted sum and nor a sum which stood adjudicated by any court of law in any judicial proceedings but it is a disputed sum, and lastly, the bank guarantee in question being in the nature of a performance guarantee furnished for execution work of contract dated 14-7-2006 (AnandVihar works) and the work having been completed to the satisfaction of the respondents, they had no right to encash the bank guarantee. \n43. In the light of foregoing discussion, we hold that the appellants have made out a prima facie case in their favour for grant of injunction against the respondents so also they have made out a case of balance of convenience and irreparable loss in their favour as was held by this Court in Raman Iron Foundry case [Union of India v. Raman Iron Foundry, (1974) 2 SCC 231] . They are, therefore, entitled to claim injunction against the respondent in relation to encashment of Bank Guarantee No. 12/2006 dated 4-8-2006.\" \n(Emphasis Supplied) In Union of India (supra), the Supreme Court, vide Paragraph Nos.14 and 15, held/observed as follows:-\n\"14. Clause 9 of the tender document enables the appellant to encash the bank guarantee, in case of failure on the part of the licensee either to deposit licence fee within 7 days of the beginning of each year or if the licensee stops the service without giving one year's notice. The bank guarantee can also be invoked if the licensee is declared or applies for being declared insolvent or bankrupt. There is no dispute that the licensee did not commence its operations and therefore the second condition does not apply. Admittedly, the third condition is not applicable to the facts of the case. According to the appellant, bank guarantee was invoked due to failure on the part of the licensee to deposit the licence fee within 7 days of beginning of the year. Essentially, the bank guarantee given by the respondent is a performance bank guarantee and was intended to ensure the due performance of the licence agreement. A perusal of the conditions of the relevant clauses of the agreement clearly shows that according to Article 1.1 of Schedule 'C' to the agreement, the licence was granted for period of 10 years which has to be reckoned from the date of issuance of WOL by the WPC. Admittedly, WOL was never issued by WPC. A Deemed Operational Licence, which was to be issued by the appellant, was not contemplated in the agreement. \n15. We are of the opinion that the Tribunal did not commit any error in its interpretation of the clause pertaining to bank guarantee by holding that the conditions provided therein have not been satisfied for the invocation of the bank guarantee.\" \n(Emphasis Supplied) In Maria Margarida Sequeira Fernandes(supra) the Supreme Court ,vide Paragraph No.84, held/observed as follows:-\n\"84. In order to grant or refuse injunction, the judicial officer or the Judge must carefully examine the entire pleadings and documents with utmost care and seriousness. The safe and better course is to give a short notice on the injunction application and pass an appropriate order after hearing both the sides. In case of grave urgency, if it becomes imperative to grant an ex parte ad interim injunction, it should be granted for a specified period, such as, for two weeks. In those cases, the plaintiff will have no inherent interest in delaying disposal of injunction application after obtaining an ex parte ad interim injunction.\" \n(Emphasis Supplied)\n26. After analysing the judgments of the Supreme Court on the point, as detailed above, and summarizing the principles decided there in as to the scope of interference / injunction against invocation of BG, this Court is of the following views:-\ni) The Courts should be slow in granting the injunction to restraint the realization of a bank guarantee ii) However, there are two well recognized exceptions to this rule which are:\n(a) A fraud of egregious nature. \n(b) The invocation/encashment of bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties. \niii) In some cases third exception is also carved out viz.\nwhen there are special equities in favour of the person seeking injunction.\niv) In case the bank guarantee is not invoked in terms thereof, the bank can refuse to honour the bank guarantee, as in that case it would not be in accordance with the agreed stipulation and invocation would be improper. This can be treated as the fourth exception, as in such a case injunction can be granted. \nPoint No.iv) is answered accordingly. \n27. Now the question is, whether any of the above established grounds for injunction against invocation of BG, has been made out by the Petitioner. \nTo determine Point Nos. iii) and iv), it would be appropriate to examine the averments made in the section 9 application so also the documents appended there to in support of such averments, which are in ditto , as made in the writ petition , so also averments made in the I.A. for vacation of stay and Objection filed by the Petitioner in response to the said I.A.\n28. Paragraph Nos.18, 19, 31 to 33 of the application under section 9 of the Act, 1996, where in the Petitioner has allegedly pleaded the grounds for interference regarding invocation of BG on the ground of special equities, so also contents of some of the documents appended to such application as Annexures 1 to 13 , which were filed by both the parties during rehearing of the matter on 19.07.2024, being so directed by this Court, are extracted below:-\n\"18. That in violation of terms of the contract from the side of the employer, vide letter dated 25.03.2024 the authorized signatory of the employer stated that as per books there is a debit balance of Rs.4,12,54,904.00 towards unadjusted advance and other deductions and it has been observed that you are not responding to our civil department direction and it is impacting out site progress and it is totally against our contract vide work order dated 24.01.2022 and advance is pending since 18.09.2023 and if the payment is not received on our before 30.04.2024, we will go for encashment of the BG of Rs.3,73,95,490.00 vide BG No.327001GL00001122 dated 8.3.2022.

If the op.parties is directed to reconcile the account then it will be sufficient towards allegation of refund towards unadjusted advance of Rs.3,12,64,904.00 whereas, the B.G. amount is Rs.3,73,95,490.00. As such without reconciliation of the petitioner bill the letter dated 25.3.2024 for encashment of bank guarantee is illegal and arbitrary. \n32. That it is submitted that the dispute to the contract to be settled by Arbitration. But before commencement of Arbitration Proceeding, if the owner/op.party encashed the Bank guarantee, the bank shall debit the BG amount from the account of the petitioner and will proceed recovery proceeding and will not wait till the result of the arbitration proceeding. Further if the Bank Guarantee is stayed, the op.party shall not suffer any loss because the petitioner has to get huge outstanding dues from the op.parties. Further huge material, machineries and equipments are in the custody of the op.party/owner. \n33. That the petitioner has a prima facie case in his favour and balance of conveniences lies in favour of the petitioner and if interim order staying the encashment of bank guarantee vide letter dated 25.03.2024 is not passed the petitioner shall suffer irreparable loss and injury.

Since the beginning of the work, there were multiple hindrances such as non-timely supply of materials and shortages of materials, Pending COS of many lines of items, etc. This has been repeatedly reported to the concerned officials but there was never any concrete step taken by them for resolution of the hindrances. Due to the same the work progress was hampered badly and it could not be completed as per the targeted timelines which was categorically explained in our different letters & intimated to the concerned authorities in personal meeting time to time but unfortunately nobody is taking any pain even to properly reply via letter. However always verbal assurance has been given that the issues will be resolved. \nAfter a lot of persuasions and intervention of the head office of JSPL represented by Mr. Ashok Mahunta (Chairman Commercial), finally on 18th October 2023, a Video Meet was organized and it was decided that the contract would be short closed and a physical meeting will be organized to decide a way forward. However, till date even after our repeated persuasion, multiple letters and requests, there has been no response from any officials. \nFurther we have invested a huge amount of funds for execution of the project which is now completely stuck due to negligence and unpreparedness of the JSPL field officers. Details of our pending payments with your company are tabulated below: \n           Sl . No .

Currently no gate pass has been issued since first week of October and our workers are unable to access the premises. The absence of adequate security measures poses a risk of loss or theft. Also idling of manpower and machinery is resulting huge financial losses for us. \nHence, in light of the above submission, we request your urgent intervention for resolution of the same and an amicable settlement. \nThanking You Yours Sincerely For, Bansal Infraprojects Pvt.

This includes not handing over a hindrance-free site for excavation, non-payment of the deviation quantity of excavation, rock strata found during excavation (which was not estimated at the time of contract allocation by JSPL), leading to increased cost and time that has not yet been paid or accounted for. There were continued delays in the provision of free-issue material to be provided by JSPL as per contract, which includes, but is not limited to, backfill material, TMT bars, concrete, structural material, PS panel, L-mesh, U-mesh, sand, cement, paint, etc. Furthermore, as per the provisions of the contract, JSPL was supposed to provide labour hutment, free electricity, and water, which was not provided. Even after repeated requests, the same was not provided as per our requirement, which we have pointed out via many letters and presentations. \nMoreover, there were various revisions and rectifications of drawings done by JSPL, due to which a lot of work was delayed. Furthermore, as per the condition of the contract, payment must be made by JSPL within 1 month of the submission of the bill, but it was made within an average of 3 months that too partially. During this time, we received partial payment, and even after repeated requests to provide reconciliation of accounts and detailed deduction sheets, the same has not been done till date. \nAdditionally, many GST payment of our invoice by JSPL. have not been made, which is a criminal offense. Also, suo-moto our scope of work was reduced by JSPL without any intimation or discussion, whereas we had deployed machinery, equipment, material, and manpower for the complete project and not the reduced scope, which leads to much higher costs than ascertained before the time of bidding. \nTill date, the entire deviation quantity from the original scope has been submitted to JSPL multiple times, but no payment has been made regarding the same. \nDespite all these issues, the contractor had been working, but since March 2023, JSPL has been making arbitrary decisions without proper consultation and representation of the contractor, keeping the contractor at their mercy, illegally stopping the contractor from taking out its material and machinery. This is a criminal conspiracy to steal or misuse the contractor's material by not providing the contractor and their people access to the site, and subsequently not providing the labour hutment, and blaming the contractor fr slow-progress of work and not releasing payments. \nAgain, the company has also denied meeting the contractor's high-level management multiple times and seized all forms of communication by not responding to the contractor's mails, letters, etc., and only raising their issues without responding to the contractor's issues to handicap the contractor from executing its obligations. Furthermore, the civil department has arbitrarily refused to review the contractor's bill, citing vague reasons. It is evident that JSPL is engaging in a criminal conspiracy to avoid paying the contractor and impede their work by withholding essential resources such as drawings, electricity, water, site access, and accommodation. Additionally, they are blackmailing the contractor by neglecting to verify the bill and threatening to invoke the bank guarantee, all while neglecting their contractual obligations as the project owner/employer. \nTherefore, we urgently request your intervention to review our bills, approve necessary deviations, and promptly settle our outstanding payments. Failure to comply will leave us with no choice but to take the shelter of court. \nThank you, Yours faithfully, For, BANSAL INFRAPROJECTS PVT LTD Sd/-\n(Authorised Signatory)\" \n(Emphasis Supplied)\n29.

From the pleadings made in the Writ Petition so also Application filed by the Opposite Party Nos. 1 and 2 for vacation of stay as well as Objection filed by the Petitioner in response to the said Application, it is amply clear that despite various allegations made by the Petitioner regarding the reasons of its failure to act in terms of its contractual obligations in time, the said allegations have not been denied by the Opposite Parties by filing Counter to the Writ Petition.

As it ascertained from the alleged MoM dated 30.04.2024, before expiry of the said period, on getting notice from the Commercial Court, the Opposite Party has made a communication to the Opposite Party Bank for invocation of Bank Guarantee, that to contrary to the terms of BG, which is not permissible under law. \n33. It is further revealed from the records, series of communications were made to the Opposite Parties regarding non- fulfillment of its contractual objections enabling the Petitioner Company to carry out its job in time, which resulted in misunderstanding against the parties.\n34. So far as allegation of non-payment of running bills as well as non-issuance of gate pass, rather restricting the Petitioner to enable its Officers and workers to enter into the premises of the Opposite Parties to carry out its contractual obligation so also take away the machineries held up inside the premises of the Opposite Parties have also not been denied by filing a Counter to the said effect or in the Reply to the Objection filed by the Petitioner in response to I.A. filed by the Opposite Parties for vacation of the interim order. \n35. As held by the Supreme Court in Maria Margarida SequeiraFernandes (supra), in order to grant or refuse injunction, the Judicial Officer or the Judge must carefully examine the entire pleadings and documents with utmost care and seriousness. However, as is revealed from the impugned order, the Commercial Court rejected the application filed under Order 39 Rule 3 C.P.C. with an observation that the Petitioner has failed to explain the irreparable mischief, which is impending and mere allegation of irreparable injury will not be sufficient and the Court is of the opinion that the Petitioner has failed to explain exceptional circumstances for grant of relief in the said Petition, which can cause serious loss to the Petitioner. Admittedly, the Court below has not taken in to consideration the documents filed before it to substantiate the prayer made in the section 9 application, as has been detailed above. \n36. As held by the Supreme Court in Arcelormittal Nippon Steel (India) Ltd. (supra), interim relief is granted in aid of final relief. The object is to ensure protection of the property being the subject-matter of arbitration and/or otherwise ensure that the arbitration proceedings do not become infructuous and the arbitral award does not become an award on paper, of no real value. Hence, this Court is of the view that the Court below, while considering the application under Order 39 Rule 3, read with Section 151 Application, failed to appreciate the settled position of law so also take note of the contents of the documents filed along with the section 9 application. Point No.iii) is answered accordingly. \n37. Admittedly, during pendency of the present Writ Petition, the Opposite Party (JSPL) has made a communication to the Opposite Party-Bank on 07.05.2024, as at Annexure-H of the I.A., for invocation of Bank Guarantee on the ground that the Petitioner has failed to perform its obligation under the agreement, though the said BG is not a performance BG. However, due to interim order dated 20.05.2024, which is still in vogue, the Opposite Parties were restrained from invoking the bank guarantee. The contents of the said letter dated 07.05.2024, being relevant, are extracted below:\nLetter dated 07.05.2024 \"Ref No: JSPL/BG/EN/4080 Date : 07.05.2024 The Manager, Union Bank of India Ajit tower, Near Sindhi School, Main Branch, Ramsagar para, Raipur(CG)-492001 Tel: 7525003213 Subject - Encashment of Bank Guarantee Dear Sir, The following Bank Guarantee was issued by your bank in our favour on behalf of M/s BANSAL INFRA PROJECTS PRIVATE LIMITED As Advance Bank Guarantee. \nType Bank guarantee No. BG Amount (Rs.)

On conjoint reading of the terms of Bank Guarantee, which mandates as to reduction by 10% of Invoice Value of each shipment, communication dated 25.03.2024 made to the Petitioner, which well demonstrates that in addition to alleged refund towards unadjusted advance, a penalty of Rs.1,00,00,000/- was claimed towards project delay and the contents of the letter dated 07.05.2024, which was issued during pendency of the Writ Petition, which indicates that the Opposite Party wanted to invoke the BG on the ground that the Petitioner failed to perform its obligation under the agreement, this Court is of the prima facie view that the Opposite Party has acted contrary to the terms of Bank Guarantee, which was furnished to secure the advance given by the Opposite Parties to the Petitioner. This Court is also of prima facie view that there are special equities in favour of the Petitioner and if the Opposite Parties are permitted to encash the BG, it may cause irretrievable injustice to the Petitioner Company.\n39. Admittedly, the section 9 application is still pending for consideration by the Commercial Court, Cuttack on merit and if at this stage the Opposite Parties are permitted to invoke the Bank Guarantee, the prayer made in the section 9 application shall become infructuous. Further, the Petitioner has already moved before this Court under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 for appointment of Arbitrator. \n40. Hence, the parties are directed to appear before the Senior Civil Judge, Commercial Court, Cuttack in ARBP No.14 of 2024 on 27.08.2024. If so required, the Commercial Court shall pre-pone the date to the said date, if the said case stands posted to any date beyond the said date. The Opposite Parties shall file their Objection with all relevant documents, if any, to the application filed under section 9 of the Act, 1996, within ten days from the said date. \n41. On filing of Objection, the Senior Civil Judge, Commercial Court, Cuttack shall proceed further in accordance with law and shall try to conclude the said proceeding at the earliest, preferably within a period of six weeks from the date of filing of the objection and documents by the Opposite Parties. \n42. Since the Bank Guarantee furnished by the Petitioner is going to expire on 05.09.2024, the Petitioner is directed to extend the said BG until 31.12.2024 well before the expiry of the said period. \n43. As the Opposite Parties contested the present Writ Petition on technical grounds of maintainability so also scope regarding interference by the Court regarding invocation of Bank Guarantee and are yet to file their Objection in ARBP No.14 of 2024, it is made clear that after filing of Objection by the Opposite Parties, the Senior Civil Judge, Commercial Court, Cuttack shall proceed further in accordance with law and decide the prayer made in ARBP No.14 of 2024 on merit taking into consideration the pleadings and documents on record, without being influenced by the observations made above. However, the interim order dated 20.05.2024 passed in the present case shall remain in force till disposal of the ARBP No.14 of 2024, subject to extension of Bank Guarantee by 31st August, 2024. \n44. Accordingly, the Writ Petition stands disposed of. No order as to cost. \n................................... \nS.K.

act, 1996, shortly hereinafter, 'the act, 1996' and ordered to transfer the matter to the commercial court, cuttack. 2. the factual matrix, which led to filing of the present writ petition, is that on 17.05.2022, the petitioner and the opposite party nos.1 & 2 entered into a partnership agreement for smooth running of the movie business inherited from their father in the name and style as m/s. brajaraj movies. the said partnership agreement was reduced to writing in shape of deed of agreement and subsequently registered with the i.g.r., odisha, cuttack on 31.05.2022, vide registration no.720202200555. the opposite party no.1, instead of extending his cooperation for smooth running of the business of the firm, allegedly violated the terms of the said deed of agreement and committed breach of trust, as has been detailed in the writ petition. when the petitioner tried to contact the opposite party no.1 to ascertain the fact and resolve the issue amicably, the opposite party no.1 did not come forward to resolve the said dispute. hence, the petitioner and the opposite party no.2 were constrained to lodge an f.i.r. against the opposite party no.1 in purighat w.p.(c) no.18217 of

as arbp no.09 of 2024 and the same is still pending for consideration before this court. as the opposite party no.1 has failed to perform his duties in contravention of terms and conditions of deed of agreement, the petitioner, pending consideration of his application for w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 3 of 36 appointment of an arbitrator by this court, was being constraint to approach the district judge, cuttack by filing an application under section 9 of the act, 1996 for grant of an order of interim injunction against the opposite party no.1, thereby restraining the opposite party no.1 or his agents from telecasting the movies and songs of m/s. brajaraj movies in any form through television media, satellite broadcasting, f.m. channels, mobile operator, cinema halls, dvd & you tube channels and to restrain him from proceeding with the production of the movie \"i love you-2\" and also using the title and logo of m/s. brajaraj movies in any manner till the dispute is resolved through

objection/show cause on 27.06.2024. on the very day, the district judge, cuttack was pleased to pass an interim order restraining the opposite party no.1 from proceeding with the release of the film \"i love you-2\" and using the logo and banner of m/s. brajaraj movies till the next date and the matter stood adjourned to 11.07.2024. on w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 4 of 36 the said date, the petitioner filed another application for grant of interim order as well as an application for continuance of the interim order dated 27.06.2024 whereas, the opposite party no.1 filed applications under order 7, rule11 of c.p.c. for rejection of the arbp no.02 of 2024 and for vacating the stay order dated 27.06.2024. however, the district judge, cuttack was pleased to extend the interim order and posted the matter to 18.07.2024. on the said date, the petitioner filed his reply in response to the application filed by the opposite party no.1 under order 7 rule, 11 of c.p.c. so also to the application for vacation of stay. however, the district judge, cuttack, though extended the interim order till the next date, but on a wrong noting and misconstruing the provisions enshrined under the act, 1996 as well as the commercial courts act, 2015, shortly hereinafter, 'cc act, 2015' and relying on the judgment of the supreme court in jaycee housing pvt. ltd. & others vrs. registrar (general), orissa high court, cuttack & others, reported in 2022 live law (sc) 860, transferred the case to the court of the senior civil judge (commercial court), cuttack on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. while passing the said order, w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 5 of 36 the district judge, cuttack also directed to dispose of the said matter on or before 23.07.2024 on merit in accordance with law, with an observation not to extend the interim order in a causal manner. hence this writ petition. 4. the said order passed by the district judge, cuttack dated 18.07.2024 passed in arbp no.02 of 2024 has been challenged on the following grounds: (i) the same is contrary to the provisions of law enshrined under the act, 1996 as well as the cc act, 2015. (ii) the court below completely misconstrued the decision rendered by the supreme court in jaycee housing pvt. ltd. (supra). (iii) the court below misconstrued the facts and circumstances of the petitioner's case and wrongly rendered a finding that the case involved is pertaining to violation of intellectual property right and loss and the valuation of the same appears to be more than five lakhs, forgetting the fact that the petitioner has filed the application under w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 6 of 36 section 9 of the act, 1996 for grant of interim relief till disposal of the dispute through arbitration in which there is no specified value, as envisaged under section 3 of the commercial courts act, 2015. (iv) the order passed by the district judge, cuttack is also contrary to section 6 of the cc act, 2015 which mandates that the cc act shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value, though, in the instant case, there is no specified value as on the date. (v) the impugned order is also in contravention to the provisions enshrined under sections 10, 12 & 15 of the cc act, 2015 and section 2(1)(e) of the act, 1996. (vi) since the dispute has no specified value, as required under the provisions of the cc act, 2015, the application under section 9 of the act, 1996 cannot come under the definition w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 7 of 36 of section 2(b),(c), vii, xv and xvii of the cc act, 2015, as referred to in the impugned order, and the said order suffers from illegalities and infirmities and is liable to be quashed. 5. reiterating the grounds agitated in the writ petition, mr. panda, learned counsel for the petitioner, drawing attention of this court to the provisions enshrined under section 2 (1)(e) of the act, 1996 so also under section 6, 10 and 15 of the c.c act, 2015 submitted that the district judge, cuttack, being the principal civil court, is only competent to hear the application filed under section 9 of the act, 1996. the section 9 application being in the nature of interlocutory application, having no valuation, the district judge should not have transferred the said application to the commercial court, cuttack, which lacks jurisdiction to try the said petition. in view of the provisions enshrined under section 6 read with section 15 of the cc act, 2015, only suits and applications, including applications under the act, 1996 relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value can only be tried by the commercial court. the specified value, as per w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 8 of 36 the amended provisions under the cc act, 2015, being rs.3,00,000/and admittedly the section 9 application filed by the petitioner having no valuation and with a prayer for interim injunction, cannot be heard by the commercial court. only the district judge, cuttack, being the principal civil court, is competent to hear and decide the said application. hence, the impugned order dated 18.07.2024 passed in arbp no.02 of 2024, being contrary to the legal provisions enshrined under the act, 1996 so also the cc act, 2015, deserves interference and be quashed and direction be given to the district judge, cuttack to hear the said application filed under section 9 of the act, 1996 and dispose of the same on merit in the interest of justice. 6. to substantiate his submission, mr. panda, learned counsel for the petitioner, relying on the judgment of the supreme court in jaycee housing pvt. ltd. (supra), submitted that though the district judge, cuttack relied on the said judgment in the impugned order, but misconstrued the said decision of the supreme court. mr. panda submitted that, vide the said decision, it was never held by the supreme court that all the cases under sections 9, 14, and 24 of the w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 9 of 36 act, 1996 have to be filed and adjudicated by the commercial court irrespective of the valuation. mr. panda, relying on para-10 of the said judgment of the supreme court, submitted that it was also held vide the said judgment that as per section 15 of the cc act, 2015, all suits and applications, including applications under the act, 1996, relating to a commercial dispute of \"specified value\" shall have to be transferred to the commercial court. 7. mr. panda, learned counsel, referring to para-15 of the order of the madhya pradesh high court at jabalpur, reported in 2021 scc online mp 457 (yashwardhan raghuwanshi vs. district & sessions judge and another) submitted that the court of district judge, being the principal civil court of original jurisdiction, would be competent to decide the matters/disputes filed under the provisions of section 9 , 14, 34 and 36 of the act, 1996 so also under the provisions of the cc act, 2015, regardless of the value of claim and it can only distribute such work amongst any of the additional district judges under his supervision, but not to any court of civil judge class-i or senior civil judge, or any court of small causes. w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 10 of 36 8. in response to the argument advanced by mr. panda, learned counsel for the petitioner, mr. dash, learned counsel for opposite party no.1, drawing attention of this court to the definition of \"commercial court\", \"commercial dispute\" and \"specified value\", as defined under sections 2(1)(b), 2(1)(c) & 2(1)(i) respectively, so also section 3(3), 6 and 10(3) of the c.c. act, 2015, submitted that in view of the definition of commercial dispute under the cc act, 2015 read with section 6 and 10(3) of the cc act, 2015, all applications and appeals, arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the act, 1996, that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district (not being high court), has to be filed in and heard and disposed of by the commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration, where such commercial court has been constituted. since arbp no.02 of 2024 has been preferred under section 9 of the act, 1996, instead of filing such an application before the commercial court, cuttack, the petitioner wrongly filed such an application before the district judge, cuttack. hence, the opposite party no.1, in addition to filing an application for vacation of stay, w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 11 of 36 also filed an application under order-7, rule 11 of c.p.c. for rejection of the said petition on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the district judge, cuttack so also on some other grounds. however, the district judge, cuttack, instead of hearing such application first, ordered for disposing of all the applications together with section 9 application. however, the district judge ultimately thought it prudent to transfer the said proceeding to the commercial court, in terms of the legal provisions under the cc act, 2015, referring to the judgment of the supreme court in jaycee housing pvt. ltd. (supra). 9. mr. dash, learned counsel for the opposite party no.1, drawing attention of this court to the legal provisions under section 10(3) of the cc act, 2015, submitted that any application under the act, 1996, pertaining to a commercial dispute, has to be moved before the commercial court after formation of the commercial court and not before the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district and the district judge, cuttack should have returned the application filed under section 9 of the act, 1996 to the petitioner. however, on being so pointed out by his client, the w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 12 of 36 district judge, cuttack ordered for transfer of the said proceeding to the commercial court, cuttack. there being no infirmity in the impugned order and the same having been passed in terms of the legal provisions under the cc act, 2015, the writ petition deserves to be dismissed. 10. from the pleadings made in the writ petition, grounds urged therein to challenge the impugned order so also submissions made at the bar, the following points emerge to be answered in the present writ petition. (i) in absence of any valuation, in an application filed under section 9 of the act, 1996, whether the commercial court, constituted under sub-section (1) of section 3 of the cc act, 2015, is competent to hear such application? (ii) whether the district judge was justified to transfer the section 9 application, registered as arbp no.02 of 2024, to the court of senior civil judge (commercial court), cuttack? w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 13 of 36 11. since both points are interrelated, the same are dealt with together for the sake of brevity and clarity. before answering the points as detailed above, this court deems it appropriate to reproduce below section 2(1)(e)(i) and 9 of the act, 1996 and section 2(1)(b),(c),(i), 3,6,10,12, 15 and 21 of the cc act, 2015 for ready reference: \"section 2(1)(e)(i) & 9 of the arbitration act, 1996: 2. definitions-(1) in this part, unless the context otherwise requires,(e) \"court\" means (i) in the case of an arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the high court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject matter of a suit, but does not include any civil court of a grade inferior to such principal civil court, or any court of small causes; 9. interim measures, etc., by court.--(1) a party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36, apply to a court-(i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely:-(a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement; (b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration; (c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subjectmatter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 14 of 36 which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence; (d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver; (e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient, and the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it.

(4) the commercial division or commercial court, as the case may be, may hold case management hearings in respect of such transferred suit or application in order to prescribe new timelines or issue such further directions as may be necessary for a speedy and efficacious disposal of such suit or application in accordance [with order xva] of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908): provided that the proviso to sub rule (1) of rule 1 of order v of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall not apply to such transferred suit or application and the court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which the written statement shall be filed. (5) in the event that such suit or application is not transferred in the manner specified in subsection (1), subsection (2) or subsection (3), the commercial appellate division of the high court may, on the application of any of the parties to the suit, withdraw such suit or application from the court before which it is pending and transfer the same for trial or disposal to the commercial division or commercial court, as the case may be, having territorial jurisdiction over such suit, and such order of transfer shall be final and binding. 21. act to have overriding effect --save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than this act.\" (emphasis supplied) w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 20 of 36 12. though \"court\" is defined under section 2(1)(e) of the act, 1996 to be the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in the district, but in the provisions enshrined under section 10(3) of the cc act, 2015, it has been clearly enumerated that, where the subject matter of an arbitration is a \"commercial dispute\" of \"specified value\" and such arbitration is other than the international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the act, 1996, that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district (not being a high court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial court has been constituted. 13. the word \"commercial dispute\" has been defined under section 2(1)(c) of the c.c. act, 2015, which clearly includes a dispute arising out of partnership agreements in terms of sub-clause (xv) under clause (c) of section 2(1) of the c.c act, 2015. similarly, the word \"specified value\" used in various provisions of the c.c act, 2015 has been defined under section 2(1)(i). specified value, in relation to a w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 21 of 36 commercial dispute, shall mean the value of the subject matter in respect of a \"suit\", which is to be determined in accordance with section 12 and the same shall not be less than three lakh rupees or such higher value, as may be notified by the central government. 14. so far as the order of madhya pradesh high court in yashwardhan raghuwanshi (supra) cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner, it was held as follows: \"15. in view of the above discussions, the present petition deserves to succeed. the entry no.45 of the impugned order dated 20.10.2020 is set aside. it is hereby declared that the court of district judge as the principal civil court of original jurisdiction would be competent to decide the matters/disputes filed under the provisions of sections 9, 14, 34 & 36 of the arbitration act and also under the provisions of the commercial courts act regardless of the value of claim. however, the district judge by virtue of section 7 read with section 15 of the civil courts act would be entitled to distribute such work amongst any of the additional district judges under his supervision, but not to any court of civil judge class-i or senior civil judge, or any court of small causes.\" 15. however, the high court of bombay in gaurang manguesh suctancar vs. sonia gaurang suctancar, reported in manu/mh/2578/2020, dealing with an issue as to whether the commercial court under the cc act, 2015 was justified to refuse to entertain an application under section 9 w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 22 of 36 of the act, 1996 and return it to the petitioner/applicant to be presented before the appropriate court, held as follows: \"issue: 2. for adjudicating an application under section 9 of the arbitration act, which is the forum: is it the court as defined under section 2 (1) (e) of the arbitration act, read with section 5 of the goa civil courts act 1965 or is it the commercial court under section 3 (1) of the amended commercial courts act 2015? 92. evidently, the commercial courts act is a later enactment, but it does not work at cross purpose with the arbitration act. in fact, both aim at speedy adjudication. the commercial courts act covers all the commercial disputes, whereas the arbitration act covers only those disputes that involve arbitration. as kandla export corporation has held, both the enactments call for a harmonious interpretation. if at all there is any conflict, as to the substantive provisions, the arbitration act prevails; but it has left the procedural niceties to the commercial courts act. section 10 (3) of the commercial courts act and the remote conditional: 93. let us revisit section 10 (3) of the commercial courts act. \"if it is a domestic arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of arbitration \"that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction\" in a district (not being a high court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the commercial court\". 94. sub-section (3) begins with a conditional \"if. then, it delineates on how \"all applications or appeals\" arising out of arbitration should be adjudicated. they \"would ordinarily\" lie before the \"principal civil court of original jurisdiction.\" in that sentence, \"ordinarily\" is an adverbial emphasiser; let us keep it aside. now the sentence is \"they would lie before the principal civil court of original jurisdiction.\" it is, grammatically speaking, the 'second conditional' employing the subjunctive \"would\". if refers to an unlikely or improbable future event or arrangement. what could have been an ordinary course of remedial event now stands altered. this uncertainty or altered course under sub-section (3) is because of a statutory development-the advent of the commercial courts act. w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 23 of 36 so, to repeat, what could have been the subject of adjudication before the principal civil court of original jurisdiction, now \"shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial court has been constituted.\" 95. because, now, the commercial courts have been established, \"all applications\" under the arbitration act should lock, stock, and barrel go before the commercial courts. so the concept of\" the principal civil court of original jurisdiction\" no longer applies. instead, what matters is the \"commercial court\". that accepted, which is the commercial court-the senior civil judge's court or the district court? in goa, the district court is no longer the primary commercial court; it is, in fact, a commercial appellate court. 96. in this context, i may once again quote g.p. singh, g.p. singh (n 13) 91, who says that \"the words of a statute are first understood in their natural, ordinary or popular sense and phrases and sentences are construed according to their grammatical meaning, unless that leads to some absurdity or unless there is something in the context, or in the object of the statute to suggest the contrary.\" here, if sub-section (3) is not read in its ordinary grammatical sense, it will lead to absurdity. the decisions: 97. the respondent wants me to treat co-equal bench decisions in d.m. corporation and jaiswal ashoka infrastructure as per incuriam. they have been rendered, as she points out, in ignorance of kandla export corporation. as the supreme court has held in b. satyanarayana rao, the rule of per incuriam can be applied \"where a court omits to consider a binding precedent of the same court or the superior court rendered on the same issue or where a court omits to consider any statute while deciding that issue.\" 98. in d.m. corporation, a learned single judge (dr. shalini phansalkar-joshi, j.) has, on facts, noted that the dispute concerns an arbitration agreement, the subject-matter of which is above rs. 1 crore; it is a dispute of commercial nature. so even if the relief claimed is mere injunction, because of section 10(3) of the commercial courts act, the principal district judge has correctly transferred the arbitration application to the commercial court. the impugned order passed by the district court w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 24 of 36 being just, legal, and correct; it warranted no interference. 99. in jaiswal ashoka infrastructure, another learned single judge (a.s. chandurkar, j) has observed that because of section 15(2) of the commercial courts act, suits and applications in relation to a commercial dispute pending in any civil court must be transferred to the commercial court. that is, the civil court \"ceases to have jurisdiction to entertain an application under the provisions of the [commercial courts] act in relation to a commercial dispute of a specified value.\" once the court lacks inherent jurisdiction, express or implied consent, failure to raise jurisdictional object, or even acquiescence cannot clothe the court with jurisdiction. 100. i have already elaborately discussed kandla export corporation, and i see no precedential transgression in d.m. corporation or jaiswal ashoka infrastructure. conclusion: (1) contrary to the respondent's contentions, the notification, dt. 05.05.2020, issued by the government of goa, is in tune with the legislative mandate under sections 3 and 3a of the commercial courts act, 2015. (2) in the state of goa, the designated district courts are the appellate commercial courts, and the senior civil judges' courts are the commercial courts. (3) even adjudication of an application under section 9 of the arbitration act must be before the commercial court, and that commercial court need not be the principal civil court of original jurisdiction. (4) there is no conflict between the arbitration and conciliation act 1996 and the commercial courts act 2015. if at all we maintain the distinction, the former act deals with the substantive rights of the parties to the arbitration, and the latter act with the procedural essentials, the choice of the forum being a part of it. w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 25 of 36 (5) as kandla export corporation has held, regarding any commercial arbitral dispute, the arbitration and conciliation act 1996 determines, among other things, the appellate remedies and the commercial courts act 2015 provides for the forum and adjudicatory procedure. result: as a result, i hold that the ad-hoc senior civil judge, \"a\" court, panaji, has failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it as the commercial court. its returning the petitioner's application to be presented \"before proper court\" is erroneous and unsustainable, for it is, by itself, the proper court. the impugned order, dt. 08.07.2020, is set aside. so the commercial court at north goa, panaji, will have the cma stamp no. 243/2020 restored to file and adjudicated on merits, after giving the regular number.\" (emphasis supplied) 16. the division bench of this court in m.g. mohanty and others vs. state of odisha and others, reported in 2022(iii)ilr-cut-992, while deciding the issue regarding constitutional validity of section 10(3) of the cc act, 2015 in a batch of cases, took note of both the said orders of madhya pradesh high court so also bombay high court. the division bench disagreed with the reasoning of the high court of madhya pradesh in yashwardhan raghuwanshi (supra), whereas, respectfully agreed with the views of bombay high court in gaurang manguesh suctancar (supra) and observed as follows: w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 26 of 36 \"39. in yashwardhan raghuwanshi v. district & sessions judge (supra), the madhya pradesh high court relied on the decision of the supreme court of india in state of maharashtra, through executive engineer v. atlanta limited (2014) 11 scc 619 to hold that the court of superior most jurisdiction in a district is the court of the district judge. it concluded that: \"14.segregation of an arbitration matters on the basis of a pecuniary limit is not what the law provides for. all the arbitration matters, irrespective of the value of claim, are required to be adjudicated by principal civil court of original jurisdiction. therefore, it is clear that in respect of commercial disputes involving an arbitration dispute only the commercial court of the status of district judge or additional district judge would be the competent court to entertain the matters under sections 9, 14, 34 & 36 of the arbitration act.\" 42. in any event, this court is unable to agree with the reasoning of the high court of madhya pradesh in yashwardhan raghuwanshi (supra). in particular, the court would like to refer to the parliamentary intent in enacting the cc act in 2015 much after the a&c act of 2016 and the sor not only of the bill introduced in 2015 but also the sor of the bill introduced in 2018, amending the said statute. the debates in the parliament in this regard are instructive. in defending its decision to expand the scope of commercial disputes beyond those which were of high value, three aspects that were mentioned on behalf of the government defending the bill in the parliament, which read as under: \"now, what really has transpired in december 2017? as has already been mentioned by the hon. minister, in december, 2017, the government had established a total of 247 commercial courts across the country. but, the nonexhausted list of 22 disputes, termed as commercial disputes, has also been brought in. to increase the efficiency of the system, there are still many enactments and many things which we need to correct w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 27 of 36 and this is just one part of the correction to improve the ease of doing business. by bringing the jurisdiction to three lakhs, we will actually be bringing judicial accessibility to a wider audience and to a larger number of people. by making it available to a larger number of people, we will be resolving a larger number of disputes. it is in this context that the jurisdiction has been reduced after studying the data in detail. this particular amendment has been brought in with the specific value which was determined under section 2 (1) (i), where the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction is mentioned, which was one crore earlier before the ordinance, now it has been brought to three lakhs. this jurisdiction will initiate more such disputes to have a faster disposal. as i have mentioned earlier, under the charter, there are chartered high courts and non-chartered high courts. so, certain original jurisdictions are vested with certain high courts and not with every high court. this was one impediment in establishing commercial divisions. so, there was a bar of some sort. to do away with the bar, this particular enactment has been brought in and this is another major change which has been brought in through this particular bill. the third aspect of the commercial appellate court is that normally at the district level, either a district judge or a judge below the level of district judge, will be notified as the commercial court judge. then the appeal need not go to the high court. the appeal can go to the district judge. that is also a part of this particular enactment.\" 43. the legislature appears to have left it open to the high court and the state government either to appoint a civil judge (senior division) or an additional district judge as the commercial court of first instance to expedite the adjudication of commercial disputes. it is interesting to note that there are several states that have constituted commercial courts both at the district judge level as well as below the district judge level. in gujarat, the courts of the additional district judges in bhuj, anjar, gandhidham and bhachau have been constituted for hearing arbitration matters whereas the courts of the principal senior civil judge in these places are for w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 28 of 36 hearing other commercial disputes. in karnataka, in some districts, it is the principal d&sj and in others the ad&sj. in bihar, depending on the pecuniary value, it could be the district judge or the sub-judge. in uttarakhand, it is the additional district judge commercial court, dehradun. the intent clearly was to expand the power and to bring in more courts under the rubric of 'commercial courts'. considering that the specified value was being lowered, it was but natural to allow courts below the rank of the district judge to be designated as such. 44. section 10(3) of the cc act specifically deals with arbitrations, 'other than international commercial arbitrations'. the jurisdiction in respect of such disputes would now be based with the commercial courts, although earlier it was with a principal civil court, which would ordinarily exercise jurisdiction under section 2(1)(e) of the a&c act. the orders passed by the d&sj on 7th july 2021, transferring the arbitration petitions to the court of the senior civil judge commercial court, was only by way of implementation of these provisions. 46. there might be an anomaly inasmuch as arbitral disputes of a commercial value of less than rs.3 lacs may have to be dealt with directly by the d&sj in terms of the definition under section 2(1)(e) of the a&c act and appeal against which would lie to the commercial appellate division in the high court. but none of the petitions before this court has that fact situation. the questions is, therefore, purely academic. nevertheless, it will be open to the state government to revise its notification in view of the above anomaly. 48. at this stage, it must be pointed out that this court's attention has been drawn to the judgment of the bombay high court in gaurang mangesh suctancar v. sonia gaurang suctancar (supra). the bombay high court, on analyzing these very provisions, came to the conclusion that it is the cc act provisions that would prevail. the court is in respectful concurrence with the said view. as rightly noted by the bombay high court both sections 42 of the a&c act and section 21 of the cc act appeared to be similar provisions inasmuch as they begin with a non-obstante clause, precluding the applicability of any other law for the time being in force. the following observations of the bombay high court in this regards are relevant, which reads as under: w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 29 of 36 \"60. g.p. singh, in his cerebral commentary, principles of statutory interpretation (g.p. singh, interpretation of statutes, (reprint, 14 edn., lexis nexis, 2018) 403), has explained that \"the expression 'notwithstanding anything in any other law' occurring in a section of an act cannot be construed to take away the effect of any provision of the act in which that section appears. in other words, 'any other law' will refer to any law other than the act in which that section occurs.\" in contrast, the expression 'notwithstanding anything contained in this act' may be construed to take away the effect of any provision of the act in which the section occurs but it cannot take away the effect of any other law. 61. indeed, a special enactment or rule cannot be held to be overridden by a later general enactment or simply because the latter opens up with a non obstante clause. there should be a clear inconsistency between the two before giving an overriding effect to the non obstante clause. 62. the learned author g.p. singh has also remarked that sometimes one finds two or more enactments operating in the same field and each containing a non obstante clause. each clause, in fact, declares that its provisions will have effect 'notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force'. the conflict in such cases is resolved on consideration of purpose and policy underlying the enactments and the language used in them. another test applied is that the later enactment normally prevails over the earlier one. it is also relevant to consider as to whether either of the two enactments can be described a special one; in that case the special one may prevail over the more general one notwithstanding that the general one is later in time. 63. in fact, the arbitration act and the commercial courts act, both central enactments, have employed this 'nonobstante clause' at more than one place. w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 30 of 36 precisely for this reason, kandla export corporation has harmoniously resolved this imbroglio: that the arbitration act prevails when it concerns the parties' substantive rights, and the commercial courts act does when it concerns the parties' procedural rights.\" 49. the bombay high court then undertook an analysis of the un-amended provisions of the cc act and noted that there is a two-tier court at the district level. one is the commercial court of original jurisdiction and another at the district judge level of the commercial appellate court. the approach in kandla exports (supra) about the cc act being procedural in nature and therefore having retrospective effect, found support in the decision in new india assurance company limited v. shanti misra (1975) 2 scc 840, where a three-judge bench held that once there was a change not in the substantive law but in the procedural law, it would operate retrospectively and 'the person has to go to the new forum even if his cause of action or right of action accrued prior to the change of forum'. the relevant passage of the decision of the bombay high court in gaurang mangesh suctancar v. sonia gaurang suctancar, reads as under: \"92. evidently, the commercial courts act is a later enactment, but it does not work at cross purpose with the arbitration act. in fact, both aim at speedy adjudication. the commercial courts act covers all the commercial disputes, whereas the arbitration act covers only those disputes that involve arbitration. as kandla export corporation has held, both the enactments call for a harmonious interpretation. if at all there is any conflict, as to the substantive provisions, the arbitration act prevails; but it has left the procedural niceties to the commercial courts act.\" 50. the court finds merit in the contention on behalf of the opposite parties that the a&c act must yield to the cc act and not vice versa given that the objective of both enactments is the speedy disposal of the cases and the cc act was a later enactment. there is no apparent conflict between the a&c act and the cc act for being resolved. the objective of both is the speedy resolution of the disputes. as far as challenge to the vires of section 10 of the cc act is concerned, w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 31 of 36 indeed no ground has been made out before this court to show how section 10 of the cc act is ultra vires the legislative powers of the parliament or how it is 'manifestly arbitrary'. the identification of commercial disputes as distinct from ordinary civil disputes is based on an intelligible differentia and subjecting them to a special expedited procedure can neither be considered to be arbitrary nor ultra vires the a&c act. that prayer, therefore, has to be rejected. 51. incidentally, there is no challenge to either section 15 or 21 of the cc act. if indeed commercial cases involving arbitral disputes have necessarily to be transferred under section 10(3) read with section 15(2) of the cc act, then as a natural corollary the commercial court alone will have to decide those disputes and not of the court in terms of the a&c act. in passing the impugned orders transferring the cases, the d&sj has not committed any illegality nor has the senior civil judge, commercial court, bhubaneswar committed any illegality in accepting the cases on transfer and proceeding with them in accordance with law.\" (emphasis supplied) 17. the judgment of this court in m.g. mohanty (supra) being challenged before the supreme court, the same was upheld in jaycee housing pvt. ltd. (supra). paragraphs 6, 10 & 11 of the said judgment, being relevant, are reproduced below: \"6. the question of law arising for consideration in the present appeal is, whether in exercise of powers under section 3 of the commercial courts act, 2015, the state government can confer jurisdiction to hear applications under sections 9, 14 and 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, upon commercial courts which are subordinate to the rank of the principal civil judge in the district, contrary to the provisions of section 2(1)(e) of the arbitration act? w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 32 of 36 10. thus, the objects and reasons of commercial courts act, 2015 is to provide for speedy disposal of the commercial disputes which includes the arbitration proceedings. to achieve the said objects, the legislature in its wisdom has specifically conferred the jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters as per section 10 of the act, 2015. at this stage, it is required to be noted that the act, 2015 is the act later in time and therefore when the act, 2015 has been enacted, more particularly sections 3 & 10, there was already a provision contained in section 2(1)(e) of the act, 1996. as per settled position of law, it is to be presumed that while enacting the subsequent law, the legislature is conscious of the provisions of the act prior in time and therefore the later act shall prevail. it is also required to be noted that even as per section 15 of the act, 2015, all suits and applications including applications under the act, 1996, relating to a commercial dispute of specified value shall have to be transferred to the commercial court. even as per section 21 of the act, 2015, act, 2015 shall have overriding effect. it provides that save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force. 11. therefore, considering the afore stated provisions of the act, 2015 and the objects and reasons for which the act, 2015 has been enacted and the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division in the high courts are established for speedy disposal of the commercial disputes including the arbitration disputes, sections 3 & 10 of the act, 2015 shall prevail and all applications or appeals arising out of arbitration under the provisions of act, 1996, other than international commercial arbitration, shall be filed in and heard and disposed of by the commercial courts, exercising the territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial courts have been constituted. if the submission on behalf of the appellants that all applications/appeals arising out of arbitration under the provisions of act, 1996, other than the international commercial arbitration, shall lie before the principal civil court of a district, in that case, not only the objects and reasons of enactment of act, 2015 and establishment of commercial courts shall be w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 33 of 36 frustrated, even sections 3, 10 & 15 shall become otiose and nugatory. if the submission on behalf of the appellants is accepted, in that case, though with respect to other commercial disputes, the applications or appeals shall lie before the commercial courts established and constituted under section 3 of act, 2015, with respect to arbitration proceedings, the applications or appeals shall lie before the principal civil court of a district. there cannot be two fora with respect to different commercial disputes. under the circumstances, notification issued by the state of odisha issued in consultation with the high court of orissa to confer jurisdiction upon the court of learned civil judge (senior division) designated as commercial court to decide the applications or appeals arising out of arbitration under the provisions of act, 1996 cannot be said to be illegal and bad in law. on the contrary, the same can be said to be absolutely in consonance with sections 3 & 10 of act, 2015. we are in complete agreement with the view taken by the high court holding so.\" (emphasis supplied) 18. law is well settled that the court under section 9 of the act, 1996 is only to formulate interim measure so as to protect the right under adjudication before the arbitral tribunal from being frustrated. in view of the provisions enshrined under section 10(3) read with the definition of \"commercial dispute\" and \"specified value\", as defined under section 2(1)(c) & (i) of the cc act, 2015 respectively, in addition to the settled position of law, as detailed above, this court is of the view that only suits and applications, which require to give a declaration regarding the valuation of suit/application, which will be further subjected to valuation, w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 34 of 36 if so required, to be determined in terms of section 12 of the cc act, 2015, will be the decisive factor to approach the fora under the cc act, 2015. this court is of further view that, in view of definition of \"specified value\" under section 2(1)(i) of the cc act, 2015, the same is not applicable to a section 9 application for determination of the jurisdiction of a commercial court to consider such application and the commercial courts, where such courts have been established in the state, are only competent to hear and decide the section 9 application filed under the act, 1996. 19. this court is of further view that section 15 of the cc act, 2015 regarding transfer of suits and applications being only applicable to pending cases, the district judge, cuttack ought to have returned the section 9 application to the petitioner for its presentation before the court of the senior civil judge (commercial court), cuttack. however, during hearing of the said application, realizing the fact that the said court lacks jurisdiction to hear the said application, after assessing the cost of such application to be more than rupees five lakhs, as is permissible under section 12 of the cc act, 2015 (though it was not so required in a section 9 w.p.(c) no.18217 of 2024 page 35 of 36 application), it was rightly ordered to transfer the matter to the commercial court. 20. in view of the detailed discussions made in the forgoing paragraphs, this court is also of the view that the plea of the petitioner regarding lack of jurisdiction of the commercial court to adjudicate an application under section 9 of the act, 1996, in absence of any valuation, is misconceived. both the points emerged, detailed above, are answered accordingly. 21. there being no infirmity in the impugned order passed in arbp no.02 of 2024, the writ petition stands dismissed. no order as to cost. .
