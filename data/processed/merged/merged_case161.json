The present Review Petition has been filed by the Petitioner seeking a review of the Judgment dated 27th February, 2019 passed by this Court in Axis Bank Limited vs. Mira Gehani & Ors.1\n2. Subsequent to the Judgment being delivered, the Petitioner filed a Praecipe dated 7th March, 2019, which read as under :\n\"1. By an order dated 20th August, 2018, this Hon'ble Court framed the following question of law :\n\"Whether in view of the amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 by a Commercial Court, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Court's Act, 2015 (4 of 2016), the Defendant can be allowed to file the Written Statement after 120 days from the date of service of 1 2019 Scc Online Bom. 358 Nitin 3 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Writ of Summons in a Commercial Suit\".\n2. Pursuant to the above mentioned Order, this Hon'ble Court was pleased to decide the above issue by an Order dated 27th February, 2019.\n3. In this regard, the Defendant seeks to approach this Hon'ble Court for speaking to the minutes to the said Order dated 27th February, 2019 to the extent that contention of the Defendant with respect to the provisions of the Cpc, 1908 as amended by the Commercial Courts Act not being applicable to a commercial dispute below a stipulated specified value is left open.\" \n3. On the Praecipe, the following order came to be passed by this Court on 8 th March, 2019 :\n\"Xxx\n2. Though the contention of the Defendant finds place in Clause 5.25 to 5.32 of the Written submissions, no arguments were advanced qua the same. The learned Advocate appearing for the Defendant states that he had made oral submissions towards the end. My notings speak otherwise. In view thereof, the question of speaking to the Minutes as sought does not arise. However, the Defendant may move an Application seeking Review.\" \n4. The present Review Petition has therefore been filed pursuant to the  liberty granted by this Court in the above order. According to the Petitioner, in the Judgment, Nitin 4 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc this Court did not decide a limited contention of the Petitioner viz. that the amendments introduced to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (\"CPC\") by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (\"Commercial Courts Act\") are only applicable to a Commercial Dispute of a Specified Value and not commercial disputes not of a Specified Value. Section 2 (i) of the Commercial Courts Act prescribes that the Specified Value in respect of a commercial dispute shall not be less than Rupees Three Lacs. \n5. In the present Suit, the Plaintiff has determined the Specified Value of its suit at Rupees Twenty Thousand i.e. below the Specified Value as prescribed under the Commercial Courts Act. \n6. In view of the above, the question of law being decided by this Order is whether the amendments introduced to the CPC by the Commercial Courts Act apply to Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value but nonetheless heard by a Commercial Division in view of the proviso to Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act ? \n7. It is clarified that the present Order is restricted to only answering the question of law recorded in paragraph 6 above and disposal of Notice of Motion (L) No.2118 of 2018. Necessary orders will therefore have to be passed on the other applications seeking condonation of delay at the time of hearing of each of such application on its own merits. \n8. For adjudication of the question of law as above, it would be necessary to Nitin 5 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc briefly set-out the legislative background leading to the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act as also certain relevant provisions thereof : \n8.1. The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Ordinance, 2015 was promulgated on 23 rd October, 2015. \nSubsequently, the Commercial Courts Act was enacted on 31 st December, 2015 and is deemed to have come into force from 23rd October, 2015. 8.2. The Commercial Courts Act came to be enacted pursuant to the recommendations made by the Law Commission of India in its 188 th Report and 253rd Report. \n8.3. The primary aim and object of the Commercial Courts Act, as can be discerned from its Statement of Objects and Reasons, was to provide speedy disposal of commercial disputes in order to reduce the pendency of cases and improve our country's image from the perspective of ease of doing business in India. 8.4. Under Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act, Commercial Divisions were constituted in this Court for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and powers conferred under the Commercial Courts Act. Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act reads as under :\n\" 4. Constitution of Commercial Division of High Court. \n(1) In all High Courts, having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the Chief Justice of the High Court may, by order, constitute Commercial Division having one or more Nitin 6 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Benches consisting of a single Judge for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under this Act. \n(2) The Chief Justice of the High Court shall nominate such Judges of the High Court who have experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be Judges of the Commercial Division.\"\n8.5. The Commercial Courts Act establishes Commercial Courts at the District level and Commercial Divisions in various High Courts ( including those having ordinary original civil jurisdiction) across India. The Specified Value, as defined by the Commercial Courts Act, stood earlier at Rupees One Crore. However, the Commercial Courts Act came to be amended in 2018 by the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts (Amendment) Act, 2018. Amongst other amendments, the Specified Value stood reduced to Rupees Three Lakhs as against the earlier Rupees One Crore. 8.6. Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act, which has a bearing on the issues at hand, provides for the jurisdiction of Commercial Divisions and is reproduced hereunder :\n\" 7. Jurisdiction of Commercial Divisions of High Courts. \nAll suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a Specified Value filed in a High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the Nitin 7 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Commercial Division of that High Court: \nProvided that all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes, stipulated by an Act to lie in a court not inferior to a District Court, and filed or pending on the original side of the High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court:\nProvided further that all suits and applications transferred to the High Court by virtue of sub-section (4) of section 22 of the Designs Act, 2000 or section 104 of the Patents Act, 1970 shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court in all the areas over which the High Court exercises ordinary original civil jurisdiction. \n(emphasis supplied)\" \n8.7. As can be seen from the above Section, whilst Section 7 mandates that all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a Specified Value filed in a High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of that High Court, its first proviso carves out an exception. The first proviso to Section 7 provides that all suits and applications relating to Commercial Disputes, stipulated by an Act to lie in a court not inferior to a District Court, and filed or pending on the original side of a High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of that High Court. The suits and applications covered under the first proviso are those which cannot be filed in a court Nitin 8 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc below the District Court or before a High Court. These are matters we refer to as Intellectual Property Rights matters. These includes matters pertaining to trademarks and copyright etc. The provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and Copyright Act, 1957 contain provisions mandating that suits under these Acts should not be filed and cannot be entertained by courts below a District Court. The relevant provisions in this regard are Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and Section 62 of the Copyright Act, 1957. These provisions have been interpreted by this Court to entitle such suits to be filed on the Original Side of the Bombay High Court irrespective of their pecuniary jurisdiction. \n8.8. Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act introduced certain amendments to the CPC. Section 16 reads as under :\n\" 16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes.\n( 1 ) The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule. \n(2) The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value. \n(3) Where any provision of any Rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, by the State Government is in conflict with the Nitin 9 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail. \" \n8.9. Amongst other amendments introduced to the CPC by the Commercial Courts Act, an amendment was introduced mandating that a Written Statement in a Commercial Courts Act cannot be filed after 120 days from the service of writ of summons. The Apex Court, in its decision in M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. 2 and this Court, in its decision in Axis Bank Limited vs. Mira Gehani & Ors. 3 have held that in Commercial Suits, a written statement by the Defendant cannot be taken on record after the expiry of 120 days from the date of service of the Writ of Summons.\n9. The present Order therefore decides whether or not this mandatory period of 120 days will apply to Commercial Suits/Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value. \n10. Appearing for the Petitioner, Advocate Mr. Rashmin Khandekar submitted that Section 16 (1) of the Commercial Courts Act makes it clear that the provisions of the CPC stood amended only in respect of Commercial Disputes of a Specified Value. He submitted that this Court ought to literally interpret Section 16 for its language is plain and unambiguous. Therefore, as the Plaintiff in the present suit has computed the Specified Value at Rs.20,000/-, the amended provisions of the CPC including the 2 2019 SCC Online SC 226 3 2019 SCC Online Bom 358 Nitin 10 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc mandatory proviso to Order VIII Rule 1 mandating that a Written Statement shall be filed within 120 days will not apply to this Suit. He further submitted that the whole scheme of the Commercial Courts Act makes it clear that there is a link between Commercial Disputes and Specified Value under the Act. Mr. Khandekar placed reliance on the decisions in Indian Overseas Bank vs. Jason Deckor P. Ltd.4; Nagarjuna Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited vs. Tecnimont SpA & Ors.5; Invoke Medical System Pvt. Ltd. vs. Kunal Structure (India) Pvt. Ltd. 6; Samsung Leasing Ltd. & Ors. vs. Samsung Electronic Co. Ltd. & Anr. 7 and OCI Corporation vs. Kandla Export Corporation & Ors8. It was further submitted that while interpreting any provision of a statute, the plain meaning has to be given effect to. If the language used in a section gives a simple meaning and message, it should be interpreted in such a way. The first and primary rule of construction is that the intention of the legislation must be found in the words used by the legislature itself. Reliance was also placed by him on the decisions in Prakash Nath Khanna & Anr. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax & Anr.9; Union of India vs. National Federation of Blind 10; Tata Power Company Ltd. & Ors. vs. Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission & Ors. 11; and Ajay Enterprises (P) Ltd. & Anr. vs. Municipal Corporation of Delhi12. Mr. Khandekar 4 MANU/GJ/1383/2018 5 MANU/HY/0448/2018 6 MANU/GJ/0227/2019 7 2018 (167) DRJ 654 8 2016 SCC Online Guj 5981 9 (2004) 9 SCC 686 10 (2013) 10 SCC 772 11 MANU/SC/0932/2009 12 ILR (1972) 2 Del 629 Nitin 11 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc therefore concluded that the question of law be answered to exclude the applicability of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act in respect of Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value and that the un-amended CPC be applicable to matters which pertain to Commercial Disputes but not of a Specified Value. \n11. As opposed to the aforesaid arguments of Mr. Khandekar, I have heard Advocate Mr. Nausher Kohli appearing for the Plaintiff. According to Mr. Kohli, the Petitioner's argument that the amendments to the CPC as introduced by the Commercial Courts Act apply only to ' commercial disputes' of a 'Specified Value' and not merely 'commercial disputes' is converse to the mandate, purpose and legislative intent behind the Commercial Courts Act. In support of his argument, Mr. Kohli relied upon the Preamble, Section 4, Section 7, the marginal note/heading to Section 16 and the Schedule to the Commercial Courts Act. \n12. Relying on the Preamble, Mr. Kohli submitted that the Commercial Courts Act does not restrict itself only to 'commercial dispute of a Specified Value '. It is also concerned with \"matters connected therewith or incidental thereto\". Relying on Section 4, he submitted that as per the mandate of Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act, this Commercial Division has been constituted for exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under the Commercial Courts Act. Such jurisdiction and power would necessarily include the power to enforce, apply and implement the Schedule to the Commercial Courts Act which introduces amendments to the CPC. Section 4 does not carve out a distinction between Nitin 12 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc 'commercial disputes' and a 'commercial dispute of a Specified Value'. According to him, this evidences that the legislature did not intend to create any distinction so far as the applicability of the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act is concerned. He submitted that the Commercial Courts Act, the Law Commission Reports and the discussions on the bill by members of the Parliament do not refer to a distinct application of the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. According to him, it would be akin to absurdity to apply the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act in a chaotic and irregular manner as both the types of matters require expeditious resolution in order to attain the objective for which the Commercial Courts Act was promulgated. \n13. Placing reliance on the marginal note/heading of Section 16 and the Schedule to the Commercial Courts Act, Mr. Kohli submitted that the Commercial Courts Act refers to 'commercial disputes' and not 'commercial disputes of a Specified Value' in the marginal note/heading of Section 16 and in the Schedule; the amendments introduced to Sections 35, Order VI, Rules 3 and 15 and Order XIII-A of the CPC. Whilst arguing, in fairness, he conceded that a marginal note/heading cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing a section, however, he submitted that a marginal note/heading can certainly be relied upon as indicating the drift of a section or to show what the section is dealing with. In this respect, he placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of K.P. Varghese vs. Nitin 13 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Income Tax Officer & Anr.13 According to him, had the legislature intended to create any distinction, there was no reason for the legislature to omit reference to 'commercial dispute of a Specified Value ' in the Schedule and marginal note/title to Section 16. Instead, the Schedule and marginal note/title to Section 16 clarifies that it applies to 'commercial disputes' whether of a 'Specified Value' or not. Hence, there is admittedly a conflict between Section 16 on the one hand and (i) the Schedule to the Commercial Courts Court and (ii) the marginal note/title to Section 16 on the other hand. In view of the apparent anomalies/inconsistencies/conflicts within the Commercial Courts Act itself, Mr. Kohli submitted that this Court ought to interpret Section 16 in a purposive manner and not in a restricted manner as Mr. Khandekar would have it. According to him, interpreting Section 16 literally would lead to erroneous and unintended consequences. Hence, this Court ought to interpret the words 'commercial disputes of a Specified Value ' in Section 16 to mean and include 'commercial disputes' covered under the first proviso to Section 7 as well. In this context, he placed reliance on the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Union of India vs Filip Tiago De Gama of Vedem Vasco De Gama 14; Rajbir Singh Dalal (Dr.) vs Chaudhari Devilal University, Sirsa15; Commissioner of Income Tax, Central Calcutta vs National Taj Traders16; Shailesh Dhairyawan vs Mohan Balkrishna Lulla 17 and 13 (1981) 4 SCC 173 14 1990 (1) SCC 277 15 2008 (9) SCC 284 16 1980 (1) SCC 370 17 2016 (3) SCC 619 Nitin 14 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Indian Performing Rights Society vs Sanjay Dalia18.\n14. Mr. Kohli's second leg of argument was that if Mr. Khandekar's arguments are accepted, there would be a resultant absurdity in the application of the Commercial Courts Act. Illustratively, the office of this Court would hence forth be required to assess not only whether or not a suit filed in this Court is a ' Commercial Suit' but would also have to enquire into the valuation of every Intellectual Property Rights matter to govern whether or not it falls within the ' Specified Value' or not. Upon such assessment, the office of this Court would next have to assess if the said Plaint so filed is in compliance with the Commercial Courts Act ( if it is of a 'Specified Value') or conversely, if the said plaint is in compliance with the CPC as un-amended by the CPC (if it is not of a 'Specified Value'). In the latter case, the office of this Court will direct that a Commercial Suit not of a ' Specified Value' will not be accompanied by a Statement of Truth etc. but would yet be titled as a ' Commercial Suit' in its cause-title. This, according to him, is an extreme absurdity resulting from Mr. Khanderkar's interpretation of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act. Further, he submitted that whilst Intellectual Property Rights matters above the ' Specified Value' will be heard by this Commercial Division and these matters would be governed by the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act in toto, an Intellectual Property Rights matter not of a Specified Value will not be governed by all the 18 2015 (10) SCC 161 Nitin 15 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc provisions of the Commercial Courts Act even though the said matter is being :\ni. Adjudicated by the same forum (Commercial Division);\nii. Adjudicated under the Commercial Courts Act;\niii.           Is a Commercial Suit; and iv.            Is a Commercial Suit in relation to an Intellectual Property Rights matter. \nThis, according to him, could never have been the intent of the legislature. The Commercial Court Act, having created a separate class of proceedings labelled as 'Commercial Suits', its procedure must apply in the trial of all such suits whether of a Specified Value or not. The objective of the Commercial Courts Act would be defeated if one category of cases i.e. those filed under the first proviso to Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act, are merely registered as 'commercial suits' in their cause-title but are not governed by major provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. \nThis, according to Mr. Kohli would create a backlog in the Commercial Division, the very mischief for which the Commercial Courts Act was promulgated, and eventually dampen and cripple the very objective of the Commercial Courts Act. \n15. Mr. Kohli further submitted that if Mr. Khandekar's arguments are accepted, an order/decree passed in matters such as the present suit would continue to be heard by the Commercial Appellate Division despite not being governed by the procedure under the Commercial Courts Act. This would render Section 13 otiose as well. The Commercial Courts Act is designed to expedite such suits and in the absence of such procedure, matters filed in the Commercial Division emanating from Nitin 16 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc the first proviso to Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act would be effectively governed by the rules and procedures applicable to non-commercial matters, defeating the very purpose for which the Commercial Division was created. In other words, if the submissions of the Petitioner are anything to go by, the Commercial Division would hear such matters without the aid of the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, yet requiring that the Commercial Division dispose of matters at an expedited pace, resulting in an acute absurdity. \n16. Mr. Kohli also submitted that if Mr. Khandekar's arguments are given any credence, it would lead to the creation of a further sub-class within a class as the sub- class of matters under the first proviso to Section 7 would be separated from the class of other matters under the Commercial Courts Act without any intelligible differentia. This would be unconstitutional in the very least as the creation of a sub-class within a class would be hit by Article 14 of the Constitution. In this context, reliance was placed by him on the Apex Court's decision in Sansar Chand Atri vs. State of Punjab 19.\n17. Mr. Kohli concluded that the phrase 'commercial disputes of a Specified Value' used in Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act ought to be interpreted to also include 'commercial disputes' governed under the first proviso to Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act. This, according to him, would be a proper, rational, consistent and purposive interpretation of the Commercial Courts Act. \n18. I have considered the aforesaid arguments canvassed by Mr. Khandekar and 19 (2002) 4 SCC 154 Nitin 17 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Mr. Kohli. I have also considered the various decisions of the Apex Court and various High Courts as cited by them. However, prior to dealing with their respective arguments, it would be necessary even at the cost of repetition to once again set-out the subject provision viz. Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act :\n\" 16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes. \n(1) The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule. \n(2) The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value. \n(3) Where any provision of any Rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail.\"\n19. A bare reading of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act begs the interpretation that the provisions of the CPC shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value , stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule to the Commercial Courts Act and that this Commercial Nitin 18 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Division, shall follow the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value . \n20. Whilst I agree with Mr. Kohli in his argument that as per the mandate of Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act, this Commercial Division has been constituted for exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under the Commercial Courts Act, in my view, such jurisdiction ought to be exercised within the four corners of the Commercial Courts Act. An express provision such as Section 16 cannot be ignored in such manner. It was also Mr. Kohli's argument that Section 4 does not carve out a distinction between a 'commercial dispute' and a 'commercial dispute of a Specified Value'. While this may be so, Section 16 clearly does so. \n21 . In so far as Mr. Kohli's reliance on the marginal note/heading to Section 16 is concerned, I believe the extent of reliance this Court can place on a marginal note/heading of a provision is no longer res integra. In this context, it would be appropriate to reproduce the following findings of the Apex Court in its decision rendered in Karnataka Rare Earth vs. Deptt. of Mines & Geology20 :\n\"14. In support of the submission that the demand for the price of mineral raised and exported is in the nature of penalty, the learned counsel for the appellants has relied on the marginal note of Section 21. According to Justice Singh, G.P.: Principles of Statutory Interpretation (8th Edn., 2001, at p. 147), though the opinion is not uniform but the weight of 20 (2004) 2 SCC 783 Nitin 19 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc authority is in favour of the view that the marginal note appended to a section cannot be used for construing the section. There is no justification for restricting the section by the marginal note nor does the marginal note control the meaning of the body of the section if the language employed therein is clear and spells out its own meaning. In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Schildkamp[(1969) 3 All ER 1640 :\n(1970) 2 WLR 279 (HL)] Lord Reid opined that a sidenote is a poor guide to the scope of a section for it can do no more than indicate the main subject with which the section deals and Lord Upjohn opined that a sidenote being a brief prcis of the section forms a most unsure guide to the construction of the enacting section and very rarely it might throw some light on the intentions of Parliament just as a punctuation mark.\"\n22. The following judgments and observations contained therein, relied upon by Mr. Khandekar with respect to the reliance upon a marginal note in interpreting a section are also relevant:\na. Prakash Nath Khanna & Anr. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax & Anr. 21 \"16. Two principles of construction -- one relating to casus omissus and the other in regard to reading the statute as a whole -- appear to be well settled. Under the first principle a casus omissus cannot be supplied by the court except in the case of clear necessity and when reason for it is found in the four corners of the statute itself but at the same time a casus omissus should not be readily inferred and for that 21 (2004) 9 SCC 686 Nitin 20 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc purpose all the parts of a statute or section must be construed together and every clause of a section should be construed with reference to the context and other clauses thereof so that the construction to be put on a particular provision makes a consistent enactment of the whole statute. This would be more so if literal construction of a particular clause leads to manifestly absurd or anomalous results which could not have been intended by the legislature. \"An intention to produce an unreasonable result\", said Danckwerts, L.J., in Artemiou v. Procopiou [(1966) 1 QB 878 : (1965) 3 All ER 539 : (1965) 3 WLR 1011 (CA)] (All ER p. 544 I), \"is not to be imputed to a statute if there is some other construction available\". Where to apply words literally would \"defeat the obvious intention of the legislation and produce a wholly unreasonable result\", we must \"do some violence to the words\" and so achieve that obvious intention and produce a rational construction. [Per Lord Reid in Luke v. IRC [1963 AC 557 : (1963) 1 All ER 655 : (1963) 2 WLR 559 (HL)] where at AC p. 577 he also observed: (All ER p. 664 I) \"This is not a new problem, though our standard of drafting is such that it rarely emerges.\"] \n17. The heading of the section or the marginal note may be relied upon to clear any doubt or ambiguity in the interpretation of the provision and to discern the legislative intent. In CIT v. Ahmedbhai Umarbhai and Co. [AIR 1950 SC 134] after referring to the view expressed by Lord Macnaghten in Balraj Kunwar v. Jagatpal Singh [ILR (1904) 26 All 393 : 31 IA 132 : 1 All LJ 384 (PC)] it was held that marginal notes in an Indian statute, as in an Act of Parliament cannot be referred to for the Nitin 21 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc purpose of construing the statute. Similar view was expressed in Board of Muslim Wakfs, Rajasthan v. Radha Kishan [(1979) 2 SCC 468] and Kalawatibai v. Soiryabai [(1991) 3 SCC 410 : AIR 1991 SC 1581]. Marginal note certainly cannot control the meaning of the body of the section if the language employed there is clear. (See Nandini Satpathy v. P.L. Dani [(1978) 2 SCC 424 : 1978 SCC (Cri) 236 : AIR 1978 SC 1025] .) In the present case as noted above, the provisions of Section 276-CC are in clear terms. There is no scope for trying to clear any doubt or ambiguity as urged by learned counsel for the appellants. Interpretation sought to be put on Section 276-CC to the effect that if a return is filed under sub-section (4) of Section 139 it means that the requirements of sub-section (1) of Section 139 would stand complied with cannot be accepted for more reasons than one.\" (Emphasis Supplied) b. Union of India vs National Federation of Blind 22 \"46. The heading of a section or marginal note may be relied upon to clear any doubt or ambiguity in the interpretation of the provision and to discern the legislative intent. \nHowever, when the section is clear and unambiguous, there is no need to traverse beyond those words, hence, the headings or marginal notes cannot control the meaning of the body of the section. Therefore, the contention of Respondent 1 herein that the heading of Section 33 of the Act is \"Reservation of posts\" will not play a crucial role, when the section is clear and unambiguous.\" (Emphasis Supplied) 22 (2013) 10 SCC 772 Nitin 22 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc c. Tata Power Company Ltd. and Ors. vs Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission & Ors 23 \"116. Chapter headings and the marginal note are parts of the statute. They have also been enacted by the Parliament. There cannot, thus, be any doubt that it can be used in aid of the construction. It is, however, well settled that if the wordings of the statutory provision are clear and unambiguous, construction of the statute with the aid of `chapter heading' and `marginal note' may not arise. It may be that heading and marginal note, however, are of a very limited use in interpretation because of its necessarily brief and inaccurate nature. They are, however, not irrelevant. They certainly cannot be taken into consideration if they differ from the material they describe. \n117. We may notice some authorities on the subject at the outset. \n118. In Bennion on Statutory Interpretation, Fifth edition, Section 255, it is stated:\nwhere general words are preceded by a heading indicating a narrower scope it is legitimate to treat the general words as cut down by the heading. \n119. Section 256 of the said treatise deals with \"sidenote, heading or title\", wherein it is stated:\n23 MANU/SC/0932/2009 Nitin 23 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Use in interpretation - Like anything else in what Parliament puts out as its Acts, a sidenote or heading is part of the Act, despite dicta to the contrary. It may therefore be used by the interpreter. `No judge can be expected to treat something which is before his eyes as though it were not there. However, the sidenote or section heading is of very limited use in interpretation because of its necessarily brief and therefore possibly inaccurate nature. \n120. It was commented:\nIf the sidenote contradicts the text this puts the interpreter on inquiry; but the answer may be that the drafter chose an inadequate signpost, or neglected to alter it to match an amendment made to the clause during the passage of the Bill. Such facts are outside the knowledge of the interpreter, who must therefore adopt a rule not depending on them. \n... \nModern judges believe it proper to consider sidenotes or headings to sections, and gather what guidance they can from them. Thus Vinelott J said that the sidenote to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1970 Section 488 (repealed) was a permissible and useful guide that threw a light on the mischief at which the section was aimed. \nUpjohn LJ gave a precisely accurate indication of the role of the sidenote when he said:\nWhile the marginal note to a section cannot control the language used in the section , Nitin 24 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc it is at least permissible to approach a consideration of its general purpose and the mischief at which it is aimed with the note in mind. \nThe italicised words accurately show the relationship of this component to the informed interpretation rule. Earlier inconsistent dicta, a selection of which are now considered, must be treated as erroneous. \n121. In Interpretation of Statutes, Fourth Edition, by Vepa P. Sarathi at page 347 it is stated:\nThe heading of a chapter may be referred to in order to determine the sense of any doubtful expression in a section ranged under it. But it cannot control unambiguous expressions. \nIt is true that a heading cannot control the interpretation of a clause if its meaning is otherwise plain and unambiguous, but it can certainly be referred to as indicating the general drift of the clause and affording a key to a better understanding of its meaning.\n122. Similarly in Principles of Statutory Interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh, upon noticing the conflicting opinion, the learned Author states:\nThe view is now settled that the Headings or Titles prefixed to section or group of sections can be referred to in construing an Act of the Legislature. \nNitin 25 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc 123. Chapter heading, therefore, is a permitted tool of interpretation. It is considered to be a preamble of that section to which it pertains. It may be taken recourse to where an ambiguity exists. However, where there does not exist any ambiguity, it cannot be resorted to. Chapter heading and marginal note, however, can be resorted to for the purpose of resolving the doubts. \n124. It furthermore appears that there is a drift from the old value in recent times. \n125. We may notice that the English decisions whereupon reliance had been placed by this Court in various judgments and in particular Chandler v. DPP (1962) All ER 142 , str considered to be a no longer a good law in the country of origin, as stated in Bennion on Statutory Interpretation Fifth Edition at page 748:\nSuperseded dicta Phillimore LJ referred to a `general rule of law' to the effect that marginal notes must be disregarded `upon the principle that those notes are inserted not by Parliament nor under the authority of Parliament, but by irresponsible persons'. \nIn fact, with occasional trifling exceptions, the marginal notes in an Act are not inserted by parliamentary clerks - or even drafters - but are contained either in the Bill as introduced or in new clauses added by amendment. Furthermore, the clerks are not Nitin 26 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc `irresponsible persons', but are subject to the authority of Parliament. Avory J. said that `marginal notes form no part of a statute'. He added : `They are not voted on or passed by Parliament, but are inserted after the Bill has become law'. This is not the case however. The entire Act is passed by Parliament and is entered, or deemed to be entered, in the Parliament Roll with all non-amendable components included. These components mostly remain unchanged throughout the passage of the Bill. They are certainly not inserted after the Bill has become law. Willes J. after asserting that the marginal notes and other `appendages' are not part of an Act, said of any Act, passed after the practice of actually engrossing Acts on the Parliament Roll ceased in 1849:\n`The Act, when passed, must be looked at just as if it were still entered upon a roll, which it may be again if Parliament should be pleased so to order; in which case it would be without these appendages.... \n126. It is, however, evident from the decision of this Court in Indian Aluminium Company v. Kerala State Electricity Board MANU/SC/0310/1975 : [1976]1SCR70 , that the modern trend is to take into consideration the marginal note. It could be used, as has been held, in R.S. Joshi, Sales Tax Officer, Gujarat and Ors. v. Ajit Mills Limited and Anr. MANU / SC/0300/1977 : [1978]1SCR338 . Relevance of marginal note was also taken note of in Ramesh Chand and Ors. v. State of U.P. and Ors.\nMANU/SC/0389/1979 : [1980]1SCR498 .\n127. In Bombay Dyeing and Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Bombay Environmental Action Group and Ors. MANU / SC/1197/2006 : AIR2006SC1489 , marginal note has been Nitin 27 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc taken into consideration as an intrinsic part of the Section. In Deewan Singh and Ors. v. Rajendra Pd. Ardevi and Ors. MANU/SC/0207/2007 : AIR2007SC767 it has been held that the marginal note may be taken into consideration for the purpose of proper construction of the provision although there is no ambiguity. Sarabjit Rick Singh v. Union of India (UOI) MANU/SC/0041/2008 : (2008)2SCC417 follows Deewan Singh (supra).\" (Emphasis Supplied) \n23. As can be seen from the above findings, it is now settled law that a marginal note/heading cannot control the plain words of a section. When the words used in a provision are clear and unambiguous, a marginal note/heading cannot be used to alter the interpretation of such provision. I am therefore, unable to agree with Mr. Kohli's reliance on the marginal note/heading of Section 16. Similarly, I also cannot agree with Mr. Kohli's reliance on the Schedule to the Commercial Courts Act. The expressions used in the Schedule to an enactment cannot control or prevail against the express enactment and in case of any inconsistency between the Schedule and the enactment, the enactment is to prevail and if any part of the Schedule cannot be made to correspond to the Act, it must yield to the Act. In this context, the following findings of the Apex Court in its decision rendered in Aphali Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra24 :\n\"31. A Schedule in an Act of Parliament is a mere question of drafting. It is the legislative intent that is material. An 24 (1989) 4 SCC Nitin 28 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Explanation to the Schedule amounts to an Explanation in the Act itself. As we read in Halsbury's Laws of England, Third Edn., Vol. 36, para 551 [Ed.: See in Fourth Edition, Vol. 44, para 822] :\n\"To simplify the presentation of statutes, it is the practice for their subject-matter to be divided, where appropriate, between sections and Schedules, the former setting out matters of principle, and introducing the latter, and the latter containing all matters of detail. This is purely a matter of arrangement, and a Schedule is as much a part of the statute, and as much an enactment, as is the section by which it is introduced.\" \nThe Schedule may be used in construing provisions in the body of the Act. It is as much an act of legislature as the Act itself and it must be read together with the Act for all purposes of construction. Expressions in the Schedule cannot control or prevail against the express enactment and in case of any inconsistency between the Schedule and the enactment, the enactment is to prevail and if any part of the Schedule cannot be made to correspond it must yield to the Act. Lord Sterndale, in IRC v. Gittus [(1920) 1 KB 563] said: (at p. 576). \n\"It seems to me there are two principles or rules of interpretation which ought to be applied to the combination of Act and Schedule. If the Act says that the Schedule is to be used for a certain purpose and the heading of the part of the Schedule in question shows that it is prima facie at any rate devoted to that purpose, then you must read the Act and the Schedule as though the Schedule were operating for that Nitin 29 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc purpose, and if you can satisfy the language of the section without extending it beyond that purpose, you ought to do it. But if in spite of that you find in the language of the Schedule words and terms that go clearly outside that purpose, then you must give effect to them and you must not consider them as limited by the heading of that part of the Schedule or by the purpose mentioned in the Act for which the Schedule is prima facie to be used. You cannot refuse to give effect to clear words simply because prima facie they seem to be limited by the heading of the Schedule and the definition of the purpose of the Schedule contained in the Act.\" \n24. In this regard, the following observations in the case of Ajay Enterprises (P) Ltd. and Anr. vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi 25 relied upon by Mr. Khandekar are also relevant- \"There can be no dispute that the various provisions of an enactment are to be so construed as to give a harmonious applicability. But the question to be determined is as to what is the effect if the language of the provisions in a schedule is contrary to the provisions contained in the main enactment. Craies on Statute Law (Seventh Edition) at pages 224-225 says, \"The schedule is as much a part of the statute, and is as much an enactment, as any other part, but if an enactment in a schedule contradicts an earlier clause the clause prevails against the schedule\". Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (Eleventh Edition) at page 156 says, \"Where a passage in a schedule to a statute was repugnant to one in the body of the statute, the latter was held to prevail, and the mere wording of a specimen form in a Schedule to an Act cannot restrict or enlarge a provision in the Act itself.\" Again Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (Twelfth Edition) at page 12 says, \"Schedules to statutes are as much part of an Act as any other, and may be used in construing provisions in the body of the Act. Similarly, provisions in a schedule will be construed in the 25 ILR (1972) 2 Del 629 at page 639 Nitin 30 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc light of what is enacted in the sections\". It is, therefore, evident that provisions in a schedule are to be construed in the light of what is enacted in the sections. If the words of a section are clear without admitting of any ambiguity, one cannot refuse to give effect to the clear words of the statute, and the positive language of an enactment cannot be dispensed with. That being so, if an enactment in a schedule contradicts the language of the section itself to which the schedule is appended, the section prevails against the schedule. Reference may be made here to The Queen v. Baines, (1840) 12 A. D. & E. 227. In that case Bains took objection to the legality of Ms deprivation on various grounds. One of the objection was to the form of the significavite as being issued by Dean of Arches and not by the Archbishop himself. The contention raised was that the form of significavite itself as given in the schedule proved that the jury, i.e., the Bishop was the only person who ought to certify as the form of significavite could only apply to a Bishop. Dealing with the contention Lord Denman, C.J., observed at page 227, \"... such form although embodied in the Act, cannot be deemed conclusive of a question of this nature: we have also to consider the language of the section itself to which the schedule is appended; and, if there be any contradiction between the two, which upon fair construction there perhaps will not be found to be, upon ordinary principles the form, which is made to suit rather the generality of cases than all cases, must give way.\" (Emphasis Supplied) \n25. Mr. Kohli relied heavily on his submissions that this Court ought to interpret Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act in a purposive manner. During the course of arguments, Mr. Kohli relied upon the following decisions and the findings therein to persuade me in 'purposively' interpreting Section 16 as suggested by him :\n25.1 Sansar Chand Atri vs. State of Punjab26 :\n\" 9. It is relevant to note here that in the certificate issued by the Ministry of Defence the appellant has been described as an ex-serviceman. The provision for reservation in the Service Rules is meant for the benefit of ex-servicemen. The 26 (2002) 4 SCC 154 Nitin 31 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc purpose is to provide them with suitable jobs in the civil services so that they may not face difficulty in adjusting themselves in civil society after leaving the defence service. In the context of the scheme of the provision the provisions in the Rules should be interpreted in a purposive and reasonable manner so that the intent and purpose of the provision is served. From the provisions in the Rules it appears that a distinction has been made for persons who are released from the army on the ground of medical disqualification or on the ground of inefficiency or misconduct. Such distinction is reasonable keeping in view the purpose of reservation of posts made under the Rules. All the ex-defence service personnel are to be treated as a class separate from other candidates for the purpose of offer of jobs and no differentiation or discrimination can be made amongst them unless such differences are real and substantial. Testing the provisions in this context we are of the view that a person in the army who has earned pension after putting in the requisite period of service before leaving the army whether at his own request or on being released by the employer or on any ground should be treated as an ex-serviceman who has retired from the army. Such treatment is to be meted out to all such persons irrespective of whether the nomenclature used is \"released [ As per Corrigendum issued by Supreme Court of India dated 7-8-2002 No. F.3/Ed. B.J./141/2002] \" or \"discharged\" or \"retired\". If the contention raised on behalf of the Service Commission and the State Government that since the appellant has been Nitin 32 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc discharged from the army at his own request, he cannot be treated as an ex-serviceman, is accepted then it will create a class within a class without rational basis and, therefore, becomes arbitrary and discriminatory. It will also defeat the purpose for which the provision for reservation has been made. \n10. The High Court, in our view, is not justified in placing reliance on sub-clause (iv) of the definition clause and excluding the writ petitioners from the eligible category on that basis. Sub-clause (iv) has no application in the instant case for the reason that it applies to such of those persons who are released from service after specific period of engagement and become entitled to get gratuity. If a person, who served in the armed forces, is released after being granted the benefit of pension, the case is taken out of the purview of sub-clause (iv). The exclusionary words \"otherwise than at his own request\" occurring in sub-clause (iv) cannot, therefore, be relied upon to deny the benefit to the appellants. Then the question arises, whether such person would fall under sub-clause (i)? True, according to the terminology used in the Service Rules governing the armed forces there is a distinction between retirement and release/discharge, as pointed out by the High Court. But, in the context of definition of ex-serviceman in Rule 2( c )( ii ), the broader meaning has to be given to the word \"retired\" occurring in sub-clause ( i ). In principle and in the light of the considerations set out above, there is no rational basis for excluding those discharged or Nitin 33 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc released from service after earning pension. It is only after considerable period of satisfactory service a member of the armed forces becomes entitled to pension. The mere fact that after such long period of service he voluntarily quit the service with the consent of the employer should not place him in a disadvantageous position for claiming the benefit of reservation for ex-serviceman. Therefore, the expression \"retirement\" should be given wider meaning in order to effectuate the objective behind the Rule .\"\n[Emphasis supplied]\"\n25.2. Union of India vs Filip Tiago De Gama of Vedem Vasco De Gama27 : \nT he paramount object in statutory interpretation is to discover what the legislature intended. This intention is primarily to be ascertained from the text of enactment in question. That does not mean the text is to be construed merely as a piece of prose, without reference to its nature or purpose. A statute is neither a literary text nor a divine revelation. \"Words are certainly not crystals, transparent and unchanged\" as Mr Justice Holmes has wisely and properly warned. (Towne v. Eisner [245 US 418, 425 (1918)] ) Learned Hand, J., was equally emphatic when he said: \"Statutes should be construed, not as theorems of Euclid, but with some imagination of the purposes which lie behind them.\" (Lenigh Valley Coal Co. v. Yensavage [218 FR 547, 553] ) \n17. Section 30(2) provides that amended provisions of Section 23(2) shall apply, and shall be deemed to have 27 1990 (1) SCC 277 Nitin 34 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc applied, also to, and in relation to, any award made by the Collector or court between April 30, 1982 and September 24, 1984, or to an appellate order therefrom passed by the High Court or Supreme Court. The purpose of these provisions seems to be that the awards made in that interregnum must get higher solatium inasmuch as to awards made subsequent to September 24, 1984. Perhaps it was thought that awards made after the commencement of the Amending Act 68 of 1984 would be taken care of by the amended Section 23(2). \nThe case like the present one seems to have escaped attention by innocent lack of due care in the drafting. The result would be an obvious anomaly as will be indicated presently. If there is obvious anomaly in the application of law the court could shape the law to remove the anomaly. If the strict grammatical interpretation gives rise to absurdity or inconsistency, the court could discard such interpretation and adopt an interpretation which will give effect to the purpose of the legislature. That could be done, if necessary even by modification of the language used [See: Mahadeolal Kanodia v. Administrator General of West Bengal [(1960) 3 SCR 578 : AIR 1960 SC 936] ]. The legislators do not always deal with specific controversies which the courts decide. They incorporate general purpose behind the statutory words and it is for the courts to decide specific cases. If a given case is well within the general purpose of the legislature but not within the literal meaning of the statute, then the court must strike the balance. \n     Nitin                                         35 / 57                RPL-15-2019-3.doc                                                             (Emphasis supplied)\" \n25.3. Rajbir Singh Dalal (Dr.) vs Chaudhari Devilal University, Sirsa28 : \n\"12. Mr P.S. Patwalia, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant submitted that in the UGC Regulations for the post of Lecturer the requirement was a Masters degree in the relevant subject, whereas the expression \"in the relevant subject\" is not mentioned in the qualifications for the post of Reader. Hence, he submitted that it was not necessary for the appellant to have a Masters degree in the relevant subject for appointment to the post of Reader. We regret we cannot agree. In our opinion, the words \"in the relevant subject\" has to be read into the qualification for the post of Reader also. To take a contrary view would lead to a strange situation as that would mean that a person who has an MA degree in Music or History, is qualified to be appointed as Reader in Political Science. \n13. No doubt, the ordinary principle of interpretation is that words should neither be added nor deleted from a statutory provision. However, there are some exceptions to the rule where the alternative lies between either supplying by implication words which appear to have been accidentally omitted, or adopting a strict construction which leads to absurdity or deprives certain existing words of all meaning, and in this situation it is permissible to supply the words (vide Principles of Statutory Interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh, 9th Edn., pp. 71-76). \n28 2008 (9) SCC 284      Nitin                                       36 / 57                   RPL-15-2019-3.doc 14. Thus, in Siraj-ul-Haq Khan v. Sunni Central Board of Waqf [AIR 1959 SC 198] , the Supreme Court interpreted the words \"any person interested in a waqf\" in Section 5(2) of the U.P. Muslim Waqfs Act, 1936 as meaning \"any person interested in what is held to be a waqf\". \n15. Similarly, in State Bank of Travancore v. Mohd. M. Khan [(1981) 4 SCC 82 : AIR 1981 SC 1744] , while construing Section 4(1) of the Kerala Agriculturists' Debt Relief Act, 1970 the Supreme Court interpreted the words \"any debt due before the commencement of this Act to any banking company\" as meaning \"any debt due at and before the commencement of this Act\". \n16. Similarly, in Gujarat Composite Ltd. v. Ranip Nagarpalika [(1999) 8 SCC 675 : AIR 2000 SC 135] the Supreme Court interpreted the words \"grog minerals\" to mean \"grog and minerals\". In Southern Railway v. T.R. Chellappan [(1976) 3 SCC 190 : 1976 SCC (L&S) 398 : AIR 1975 SC 2216] the Supreme Court interpreted the words \"any party to an arbitration agreement\" occurring in Section 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 to mean \"a person who is alleged to be a party to an arbitration agreement\". (Emphasis supplied)\". 25.4. Commissioner of Income Tax, Central Calcutta vs. National Taj Traders 29 : \n\"10. Two principles of construction -- one relating to casus omissus and the other in regard to reading the statute as a whole -- appear to be well settled. In regard to the former the following statement of law appears in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edn.) at p. 33:\n29 1980 (1) SCC 370 Nitin 37 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc \"Omissions not to be inferred.--It is a corollary to the general rule of literal construction that nothing is to be added to or taken from a statute unless there are adequate grounds to justify the inference that the legislature intended something which it omitted to express. Lord Morsey said: 'It is a strong thing to read into an Act of Parliament words which are not there, and in the absence of clear necessity it is a wrong thing to do'. 'We are not entitled', said Lord Loreburn L.C., 'to read words into an Act of Parliament unless clear reason for it is to be found within the four corners of the Act itself'. A case not provided for in a statute is not to be dealt with merely because there seems no good reason why it should have been omitted, and the omission appears in consequence to have been unintentional.\" \nIn regard to the latter principle the following statement of law appears in Maxwell at p. 47:\n\"A statute is to be read as a whole.--It was resolved in the case of Lincoln College [(1595) 3 Co. Rep. 58b at p. 59b] that the good expositor of an Act of Parliament should 'make construction on all the parts together, and not of one part only by itself'. Every clause of a statute is to 'be construed with reference to the context and other clauses of the Act, so as, as far as possible, to make a consistent enactment of the whole statute'.\" (Per Lord Davey in Canada Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. v.R., 1898 AC 735.) In other words, under the first principle a casus omissus cannot be supplied by the Court except in the case of clear necessity and when reason for it is found in the four corners Nitin 38 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc of the statute itself but at the same time a casus omissus should not be readily inferred and for that purpose all the parts of a statute or section must be construed together and every clause of a section should be construed with reference to the context and other clauses thereof so that the construction to be put on a particular provision makes a consistent enactment of the whole statute. This would be more so if literal construction of a particular clause leads to manifestly absurd or anomalous results which could not have been intended by the Legislature. \"An intention to produce an unreasonable result\", said Danckwerts, L.J., in Artemiou v. Procopiou (1966 1 QB 878), \"is not to be imputed to a statute if there is some other construction available\". Where to apply words literally would \"defeat the obvious intention of the legislation and produce a wholly unreasonable result\" we must \"do some violence to the words\" and so achieve that obvious intention and produce a rational construction. [Per Lord Reid in Luke v. IRC (1966 AC 557) where at p. 577 he also observed: \"this is not a new problem, though our standard of drafting is such that it rarely emerges\".] In the light of these principles we will have to construe sub-section (2)(b) with reference to the context and other clauses of Section 33-B. (Emphasis supplied)\". \n25.5. Shailesh Dhairyawan vs Mohan Balkrishna Lulla30 :\n30 2016 (3) SCC 619 Nitin 39 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc \"31. The aforesaid two reasons given by me, in addition to the reasons already indicated in the judgment of my learned Brother, would clearly demonstrate that the provisions of Section 15(2) of the Act require purposive interpretation so that the aforesaid objective/purpose of such a provision is achieved thereby. The principle of \" purposive interpretation \" or \" purposive construction \" is based on the understanding that the court is supposed to attach that meaning to the provisions which serve the \" purpose \" behind such a provision. The basic approach is to ascertain what is it designed to accomplish? To put it otherwise, by interpretative process the court is supposed to realise the goal that the legal text is designed to realise. As Aharon Barak puts it:\n\"Purposive interpretation is based on three components: language, purpose, and discretion. Language shapes the range of semantic possibilities within which the interpreter acts as a linguist. Once the interpreter defines the range, he or she chooses the legal meaning of the text from among the (express or implied) semantic possibilities. The semantic component thus sets the limits of interpretation by restricting the interpreter to a legal meaning that the text can bear in its (public or private) language.\" [ Aharon Barak, Purposive Interpretation in Law (Princeton University Press, 2005).] \n32. Of the aforesaid three components, namely, language, purpose and discretion \"of the court\", insofar as purposive component is concerned, this is the ratio juris, the purpose at Nitin 40 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc the core of the text. This purpose is the values, goals, interests, policies and aims that the text is designed to actualise. It is the function that the text is designed to fulfil. \n33. We may also emphasise that the statutory interpretation of a provision is never static but is always dynamic. Though the literal rule of interpretation, till some time ago, was treated as the \" golden rule \", it is now the doctrine of purposive interpretation which is predominant, particularly in those cases where literal interpretation may not serve the purpose or may lead to absurdity. If it brings about an end which is at variance with the purpose of statute, that cannot be countenanced. Not only legal process thinkers such as Hart and Sacks rejected intentionalism as a grand strategy for statutory interpretation, and in its place they offered purposivism, this principle is now widely applied by the courts not only in this country but in many other legal systems as well. (Emphasis Supplied)\". \n25.6. Indian Performing Rights Society vs Sanjay Dalia31 :\n\"27. It was also submitted that Heydon's [Heydon's case, (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a : 76 ER 637] rule is not applicable where the words of the statute are clear. Reliance has been placed on Hiralal Rattanlal v. State of U.P. [(1973) 1 SCC 216] in which it has been observed that when the provision is unambiguous and if from the provision legislative intent is clear, the court need not call into aid the other rule of construction of statutes 31 2015 (10) SCC 161 Nitin 41 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc such as that of \"mischief\". However, we opine, when two interpretations are possible, the court has to adopt the one which furthers the object as provided in the statute itself. \n28. Reliance has been placed on Padma Sundara Rao v. State of T.N. [(2002) 3 SCC 533 : AIR 2002 SC 1334] in which it has been observed that the intention of the legislature must be found in the words used by the legislature itself. Reliance has also been placed on Grasim Industries Ltd. v. Collector of Customs [(2002) 4 SCC 297] in which it has been observed that wherever the language is clear, the intention of the legislature is to be gathered from the language used. While doing so, what has been said as also what has not been said, has to be noted. There is no dispute with the aforesaid proposition. However, the object of the Act and the intention of the legislature is clear which is to the otherwise.\" xxx \"32. Justice G.P. Singh in Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 12th Edn., has observed that regard be had to the subject and object of the Act. The court's effort is to harmonise the words of the statute with the subject of enactment and the object the legislature has in view. When two interpretations are feasible, the court will prefer the one which advances the remedy and suppresses the mischief as envisioned. The relevant portion is extracted below:\n\"As stated earlier (Chapter 1, Title 2 'Intention of the Nitin 42 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Legislature', text and Notes 57 to 69, pp. 14 to 17) and as approved by the Supreme Court:\n'9. ... \"the words of a statute, when there is doubt about their meaning, are to be understood in the sense in which they best harmonise with the subject of the enactment and the object which the legislature has in view. Their meaning is found not so much in a strictly grammatical or etymological propriety of language, nor even in its popular use, as in the subject or in the occasion on which they are used, and the object to be attained.\" \n(Workmen v. Dimakuchi Tea Estate [AIR 1958 SC 353] , AIR p. 356, para 9.) The courts have declined \"to be bound by the letter, when it frustrates the patent purposes of the statute\". (Cabell v. Markham [148 F 2d 737 (2d Cir 1945)] ), ( Judge Learned Hand). In the words of Shah, J.:\n'8. ... It is a recognised rule of interpretation of statutes that the expressions used therein should ordinarily be understood in a sense in which they best harmonise with the object of the statute and which effectuate the object of the legislature.' (New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. CST [AIR 1963 SC 1207] , AIR p. 1213, para 8.) Therefore when two interpretations are feasible the court will prefer that which advances the remedy and suppresses the mischief as the legislature envisioned. (Carew & Co. Ltd. v. Union of India [(1975) 2 SCC 791] , SCC p. 804, para 40.) The Court should adopt an object- oriented approach keeping in mind the principle that Nitin 43 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc legislative futility is to be ruled out so long as interpretative possibility permits. [Busching Schmitz (P) Ltd. v. P.T. Menghani [(1977) 2 SCC 835] , SCC pp. 843-44, para 17. ] The object-oriented approach, however, cannot be carried to the extent of doing violence to the plain language used by rewriting the section or substituting words in place of the actual words used by the legislature. (CIT v. N.C. Budharaja and Co. [1994 Supp (1) SCC 280] , SCC p. 288, para 13.) Having regard to the object of the U.P. Bhoodan Yagna Act, 1953 to implement the Bhoodan movement, which aimed at distribution of land to landless labourers who were versed in agriculture and who had no other means of subsistence, it was held that the expression 'landless persons' in Section 14, which made provision for grant of land to landless persons, was limited to landless labourers as described above and did not include a landless businessman residing in a city. (U.P. Bhoodan Yagna Samiti v. Braj Kishore [(1988) 4 SCC 274] .)\" \n33. In Busching Schmitz (P) Ltd. v. P.T. Menghani [(1977) 2 SCC 835] , it has been observed that purposive interpretation may be made having regard to the object of the provisions and to avoid any obvious lacuna. \n34. The learned author Justice G.P. Singh in Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edn. has also observed that it is the court's duty to avoid hardship, inconvenience, injustice, absurdity and anomaly while selecting out of different interpretations. The doctrine must be applied with great care and in case absurd inconvenience is to be caused that interpretation has to Nitin 44 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc be avoided. Cases of individual hardship or injustice have no bearing for enacting the natural construction. The relevant discussion at pp. 132-33 and 140-42 is extracted hereunder:\n\"(a) Hardship, inconvenience, injustice, absurdity and anomaly to be avoided In selecting out of different interpretations 'the court will adopt that which is just, reasonable and sensible rather than that which is none of those things' (Holmes v. Bradfield Rural District Council [(1949) 2 KB 1 : (1949) 1 All ER 381 (DC)] , All ER p. 384) as it may be presumed 'that the legislature should have used the word in that interpretation which least offends our sense of justice'. (Simms v. Registrar of Probates [1900 AC 323 (PC)] , AC p. 335.) If the grammatical construction leads to some absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, it may be departed from so as to avoid that absurdity and inconsistency. \n(Grey v. Pearson [(1857) LR 6 HL Cas 61 : (1843-60) All ER Rep 21] , HLC p. 106.) Similarly, a construction giving rise to anomalies should be avoided. (N.T. Veluswami Thevar v. G. Raja Nainar [AIR 1959 SC 422] , AIR SC pp. 427 and 428.) As approved by Venkatarama Aiyar, J.:\n'7. ... Where the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical construction, leads to a manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of the enactment, or to some inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or injustice, presumably not intended, a construction may be put upon it which modifies the meaning of the words, and even the Nitin 45 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc structure of the sentence.' (Tirath Singh v. Bachittar Singh [AIR 1955 SC 830] , AIR p. 833, para 7.)\" \n*** \"Consideration of hardship, injustice or absurdity as avoiding a particular construction is a rule which must be applied with great care. 'The argument ab inconvenienti', said Lord Moulton, 'is one which requires to be used with great caution'. (Vacher & Sons Ltd. v. London Society of Compositors [1913 AC 107 : (1911-13) All ER Rep 241 (HL)] .) Explaining why great caution is necessary Lord Moulton further observed: (AC p. 130) '... There is a danger that it may degenerate into mere judicial criticism of the propriety of the Acts of legislature. We have to interpret statutes according to the language used therein, and, though occasionally the respective consequences of two rival interpretations may guide us in our choice between them, it can only be where, taking the Act as a whole, and viewing it in connection with the existing state of the law at the time of the passing of the Act, we can satisfy ourselves that the words can have been used in the sense to which the argument points.' (Vacher & Sons Ltd. v. London Society of Compositors [1913 AC 107 : (1911-13) All ER Rep 241 (HL)] .) According to Brett, L.J., the inconvenience necessitating a departure from the ordinary sense of the words should not only be great but should also be what he calls an 'absurd inconvenience'. Moreover, individual cases of hardship or injustice have no Nitin 46 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc bearing for rejecting the natural construction (Young & Co. v. Royal Leamington Spa Corpn. [(1883) LR 8 AC 517 (HL)] ), and it is only when the natural construction leads to some general hardship or injustice and some other construction is reasonably open that the natural construction may be departed from. It is often found that laws enacted for the general advantage do result in individual hardship; for example laws of Limitation, Registration, Attestation although enacted for the public benefit, may work injustice in particular cases but that is hardly any reason to depart from the normal rule to relieve the supposed hardship or injustice in such cases. (Lucy v. W.T. Henleys Telegraph Works Co. Ltd. [(1970) 1 QB 393 : (1969) 3 WLR 588 : (1969) 3 All ER 456 (CA)] ) 'It is the duty of all courts of justice', said Lord Campbell, 'to take care for the general good of the community, that hard cases do not make bad law'. (East India Co. v. Oditchurn Paul [(1850) 7 Moo PCC 85 : 13 ER 811] .) 'Absurdity' according to Willes, J., should be understood 'in the same sense as repugnance that is to say something which would be so absurd with reference to the other words of the statute as to amount to a repugnance'. (Christophersen v. Lotingae [(1864) 33 LJ CP 121] .) 'Absurdity', said Lord Greene, M.R., 'like public policy, is a very unruly horse'. (Grundt v. Great Boulder Proprietary Mines Ltd. [1948 Ch 145 : (1948) 1 All ER 21 (CA)] ) He proceeded to add:\n'There is one rule, I think which is clear ... that, although the absurdity or the non-absurdity of one conclusion as compared Nitin 47 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc with another may be, and very often is, of assistance to the court in choosing between two possible meanings of ambiguous words, it is a doctrine which has to be applied with great care, remembering that Judges may be fallible in this question of an absurdity and in any event it must not be applied so as to result in twisting language into a meaning which it cannot bear. It is a doctrine which must not be used to rewrite the language in a way different from that in which it was originally framed.' (Grundt v. Great Boulder Proprietary Mines Ltd. [1948 Ch 145 : (1948) 1 All ER 21 (CA)] , Ch pp. 159-60.) The alternative construction contended for must be such which does not put an undue strain on the words used; (Kanailal Sur v. Paramnidhi Sadhukhan [AIR 1957 SC 907] ) and does not require recasting of the Act or any part of it. It must be possible to spell the meaning contended for out of the words actually used. (Shamrao V. Parulekar v. District Magistrate, Thana [AIR 1952 SC 324 : 1952 Cri LJ 1503] .) No doubt in cases of ambiguity that construction which better serves the ends of fairness and justice will be accepted, but otherwise it is for the legislature in forming its policy to consider these elements. (IRC v. Mutual Investment Co. Ltd. [1967 AC 587 : (1966) 3 WLR 740 : (1966) 3 All ER 265 (PC)] ) If no alternative construction is open, the court cannot ignore a statutory provision 'to relieve what it considers a distress resulting from its operation; a statute has to be given effect to whether the court likes it or not'. (Martin Nitin 48 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Burn Ltd. v. Corpn. of Calcutta [AIR 1966 SC 529] .) The function of the court is to find out what is legal and not what is right. (Chandavarkar Sita Ratna Rao v. Ashalata S. Guram [(1986) 4 SCC 447] .) It is presumed that a legislative body intends which is the necessary effect of its enactments; the object, the purpose and the intention of the enactment is the same; it need not be expressed in any recital or Preamble; and it is not competent for any court judicially to ascribe any part of the legal operation of the statute to inadvertence. (Kariapper v. Wijesinha [1968 AC 717 : (1967) 3 WLR 1460 : (1967) 3 All ER 485 (PC)] .) The courts should as far as possible avoid a construction which results in anomalies. (N.T. Veluswami Thevar v. G. Raja Nainar [AIR 1959 SC 422] .)\" \n35.Bennion on Statutory Interpretation has mentioned law to the same effect under Section 312 and has observed that there is a presumption that absurd result is not intended and in Section 314 it has been observed that the court has to avoid an inconvenient result while interpreting a provision. It was stated that it can be presumed that Parliament intends that while construing an enactment the court will avoid a construction that is unworkable or impracticable, inconvenient, anomalous or illogical as the same is unlikely to be intended by Parliament. In Rosali V. v. TAICO Bank [(2009) 17 SCC 690 : (2011) 2 SCC (Civ) 626] , this Court referring to Halsbury's commonsense construction rule held that it is a well-settled principle of law that commonsense Nitin 49 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc construction rule should be taken recourse in certain cases. \n36. This Court in Sonic Surgical v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. [Sonic Surgical v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., (2010) 1 SCC 135 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 28] has also laid down law to the same effect and has discussed the term \"branch office\"\nused in Section 17(2) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 in the context of cause of action. Section 17(2) of the said Act reads thus: (SCC p. 138, para 7) \"7. ... '17. (2) A complaint shall be instituted in a State Commission within the limits of whose jurisdiction-- (a) the opposite party or each of the opposite parties, where there are more than one, at the time of the institution of the complaint, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or has a branch office or personally works for gain; or (b) any of the opposite parties, where there are more than one, at the time of the institution of the complaint, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business or has a branch office or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the permission of the State Commission is given or the opposite parties who do not reside or carry on business or have a branch office or personally works for gain, as the case may be, acquiesce in such institution; or (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.'\"\nThis Court while interpreting the provision held that the term \"branch office\" as used in the amended Section 17(2)(b) has to be interpreted to mean only that branch office where the Nitin 50 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc cause of action has arisen. Thus, the court departed from the plain and literal meaning of the words of Section 17(2)(b) of the Consumer Protection Act in order to avoid absurdity. The decision in Sonic Surgical [Sonic Surgical v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., (2010) 1 SCC 135 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 28] has been approved by this Court in State of M.P. v. Narmada Bachao Andolan [(2011) 7 SCC 639 : (2011) 3 SCC (Civ) 875] inasmuch as this Court has observed that in case the natural meaning leads to mischievous consequences, it must be avoided by accepting other permissible construction. \n(emphasis supplied)\". \n26. Whilst the aforesaid judgments reflect that the courts therein have purposively interpreted the subject provisions therein, I do not deem it necessary to depart from the foremost principle of statutory interpretation viz. the literal rule of interpretation. In this context, the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of B. Premanand vs. Mohan Koikal32 and the following findings therein:\n\"9. It may be mentioned in this connection that the first and foremost principle of interpretation of a statute in every system of interpretation is the literal rule of interpretation. The other rules of interpretation e.g. the mischief rule, purposive interpretation, etc. can only be resorted to when the plain words of a statute are ambiguous or lead to no intelligible results or if read literally would nullify the very object of the statute. Where the words of a statute are 32 (2011) 4 SCC 266 Nitin 51 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc absolutely clear and unambiguous, recourse cannot be had to the principles of interpretation other than the literal rule, vide Swedish Match AB v. SEBI [(2004) 11 SCC 641 : AIR 2004 SC 4219] .\n16. Where the words are unequivocal, there is no scope for importing any rule of interpretation (vide Pandian Chemicals Ltd. v. CIT [(2003) 5 SCC 590] ). It is only where the provisions of a statute are ambiguous that the court can depart from a literal or strict construction (vide Nasiruddin v. Sita Ram Agarwal [(2003) 2 SCC 577 : AIR 2003 SC 1543] ). Where the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous effect must be given to them (vide Bhaiji v. SDO [(2003) 1 SCC 692] ). \n17. No doubt in some exceptional cases departure can be made from the literal rule of the interpretation, e.g. by adopting a purposive construction, Heydon [Heydon case, (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a : 76 ER 637] mischief rule, etc. but that should only be done in very exceptional cases. Ordinarily, it is not proper for the court to depart from the literal rule as that would really be amending the law in the garb of interpretation, which is not permissible (vide J.P. Bansal v.\nState of Rajasthan[(2003) 5 SCC 134 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 605 :\nAIR 2003 SC 1405] and State of Jharkhand v. Govind Singh [(2005) 10 SCC 437 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1570 : JT (2004) 10 SC 349] ). It is for the legislature to amend the law and not the court (vide State of Jharkhand v. Govind Singh [(2005) 10 SCC 437 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1570 : JT (2004) 10 SC 349] ).\nNitin 52 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc 18. In Jinia Keotin v. Kumar Sitaram Manjhi [(2003) 1 SCC 730] (SCC p. 733, para 5) this Court observed [Ed.: As observed in Raghunath Rai Bareja v. Punjab National Bank, (2007) 2 SCC 230, p. 245, para 48.] :\n\"48. ... The court cannot legislate under the garb of interpretation.\" \nHence, there should be judicial restraint in this connection, and the temptation to do judicial legislation should be eschewed by the Courts. In fact, judicial legislation is an oxymoron. \n19. In Shiv Shakti Coop. Housing Society v. Swaraj Developers [(2003) 6 SCC 659 : AIR 2003 SC 2434] this Court observed: (SCC p. 669, para 19) \"19. It is a well-settled principle in law that the court cannot read anything into a statutory provision which is plain and unambiguous. A statute is an edict of the legislature. The language employed in a statute is the determinative factor of legislative intent.\" \n20. Where the language is clear, the intention of the legislature has to be gathered from the language used (vide Grasim Industries Ltd. v. Collector of Customs [(2002) 4 SCC 297] and Union of India v. Hansoli Devi [(2002) 7 SCC 273] ).\n21. In Union of India v. Hansoli Devi [(2002) 7 SCC 273] this Court observed: (SCC p. 281, para 9) Nitin 53 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc \"9. ... It is a cardinal principle of construction of a statute that when the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, then the court must give effect to the words used in the statute and it would not be open to the courts to adopt a hypothetical construction on the ground that such construction is more consistent with the alleged object and policy of the Act.\"\n22. The function of the court is only to expound the law and not to legislate (vide District Mining Officer v. TISCO [(2001) 7 SCC 358] ). If we accept the interpretation canvassed by the learned counsel for the private respondents, we will really be legislating because in the guise of interpretation we will be really amending Rule 27(c) of the Rules. \n23. In Gurudevdatta VKSSS Maryadit v. State of Maharashtra [(2001) 4 SCC 534 : AIR 2001 SC 1980] , this Court observed: (SCC pp. 552-53, para 26) \"26. ... it is a cardinal principle of interpretation of statute that the words of a statute must be understood in their natural, ordinary or popular sense and construed according to their grammatical meaning, unless such construction leads to some absurdity or unless there is something in the context or in the object of the statute to suggest to the contrary. The golden rule is that the words of a statute must prima facie be given their ordinary meaning. It is yet another rule of construction that when the words of the statute are clear, Nitin 54 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc plain and unambiguous, then the courts are bound to give effect to that meaning, irrespective of the consequences. It is said that the words themselves best declare the intention of the law-giver. The courts have adhered to the principle that efforts should be made to give meaning to each and every word used by the legislature and it is not a sound principle of construction to brush aside words in a statute as being inapposite surpluses, if they can have a proper application in circumstances conceivable within the contemplation of the statute.\"\nThe same view has been taken by this Court in Harshad S. Mehta v. State of Maharashtra [(2001) 8 SCC 257 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 1447] (vide SCC para 34) and Patangrao Kadam v. Prithviraj Sayajirao Yadav Deshmukh [(2001) 3 SCC 594 :\nAIR 2001 SC 1121] . \n24. The literal rule of interpretation really means that there should be no interpretation. In other words, we should read the statute as it is, without distorting or twisting its language. \nWe may mention here that the literal rule of interpretation is not only followed by Judges and lawyers, but it is also followed by the layman in his ordinary life. To give an illustration, if a person says \"this is a pencil\", then he means that it is a pencil; and it is not that when he says that the object is a pencil, he means that it is a horse, donkey or an elephant. In other words, the literal rule of interpretation simply means that we mean what we say and we say what we mean. If we do not follow the literal rule of interpretation, Nitin 55 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc social life will become impossible, and we will not understand each other. If we say that a certain object is a book, then we mean it is a book. If we say it is a book, but we mean it is a horse, table or an elephant, then we will not be able to communicate with each other. Life will become impossible. Hence, the meaning of the literal rule of interpretation is simply that we mean what we say and we say what we mean.\"\n27. In my view, literally interpreting Section 16, the interpretation that follows is that the amendments introduced by Section 16 apply only to Commercial Disputes of a Specified Value and not Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value. This is the letter of law. Section 16, as it reads currently ought to be interpreted literally. In Kanai Lal Sur vs. Paramnidhi Sadhukhan33, it was held by the Apex Court that if the words used are capable of one construction only then it would not be open to the courts to adopt any other hypothetical construction on the ground that such construction is more consistent with the alleged object and policy of the subject Act. Further, the Apex Court, in its decision rendered in Commr. of Customs v. Dilip Kumar & Co.,34 has held thus :\n\"21.The well-settled principle is that when the words in a statute are clear, plain and unambiguous and only one meaning can be inferred, the courts are bound to give effect to the said meaning irrespective of consequences. If the words in the statute are plain and unambiguous, it becomes necessary 33 AIR 1957 SC 907 34 (2018) 9 SCC 1 Nitin 56 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words used declare the intention of the legislature.\" \n28. Additionally, as submitted by Mr. Kohli, there may be certain inefficient consequences resulting from the literal interpretation of Section 16. Illustratively, the present Suit is titled a 'Commercial Suit' and yet, would be governed by the un- amended CPC. However, in my view, should the legislature deem fit, it may carry out an amendment to overcome these consequences and/or may provide a clarification if it so deems fit. Till such time, I am currently bound by the language of Section 16 and am inclined to interpret the said section literally. \n29. It was also Mr. Kohli's argument that the creation of a sub-class within a class would be unconstitutional. If that is so, the Plaintiff's remedy would be to challenge the vires of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act for in its present form, I am bound with the letter of law written therein and cannot interpret the said provision as Mr. Kohli would have it. \n30. I therefore hold that the amendments introduced to the CPC by the Commercial Courts Act are only applicable to Commercial Disputes of a Specified Value and not Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value such as the present suit.

judicature at allahabad, lucknow bench a.f.r. reserved on 04.03.2022 delivered on 01.09.2022 case :matters under article 227 no. 24693 of 2020 petitioner :m/s zapdor-ubc-abnjv delhi respondent :u.o.i. thru.general manager northern railway new delhi and ors counsel for petitioner :anil srivastava,divyam krishna,utkarsh srivastava counsel for respondent :mrs.suniti sachan,brijesh kumar shukla,pratyush chaube hon'ble mrs. sangeeta chandra,j. 1. heard sri divyam krishna and sri utkarsh srivastava for the petitioners and sri brajesh kumar shukla along with pratyush chaubey for the respondents. the petitioners have challenged the order passed by the learned district judge/commercial court, lucknow dated 12.12.2019 rejecting the petitioners application for return of arbitration application filled under section 34 by the railways against award of the arbitral tribunal dated 06.03.2019 , and allowing the application for condonation of delay moved by the respondents. 2. the facts as mentioned in the petition briefly are that on 30.10.2015 the respondents floated a tender notice entitled \"design, supply, erection, testing and commissioning of 25 kv, 50 hz single phase, electrification works including ohe and tss composite electrical works (hereinafter referred to as the tender paper elcore) the petitioner's bid was adjudged viable and a letter of acceptance awarding the contract for a total value of more than rs.30 crores 27 lakhs was issued by the chief electrical engineer/p&d central organisation for railway electrification (core) at allahabad 19.04.2016. an agreement was executed on 14.7.2016 between the petitioner and chief project director railway electrification lucknow, as the contract was to be operated for the composite electrification works in jafrabad akbar pur tanda section under the supervision and control of divisional headquarters at lucknow. 3. the contract was terminated by the respondents because of slow progress as only 8 % of the work was completed in seven and a half months as opposed to hundred percent target for fifteen months. 4. the petitioner invoked the arbitration clause and arbitral tribunal was constituted through letter dated 01.12.2017 comprising of three senior officers of the railways. the entire arbitral proceedings were conducted in new delhi at the core office. the arbitral tribunal rendered an award of more than three crore rupees along with interest at the rate of 10% in favour of the petitioner which was signed and delivered at new delhi on 6 march 2019. arbitration application no. 925 of 2019 was filed on 30 august 2019 under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the 1996 act\") by the respondents against the arbitral award before the commercial court at lucknow along with an application for condonation of delay duly supported by an affidavit. subsequently the petitioner preferred an execution petition/enforcement application under section 36 of the 1996 act before the high court at delhi on 17.09.2019. the petitioner filed an application for return of arbitration application on 19.11.2019. it also moved an application containing objections to the application for condonation of delay in the section 34 application. a reply to both the applications was filed by the respondents on 04.12.2019. the learned commercial court by its order dated 12.12.2019 rejected the petitioner's application for return of arbitration application, and allowed the application for condonation of delay moved by the respondents by a composite order. 5. it is the case of the petitioners that such order has been passed by the commercial court at lucknow exercising a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, causing grave injustice to the petitioner and no appeal under section 37 of the act of 1996 lies against the impugned order so far as return of plaint (arbitation application) under section 34 of the act read with order vii rule 10 cpc is concerned. hence, a petition under article 227 of the constitution of india has been filed before this court. it is the case of the petitioners that clause 4.0 of the letter of acceptance dated 19.04.2016 specifically mentioned \"the contract shall be governed by the terms and conditions given in the tender paper number elcore/ohe and tss/group 199 with anc slip number 1\". the agreement executed between the parties after letter of acceptance also referred to the said tender paper as governing the contract. the tender paper elcore contains the subclause 1.2 .54 which provides under subclause (k) the \"venue for arbitration shall be the place from which the letter of acceptance of tender is issued or such other place as the purchaser at his discretion may determine.\" 6. the learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the arbitral proceedings were held exclusively at new delhi and the arbitral award was signed and delivered at new delhi hence the commercial court at lucknow lacked territorial jurisdiction to entertain the application under section 34 of the act of 1996. the supervisory territorial jurisdiction for the purposes of section 34 cannot be determined on the basis of location of cause of action. as per clause 1.2 .54 (k) the place of arbitration can be either at prayagraj where the letter of acceptance was issued or at new delhi where the arbitration was actually held and award delivered. in so far as section 34 of the act of 1996 is concerned no part of cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court at lucknow. the learned commercial court has relied upon general conditions of contract and clause 64 (i) (iii) (d) which provides\"the place of arbitration \"would be within the geographical limits of the division of the railway where the cause of action arose, or the headquarters of the concerned, or any other place with the written consent of both the parties.\" 7. it has been argued that the learned commercial court has erroneously interpreted paragraph 96 of the judgement rendered by the constitution bench in bhartiya alluminium company ltd. vs kaiser aluminium technical services 2012 (9) scc 552; to say that supervisory territorial jurisdiction for the purpose of section 34 accrues to courts situated both at the place of arbitration, as well as where the cause of action has occurred. in other words, the jurisdiction is concurrent and not exclusively restricted to those courts located in place of arbitration agreed to by the parties. such an interpretation of paragraph 96 of balco (supra) is against a long line of judgements rendered by the supreme court and by various high courts interpreting paragraph 96 to hold that supervisory jurisdiction under section 34 is not concurrent and must be restricted to courts in the location selected by the parties as place of arbitration exclusively, irrespective of where the cause of action arose. 8. the learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon paragraphs 20, 45, 54, 57, 58, 82, 97 and 98 of the judgement rendered by the supreme court in bgs sgs soma jv versus nhpc ltd, 2004 (4) scc 234; and has also placed reliance upon paragraph 19, 22 and 31 of judgement rendered by the supreme court in quippo construction equipment ltd versus janardan nirman private limited (2020) scc online sc 419; and om prakash and others versus vijay dwarka dass verma 2020 scc online bombay 796, l&t finance vs. manoj pathak (2020) scc online bombay 177 and tngq projects ltd. vs. balaji projects (2021) scc online madras 409. 9. it has been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the clauses of contract are determinative of the seat of arbitration. the seat of arbitration alone would be important for determination of the place where section 34 application would lie. he has also argued that where the clauses of contract leave it open for the parties to choose, and the contract did not specifically mention some place, even then the conduct of the parties would determine the seat of arbitration. it has been argued that the parties when they entered into the contract had referred to two clauses, the first clause in the tender document itself i.e. clause 1.2 .54 (k) related to the venue of arbitration being either at allahabad or at a place determined by the purchaser, and the second clause ie, clause number 64.1.(iii)(d) which refers to 3 possibilities, the last one being determined by a written agreement between the parties. since there was no written agreement between the parties, then the conduct of the parties would be relevant for a determination of the seat of arbitration. 10. it has been argued for the petitioners that the judgement rendered by the constitution bench in balco having been interpreted by subsequent benches of the supreme court later on, it was not open to the learned commercial court to give its own interpretation to paragraph 96 thereof. also ,the tender paper elcore clearly mentioned the parties intention to exclude any clause which is similar or identical to clause 64 (i)(iii)(d) of the general conditions of contract which has been relied upon by the learned commercial court in holding that cause of action arose both at new delhi and at lucknow. even if a part of cause of action did arise in lucknow due to the execution of the project at lucknow, that in itself is legally insufficient to confer upon the learned commercial court at lucknow any supervisory jurisdiction under section 34 of the act of 1996. 11. the learned counsel for the petitioner has also drawn attention of this court to the affidavit filed along with the application for condonation of delay by the respondents wherein the delay in approaching the learned commercial court under section 34 of the act of 1996 has been explained as time having been taken in \"collecting documents and completing the formalities\". it has been argued that government departments cannot take the defence of bureaucratic setup in their offices to get delay condoned. the petitioner had relied upon judgement rendered by the supreme court in the case of chief postmaster general and others versus living media india ltd 2012 (3) scc 563, but such argument has been arbitrarily rejected by the commercial court on the ground that in the case relied on by the petitioner the delay was more than 427 days but in the case of the respondents they had approached the commercial court with the delay of 26 days only. 12. sri brajesh kumar shukla appearing for the respondents has raised a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the petition filed on behalf of a joint venture by the director of only one of the companies constituting it. it has been argued that the deponent of the affidavit filed in support of the petition is one mr amresh anand, who is the director of only one of the companies which forms part of the joint venture. he has not been authorised by other members of the joint-venture for filing any petition before the high court. he was authorised only to deal with matters relating to the bid offer and the completion of proceedings of tender and correspondence related thereto. the learned counsel for the respondent has argued that amresh anand may have had the competence to have entered into contract as per the authority letter given to him by all the partners of the joint venture, but this authority ended with the signing of the contract and was limited to the same only. there is no separate authority letter issued to amresh anand by the other two partners of the joint venture to file this petition on their behalf. mr amresh anand may be authorised only to sign the application and to negotiate with the railways for the contract but he could not file the petition on behalf of the other two partners of the joint-venture. 13. the learned counsel for the respondent has also argued that this petition is not maintainable under article 227 of the constitution as the learned commercial court has passed an order under the provisions of section 34 of the act of 1996 against which remedy of appeal under section 37 of the act is available in case the order of admission of application under section 34 of the act is treated to be of such nature as to give finality to the the rights of the parties under litigation. the act of 1996 is a special act and a complete code in itself and no petition under article 227 of the constitution is maintainable against interlocutory orders. 14. with regard to the delay in approaching the commercial court the learned counsel for the respondent has placed reliance upon sub-section (3) of section 34 and the proviso thereof, which is that an application may be filed even after three months from the date of receipt of the award but within 30 days thereafter, subject to satisfaction of the court regarding the reason for delay. the award was received by speed post on 03.05.2019 and the application under the section 34 should have been filed ideally within three months that is latest by 03.08.2019, however, due to delay in collecting of documents and completing necessary formalities it could only be filed on 28th of august, causing a delay of 26 days in approaching the commercial court. the learned commercial court has considered the delay and also the judgement rendered by the supreme court in the case of chief post master general (supra) and found that it was not a case of huge delay but only a case of slight delay which could be condoned looking into the facts and circumstances of the case. 15. on the merits of the case, sri pratiyush chaube for the respondents has pointed out from various clauses of the agreement (a complete copy of which has been filed along with the supplementary affidavit) that in this case the purchaser is the president of india and he alone has been empowered to determine the seat of arbitration. he has determined the seat of arbitration at the place where the headquarter of the division of railways is situated which has to supervise the work. the learned counsel for the respondent has referred to tender paper elcore and clause 17 of the preamble which says that the \"indian railways standard general conditions of contractjuly 2014 \"with addendum and corrigendum slips issued by the railway board\" shall be applicable to the contract which may be obtained by the tenderer /contractor on payment from the divisional railway manager's office of the concerned railway. in case of any difference between the provisions of general conditions of contract and any conditions contained in the tender documents, the provisions of general conditions of contract will prevail. 16. the learned counsel for the respondent has also referred to chapter 2 of the tender paper elcore which contains the conditions of contract. it specifies that conditions of contract shall be governed not only by the preamble to the tender paper, but also the instructions to tenderers and conditions of tendering as included in part i of chapter i and conditions of contract as included in chapter ii and also other specifications and conditions contained in following chapters of the tender paper elcore. the learned counsel for the respondent has referred to paragraph 1.2.54 (k) which provides that the venue for arbitration shall be the place from which the letter of acceptance of tender is issued, or such other place as the purchaser at his discretion may determine; and has also referred to clause 64 (i) (iii) (d) which refers to place of arbitration as being within the geographical limits of the division of the railways where the cause of action arose, or the headquarters of the concerned railway, or any other place with the written consent of both the parties. it has been argued that since there was no written consent of both the parties to arbitration being held at new delhi and the arbitral tribunal held the proceedings at new delhi only for convenience sake it cannot be said that new delhi was agreed upon by the parties as being the place of arbitration. hence the preceding phrases relating to geographical limits of the division of the railway where the cause of action arose, or the headquarters for the concerned railway should be treated as determinative of the place of arbitration. both these phrases relate to lucknow, and therefore the place of arbitration should be treated as lucknow, conferring supervisory jurisdiction under section 34 of the act of 1996 upon the commercial court at lucknow. 17. the learned counsel for the respondent has referred to clause 7.0 of the preamble of the tender paper elcore which directs performance guarantee to be submitted by the contractor amounting to 5% of the contract value to the chief project director, railway electrification lucknow after the issuance of letter of acceptance but before signing of the agreement in terms of clause 19 of the preamble. reference has also been made to clause 11 of the preamble which states that the contract will be operated by the chief project director, railway electrification, lucknow. the agreement had been signed and delivered at lucknow for and behalf of the respondents on 14.07.2016. the cause of action arose at lucknow and since the contract was operated at lucknow as the project of electrification had to be conducted under the divisional headquarters with supervision and lucknow was the place of correspondence. after the award of contract a major part of cause of action arose at lucknow. reference has been made to clause 15 of the preamble where all correspondence has to be undertaken after award of contract with the chief project director, railway electrification, lucknow in respect to matters relating to particular design, working and drawing, matters relating to basic design and drawing for fitting, components equipment and prototype test, and matters relating to progressing of fieldwork, scheduling of quantities and submission of bills. under clause 1.1.2 which relates to interpretation of contract agreement, \"purchaser\" has been defined as the president of india acting through his accredited officers or anyone of them including the general manager in charge of railways electrification and also the chief project director. it has been argued that section 31 sub-clause (4) and section 20 of the act of 1996 would be in applicable as no written consent was ever given to change the place of arbitration by any of the parties. 18. the learned counsel for the has also placed reliance upon judgement rendered by the supreme court in the case of mankastu impex private limited versus air visual ltd 2020 (5) scc 399; and has read out paragraphs 10 to 13, 17 to 20, and 24 to 26 of the judgement and has also read out the impugned order passed by the commercial court. 19. the learned counsel for the respondent has also placed reliance upon judgement rendered by coordinate bench of this court in hasmukh prajapati versus jai prakash associates limited in a petition under article 227 of the constitution no. 6890 of 2021, decided on 17.02.2022, where a distinction has been drawn between seat of arbitration and venue of arbitration. it has been argued that the venue of arbitration may have been in new delhi, in the case of the petitioner, however the seat of arbitration would only be determined on the basis of clause 64 (1)(iii)(d) of the general conditions of contract. 20. it has also been informed to this court that subsequent to the filing of the application under section 34 of the act of 1996 before the commercial court at lucknow the petitioner preferred an execution petition/enforcement application under section 36 of the act on 17.09.2019 before the delhi high court. the delhi high court while issuing notice to the respondents has directed them to deposit the entire awarded amount with up-to-date interest before the registrar general of the high court of delhi by its order dated 18.09.2019, passed ex parte. further, the high court of delhi was pleased to release 50% of the deposited amount under the arbitral award to the petitioner by its order dated 24.12.2019 subject to the outcome of the objections filed by the judgement debtor. the decree holder had to submit a personal bond executed by all its directors and supported by a board resolution that in the event of the decree holder being directed to refund the amount by the court in the objections under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, the decree holder shall refund the amount along with interest at such rate as directed by the court within eight weeks of the order, irrespective of the right to challenge the order passed in proceedings under section 34 of the 1996 act. the balance 50% of the amount had to be kept in fixed deposit till further orders. in compliance of the order passed by the delhi high court on 24.12.2019, 50% of the amount was released against the personal bond of the directors only. the petitioner has filed an application stating that it is not in a position to furnish bank guarantee to secure the judgement debtor against the payment of any funds. further, after hearing on several dates and entertaining the application under section 34 of the act of 1996, the learned commercial court at lucknow has been pleased to stay the operation and implementation of the award dated 6.03.2019 by its order dated 09.02.2021. subsequently the petitioner has filed a further application for seeking release of the remaining 50% of the amount before the delhi high court on which the delhi high court has been pleased to issue notice to the respondents by its order dated 05.11.2020. after having approached delhi high court in this manner, the petitioner has approached this court in this petition under article 227 only on 08.12.2020, after a lapse of almost one year from the date of the impugned order, 12.12.2019. 21. in rejoinder the learned counsel for the petitioner has reiterated his earlier arguments and said that it is no doubt true that general conditions of contract would prevail over tender document ordinarily, however, in this case there is the phrase \"with the written consent of both the parties\". the counsel for the petitioner argued that in this case the tender document is the written consent, and would override the general conditions of contract. the learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon several judgements to say that even though the cause of action or part of cause of action may have arisen at lucknow that would not determine the seat of arbitration and has referred to the importance of the determination of the seat of arbitration as discussed by the supreme court in the judgement rendered in bgssgs soma (supra). the learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that in this case the conduct of the parties would give rise to the presumption that it is a separate contract condition to hold arbitration at delhi, that was agreed upon between the parties, and the subsequent condition so created by implication would override the written consent given in the contract. it has also been argued that the judgement rendered in mankastu impex (supra) would not apply as it related to international arbitration, whereas the controversy before this court has been raised with respect to an arbitration that has been held in india between the parties and is governed by part i of the act of 1996. 22. it has also been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that where there is a conflict between written agreement among the parties and the conduct of the parties, the conduct of the parties would prevail. the learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to judgement rendered by the supreme court in inox renewables ltd versus jayesh electricals ltd 2021 scc online sc 448, and has relied upon paragraphs 11, 16 and 17 of the judgement. 23. with regard to the argument of the learned counsel for the respondent that this petition under article 227 is not maintainable having been filed through director of one of the companies constituting the joint venture, it has been argued that the contract was awarded to a joint-venture partnership between three companies. the deponent of the affidavit in this petition is the director of zapdor / under order xxx rule 2 c.p.c. and order xxix rule 1 c.p.c., amresh anand is competent to file the application/petition before this court. 24. after hearing the parties at length, this court finds that there are four issues which must be considered by this court to decide this petition. a) whether this petition under article 227 is maintainable ? b) whether cause of action or subject matter of the suit would determine the court which could exercise supervisory jurisdiction to decide the section 34 petition? c) whether it would be the 'venue' or the 'seat' of arbitral proceedings which would determine the court which can exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings ? d) whether in the absence of a specific mention in the contract agreement regarding 'seat' of arbitration, the conduct of parties would determine the 'seat' and therefore act as an exclusionary clause for courts at all other places to exercise supervisory control over the arbitral proceedings ? 25. with regard to the first issue of maintainability of the petition on behalf of the j.v. company filed only by one director of one company, this court finds that with regard to the question of maintainability of the petition on behalf of the joint venture company/ consortium; it has been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that three companies had come together to make a bid for the contract relating to electrification of jafarabad-akbarpur-tanda section. the director of zapdor mr amresh anand had been authorised by the directors of all three companies to enter into correspondence for the award of contract and also to do all that was needful with regard to arbitration proceedings. mr amresh anand had been authorised by all to place their case before the arbitrator. no objection was raised by the railways with regard to the appearance of mr amresh anand before the arbitrator for pursuing the case of the joint venture. now a challenge is being raised for the first time regarding the capacity of mr amresh anand to file the petition. the learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon judgement rendered by the supreme court in the case of united bank of india versus naresh kumar and others 1996 (6) scc 660, where the appellant bank had instituted a suit for recovery of loan advanced to the respondent together with interest thereon. the suit having been filed in the name of the appellant bank, full amount of court fees had been paid. the trial of the suit also proceeded. although the trial court found the appellant bank had indeed advanced money to the respondent and its claim was justified, it rejected the claim of the bank only on the ground that the plaint was not duly signed and verified by a competent person. the first appeal and second appeal were also dismissed. the bank approached the supreme court. 26. the supreme court observed that procedural defects which do not go to the root of the matter should not be permitted to defeat a just cause. it also observed in paragraph 10 as follows \"10. it cannot be disputed that a company like the appellant can sue and be sued in its own name. under order vi rule 14 of the code of civil procedure, pleading is required to be signed by the party and its counsel if any. as a company is a juristic entity it is obvious that some person has to sign the pleadings on behalf of the company. order xxix rule 1 of the code of civil procedure, therefore, provides that in a suit by or against a corporation, the secretary or any director or other principal officer of the corporation who is able to depose to the facts of the case might sign and verify on behalf of the company. reading order vi rule 14 together with order xxix rule 1 of the code of civil procedure it would appear that even in the absence of any formal letter of authority or power of attorney having been executed, a person referred to in rule 1 of order xxix can, by virtue of the office which he holds, sign and verify the pleadings on behalf of the corporation. in addition there to under order xxix rule (1) of the code of civil procedure, as a company is a juristic entity, it can duly authorise any person to sign the plaint or the written statement on its behalf , and this would be regarded as sufficient compliance with the provisions of order vi rule 14 of the code of civil procedure. a person may be expressly authorised to sign the pleadings on behalf of the company, for example by the board of directors passing a resolution to that effect, or by the power of attorney executed in favour of any individual. in the absence thereof, and in cases where the pleadings have been signed by one of its officers, a corporation can ratify the said action of its officer in signing the pleadings. such ratification can be express or implied. the court can, on the basis of the evidence on record, and after taking all circumstances of the case, specially with regard to the conduct of the trial, come to the conclusion that the corporation had ratified the act of signing of the pleadings by its officer.\" this court is of the opinion that considering the facts and circumstances of the case as pleaded and the substantial questions of law that arise, the petitioner cannot be nonsuited on technical grounds alone. 27. with regard to the issue of maintainability of this petition under article 227 of the constitution, this court is bound by the observations of the supreme court in soma jv (supra) where the project site was located in the states of assam and arunachal pradesh and the agreement was signed at faridabad. with regard to dispute resolution through arbitration, the parties agreed that it shall be settled finally in accordance with the provisions of the 1996 act and the arbitration proceedings shall be held at new delhi/faridabad, india. on 16.05.2011 the notice of arbitration was issued to the petitioner in regard to payment of compensation for losses suffered due to delays. the arbitral tribunal was constituted which held 71 sittings at new delhi and then delivered a unanimous award again at new delhi, by which the claims of the petitioner were allowed together with simple interest at the rate of 14% per annum till the date of actual payment. the responden being aggrieved filed an application under section 34 before the court of district and sessions judge, faridabad haryana. the petitioner filed an application under section 151 read with order vii rule 10 of the c.p.c. and section 2 (1) (e) (i) of the 1996 act seeking a return of the petition under section 34 for presentation before the appropriate court at new delhi, and/or the district judge at dhemaji assam. the special commercial court gurugram, allowed the application of the petitioner to return the section 34 petition for presentation before the proper court having jurisdiction in new delhi. the respondent filed an appeal under section 37 of the 1996 act before the punjab and haryana high court which held the appeal to be maintainable and also that delhi was only a convenient \"venue\" where arbitral proceedings were held and not the \"seat\" of arbitral proceedings at faridabad would have jurisdiction on the basis of cause of action having arisen in part in faridabad. the petitioner challenged such order before the supreme court. 28. it was argued that an order which allowed an application under order vii rule 10 cpc cannot amount to an order refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34 of the 1996 act. it was also argued that even if both new delhi and faridabad had jurisdiction on the basis of part of cause of action arising at new delhi and at faridabad, the ratio laid down in the constitution bench decision in the case of balco (supra) would apply as understood by two subsequent decisions of the supreme court in reliance industries ltd versus union of india 2014 (7) scc 603; and in indus mobile distribution (private )limited versus datawind innovation (private )limited 2017 (7) scc 678. it was also argued by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the place of arbitration as determined in accordance with section 20 of the 1996 act was new delhi therefore this being the seat as determined by the tribunal in the case, challenge under section 34 of the 1996 act could only be made in the courts at new delhi. on the other hand the additional solicitor general supported the judgement under appeal saying that an order passed under order vii rule 10 c.p.c. would amount to refusal to set aside an award and therefore appeal would be maintainable. moreover the arbitration clause only referred to the convenient venue and the fact that the sittings were held at new delhi would not make new delhi the seat of arbitration under section 20 (1) of the act 1996. a part of cause of action clearly arose in faridabad, as a result of which the court in faridabad would be clothed with jurisdiction to decide section 34 application. 29. the supreme court in soma jv (supra) considered the question of maintainability of appeal under section 37 of the act and referred to sub-clause (1) (a),(b) and (c), and held that the order passed by the commercial court at gurugram was not referable to section 8 or section 9. it could also not amount to setting aside or refusing to set aside an award under section 34(1) (c ). therefore, appeal under section 37 would not be maintainable. it compared the provisions of section 13 of the commercial courts act and section 37 of the act of 1996. section 13 of the commercial courts act referred to grounds enumerated under order 43 of the c.p.c. and section 37 of the 1996 act. referring to judgement rendered in fuerst day lawson ltd versus jindal exports ltd, 2011 (8) scc 333; it held that section 13 of the commercial courts act was a general provision vis-a-vis arbitration, relating to appeals arising out of commercial disputes and since section 37 of the act of 1996 was expressly included in the proviso to section 13 (1), the court held that the special statute that is the 1996 act would be applicable vis-a-vis the more general statute namely the commercial courts act. the general statute being left to operate in spheres other than arbitration. section 37(1) makes it clear that the appeals only lie from orders set out in sub clause (a), (b) and (c) and from no others. the refusal to set aside and arbitral award must be under section 34 , i.e., after the grounds set out in section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question and after the court has turned down such grounds. admittedly on the facts of the case there was no adjudication under section 34 of the 1996 act all that was done was that the commercial court at gurugram had allowed an application filed under section 151 read with order vii rule 10 c.p.c., determining that commercial court at gurugram had no jurisdiction to proceed further with the section 34 application, and therefore such application would have to be returned to the competent court situated at new delhi. by virtue of the impugned order the arbitral award had not been set aside. the supreme court therefore held appeal under section 37 before the punjab and haryana high court was not maintainable. 30. this court after the dictum as aforesaid of the supreme court in soma jv (supra) is of the considered opinion that this petition under article 227 of the constitution is maintainable against the order rejecting an application for return of application under section 34 of the act of 1996. 31. this court shall now consider the issues c, d and e jointly by referring to various case laws relied upon by the counsel for the parties and recent developments of law, after case was heard and judgement was reserved by me. the first such judgment being that of the constitution bench in balco vs. kaiser alluminium (supra). the supreme court in balco (supra) was considering an agreement between the appellant and the respondent which had a dispute resolution clause in article 17 which stated that the arbitration proceedings will be governed by english arbitration law and arbitration shall be held wholly in london and use english language in the proceedings. clause 22 of the agreement stated that the agreement shall be governed by the prevailing law of india and in case of arbitration, the english law shall apply. therefore the aforesaid clause indicated that by reason of the agreement between the parties, the governing law of the agreement was the prevailing law of india. however, the settlement procedure for adjudication of rights or obligation under the agreement was by way of arbitration in london and the english arbitration law was made applicable to such proceedings. disputes arose between the parties and arbitration proceedings were held in london. the arbitral tribunal made two awards in london. 32. the appellant thereafter filed applications under section 34 of the 1996 act for setting aside the aforesaid two awards in the court of district judge bilaspur. the district judge bilaspur, held such applications filed under section 34 to be not maintainable and dismissed the same. aggrieved by the two judgements, the appellant filed two miscellaneous appeals before the high court of chhattisgarh. the division bench dismissed the appeals by a common order. such decision was challenged before the supreme court. the supreme court considered the questions that arose in several special leaves to appeal which were connected with the main appeal after its reference to the constitution bench and referred to such questions as: \"a) what is meant by the place of arbitration as found in section 2 (2) and 20 of the arbitration act 1996?\" \"b) what is the meaning of the words \"under the law of which the award is passed\" under section 48 of the 1996 act ? \"c) does section 2 (2) bar the application of part i of the arbitration act 1996 to arbitration where the place is outside india?\" \"d) does part i apply at all stages of arbitration that is pre, during and post stages of the arbitral proceedings in respect of all arbitration, except for areas specifically falling under part ii and iii of the 1996 act ?\" \"e) whether a suit for preservation of assets pending an arbitration proceeding is maintainable?\" 33. the supreme court clarified the use of the words \"place\", \"seat\", \"situs\", and \"venue\" in the context of arbitration and discussed the same in paragraphs 75, 76 and 95 to 100 of the judgement and section 20 of the 1996 act was referred to which recognised such distinction. the supreme court observed that the seat of arbitration or the situs of arbitration or the place of arbitration indicates the jurisdiction or legal seat of arbitration which determines the curial law i.e. the law that shall govern the arbitration proceedings. the supreme court said further that if the legal or juridical seat of arbitration is outside india, part i of the 1996 act shall be inapplicable to such operations; and even in case a clause in the arbitration agreement purports to apply part i of the 1996 act to an arbitration where juridical seat of arbitration is outside india, part i shall be inapplicable to the extent inconsistent with the arbitration law of the seat of arbitration. \"venue of arbitration \" as distinguished from the place or the seat or the situs, is the actual physical location where the arbitrators/ arbitral tribunal for reasons of convenience et cetera, might actually conduct their proceedings, which may be a location physically outside the jurisdiction or legal seat of arbitration. 34. the supreme court answered the reference by observing that the 1996 act had accepted the territoriality principle which had been adopted in the uncitral model law. section 2 sub-clause (2) of the 1996 act makes a declaration that part i of the act shall apply to all arbitration which take place within india. part i of the 1996 act would have no application to international commercial arbitration held outside india. therefore, such awards would only be subject to the jurisdiction of the indian courts when the same are sought to be enforced in india in accordance with the provisions contained in part ii of the 1996 act. there can be no overlapping or intermingling of the provisions contained in part i with the provisions contained in part ii of the 1996 act . in a foreign seated international commercial arbitration, no application for interim relief would be maintainable under section 9 of the 1996 act or any other provision of indian law, as applicability of part i of the act is limited only to all arbitration which take place in india. similarly, no suit for interim injunction simplicitor would be maintainable in india on the basis of an international commercial arbitration with its seat outside india. hence part i of the act is applicable only to all the arbitrations which take place within the territory of india. 35. the supreme court also observed \"the subject matter of arbitration\" in section 2(1) (e) of the 1996 act cannot be confused with \"subject matter of the suit\". the term \"subject matter\" in section 2 (1) (e) is confined to part i. it has a reference and connection with the process of dispute resolution. its purpose is to identify courts having supervisory control over the arbitration proceedings. hence, it refers to a court which would essentially be at the seat of the arbitration process. the provision in section 2(1)(e) has to be construed keeping in view the provisions in section 20 which gives recognition to party autonomy. the legislature has intentionally given jurisdiction to two courts ie the court which would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is located ,and the courts where the arbitration takes place. this was necessary as on many occasions the agreement may provide for a seat of arbitration at a place which would be neutral to both the parties. therefore, the courts where the arbitration takes place would be required to exercise supervisory control over the arbitral process.for example, if the arbitration is held in delhi, when neither of the parties are from delhi (delhi having been chosen as a neutral place as between a parties from mumbai and the other from kolkata) and the arbitral tribunal sitting in delhi passes an interim order under section 17 of the 1996 act, the appeal against such an interim order under section 37 must lie to the court at delhi being the court having supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and the tribunal. this would be irrespective of the fact that the obligations to be performed under the contract were to be performed either at mumbai or at kolkata, and only arbitration is to take place in delhi. in such circumstances, both the courts would have jurisdiction ie the court within whose jurisdiction the subject matter of the suit is situated and the courts within the jurisdiction of which the dispute resolution ie arbitration is located. 36. the object of selection of a neutral seat or place of arbitration within india by the parties would be frustrated partially at least, if not wholly, if courts having jurisdiction over the said neutral seat of arbitration did not have supervisory jurisdiction over such arbitration. after all, the whole point of agreeing to a neutral seat of arbitration is to avoid mutual inconvenience. it is certain that the parties cannot by agreement confer jurisdiction on a court which does not otherwise have jurisdiction over the matter concerned; the parties can only restrict jurisdiction over the matter concerned to only one of the courts that otherwise have jurisdiction. the supervisory jurisdiction of the court is located at the legal seat of arbitration which can be said to be created by the parties by choosing that as the seat in the arbitration agreement. the supreme court having held that the court which has jurisdiction over the seat of arbitration would have supervisory jurisdiction of arbitration in addition to courts where the cause of action might have arisen clarifies the law. 37. one of the questions that the constitution bench dealt with was \"what is meant by the place of arbitration as found in section 2(2) and 20 of the arbitration act 1996? in paragraph 75 of the judgement the supreme court observed that the seat of arbitration decides the applicability of law for regulation of the arbitration. this however does not mean that all proceedings of arbitration to have to take place at the seat of arbitration. the arbitrators at times hold meetings at more convenient locations. this is necessary as arbitrators may often come from different countries. it may therefore be convenient to hold some of the meetings in a location which may be convenient to all. the supreme court referred to english caselaw with approval where it was observed:\"the preceding discussion has been on the basis that there is only one \"place\" of arbitration. this will be the place chosen by, or on behalf of the parties; and it will be designated in the arbitration agreement or the terms of the reference, or the minutes of proceedings, or in some other way as the place or \"seat\" of the arbitration. this does not mean however that the arbitral tribunal must hold all its meetings or hearings at the place of arbitration. .it may be more convenient for an arbitral tribunal sitting in one country to conduct a hearing in another country for instance for the purpose of taking evidence.in such circumstances each move of the arbitral tribunal does not of itself mean that the seat of arbitration changes. the seat of arbitration remains the place initially agreed by or on behalf of the parties.\" these observations were subsequently followed by the supreme court in the case of union of india versus mcdonnell douglas corporation 1993 (2) lloyd's report 48, where the supreme court observed that the laws of the land of the country where the arbitration took place usually govern the regulation of arbitration. part i of the act of 1996 only applies when the seat of arbitration is in india, irrespective of the kind of arbitration. 38. while dealing with the arguments made by the learned counsel for the appellant regarding the act being \"subject matter centric\" and not \"seat centric\" and therefore seat is not the centre of gravity as far as arbitration act 1996 is concerned, the court observed in paragraph 96 while dealing with the definitions clause 2 (1) (e) that\"subject matter of the arbitration\" cannot be confused with \"subject matter of the suit.\" the term subject matter in section 2(1)(e) is confined to part i. it has a reference and connection with the process of dispute resolution. its purpose is to identify the courts having supervisory control over the arbitration proceedings. hence, it refers to a court which would essentially be a court of the seat of arbitration process.where arbitration is located. \" the supreme court observed in paragraph 97 \"the definition of section 2(1)(e)includes \"subject matter of the arbitration\" to give jurisdiction to the courts where the arbitration takes place, which otherwise would not exist. this has a clear reference to a court within whose jurisdiction the asset/ person is located, against which the enforcement of international arbitral award is sought.\"' 39. the supreme court thereafter observed in paragraph 98 \"we now come to section 20, which is as under: \"20. place of arbitration (1) the parties are free to agree on the place of arbitration. (2) failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (1) the place of arbitration shall be determined by the arbitral tribunal having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the convenience of the parties. (3) notwithstanding sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the arbitral tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, meet at any place it considers appropriate for consultation among its members ,for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, or for inspection of documents, goods or other property.\" a plain reading of section 20 leaves no room room for doubt that where the place of arbitration is in india, the parties are free to agree to any place or seat within india, new delhi or mumbai et cetera. in the absence of parties agreement thereto, section 20 sub-clause (2) authorises the tribunal to determine the place/seat of such arbitration. section 20(3) enables the tribunal to meet at any place for conducting hearings at a place of convenience in matters such as consultations among its members for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties.\" 40. the supreme court thereafter considered the question of \"venue \" and observed in paragraph 99 \"99. the fixation of most convenient venue is taken care of by section 20(3). section 20(3)has to be read in the context of section 20(2)which places a threshold limitation on the applicability of part 1 where the place of arbitration is in india. .\" the court observed in paragraph 100\"true, that in an international commercial arbitration, having its seat in india, hearings may be necessitated outside india. in such circumstances, the hearing of the arbitration will be conducted at the venue fixed by the parties, but it would not have the effect of changing the seat of arbitration which would remain in india. the supreme court thereafter referred to the commentary of redfern and hunter, \"the law and practice of international commercial arbitration\", and the following passage under the heading \"the place of arbitration\":\"the preceding discussion has been on the basis that there is only one place of arbitration. this will be the place chosen by or on behalf of the parties; and it will be designated in the arbitration agreement or the terms of the reference or the minutes of proceedings or in some other way as the place or seat of the arbitration. this does not mean, however, that the arbitral tribunal must hold all its meetings or hearings at the place of arbitration. international commercial arbitration often involves people of many different nationalities, from many different countries. in the circumstances it is by no means unusual for a tribunal travelling to hold meetings or even hearings, in a place other than the designated place of arbitration, either for its own convenience or for the convenience of the parties or their witnesses it may be more convenient for an arbitral tribunal sitting in one country to conduct a hearing in another country for instance, for the purpose of taking evidence .in such circumstances each move of the arbitral tribunal does not of itself mean that the seat of arbitration changes. the seat of arbitration remains the place initially agreed by or on behalf of the parties.\" \"this in our view, is the correct depiction of the practical considerations and the distinction between \"seat\" as given in section 20 (1)and subsection 20 (2)and the venue as given in section 20 (3).\" 41. subsequently in 2018, the supreme court in the case of union of india versus hardy exploration and production (india) inc 2019 (13) scc 472; considered an agreement relating to a production sharing contract between the parties. the arbitration agreement provided that the venue of conciliation or arbitration proceedings, unless the parties otherwise agreed, would be kuala lumpur and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration. the arbitration proceedings were held in kuala lumpur and the award was signed and delivered in kuala lumpur. the union of india sought to challenge the award under the act of 1996 before the delhi high court. it contended that kuala lumpur was merely the venue and new delhi was the seat of arbitration. the supreme court held that the parties had not chosen the seat of arbitration and the arbitral tribunal had also not determined the seat of arbitration. it held that :\"kuala lumpur was the venue of arbitration but it did not imply that it had become the seat of arbitration by any express agreement between the parties. the venue could not by itself assume the status of the seat; instead a venue could become the seat only if something else is added to it as a concomitant.\" 42. the five judges bench decision in balco (supra) has been interpreted and followed by five judges bench in soma jv (supra). the supreme court in balco vs. kaiser alluminium (supra) referred to the observations made in braes of doune wind farm (scotland) ltd v alfred macalpine business services ltd 2008 ewhc 426 (tcc) by the queen bench division that a detailed examination is required to be undertaken by the court to determine from the agreement and the surrounding circumstances the intention of the parties as to whether a particular place mentioned refers to 'venue' or 'seat' of the arbitration. in that case, the court upon consideration of the entire material, concluded that glasgow was a reference to the venue and the seat of the arbitration was held to be in london,england. the court reiterated the principle that the selection of a 'place or seat' for an arbitration will determine what \"curial law\"or \"lex fori\" or \" lex arbitri \"will be. it was also further concluded that where in substance the parties agreed that the law of one country will govern and control a given arbitration, the place where the arbitration is to be heard will not dictate what the governing law or controlling law will be. 43. the supreme court further observed that the ratio in alfred macalpine was followed is shashoua v sharma 2009 ewhc 957(comm). in the shashoua case the court was concerned with the construction of the shareholders agreement between the parties which provided that \"the venue of arbitration shall be london, united kingdom\". whilst providing that the arbitration proceedings would should be conducted in english in accordance with the icc rules, and that the governing law of the shareholders agreement itself would be the law of india. the claimants made an application to the high court in new delhi seeking interim measure of protection under section 9 of the arbitration act 1996, prior to the institution of arbitration proceedings. following the commencement of the arbitration, the defendant and the joint-venture company raised the challenge to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, which the tribunal heard as a preliminary issue. the tribunal rejected the jurisdictional objection. the tribunal then made an award for the defendant to pay more than £300,000. the english court gave leave to the claimant to enforce the award as a judgement. the defendant applied to the high court of delhi under section 34 (2)(a) of the arbitration act 1996 to set aside the award. in the meantime, the claimant had obtained the charging order, which had been made final over the defendant's property in england. the defendant applied to the delhi high court for an order directing the claimants not to take any action to execute the charging order, pending the final disposal of section 34 petition in delhi seeking to set aside the award. the defendant had sought unsuccessfully to challenge the award in the commercial court under section 68 and section 69 of the uk act and to set aside the order giving leave to enforce the award. 44. the supreme court in soma j.v. then referred to paragraph 110 of balco as follows: \"110. examining the fact situation in the said case, the court observed as follows: (shashua) \"the basis for the court''s grant of an anti-suit injunction of the kind sought depended upon the seat of the arbitration. an agreement as to the seat of an arbitration brought in the law of that country as the curial law, and was analogous to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. not only was there an agreement to the curial law of the seat, but also to the courts of the seat having supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration, so that, by agreeing to the seat, the parties agreed that any challenge to an interim or final award was to be made only in the courts of the place designated as the seat of arbitration. although, \"venue\" was not synonymous with \"seat\", in an arbitration clause which provided for arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the rules of icc in paris (a supranational body of rules), a provision that \"the venue of arbitration shall be london, united kingdom\" did amount to the designation of the juridical seat.\" the queens bench division observed that \"a choice of seat for the arbitration must be a choice of forum for remedies seeking to attack the award\". (emphasis supplied) 45. the supreme court in balco observed thereafter that this principle was followed in union of india vs. mcdonnell douglas corporation. in union of india versus mcdonnell douglas corpn (1993) lloyds rep 48; the agreement provided that the \"arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure provided in the indian arbitration act of 1940 or any re-enactment or modification thereof. the seat of arbitral proceedings shall be london, united kingdom. considering the aforesaid clause, the supreme court held that by agreement the parties have chosen english law as a law to govern their arbitration proceedings, while contractually importing from the indian act those provisions of that act which are concerned with internal conduct of their arbitration and which are not inconsistent with the choice of english arbitral procedure in law. the supreme court followed the queens bench decision which laid stress upon the location of the seat of arbitration as an important factor in determining the proper law of the arbitration agreement. 46. the supreme court thereafter in soma j.v. (supra) referred to paragraph-116 of balco that \"the legal position that emerges from a conspectus of all the decisions, seems to be, that the choice of another country as the seat of arbitration inevitably imports an acceptance that the law of that country relating to the conduct and supervision of arbitration will apply to the proceedings.\" 47. the three judges bench of this supreme court in soma jv (supra) was considering the question whether the seat of arbitration proceedings was new delhi or faridabad, consequent upon which a petition under section 34 of the arbitration act 1996 could be filed dependent on where the seat of arbitration is located. 48. while considering the question of determination of the seat of the arbitral proceedings between the parties, it was observed that it is important to lay down the law on what constitutes \"juridical seat\" of the arbitral proceedings, and once the seat is delineated by arbitration agreement, the courts at the place of the seat would alone thereafter have exclusive jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings. 49. the supreme court considered the arbitration act 1940 which did not refer to juridical seat of arbitration proceedings at all. after the uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration was adopted by this country the concept of \"place\" or \"seat\" of arbitral proceedings was introduced. the 1996 act adopted the model law and referred to the place of arbitration and defined the court and indicated which courts have jurisdiction in relation to arbitral proceedings in several sections in part i. 50. the supreme court referred to the definition clause under section 2 (1) (e) and sub-clause (i) and (ii) thereof, and then to section 20, 31 (4) and 42 of the 1996 act. 51. the supreme court in soma jv (supra) referred to the five judges bench in balco (supra) because in earlier decisions of the court it had not properly distinguished between seat and venue of an arbitral proceeding. after referring to paragraphs 75, 76, 96, 110, 116, 123 and 194 of balco (supra), the supreme court observed in paragraph 38 as follows: \"38. a reading of paras 75, 76, 96, 110, 116, 123 and 194 of balco would show that where parties have selected the \"seat\" of arbitration in their agreement, such selection would then amount to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, as the parties have now indicated that the courts at the \"seat\" would alone have jurisdiction to entertain challenges against the arbitral award which have been made at the seat. the balco judgement, when read as a whole, applies the concept of seat as laid down by the english judgements (and which is in section 20 of the arbitration act 1996) by harmoniously construing section 20 with section 2 (1)(e), so as to broaden the definition of \"court \"and bring within its ken courts of the \"seat\" of the arbitration.\" 52. the supreme court thereafter considered the import and purport of paragraph 96 of the balco (supra) in paragraph 39 to 43, and came to the conclusion that :\"a judgement must be read as a whole, so that conflicting parts maybe harmonised to reveal the true ratio of the judgement. however, if this is not possible, and it is found that the internal conflicts within the judgement cannot be resolved, then the first endeavour that must be made is to see whether ratio decidendi can be culled out without the conflicting portion. if not, then as held by lord denning in harper versus national coal board, the binding nature of the precedent on the point on which there is a conflict in a judgement, comes under a cloud \" it thereafter observed in paragraph-44 as follows:\"44. if para 75, 76, 96, 110, 116, 123 and 194 of balco ought to be read together, what becomes clear is that section 2 (1)(e)has to be construed keeping in view section 20 of the arbitration act 1996, which gives recognition to party autonomythe arbitration act 1996 having accepted the territoriality principle in section 2 (2), following the uncitral model law. the narrow construction of section 2 (1) (e) was expressly rejected by the five judges bench in balco (supra). this being so, what has then to be seen is what is the effect section 20 would have on section 2 (1) (e) of the arbitration act 1996.\" 53. the supreme court then considered the observations made by it in union of india vs. reliance industries ltd 2015 (10) scc 213 which relied upon videocon industries ltd versus union of india 2011 (6) scc 161; and judgement rendered by the court of appeal in c v d, 2007 ewca civ 1282 (ca); which was subsequently followed by the high court of justice, queens bench division. the english courts had held that the effect of choice of seat of arbitration would mean conferring exclusive jurisdiction for the purpose of regulating arbitral proceedings arising out of the agreement between the parties on the courts situated in that \"seat\" alone. 54. the supreme court in soma jv referred to the observations made by it in indus mobile distribution private limited versus datawind innovations private limited (2017) 7 scc 678; distinguishing between seat of an arbitral proceedings and venue of such proceeding. in indus mobile (supra), the supreme court referred to the 246th report of the law commission of india and the recommendations made with regard to amendment to be carried out in section 20 of the 1996 act replacing the word \"place\" by the word \"seat\". 55. the court in indus mobile (supra) observed that amendment as proposed by the law commission could not be made because \".the balco judgement in no uncertain terms had referred to the \"place\" as juridical seat for the purpose of section 2 (2) of the act. it had further made it clear that section 20 (1) and section 20 (2) where the word \"place\" is used refers to the juridical seat, whereas section 20 (3) the word \"place\" is equivalent to venue. ..\" 56. the supreme court referred to paragraph 19 of indus mobile (supra) where it was observed that \"the moment the seat is designated, it is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. \"even if a part of cause of action had not arisen in such seat, nevertheless the courts situated in the seat will have \"exclusive jurisdiction for the purpose of regulating arbitral proceedings arising out of the agreement between the parties.\" 57. the supreme court referred to judgement rendered in brahmani river pellets limited versus kamatchi industries ltd 2020 (5) scc 462; where judgement rendered in indus mobiles (supra) was followed. the supreme court observed in paragraph 49 of judgement rendered in soma jv (supra) that if any other interpretation is taken for example, the interpretation given by the respondents that courts where a part of cause of action action had arisen would also have jurisdiction would mean that -\".,,if part of cause of action arose in five places, even though the parties have contemplated that a neutral seat be chosen as the seat so that the courts of that place alone would have jurisdiction, yet, any one of the five other courts in which a part of cause of action arises, including courts in remote corners of the country, would also be clothed with jurisdiction. this obviously cannot be the case. if therefore, the conflicting portion of the judgement of balco in para 96 is kept aside for a moment, the very fact that the parties have chosen a place to be the seat would necessarily carry with it the decision of both parties that the courts at the seat would exclusively have jurisdiction over the entire arbitral process.\" (emphasis supplied) 58. the supreme court further observed in paragraph 50:\"50. in fact, subsequent division benches of this court have understood the law to be that where the seat of arbitration is chosen, it amounts to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, in so far as the courts at the seat of arbitration are concerned. in enercon (india) limited versus enercon gmbh, 2014 (5) scc 1; this court approved the dictum in shashoua as follows:\"126. examining the fact situation in the case, the court in shashoua observed as follows: \"the basis for the court''s grant of an anti-suit injunction -.,depended upon the seat of the arbitration. an agreement as to the seat of an arbitration brought in the law of that country as the curial law and was analogous to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. not only was their agreement to the curial law of the seat, but also to the courts of the seat having supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration, so that, by agreeing to the seat, the parties agreed that any challenge to an interim order or final award was to be made only in the courts of the place designated as the seat of the arbitration. although, \"venue\", was not synonymous with \"seat\", in an arbitration clause which provided for arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the rules of the icc in paris (a supranational body of rules), a provision that the venue of the arbitration shall be london, united kingdom did amount to the designation of a juridical seat.\" (emphasis supplied) 59. after referring to several paragraphs of enercon (supra), the supreme court in paragraph 51 observed as follows: \"51. the court in enercon concluded: \"138. once the seat of arbitration has been fixed in india, it would be in the nature of exclusive jurisdiction to exercise the supervisory powers over the arbitration .\" 60. referring to the test for determination of seat the supreme court observed that the english courts have examined the concept of juridical seat of the arbitral proceedings, and have laid down several important tests in order to determine whether the seat of the arbitral proceedings has in fact been indicated in the agreement between the parties. referring to judgement in shashoua v sharma, the court observed that wherever there is an express designation of venue and no designation of any alternative place as the seat combined with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration, and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that the stated venue is actually the juridical seat of the arbitral proceedings. the supreme court thereafter referred to the mcdonnell douglas judgement and enercon judgement and judgement rendered in dozco(india) private limited v doosan infracore company ltd 2011 (6) scc 179; and the commentary of redfern and hunter on international arbitration, and alfred macalpine (supra), and came to the conclusion that if the parties failed to mention any place as the juridical seat but only mentioned the venue or without mentioning the venue hold the entire sittings of the arbitral tribunal at any particular place, such place shall be treated as \"seat for the arbitration\" and must also be the forum of choice for remedies seeking to attack the award. 61. the supreme court observed in paragraph 82 as follows: \" \"82. on a conspectus of the aforesaid judgements, it may be concluded that whenever there is the designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the venue of the arbitration proceedings, the expression arbitration proceedings would make it clear that the venue is really the seat of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression does not include just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award at that place.this, coupled with there being no other significant contrary indicia that the stated venue is only a venue and not the seat of the arbitral proceedings, would then conclusively show that such a clause designates a seat of the arbitral proceedings.\" 62. the supreme court in soma jv (supra) also approved of the judgement rendered in shashoua versus sharma, which according to it was also approved by the constitution bench in balco. 63. the supreme court again in a three judges decision in mankastu impex private limited versus air visual ltd 2020 (5) scc 399; was considering an application by mankastu an indian company, for appointment of sole arbitrator. the arbitration agreement provided that the arbitration shall be administered in hong kong and the place of arbitration shall be hong kong, but at the same time stated that the memorandum of understanding would be governed by laws of india and the courts at new delhi should have jurisdiction. learned counsel for the petitioner had argued that since indian law was governing law and the courts at delhi had jurisdiction, the seat of arbitration was new delhi. it relied on hardy exploration for this purpose. on the other hand air visual contended that since arbitration agreement provided the place of arbitration to be hong kong and the arbitration had to be administered in hong kong, the seat of arbitration was hong kong accordingly indian courts had no jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator. the respondent relied on soma jv for this purpose. the supreme court instead of affirming soma jv, decided to adopt another way to determine the issue. it observed that the use of the expression \"place of arbitration\" could not decide the intention of the parties to designate that particular place as a seat of arbitration and such intention had to be determined from other clauses in the agreement between the parties and their contract . but because the parties had also agreed that such arbitration was to be administered in hong kong, the supreme court ultimately held that the parties had chosen hong kong as the seat of arbitration. the supreme court observed in mankastu that the memorandum of understanding is clearly silent on the proper and curial law of arbitration. it observed in paragraph 19 and 20 as follows: \"19. the seat of arbitration is a vital aspect of any arbitration proceedings. significance of the seat of arbitration is that it determines the applicable law when deciding the arbitration proceedings and arbitration procedure as well as judicial review over the arbitration award. the situs is not just about where an institution is based or where hearings will be held. but it is all about which court would have supervisory power over the arbitration proceedings. in enercon (india )ltd versus enercon gmbh the supreme court had held that: ( scc pp 43 and 46 para 97 and 107) \"the location of the seat will determine the courts that will have exclusive jurisdiction to oversee the arbitration proceedings.\" it was further held that the seat normally carries with it the choice of that country's arbitration/curial law \" \"20. it is well settled that the seat of arbitration and venue of arbitration cannot be used interchangeably. it has also been established that mere expression \"place of arbitration \"cannot be the basis to determine the intention of the parties that they have intended that place as the seat of arbitration. the intention of the parties as to seat should be determined from other clauses in the agreement and the conduct of the parties.\" 64. the supreme court declined to give a specific finding with regard to whether hardy exploration (supra) is no longer good law in view of the observation made by a coordinate bench in soma jv or whether soma jv could have declared hardy exploration to be per incuriam in view of the law of binding precedents and in paragraph 13 it observed \".however, considering clause 17 of mou in the present case and the definite clauses therein and in the facts and circumstances of the case, we are not inclined to go into the question on the correctness of bgs soma or otherwise.\" 65. the supreme court observed that clause 17.2 in the memorandum of understanding between the parties had provided that in case of a dispute it shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered in hong kong which clearly suggested that the parties had agreed that the arbitration be seated at hong kong, and that the laws of hong kong shall govern the arbitration proceedings as well as have power of judicial review over the arbitration award. the supreme court placed reliance upon its earlier decisions in eitzen bulk a/s versus ashapura minechem ltd 2016 (11) scc 508, and indus mobile (supra), to say that when the parties have chosen a place of arbitration in a particular country, that choice brings with it submission to the laws of that country. once the seat is determined only that jurisdictional court would have exclusive jurisdiction. 66. in inox renewables ltd versus jayesh electricals ltd, 2021 scconline supreme court 448, a two judges bench was considering the appeal arising out of judgement rendered by the high court of gujarat at ahmedabad wherein the application under section 34 filed by the appellant was rejected on the ground that the courts at jaipur, rajasthan would have jurisdiction to decide such application. the facts of the case were that a purchase order was entered into between messers gujarat fluorochemicals ltd and the respondent jayesh electricals ltd for manufacture and supply of power transformers at windfarms. the arbitration clause contained in the purchase order mentioned the venue of arbitration to be jaipur. a package sale of the entire business of gujarat fluorochemicals ltd took place by way of business transfer agreement between the appellant and gfl to which the respondent was not a party. in this business transfer agreement the arbitration clause designated vadodara as the seat of arbitration and the court at vadodara to have exclusive jurisdiction qua disputes arising out of the agreement. 67. on an application filed by the respondent under section 11 of the act the high court of gujarat at ahmedabad appointed a retired high court judge as arbitrator. the arbitrator passed an award. a section 34 petition was filed by the appellant in ahmedabad which was resisted by the respondent referring to the business transfer agreement and stating that the courts at vadodara did not have jurisdiction. the commercial court at ahmedabad accepted the respondents' plea and referring to the business transfer agreement returned the application saying that the courts at vadodara alone would have exclusive jurisdiction. the appellant filed a special civil application no.9536 of 2019 against the said order. the high court referred to the arbitration clause contained in the purchase order and held that the courts in rajasthan would have exclusive jurisdiction looking into the exclusive jurisdiction clause and observed that even assuming that ahmedabad would have jurisdiction, exclusive jurisdiction being vested in the courts at rajasthan, the appropriate court would be the court at jaipur. the special civil application being dismissed as not maintainable at ahmedabad, the appellant approached the supreme court. it was argued that the business transfer agreement was between gujarat fluorochemicals and the appellant and the respondent was not a party to the same . hence the arbitration clause in the business transfer agreement was irrelevant however the impugned judgement had failed to consider that the arbitrator had recorded in the arbitral award that the venue/place of arbitration was shifted by mutual consent to ahmedabad as a result of which the place of arbitration or seat of arbitration became ahmedabad resulting in the courts at ahmedabad having exclusive jurisdiction in view of the laws set up by the supreme court in the case of soma jv. on the other hand it was argued by the respondent that even if the place of arbitration is shifted by mutual agreement, it cannot be done so without a written agreement between the parties. it was argued that the finding that the venue was shifted by mutual consent from jaipur to ahmedabad has reference only to section 20(3) of 1996 act as ahmedabad was in reality a convenient place for the arbitration to take place, the seat of arbitration always remaining at jaipur. the court having heard both the parties referred to the award of the arbitrator wherein it was mentioned that -\"as per the arbitration agreement, the venue of the arbitration was to be jaipur. however, the parties have mutually agreed irrespective of a specific clause , as to the venue of the arbitration would be ahmedabad and not at jaipur. the proceedings, thus have been conducted at ahmedabad on the constitution of the tribunal by the learned nominee judge of the honourable high court of gujarat.\" 68. the court observed in paragraph 11 that\"it is clear from the arbitral award that by mutual agreement parties have specifically shifted the venue/place of arbitration from jaipur to ahmedabad. this being so, it is not possible to accede to the argument made by the learned counsel for the respondent that this could only have been done by written agreement and that the arbitrator is finding would really have reference to a convenient venue and not the seat of arbitration. \" 69. the supreme court after referring extensively to soma jv wherein indus mobile (supra) and videocon (supra) judgements were considered in detail; observed in para 16&17 that \"the moment the seat is chosen as ahmedabad, it is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, thereby vesting the court at ahmedabad with the exclusive jurisdiction to deal with arbitration . once the seat of arbitration is replaced by mutual agreement to be at ahmedabad, the courts at rajasthan are no longer vested with the jurisdiction as exclusive jurisdiction is now vested in the courts at ahmedabad, given the change in the seat of arbitration.\" 70. in quippo construction equipment ltd versus janardan nirman private limited 2020 scconline supreme court 419; the supreme court was considering an appeal from the judgement of the high court at calcutta. there were four agreements entered into from time to time between the appellant and the respondent for taking on rent construction equipment. in the general terms and conditions appended to the aforesaid agreements, for resolution of disputes between the parties an arbitration clause was provided. the parties agreed to refer such dispute to arbitration under construction industry arbitration association rules and regulations and the venue for holding such arbitration proceedings would be new delhi. on the other hand the relevant arbitration clause in the agreement that followed recorded that only courts and tribunals at kolkata shall have exclusive jurisdiction in dispute arising out of terms of the agreement or its interpretation. the sole arbitrator was appointed in terms of the arbitration clause who conducted the proceedings at new delhi. a notice was issued to the respondent who denied the existence of any agreement between the parties and it did not take any steps to participate in the arbitration proceedings. the respondent on the other hand filed a title suit at sealdah, praying that the agreements be declared as null and void and for a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from relying upon the arbitration clauses contained in the agreements. initially a restraint order was passed by the trial court as a result of which the proceedings before the arbitrator were stayed. later on the trial court accepted the application filed under section 5 and 8 of the 1996 act by the appellant. the trial court observed that the plaintiffs had signed a series of agreements and now they were claiming that they were non-existing. therefore the dispute between the parties regarding of payments was within the scope of arbitration clause. the defendant was justified in referring the matter to arbitration. the trial court dismissed the suit as it had no jurisdiction to hear it. the plaint was directed to be returned. 71. the respondent filed miscellaneous appeal before the additional district judge, sealdah. during the pendency of the application for interim relief an ex parte award was given by the arbitrator accepting the claim preferred by the appellant. soon after the award a petition was filed by the appellant before the high court of delhi seeking relief under section 9 of the act. the respondent being aggrieved by the award filed a petition under section 34 of the act before the high court at calcutta. the said petition was then dismissed. the respondent thereafter filed a section 34 application in the court of district judge, alipore. it was alleged that the venue of arbitration in terms of the agreement was at kolkata. the appellate court dismissed the appeal as not maintainable. a petition was filed by the respondent against the order of the additional district judge before the high court at calcutta. such a petition was allowed by the high court. an appeal was filed before the supreme court and the supreme court observed that though each of the four agreements provided for arbitration, in one of the agreements the venue was stated as kolkata, yet the proceedings were conducted at new delhi. at no stage objections were raised by the respondent before the arbitrator and the respondent had let the arbitration proceedings to conclude and culminate in an ex parte award. the court thereafter considered sections 4, 16 and 20 of the 1996 act. section 4 related to waiver of right to object. section 16 related to the competence of the arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction, and section 20 related to place of arbitration. having quoted the three sections the supreme court observed that it was open for the respondent to raise an objection at initial stage of the arbitration regarding its maintainability at new delhi however, it let the proceedings continue without raising any objections therefore it would be deemed that the respondent had waived its right and it could not be allowed to object at a later stage. moreover, the matter had not arisen from an arbitration petition preferred under section 11 (6) of the act. in the case before the supreme court however, the question was of a domestic and institutional arbitration where construction industry arbitration association was empowered to and did nominate the arbitrator. 72. the supreme court observed in para 30 that\"the specification of place of arbitration may have significance in an international commercial of arbitration , where the place of arbitration may determine which curial law would apply. however, in the present case the applicable substantive as well as curial law would be the same.\" the supreme court there after observed in paragraph 31 as follows: \"31. it was possible for the respondent to raise submissions that arbitration pertaining to each of the agreements be considered and dealt with separately. it was also possible for him to contend that in respect of the agreement where the venue was agreed to be at kolkata, the arbitration proceedings be conducted accordingly. considering the facts that the respondent failed to participate in the proceedings before the arbitrator and did not raise any submission that the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction or that he was exceeding the scope of his authority, the respondent must be deemed to have waived all such objections.\" 73. the learned counsel for the petitioner has also placed reliance upon judgements of high courts of bombay and madras and delhi which have followed the judgement in soma jv, ie ; l&t finance ltd versus manoj pathak and another; 2020 scc online bombay 177; om prakash and others versus vijay dwaraka das varma 2020 scc online bombay 796; engineering projects india versus balaji projects 2021 scconline madras 409; and s.p. singla constructions pvt ltd versus construction and design services up jal nigam arb.p450/2021 decided on 23.9.2021; where the high courts had held that subsequent to the signing of the agreement where the seat has been designated, it is the conduct of the parties which is important. if the venue is shifted to some place else where the entire arbitration proceedings are held then the place at which such arbitration proceedings are held would be deemed to be the seat of arbitration raising an exclusive jurisdiction clause and the courts situated in that place alone would have jurisdiction to deal with any application under section 34/37 of the act of 1996. even where no place of arbitration is specified in the arbitration clause the parties could agree to a place of arbitration separately in writing and even in the absence of such place being specified in writing, it could be ascertained from the conduct of the parties. if the parties do not object before the arbitrator appointed by a high court and participate in the proceedings then such particular place by their conduct , would become the seat of arbitration creating an exclusionary jurisdiction clause for the courts situated in that place to have supervisory jurisdiction. 74. a two judges bench of the supreme court in ravi ranjan developers private limited versus aditya kumar chatterji 2022 scconline supreme court 568; decided on 24.03.2022, was considering an order of the calcutta high court appointing a sole arbitrator under section 11 (6) of the 1996 act. the appellant and the respondent had entered into a development agreement for a property situated at muzaffarpur in bihar. dispute arose in relation to such development agreement. the respondent sent a notice to the appellant invoking arbitration clause under the development agreement. notice was sent to the registered office of the appellant at patna in bihar outside the jurisdiction of the calcutta high court. thereafter, the respondent moved a petition under section 11 sub-section (6). the appellant denied that the calcutta high court had territorial jurisdiction to entertain such application. it submitted that the development agreement was executed and registered in the state of bihar. the registered office of the appellant was also situated outside the jurisdiction of the calcutta high court. however, the respondent submitted that the parties had agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the calcutta high court by fixing kolkata as the place for arbitration proceedings to be held. the respondent had relied upon soma jv and indus mobile and hindustan construction company limited versus nhpc 2020 (4) scc 234, to argue that whenever there is designation of a place of arbitration in an agreement as being the venue of the arbitration proceedings, the expression arbitration proceedings would make it clear that the venue is really the seat of arbitral proceedings, and it would create an exclusionary clause with respect to the courts situated at such seat having exclusive supervisory jurisdiction over disputes arising out of five attrition agreement. 75. the supreme court observed in paragraph 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 as follows: \"37.the question before the constitution bench was whether part i of the arbitration and conciliation act applied to the arbitration, where the place of arbitration was outside india. \"38. as observed by the constitution bench, section 2 (2) of the arbitration and conciliation act places a threshold limitation on the applicability of part i, where the place of arbitration is not in india. the constitution bench in effect and substance drew a distinction between venue and place of arbitration, as contemplated in section 20 and held that only if the agreement of the parties was construed to provide for seat/place of arbitration in india, hen part i of 1996 act be applicable. if the seat/place was outside india, part i would not apply, even though the venue of a few sittings may have been in india, or the cause of action may have arisen in india. \"39. the judgement of this court in soma jv (supra) .was also rendered in the context of section 2 (2) of the arbitration and conciliation act and the applicability of part i of the arbitration and conciliation act to an international commercial arbitration,where the seat of arbitration was not in india. \"40. in hindustan construction company ltd (supra), this court held that where the seat of arbitration is designated, the same operates as an exclusive jurisdiction clause and only courts within whose restriction the seat was located, would have jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts. in the facts and circumstances of that case this court found that courts at new delhi alone would have jurisdiction for the purpose of challenge to the award. \"41. it is well settled that a judgement is a precedent for the issue of law that is reached and declared decided. the judgement has to be construed in the backdrop of the facts and circumstances in which the judgement has been rendered. words, phrases and sentences in a judgement, cannot be read out of context. nor is a judgement to be read and interpreted in the manner of a statute. it is only the law as interpreted in an earlier judgement, which constitutes a binding precedent and not every thing that the judges say\". 76. the supreme court in ravi ranjan developers (supra) thereafter observed that on careful perusal of the development agreement it was evident that the parties to the arbitration agreement had agreed to hold the sittings of the arbitral tribunal in kolkata. referring to union of india versus hardy exploration and mankastu impex that mere expression \"place of arbitration \"cannot be the basis to determine the intention of the parties that they have intended that place as a \"seat of arbitration\", the supreme court held that kolkata was only the venue for the sittings of the arbitral tribunal . in this case the parties had not agreed to refer their disputes to the jurisdiction of the courts in kolkata. referring to the code of civil procedure and sub-section (2) of section 2 of the 1996 act, the supreme court observed that the court having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject matter of the arbitration subject to pecuniary and other limitations would be either where the immovable property was situated or where the defendant voluntarily resides or carries on business. a suit may also be instituted in a court within whose jurisdiction the cause of action arises either wholly or in part. admittedly the immovable property was situated at muzaffarpur in bihar and admittedly no part of cause of action had arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of the calcutta high court. 77. it observed in paragraph 28 as follows-\"28. it could never have been the intention of section 11(6)of the arbitration and conciliation act that arbitration proceedings should be initiated in any court in india, irrespective of whether the respondent resided or carried on business within the jurisdiction of that high court, and irrespective of whether any part of cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of that court, to put an opponent at a disadvantage and steal a march over the opponent. \" 78. the supreme court also observed that under section 42 of the 1996 act which was mandatory, any application under part i of the act if made to a court, that court alone would have jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement, and the arbitral proceedings, would have to be made in that court and in no other court, unless of course, the court in which the first application had been instituted, inherently lacked jurisdiction to entertain that application. 79. in a recent decision dated 18.5.2022 rendered by two judges bench in civil appeal no.4130 of 2022: bbr (india) private limited versus sp singla constructions (private) limited; the supreme court was considering a case where under the arbitration agreement a retired justice of the high court was appointed as sole arbitrator who heard the proceedings at panchkula, haryana. later on he recused for personal reasons. another retired high court judge was appointed who held the arbitration proceedings at new delhi. the award was signed and delivered at new delhi. the respondent was awarded more than 3crores 35 lakhs with interest at the rate of 15% per annum. the arbitration clause was silent and did not state the seat or venue of arbitration. the contract and the letter of intent had been executed at panchkula, haryana. the respondent filed an application for interim order under section 9 of the 1996 act before the additional district judge panchkula, haryana in terms of the award. the said application was dismissed by the additional district judge, panchkula, on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction by observing that jurisdiction to entertain the application rests solely with delhi high court where a prior petition under section 34 had been filed by the appellant and was pending. the petition under section 9 being a subsequent petition would be barred under section 42 of the act. such order was set aside by the high court of punjab and haryana with finding that the courts of delhi did not have jurisdiction to entertain the objection under section 34 of the act and the court at panchkula, haryana had the jurisdiction to deal with the case. 80. such order was challenged before the supreme court. the supreme court observed after quoting section 2(1)(e) and section 20 and section 42 of the 1996 act and judgement rendered by the five judges in balco, that there was a distinction between jurisdictional seat and venue in the context of international arbitration. the arbitrators at times hold meetings at more convenient locations. the court also noticed the three judges decision in soma jv versus nhpc ltd, where paragraph 96 of balco judgement had been interpreted and clarified by the supreme court. in soma jv, the supreme court had observed that the term \"subject matter of the suit\" used in clause (1) is for the purpose of identifying the court having supervisory control over the judicial proceedings . hence, the clause refers to a court which would be essentially a court of the seat of the arbitration process. the seat of arbitration process has to be determined in terms of section 20 of the act as such that the term court as defined in sub-section (1) of section 2 which refers to the subject matter of arbitration is not necessarily used as finally determinative of the court''s territorial jurisdiction to entertain proceedings under the act. in soma jv the supreme court had observed that any other construction of the provisions would render section 20 of the act nugatory. the court had held that the legislature had given jurisdiction to two courts: the court which should have jurisdiction where the cause of action is located; and a court where the arbitration takes place. the seat of arbitration need not be the place where any cause of action has arisen as the parties may choose a neutral place for holding arbitration proceedings. however under section 20 subsection (1), party autonomy to fix such seat of arbitration by agreement is recognised. it was therefore held that an agreement as to the seat of arbitration draws in the law of that country as the curial law and is analogous to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. 81. the supreme court in singla construction (supra) observed that the principles relating to the seat of arbitration and the exclusive jurisdiction clause as in international arbitration was applied to domestic arbitration in the case of soma jv (supra) and quoted paragraph 38 and 40 of the said judgement. it referred to judgement rendered in indus mobile versus datawind innovations and brahmani river pellets ltd versus kamatchi industries ltd and observed in para 20 thus:\".in the context of domestic arbitrations it must be held that once the seat of arbitration has been fixed, then the courts at the said location alone will have exclusive jurisdiction to exercise the supervisory powers over the arbitration. the courts at other locations would not have jurisdiction, including the courts where cause of action has arisen. as observed and held in soma jv (supra), and indus mobile (supra), the moment the parties by agreement designate the seat, it becomes akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. it would then vest the court at that seat with the exclusive jurisdiction to regulate arbitration proceedings arising out of the agreement between the parties.\" 82. referring to the judgement in soma jv (supra), the supreme court in singla constructions observed that the said judgement also dealt with a situation where the parties have not agreed on or have not fixed the jurisdictional seat of arbitration. in soma jv, the test to determine the seat of arbitration which would determine the location of the court that would exercise supervisory jurisdiction was given in paragraph 61 where it was observed:-\".. it will thus be seen that wherever there is an express designation of a venue, and no designation of any alternative place as the seat, combined with a supra national body of rules governing the arbitration, and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that the stated venue is actually the juridical seat of the arbitral proceedings\" 83. the supreme court in s.p. singla (supra) observed \"accordingly, in soma jv (supra), the law as applicable, where the parties by agreement have not fixed jurisdictional seat, is crystallised as under: \"82. on a conspectus of the aforesaid judgements it may be concluded that whenever there is the designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the venue of the arbitration proceedings, the expression arbitration proceedings would make it clear that the venue is really the seat of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression does not include just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award at that place. further the fact that arbitral proceedings shall be held at a particular venue would also indicate that the parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby, that that place is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. this, coupled with there being no other significant contrary indicia, that the stated venue is merely a venue and not the seat of the arbitral proceedings, would then conclusively show that such a clause designates a seat of the arbitral proceedings. in a national context, this would be replaced by the arbitration act 1996 as applying to the stated venue which then becomes the seat for the purpose of arbitration..\" 84. in paragraph 22 of s.p. singla (supra), the supreme court referred to the observations made in soma jv that the reasoning given in hardy exploration and production (supra) is per incuriam as it contradicts the ratio as laid down in balco (supra). the supreme court thereafter considered the facts of the case before it where the earlier appointed sole arbitrator had held hearing at panchkula in haryana and on his recusal, another sole arbitrator was appointed who held the arbitration proceedings at delhi, and delivered the award at delhi. it referred to the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the appellant that on the appointment of the new arbitrator the venue being fixed at delhi, the juridical seat of arbitration had changed from panchkula in haryana to delhi. the supreme court observed that in so far as sub-section (1) of section 20 of the 1996 act is concerned, the observations made by the supreme court in inox renewable (supra) is correct, but they cannot be read as a precept in cases governed by sub-section (2) of section 20 of the act. inox renewable would apply in cases where the parties by consent agree mutually that the seat of arbitration would be located at a particular place. it would not apply when the arbitrator fixes the seat in terms of sub-section (2) of section 20 of the act. once the arbitrator fixes the seat in terms of sub-section (2) of section 20 of the act, the arbitrator cannot change the seat of arbitration, except when and if the parties mutually agree and state that the seat of arbitration should be changed to another location, which is not so in the present case. 85. the supreme court observed in paragraph 25 and 26 of its judgement in s.p. singla that any other interpretation would lead to \"uncertainty and confusion resulting in avoidable esoteric and hermetic litigation as to the jurisdictional seat of arbitration.\" it observed that \".., it would create a recipe for litigation and what is worse confusion which was not intended by the act. the place of jurisdiction over the seat must be certain and static and not vague or changeable, as the parties should not be in doubt as to the jurisdiction of the courts for availing of judicial remedies. further, there would be a risk of parties rushing to the courts to get first hearing or conflicting decisions that the law does not contemplate and is to be avoided.\" 86. the supreme court further observed in s.p. singla in para 28 thus:\".the legal question raised in the case must be answered objectively or not subjectively with reference to the facts of a particular case. otherwise, there would be lack of clarity and consequent mixup about the courts that would exercise jurisdiction. there could be cases where the arbitration proceedings were held at different locations but the seat of arbitration, as agreed by the parties or as determined by the arbitrator, may be different, and at that place ,\"the seat\",only a few hearings or initial proceedings may have been held. this would not matter, and would not result in shifting of the jurisdictional seat. arbitrators can fix the place of residence, place of work, or in case of recusal , arbitration proceedings may be held at two different places, as in the present case. for clarity and certainty, which is required when the question of territorial jurisdiction arises, we would hold that the place or the venue fixed for arbitration proceedings, when subsection (2) of section 20 applies, will be the jurisdictional seat and the court having jurisdiction over the jurisdictional seat would have exclusive jurisdiction. this principle would have exception that would apply when by mutual consent the parties agree that the jurisdictional seat should be changed, and such consent must be express and clearly understood and agreed by the parties.\" (emphasis supplied) 87. it further observed that paragraph 42 of the judgement in soma jv supports the \"..reasoning that once the jurisdictional seat of arbitration is fixed in terms of subsection (2) of section 20 of the act, then, without the express mutual consent of the parties to the arbitration, the seat cannot be changed.\" 88. the learned counsel for the respondent railways has placed before this court a judgement of a coordinate bench of this court in a petition under article 227 no.6890 of 2021:hasmukh prajapati versus jaiprakash associates ltd; decided on 17.2.2022. 89. the petitioner before the coordinate bench had challenged the order passed by the presiding officer commercial court gautam budh nagar, in an application preferred under section 34 of the 1996 act arising out of award dated 16.02.2019 passed by the arbitral tribunal at new delhi. the petitioner had booked a flat with the respondents and had made full payment by taking a housing loan from a non banking finance company with interest at the rate of 13% per annum. the possession had to be delivered in three years. jaypee associates however did not deliver possession for more than nine years. the petitioner preferred an arbitration application before this court and this court appointed a retired judge having his office at new delhi, under section 11(6) of the 1996 act as there was no dispute between the parties that the place of arbitration will be new delhi. the arbitral award was passed in favour of the petitioner against which the respondent preferred an arbitration application under section 34 before the district judge gautam budh nagar. an application was filed by the petitioner praying for return of plaint on the ground that it was not maintainable. such application was rejected by the commercial court gautam budh nagar. the petitioner thereafter approached this court in the aforesaid article 227 petition. 90. this court while considering the issue whether the commercial court at gautam budh nagar had jurisdiction to hear the case under section 34 of the 1996 act recorded that the arbitral award having been passed at new delhi after completion of entire arbitration proceedings at delhi. the counsel for the petitioner argued that in the arbitration agreement the seat of arbitration had not been specified. the venue of arbitration had been chosen to be new delhi by both the parties out of convenience. in the absence of specified seat of arbitration in the agreement, the venue of arbitration will be the juridical seat of arbitration proceedings. the learned counsel for the petitioner had placed reliance upon judgement rendered by three judges bench in soma jv where the court had interpreted the constitution bench judgement in balco and paragraph 96, to say that if both parties had chosen a seat of arbitration the courts situated in such seat will have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain and decide dispute under section 34 of the act. since no seat of arbitration was specified in the agreement and the parties agreed upon the venue of arbitration to be new delhi, the stated venue will be the juridical seat of arbitration as held also in the case of roger shashoua versus mukesh sharma and others 2017 (14) scc 722. 91. the coordinate bench went on to observe that the judgement in hardy exploration (supra) was rendered by three judges bench. however in soma jv which came in later, another three-judges bench observed that the decision in hardy exploration is per incuriam. the coordinate bench thereafter observed that \".there is uncertainty whether decision in hardy exploration or soma jv holds the field as a concurrent bench could not have overruled the judgement in hardy exploration..\" 92. the coordinate bench of this court observed in paragraph 31 as follows:\"31. from the above consideration of the judgement of the honourable supreme court regarding the seat and venue controversy, this court finds that the judgement of the honourable supreme court in the case of balco (supra) still holds good. the judgement in the case of hardy exploration (supra) or soma jv (supra) are of two coordinate benches of three honble judges and their ratios are contrary to each other. while hardy exploration stipulated that a chosen venue could not by itself assume the status of seat of arbitration in the absence of additional indicia, soma jv (supra) prescribed that the chosen seat of arbitration proceedings would become the seat of arbitration in the absence of any significant contrary indicia. the recent judgement in the case of messers inox renewables ltd (supra) follows soma jv (supra).\" 93. the coordinate bench there after observed that in balco it was held that there was concurrent jurisdiction conferred on the courts seized with the subject matter in dispute and the courts where the arbitration was carried out. however, such concurrent jurisdiction will not replace \"significant contrary indicia test\" as per shashoua principle. 94. it thereafter interpreted the clauses in the contract where under clause 10.6 the governing law and jurisdiction of the courts would be the courts of gautam budh nagar in up; whereas such clause was made subject to clause 10.9 of the standard terms and conditions. the exception regarding clause 10.9 constituted \"significant contrary indicia\" as per shashoua principle in agreement regarding treating the venue of arbitration (new delhi) as seat of arbitration proceedings and not gautam budh nagar where the cause of action arose. the arbitrator conducted the arbitration proceedings at the agreed venue of new delhi and passed the award. the parties never clearly stated about the seat of arbitration but from clause 10.6 of the agreement, the courts at gautam budh nagar, up india were agreed to have jurisdiction over all matters arising out of or relating to allotment/provisional allotment. this clause proved that the parties had chosen the seat of arbitration as gautam budh nagar and venue of arbitration as new delhi india. moreover, the petitioner had approached this court for appointment of arbitrator under section 11 of the act. it had also moved execution proceedings under section 36 of the act before the court at gautam budh nagar. if it was held by the court now that the seat of arbitration was at new delhi, it would create an exclusionary clause, and the appointment of the arbitrator itself by this court at allahabad would become non est. the coordinate bench thereafter held that new delhi was only the venue of arbitration and gautam buddh nagar was the seat of arbitration and the courts at gautam buddh nagar had exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the challenge to the award. 95. this court is of the considered opinion that the judgement rendered in soma j v (supra) has been reiterated by the supreme court in quippo constructions (supra) and singla constructions (supra) and the reason for following soma jv as against hardy exploration (supra) have also been stated with quite clarity and definiteness in singla constructions. soma jv (supra) was sought to be questioned by the respondents in mankastu impex but the three judges coordinate bench refused to make any observations with regard to the failure to follow the law of binding precedents in soma j v. the court observed in mankastu while looking at the clauses of the contract, and the judgement rendered in shashoua case held that the language of the contract gave sufficient indication of the intent of the parties to hold arbitration proceedings at hong kong which would therefore be also the juridical seat. 96. this court has also considered observations made in ravi ranjan developers (supra) but finds that the judgement in ravi ranjan developers turned on its on facts where the respondents had themselves approached the courts in bihar first, and hence were bound by non obstante clause in section 42 of the 1996 act . in any case, a two judges decision in ravi ranjan developers could not be said to have decided the law against what has already been settled by three judges bench in soma j v while following to 5 judges bench in balco. 97. this court has also considered the conduct of the parties which is very relevant for a decision to be taken,in view of what has been stated hereinabove with regard to section 4 and section 20 of the 1996 act. the contract being governed by the tender paper elcore, it was open for the parties, more specifically the railways, to determine the place of arbitration by way of written agreement. instead of any written agreement or conditions in the contract or even in the correspondence between the parties, specifying the seat of arbitration, the railways agreed to participate in the arbitration proceedings at new delhi without any protest. the railways hence can be said to have waived their right to object and by their conduct determined the venue of arbitration at new delhi to be also the seat of the arbitration proceedings. issues b, c, and d consequently are also decided in favour of the petitioner and it is held that failure to specifically mention a seat of arbitration and participation in arbitration proceedings at new delhi by the railways without any protest shall be considered as determination of the venue of arbitration as also the seat, giving exclusive jurisdiction to the courts at new delhi to supervise the arbitral proceedings including any attack on the award. 98. the order impugned dated 12.12.2019 is held to be vitiated and liable to be set aside. the commercial court at lucknow has entertained the section 34 application without jurisdiction. such inherent lack of jurisdiction makes the proceedings before it also liable to be set aside. 99. this petition stands allowed. 100. the order impugned dated 12.12.2019 is set aside. consequences to follow. order date :1.9.2022 rahul [justice sangeeta chandra]"
