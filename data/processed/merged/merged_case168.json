By way of this petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the petitioner - original applicant has challenged the order dated 16.7.2021 passed by the Commercial Court  and learned 12th Additional District Judge, District and Sessions Court, Surat below interim application filed by the applicant in Commercial CMA no.2 of 2021. \nAs all documents including the material relied upon before the trial court is forming part of the record of this petition, we do not deem it fit to call for the original record and proceedings but to decide this petition on the basis of the record before us. The pleadings and documents which are relied upon by the parties before the trial court is part of the paper book. We have called for the original record and proceedings of IAAP 5 of 2021. \n2. Following noteworthy facts emerge from the record of the petition:-\n2.1 That, the parties to this petition entered into Cargo Handling Agreement (CHA) (hereinafter referred to as \"the agreement\") on 21.2.2011. It appears from the record that Article 15 of the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 said agreement stipulates that the disputes between the parties arising out of the said agreement shall be settled by way of arbitration. As per the record, several amendments were made in the said agreement. \nHowever, they are not necessary to be mentioned in this order. Record further shows that the disputes arose between the parties regarding the agreement in the month of December, 2019. The record further shows that the petitioner issued a notice to the respondent invoking the arbitration between the parties in relation to the agreement in the question on 22.11.2020. The notice dated 22.11.2020 was replied by the respondent on 30.12.2020. The petitioner herein filed a petition before this Court under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\" for the sake of brevity) which came to be registered on 5.1.2021 before this Court as IAAP no.5 of 2021 seeking appointment of an Arbitral Tribunal to adjudicate the disputes between the parties. On 8.1.2021, this Court (Coram: Ms. Bela M. Trivedi, J.) issued notice in IAAP no.5 of 2021. The petitioner herein filed an application under Section 9 of the Act before the Commercial Court at Surat on 15.1.2021. The said application was contested by the respondent before the Commercial Court at Surat and hearing of the said application took place before the Commercial Court at Surat from January 18, 2021. \nC/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 2.2 The respondent also filed an application for interim measure as provided under Section 9(1) of the Act before the same Court i.e. Commercial Court at Surat. \n2.3 Both the applications were heard together and final arguments in both the applications under Section 9(1) of the Act were made by both the sides before the Commercial Court at Surat between May 17, 2021 to June 7, 2021 both were made by both the sides before the commercial Court the applications were heard together and kept for orders ultimately on June 7, 2021. Record indicates that the Commercial Court at Surat was to pronounce the orders on both the applications filed by the respective parties under Section 9(1) of the Act on June 18, 2021, however, did not pronounce the orders and the matter was adjourned to 3.7.2021 for pronouncement of orders. Even on that day, the Commercial Court could not pronounce the orders on both the applications under Section 9(1) of the Act filed by the respective parties and the matter was kept for orders on July 20, 2021. Meanwhile, the application filed under Section 11(6) of the Act by the petitioner was allowed with consent on an express written agreement between the parties and by an order dated 9.7.2021, which is referred to hereinafter, this Court was pleased to appoint Arbitral Tribunal, C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 consisting of Hon'ble Mr. Justice Vikramjit Sen and Hon'ble Mr. Justice G.T. Nanavati, former Judges of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as arbitrators and Hon'ble Mr. Justice Deepak Gupta, former Judge of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as presiding arbitrator. The petitioner herein filed an application before the Commercial Court at Surat on July 16, 2021 and, inter-alia, prayed as under:-\n\"a. Pass an order referring all disputes between the parties as mentioned in the AMNS Petition and EBTL Petition to the arbitral tribunal for adjudication; and\"\n2.4 The Commercial Court at Surat, after hearing both the parties, was pleased to dismiss the said application and while dismissing the said application filed by the petitioner, vide impugned order dated 16.7.2021, granted 10 days' time to the petitioner herein-original applicant to enable them to challenge the order before this Court. Being aggrieved by the same, the present petition is filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \n2.5 This Court passed the following order on 26.7.2021:-\n\"Heard Mr. Harish Salve, learned Senior Advocate, Mr. Mihir Thakore, learned Senior Advocate, Mr. Navin Pahwa, learned Senior Advocate assisted by Mr. Nirag N. Pathak, C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 learned advocate, Mr. Rishab Gupta, learned advocate and Mr. Sairam Subramanian, learned advocate for the petitioner and Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned Senior Advocate, Mr. Saurabh Soparkar, learned Senior Advocate assisted by Mr. Keyur Gandhi, learned advocate for Nanavati Associates and Mr. Mahesh Agarwal, learned advocate for the respondent.\n            Heard   both   the   learned    Senior             Advocates    appearing     for     the             respective parties extensively. \nConsidering the issue involved in the matter, we deem it fit to fix the matter for final disposal on 2nd August, 2021 at 02:30 p.m. Both the parties shall submit their written submissions as well as copies of judgments, which they intend to rely upon. \nAs can be seen from the record that the trial Court fixed the matter for pronouncement of order on 20.07.2021, as while pronouncing the impugned order in para-21, the trial Court has granted 10 days time to the applicant-petitioner herein to enable the applicant-petitioner herein to challenge the order dated 16.07.2021. In the facts and circumstances of the case, as this Court has taken cognizance of the matter, the trial Court is directed to postpone the date of pronouncement of judgment to 09.08.2021. \nThe Registrar General is directed to communicate a copy of this order to the trial Court through e-mail / FAX forthwith. \nC/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Direct service is permitted.\"\n3. Both the sides have filed their written submissions. However, the learned counsels have not based their arguments entirely on such written submissions, which are taken on record. \n4. The application under consideration was filed by the petitioner-original applicant. It was averred by the petitioner that the Court had heard the applications filed by the petitioner as well as the respondent under section 9(1) of the Act extensively and reserved the applications for pronouncement of orders and was listed on 20.7.2021 for pronouncement of order. Referring to and relying upon the order passed by this Court in IAAP no.5 of 2021, it was contended by the petitioner that as the Arbitral Tribunal has now been constituted, it is imperative under Section 9(3) of the Act that all disputes between the parties including the interim reliefs claimed by the petitioner and/or the respondent be adjudicated by the Arbitral Tribunal. Relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in the case of Tufan Chatterjee Vs. Rangan Dhar, reported in AIR 2016 Cal 213 as well as judgment of this Court in the case of Manbhupinder Singh Atwal Vs. Neeraj Kumarpal Shah, reported in 2019 (4) GLR 3229 as well as the judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Nehru Nagar Vijay Lenyadri C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 C.H.S.L. Vs. S.D. Bhalerao Construction Pvt. Ltd., reported in 2018 SCC OnLine Bom 20461, it was contended by the applicant before the Commercial Court that in light of the order whereby the Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted, it becomes imperative that the application filed by both, the petitioner and the respondent, pending before the Commercial Court at Surat be referred for adjudication to Arbitral Tribunal. It was also contended by the petitioner-original applicant that there is no reason why the reliefs claimed for by the petitioner as well as the respondent in their respective applications filed under Section 9(1) of the Act would be rendered inefficacious if they are adjudicated by the Arbitral Tribunal as opposed to the Commercial Court. It was also contended on the same aspect that more than four months have passed since then and none of the parties have faced any prejudice owing to pendency of the applications and it was contended that as such there is no urgency in the said matter and the matter can wait adjudication by the Arbitral Tribunal and on such factual basis, the petitioner has prayed for the prayers as referred to hereinabove.\n5. Heard Mr. Mihir Thakore, Mr. Gourab Banerjee, Mr. Navin Pahwa, learned Senior Advocates assisted by Mr. Nirag Pathak, Mr. Rishab Gupta, Mr. Sairam Subramanian, Ms. Shreya Gupta, Ms. C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Swagata Ghosh, Ms. Juhi Gupta, Ms. Saloni Gupta, Ms. Archismita Raha, learned advocates for the petitioner and Mr. Kapil Sibal, Mr. Saurabh Soparkar, learned Senior Advocates assisted by Mr. Keyur D. Gandhi, Mr. Mahesh Agarwal, Mr. Raheel Patel, Ms. Amita Katragadda, Mr. Nizam Pasha, learned advocates for Nanavati Associates for the respondent.\n6. By an order dated 5.8.2021, the compilations filed by both the sides are taken on record and are also made basis of this judgment and order.\n7. Mr. Mihir Thakore, learned counsel for the petitioner, at the outset, contended that the respondents have raised an objection to the effect that the petitioner cannot seek a writ of certiorari in a matter arising from the Trial Court is correct. Mr. Thakore further submitted that what has been prayed for is to call for the record and proceedings and the petition is under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and the word \"certiorari\" is a surplus aid. Mr. Thakore, at this stage, contended that the petitioner has no objection to delete the word \"certiorari\" and that this Court may be pleased to permit the petitioner to amend the petition and delete the relevant portion out of the prayers. Mr. Thakore contended that the petitioner would pray only for calling for the record and proceedings and merely to quash and set aside the impugned C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 order. Mr. Thakore, referring to the factual matrix arising out of this petition, contended that a Cargo Handling Agreement dated 21.2.2011 was entered into between the respondent and Essar Steel Ltd., the predecessor of the present petitioner now known as ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Limited. Mr. Thakore, referring to Article 15 of the agreement, contended that an arbitration clause is provided thereunder. It was also pointed out by Mr. Thakore that the agreement has undergone various amendments. However, it was submitted that those amendments were not relevant for the present purpose. Mr. Thakore also referred to the Service Level Agreement entered into between the parties which came to be revised on 1.4.2016 and more particularly, referred to in Paragraphs 7 and 11 of the said Service Level Agreement. Mr. Thakore, further relying upon the factual matrix, contended that a notice for invoking the arbitration clause was given by the petitioner to the respondent on 22.11.2020 and as there was no response to the notice for a mandatory period of 30 days, the petitioner filed an application under Section 11 of the Act for appointment of arbitrator on 24.12.2020 before this Court. It was contended by Mr. Thakore that after the said application under Section 11(6) of the Act was filed before this Court, the respondent gave reply to the notice of arbitration vide their reply dated 30.12.2020. Mr. Thakore further C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 contended that on 12.1.2021, there was a sudden and abrupt reduction in the draft of the port announced by the respondent, which they claimed that this is as per the agreement. It was contended that there were vessels waiting with a higher draft which could not enter because of change in draft declared by the respondent and those vessels were the vessels, which were approved by them earlier. Mr. Thakore pointed out that because of such reason, an application for interim measures was filed by the petitioner on 15.1.2021 before the competent Court i.e. Commercial Court at Surat. The respondent gave reply to the same on 13.2.2021 and the said application was kept for hearing by the Trial Court. Mr. Thakore further pointed out that on 15.3.2021, the respondent also filed an application under Section 9(1) of the Act for interim measures. Mr. Thakore contended that it is the claim of the respondent in the said application under Section 9(1) of the Act that the petitioner has to pay as per the amended provision of the agreement tariff on dollar rate basis rather than in rupee terms. Mr. Thakore, further referring to the application filed by the respondent, contended that the respondent claimed before the Trial Court that they are required to fulfill minimum requirements and hence, the petitioner is required to pay that amount and other claims which were made. Mr. Thakore contended that thus, the application C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 under Section 9(1) of the Act filed by the respondent primarily is to recover the amount which according to them is payable by the petitioner. Mr. Thakore, further elucidating the contentions raised and the prayers prayed for by the respondent in their application under Section 9(1) of the Act, contended that the petitioner has also claimed that there was a provision for providing Bank Guarantee or a letter of credit. Mr. Thakore contended that both the applications were heard together and thereafter kept for orders and lastly on 20.7.2021. However, no orders were passed. Mr. Thakore relied upon the order passed by this Court in IAAP no.5 of 2021. Mr. Thakore also submitted that the respondent filed an independent Suit in the Civil Court, wherein the petitioner moved an application under Section 8 of the Act. Mr. Thakore also referred to the orders dated 15.3.2021 and 30.3.2021 passed by the Civil Court rejecting the application filed by the petitioner under Section 8 as well as the orders passed by the Appellate Court allowing the appeal, whereby the disputes arising out of the Suit were referred to the arbitration. Mr. Thakore, however, contended that the same has no direct relevance to the present petition. Mr. Thakore further contended that in view of the order passed by this Court, the Arbitral Tribunal came to be constituted vide order dated 9.7.2021. Mr. Thakore further contended that the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 petitioner filed an application on 16.7.2021 before the order was pronounced which was to be pronounced on 20.7.2021 for the prayers prayed for therein. Mr. Thakore contended that it was prayed that, the disputes pending under Section 9(1) of the Act should now be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal and the pending applications be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal. Mr. Thakore submitted that the said application was heard on 16.7.2021 which came to be dismissed vide impugned order. \n7.1 At this stage, Mr. Thakore contended that first sitting of the Arbitral Tribunal was held on 30.7.2021 and the procedural order is already passed. A copy of the said order was also referred to by Mr. Thakore. \n7.2 Mr. Thakore contended that the issue which arises in this petition is that whether once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, can the Court which is seized of the matter under Section 9 of the Act, continue to determine the matter irrespective of the stage at which that matter is pending. Mr. Thakore contended that it is completely irrelevant whether the matter is part heard, heard or totally heard. It was contended that so long as there is no order under Section 9 of the Act, the matter will have to be treated as pending matter before the Court under Section 9 of the Act and any such matter, except when it C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 falls within the four corners carved out in Section 9, the Court would have to say that the Court will not further determine the matter and one must approach the Arbitral Tribunal for determination on the issue of the interim relief. Mr. Thakore, referring to Sections 9 and 17 of the Act pre-amendment, contended that there was absolutely no provision for enforceability of interim orders passed by the Tribunal in pre-amended Section 17 of the Act. Mr. Thakore contended that with this limitation, practically, the only remedy available for obtaining the interim relief was Section 9. Mr. Thakore further contended that the order of the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 17 of the Act was the premises for filing the application under Section 9 of the Act to make it enforceable. It was contended that in the alternative, only Section 9 was filed and Section 17 was not filed. Referring to the judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of MSTC Limited Vs. K.A. Malle Pharmaceuticals Limited passed in F.M.A. no.982 of 2017, it was contended by Mr. Thakore that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court referred to and relied upon Section 27(5) of the Act to find out the way of enforcing an order passed under Section 17 of the Act. It was further contended that the said view is pre-amended view. It was further contended that it was in this background that the Law Commission report suggested certain C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 amendments. Referring to the foot note and referring to the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Alka Chandewar Vs. Shamshul Ishrar Khan, reported in (2017) 16 SCC 119, it was contended by Mr. Thakore that the amended Section 17 of the Act is pari materia to Section 9 of the Act. It was therefore contended that with effect from 2015, Section 17 of the Act was made pari materia to Section 9 of the Act. Mr. Thakore contended that the Arbitral Tribunal during the arbitration proceedings had the same powers as that of the Courts and the party could apply to the Arbitral Tribunal for all reliefs which earlier could be applied under Section 9 of the Act before the Court. Referring to Section 17(2) of the Act, it was contended that the interim order of the Arbitral Tribunal can even be executed under Order 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. It was contended that this is the teeth which is given to the orders of the Tribunal and when such teeth was given to the orders of the Arbitral Tribunal, it was necessary also to amend Section 9 of the Act. Mr. Thakore referred to the post-amendment Sections 9(1), 9(2) and 9(3) of the Act and contended that while the same powers were retained with the Courts, these powers were made subject to sub-section (3) of Section 9 of the Act which provides that once the Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted, the Court shall not entertain any application under Section 9(1) C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 of the Act unless the Court finds that the circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 of the Act efficacious. Mr. Thakore submitted that the word \"entertain\" cannot mean filing of an application under Section 9. 'Entertain' would mean filing and all the way upto final disposal of the application under Section 9. It was contended that thus, there is embargo in the Court to entertain an application unless it gives a finding that the remedy provided under Section 17 of the Act is not efficacious. The Court has not given such a finding and what is material is that even after the order dated 09.07.2021 of the High Court was placed before the Trial Court, the Court has said that the Tribunal has not come into existence and that the Tribunal has not become functional. Mr. Thakore contended that the Tribunal has become functional the moment it is constituted and the parties can approach the Tribunal for an interim order even before filing of the statement of claim. Mr. Thakore contended that the parties can approach under Section 9 of the Act and they can as well approach under Section 17 without filing a statement of claim and invariably, are being approached. It was contended that the order of the Tribunal in this case also clearly spells out that as and when such application will be filed, time table for deciding that application will be laid down and the same has nothing to do C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 with the application for filing statement of claim or reply. Referring to the impugned order, Mr. Thakore contended that only two grounds are raised basically by the Trial Court. It was contended that first ground is that there are 3 stages, (i) that the Arbitral Tribunal has already come into existence and an application is filed, (ii) application is filed before the Arbitral Tribunal comes into existence, but is not determined, and (iii) after the matter is heard, but before judgment is pronounced, the arbitral tribunal is constituted. This is clearly a brain wave of the concerned Judge drawing a distinction between the pending application and the pending application which is heard. In both cases, it is pending. Mr. Thakore contended that the Court takes a view that if it is pending without being heard, then he will have to send it to the Arbitral Tribunal, however, he has further observed that the Court shall not pass such an order as the application is heard and only the order is to be passed. Mr. Thakore contended that the distinction which is drawn is incorrect and the second reason which is given that the Arbitral Tribunal has not become functional is also incorrect. Mr. Thakore submitted that the Law Commission report speaks of \"ordinarily not entertained\", whereas the statute says \"shall not entertain\" which is a mandate. Mr. Thakore further contended that the whole object of amendment is that unless the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 remedy of Arbitral Tribunal is not efficacious, all applications must be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. Mr. Thakore extensively took this Court, more particularly, to Paragraphs 7, 9, 15 and 17 of the impugned order. Relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Benara Bearings & Pistons Ltd. Vs. Mahle Engine Components India Pvt. Ltd., reported in 2017 SCC OnLine Del 7226, it was contended by Mr. Thakore that the said matter relates to the period after the amendment of the application was filed before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court and on facts, the learned Single Judge came to the conclusion that in fact, there was no agreement much less an arbitration agreement and even if there was an agreement, it cannot specifically be enforced. Referring to Paragraphs 23 to 26 of the said judgment, it was contended that the said judgment was challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the SLP came to be rejected. Mr. Thakore contended that factual matrix in the said matter shows that there was no agreement between the parties and the agreement was unenforceable. Referring to the judgment of Benara Bearings & Pistons Ltd. (supra), it was contended that in the said case, the appointment of Arbitral Tribunal was made on 28.7.2016, whereas the judgment was pronounced by the Court on 26.8.2016. Mr. Thakore, distinguishing the said judgment, contended that C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 the word \"entertain\" and the emphasis on exception carved out in Section 9(3) of the Act is not dealt with. Mr. Thakore also referred to the judgment of Calcutta High Court in the case of Srei Equipment Finance Ltd. (SEFF) vs. Ray Infra Services Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. reported in 2016 SCC OnLine Cal 6765 and more particularly, Paragraph 7 thereof as well as judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of Energo Engineering Projects Vs. TRF Ltd., reported in 2016 SCC OnLine 6560, more particularly, Paragraphs 22, 23, 27 and 34. Mr. Thakore thereafter heavily relied upon the case of Tufan Chatterjee (supra) and heavily relied upon the observations made by the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in Paragraphs 8, 12, 15, 16, 18, 26, 34. Mr. Thakore contended that the said judgment lays down two issues i.e. the principle that even with respect to pre 2015 amendment, application of new Act will apply as far as Court proceedings are concerned. It was contended that thus, the Court is denude of the power. Mr. Thakore also referring to the judgment of Tufan Chatterjee (supra) contended that it also lays down the principle of interpretation of Section 9(3) and the Court is denude of the powers to grant interim relief once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted. According to Mr. Thakore, two separate things are determined; firstly, the amended provision will also apply to the past/earlier arbitration;\nC/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 and secondly that Section 9 once it is there, the Court is denude of its power. According to Mr. Thakore, second part is never questioned by anybody in any judgment. Distinguishing the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of Ardee Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Ms. Anuradha Bhatia, reported in 2017 SCC OnLine Del 6402, it was contended that it is not a matter under Section 9 or Section 17 of the Act and the same has nothing to do with the interpretation of Section 9 of the Act. According to Mr. Thakore, the said judgment in the case of Ardee Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (supra) relied upon by the respondent herein has only to do with applicability of the amended provision to pre- amendment arbitral proceedings and post amendment arbitral proceedings. Mr. Thakore contended that the said judgment does not in any manner deal with Section 9, which is also interpreted by the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in the case of Tufan Chatterjee (supra). \n7.3 Learned counsel Mr. Mihir Thakore again referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in the case of Tufan Chatterjee (supra) and the judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Benara Bearings & Pistons Ltd. (supra). Learned counsel Mr. Thakore submitted that in Tufan Chatterjee's judgment (supra), the matter was arising out of the provisions of Section 9 of the Act, whereas, in Benara C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Bearings & Pistons Ltd.'s case (supra), it was more related to the provisions of Section 17 of the Act. According to learned counsel Mr. Thakore, Tufan Chatterjee's case (supra) deals with the situation of arbitral proceedings which commenced prior to the amendment, whereas, the case of Benara Bearings & Pistons Ltd. (supra) deals with Section 17 of the Act since the core issue that was determined in different context and as in Benara Bearings & Pistons Ltd.'s judgment (supra), there is no comment about Tufan Chatterjee's case (supra). Learned counsel Mr. Thakore submitted that looking to the controversy in question, the judgment in the case of MSTC Limited Vs. K.A. Malle Pharmaceuticals Limited (supra) also deals with the aspect of Section 17 and not Section 9 of the Act. Learned counsel Mr. Thakore also submitted that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Benara Bearings & Pistons Ltd. (supra) has not considered the judgment in the case of Tufan Chatterjee (supra). According to learned counsel Mr. Thakore, the judgment delivered by this Court in the case of Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra) is more relevant to determine the present controversy. According to learned counsel Mr. Thakore, Section 9(3) of the Act, in clear terms, mandates, not to entertain any application by the Court once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted. It is submitted that in the instant C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 case, now since the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the Commercial Court must be stopped from entertaining the application any further. He submitted that the Commercial Court has committed an error by considering the application preferred by the petitioner by taking into consideration the sole ground that the matter was heard and is reserved for judgment. It is submitted that the judgment of this Court in the case of Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra) would be a binding precedent for the Commercial Court Judge, but the said judgment has not been taken into consideration by the Trial Court. There can only be one exception to that judgment and that is, in case if remedy under Section 17 of the Act is not efficacious and Arbitral Tribunal has already been constituted and therefore, in absence of any such exception about inefficacy of the Tribunal, the judgment of this Court in the case of Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra) was required to be followed by the Trial Judge while passing the impugned order.\n7.4 Learned counsel Mr. Thakore relied upon the judgment in the case of Bhubhaneshwar Expressway Vs. National Highway Authority of India, reported in 2019 SCC OnLine Del 11390 and tried to point out from Paragraph 46 as to what can be said to be inefficacious. Mr. Thakore further relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 High Court in the case of Tata Capital Vs. Nectar Prints, reported in 2019 SCC OnLine Bom 4546 and also relied upon the judgment in the case of Nehru Nagar Vijay Lenyadri C.H.S.L. (supra) and also one more decision of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Krishanlal S. Attkan Vs. Union of India, reported in 2019 SCC OnLine Bom 4549 and submitted that once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, Section 9 application can be treated as Section 17 application and the dispute be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal and it was pointed out by the learned counsel that those orders are passed by the consent of the parties. Learned counsel took us to the order dated 26.7.2021 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Johnson Stephen V. MCEES Trading & Ors., rendered in SLP(C) no.6538-6539 of 2021 and submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid matter passed an order by directing that all issues arising in the interim application including an application for receiver can now be decided by the arbitrator untrammeled by the observations made by the High Court. According to learned counsel, in the aforesaid SLP also, the issue was in respect of Section 9 application before the Kerala High Court, wherein Kerala High Court entertained Section 9 application. \n7.5 Thereafter, learned counsel took us to the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 various judgments, whereby the word \"entertain\" is interpreted. According to Mr. Thakore, word \"entertain\" can only mean \"till final disposal\"\nand it means adjudication and disposal of Section 9 application. It cannot have any other meaning in the context in which it is used, once Arbitral Tribunal is constituted. It was submitted that if Section 9(1) of the Act is looked into, it provides that a party may before or during the arbitral proceedings or at any time after making of arbitral award, but before it is enforced in accordance with Section 36 apply to a Court for interim protection, would mean that entertaining an application would not just confine to its filing. Any party can file an application under Section 9 of the Act even after constitution of an Arbitral Tribunal. Filing of an application is always permissible at any stage, but it can be entertained only if it is decided that whether remedy under Section 17 of the Act is efficacious or not. The word \"entertain\" can have a wider meaning than just mean \"filing of an application\". What is required to determine first while considering the application under Section 9(3) of the Act is to see as to whether the remedy under Section 17 of the Act is efficacious or not. Once if it is decided that the remedy under Section 17 of the Act is not efficacious, then only, such application can be entertained and decided. If it is found that remedy under Section 17 of the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Act is an efficacious, then, the learned Trial Judge can always say that in view of the fact that Section 17 is efficacious remedy, he should not entertain such an application. Therefore, at which stage, the application is filed is not much relevant whether it is filed before the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted or after the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted. What is important is to determine whether to entertain such an application or not and therefore, the word \"entertain\" must be interpreted as final adjudication of the application. There cannot be any other meaning considering the context in which the word \"entertain\" is used. Learned counsel Mr. Thakore took us to the Dictionary meaning of Black's Law Dictionary which reads as under:-\n\"Entertain, vb. - 1. To bear in mind or consider; esp., to give judicial consideration to <the court then entertained motions for continuance>. 2. To amuse or please. 3. To receive (a person) as a guest or provide hospitality to (a person). 4. Parliamentary law. To recognize and state (a motion); to receive and take into consideration <the chair will entertain the motion>.\" \n7.6 Thereafter, learned counsel, relying upon the judgment in the case of Lakshmi Rattan Engineering Works Ltd. Vs. Asst. Commission of Sales Tax, reported in AIR 1968 SC 488, submitted that in Paragraphs 7 and 9 of the said C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 judgment, the word \"entertain\" has been interpreted. Sum and substance of submission of Mr. Thakore based on the aforesaid judgment was that \"entertain\" does not mean \"receive\" or \"accept\", but proceed to consider on merits or adjudicate upon. Then, Mr. Thakore relied upon the judgment of Allahabad High Court in the case of Kundan Lal Vs. Jagan Nath Sharma, reported in AIR 1962 All 547 and relying upon Paragraphs 5 and 7 of the aforesaid judgment, it was submitted by the learned counsel that \"entertain\" means actually to dispose of an application on merits. Learned counsel further substantiated his submission in respect of interpretation of word \"entertain\" by relying upon two more judgments in the case of Hindustan Commercial Bank Ltd. Vs. Punnu Sahu (Dead) Through LRs, reported in (1971) 3 SCC 124 and relying upon Paragraph 4 of the said judgment that a number of decisions of various Courts while interpreting word \"entertain\" has taken a view that \"entertain\" means \"adjudicate upon\" or \"proceed to consider on merits\". Similarly, the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Martin & Harris Ltd. Vs. Additional District Judge & Ors. reported in (1998) 1 SCC 732 and more particularly, Paragraphs 8 and 10 of the said judgment was pressed into service to substantiate his argument in respect of interpretation of the word \"entertain\". The learned counsel, by citing the aforesaid C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 judgment, submitted that the word \"entertain\" cannot be interpreted by giving it a narrow meaning considering the interpretation of word \"entertain\" by various High Courts including the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The word \"entertain\" can have only one meaning and that is to consider it till final disposal. Learned counsel Mr. Thakore also pointed out from the compilation of judgments by reading out the judgment in the case of Anil Kunj Bihari Saraf Vs. Namboodas, reported in 1996 SCC OnLine MP 112 and submitted that in view of the judgments relied upon by the petitioner, the Commercial Court Judge has committed an error in interpreting the word \"entertain\" by relying upon the judgment in the case of Anil Kunj Bihari (supra). Based upon the aforesaid argument, learned counsel Mr. Thakore submitted that as per the language of Section 9(1) of the Act, when an application for interim measure can be filed at any point of time, once if such an application is filed, the Court will have to determine whether remedy available before the Arbitral Tribunal is efficacious remedy, then, it must withdraw itself from deciding that application. In light of this, it will not make any difference whether the matter is heard for a week, 10 days or month because the word \"entertain\" would mean that it has to consider an application pending before him and yet not entertained it by adjudicating upon it. It was submitted that no one can go behind the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 mind of a Judge as the same is expressed by words which are translated into judgments and therefore, entertaining an application can be said only when a Judge delivers the judgment. Before a Judge delivers the judgment, the word \"entertain\" comes into play and therefore, first he has to take the decision whether he should decide or hold that this is a case where he finds that the remedy available before the Arbitral Tribunal is an efficacious remedy or not. A Judge can only travel further on merits of an application only in case if he decides that remedy under Section 17 of the Act is not an efficacious remedy. \n7.7 Since it was objected by the respondent that the present petition seeking a writ of certiorari is not maintainable as what is under challenge by way of this petition is an order passed by the subordinate Court and therefore, the draft amendment was forwarded. The same was taken on record. At that juncture, learned counsel Mr. Thakore conceded that insertion of word \"certiorari\" with some words relevant to it in the prayer clause was by mistake and therefore, to cure the said mistake, the amendment application was given. He submitted that certainly writ of certiorari cannot be prayed for in a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and looking to the cause title of the petition and considering the nature C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 of the prayer to call for the record and proceedings , the present petition is preferred only under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \n7.8 Learned counsel Mr. Thakore thereafter tried to meet with the objections raised by learned Senior Advocate Mr. Sibal against the amendment in prayer clause by deleting the word \"certiorari\" and a portion related to that and submitted that the objections raised by the respondent instead of prayer of certiorari and amendment is of highly technical in nature. Learned counsel has placed reliance upon the judgment in the case of Ram Kishan Fauji Vs. State of Haryana, reported in (2017) 5 SCC 533 and relied upon Paragraphs 41 and 42.3, which read as under:-\n\"41. We have referred to these decisions only to highlight that it is beyond any shadow of doubt that the order of civil court can only be challenged under Article 227 of the Constitution and from such challenge, no intra-court appeal would lie and in other cases, it will depend upon the other factors as have been enumerated therein.\n42.3 A writ petition which assails the order of a civil court in the High Court has to be understood, in all circumstances, to be a challenge under Article 227 of the Constitution and determination by the High Court under the said Article and, hence, no intra-court appeal is entertainable.\" \nC/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 7.9 On the basis of the aforesaid observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the learned counsel submitted that even if Article 226 and certiorari is written in the Writ Petition, it can only be treated as Article 227 petition. Mr. Thakore further relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Radhe Shyam & Anr. Vs. Chhabi Nath & Ors., reported in (2015) 5 SCC 423 and submitted that considering the fact that what is challenged by way of the present petition is an order passed by the Subordinate Court and therefore, considering the ratio laid down in the judgment in the case of Radhe Shyam (supra), it is amply clear that the present petition is preferred only under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and writ of certiorari was erroneously prayed for and this Court can certainly treat the present petition as a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India even without amendment and therefore, the amendment sought for by the petitioner is required to be allowed. It is submitted that the word \"certiorari\" is surplus word which can deny the remedy to the petitioner and therefore, the Court may consider the considering the scope of a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Learned counsel Mr. Thakore in support of the aforesaid contention also referred to and relied C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 upon the judgment in the case of Shalini Shyam Shetty & Anr. Vs. Rajendra Shankar Patil, reported in (2010) 8 SCC 329. Based upon the aforesaid judgment, learned counsel submitted that the present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is maintainable. He submitted that the Commercial Court has committed two patent perversities (i) by classifying the pending application in two sub- application, the Tribunal is constituted, and (b) after the matter is heard, but before the judgment is pronounced, the Tribunal is constituted; as in both the scenario, the matter remains pending and therefore, such classification can be said to be a patent perversity, and (ii) relying upon the Order 22 Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which refers to a Suit being not abetting after it is kept for judgment, which according to Mr. Thakore, was a patent perversity on the face of the order impugned and therefore, the impugned order is bad in law. Learned counsel then relied upon Paragraph 14 of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Waryam Singh & Anr. Vs. Amarnath & Anr., reported in AIR 1954 SC 215 and submitted that in the instant case also, the Commercial Court has not acted within it's bound or it's authority and therefore, this is a fit case for exercising the powers of superintendence conferred to the High Courts C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \n7.10 Learned counsel also relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ajay Singh & Anr. Vs. State of Chattisgarh & Anr. reported in (2017) 3 SCC 330 and more particularly, the observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Paragraph 24 and contended that the High Court can interfere under Article 227 of the Constitution of India in case of erroneous assumption or acting beyond its jurisdiction, refusal to exercise jurisdiction, error of law apparent on record as distinguished from a mere mistake of law, arbitrary or capricious exercise of authority or discretion, a patent error in procedure, arriving at a finding which is perverse or based on no material or resulting in manifest injustice and submitted that the present case is a fit case to exercise the powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.\n7.11 Learned counsel Mr. Thakore thereafter took us to the concept of two models relating to involvement of Court in respect of interim relief which is as per the prevailing international practice. According to Mr. Thakore, one model is called free choice model or Court subsidiarity much less emphasized on the parties ability to approach any forum i.e. Court or Arbitral Tribunal for grant of interim relief. Second model is Court subsidiarity model C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 which gives privacy to the Arbitral Tribunal over the Courts. According to learned counsel today, the party autonomy has been held to be brooding and guiding spirit of arbitration. The same being corner stone of 1996 Act, the true interpretation of Section 9(3) of the Act would necessarily mean that once the Tribunal has been constituted, the Court should not continue to adjudicate unless the Court finds that the circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious. According to Mr. Thakore, the amendment to Section 9 of the Act denotes the shift in thinking from free choice model to the Court subsidiarity model. The learned counsel thereafter took us to the relevant Sections and provisions of the England, Singapore, USA, Hong Kong and South Africa and submitted that international practice of \"Court-Subsidiarity\"\nsupports the interpretation of the petitioner that once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the Court must defer to proceed further unless the Court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious. Such an interpretation is consistent with the principle of party autonomy and least interference to the Arbitral Tribunal which is the body chosen by the parties to resolve their disputes. On the premises of the aforesaid, the learned counsel submitted that the impugned order dated 16.7.2021 passed by the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Commercial Court, Surat is contrary to the settled principles of law and is contrary to the provisions of Section 9(3) of the Act. If such an order is allowed to continue, it will lead to a situation of parallel proceeding and will render the provisions of Section 9(3) of the Act redundant and hence, the same is required to be quashed and set aside.\n8. Per contra, Shri Kapil Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for respondent submitted that the very application preferred by the petitioner before the Commercial Court is preferred with a view to defeat the urgent interim orders that the present respondent is seeking from the Commercial Court. It is submitted that by way of interim application preferred by the respondent before the Commercial Court at Surat what is sought to be demanded was in respect of previous amount owed to the respondent to the tune of Rs.800 crores. From January onward, the petitioner is not even paid the minimum amount as guaranteed. The respondent is required to pay the amount to the Bank. Shri Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent submitted that if an application under Section 9 is preferred prior to appointment of Arbitral Tribunal, present petitioner would contend that his application for appointment of Arbitral Tribunal is pending and hence the Court may not decide the issue. Whereas now once the Arbitral C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Tribunal is constituted, the petitioner has come out with a case that in view of the fact that Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, Section 9(3) of the Act provides a bar to the Commercial Court or a learned Judge to decide the issue of interim relief. That shows that actually the present petitioner is interested more in delaying the proceedings rather than taking part in adjudication of the dispute. Shri Sibal, learned Senior Counsel submitted that the present petition preferred by the petitioner is premature in a way that in case if the Court comes to the conclusion that the remedy under Section 17 is an efficacious remedy, in that case, the present proceedings under Section 9(1) would end there and then itself and the proper course of action for the parties would be to approach the Arbitral Tribunal seeking interim protection. It is only in an eventuality that if the Commercial Court comes to the conclusion that remedy under Section 17 is inefficacious remedy then and then only such order can be challenged by the present petitioner. In the instant case, the petitioner by way of present petition has tried to see that even that order is not pronounced by the trial Court and therefore, unless the trial Court is granted an opportunity to apply it's mind and pronounce an order as to whether the remedy provided under Section 17 of the Act is an efficacious remedy or not, until such order is pronounced, present C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 petition ought not to have been entertained by the Court as the same would amount to entertaining premature petition and hence he submitted that the trial Court must be given an opportunity to disclose it's mind and to adjudicate the issue at least to the extent that whether remedy provided under Section 17 is an efficacious remedy or not. He further submitted that today a situation has arisen that once the petitioner has preferred an application before the Commercial Court seeking a relief to refer the dispute between the parties to the Arbitral Tribunal and that order is reserved and therefore, that application awaits adjudication. Once that application is awaiting adjudication and order is reserved, it is not open for the petitioner to say that the learned Commercial Court has passed an order without jurisdiction since there is no order, it cannot be said that the order is without jurisdiction. Same way reserving the order, cannot also be construed as lack of jurisdiction. Therefore, unless the trial Court finds that there is an urgency and passes any order, in that case, such order only can be said to be an order, which can be challenged before this Court and in such eventuality only, the petitioner can file an appeal or appropriate application and say that order is erroneous or without jurisdiction but as on today, it is not open for the petitioner to contend that the order of the trial Court is C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 without jurisdiction.\n8.1. By referring to the impugned order, Shri Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent further submitted that in the instant case learned Commercial Judge has already admitted the matter for consideration and hearing is concluded, the only formality that remains is to pronounce the judgment and therefore, at this juncture, nothing further remains to be entertained. Once the final hearing of the matter is concluded, merit is considered and the matter is reserved for judgment, the application can be said to have been already entertained and hearing is concluded and hence word entertain cannot be interpreted in such a way to undo what is already done and hence learned Senior Counsel submitted that bar of Section 9(3) of the Act would not apply even when the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, once the judgment is reserved by the Court under Section 9.\n8.2. He further submitted that the matter was reserved for judgment on 20.7.2021 and the application of the petitioner dated 16.7.2021 was dismissed. The learned Judge on that application by giving reasons passed order saying that he will not refer the dispute to the Tribunal under Section 9. Such order cannot be said to be an order lacking jurisdiction vested in a Judge or can be said to be perverse because C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 he is yet to decide Section 9 application in light of the fact that now Tribunal is constituted. It was further submitted that Section 9(1) provides that a party may approach the Court at any stage before or during the arbitration proceedings or even after arbitration proceedings but before award is enforced under Section 36 and hence a bare reading of provision of Section 9 would suggest that word 'during' is not taken away from Section 9. If argument of the petitioner is believed, in that case, it would amount to oust the jurisdiction of Civil Court, whereas language of Section 9 does not suggest so. On the contrary, Section 9(1) provides that a party may make an application before or during the arbitral proceedings or even after the arbitration proceedings but before the award is enforced under Section 36. Whereas Section 9(2) gives an idea as to relief of which nature can be prayed for an application under Section 9. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent further submitted that hypothetical situation by showing that suppose if a party prefers an application for release of goods and nature of good is perishable goods. If such application is preferred even after constitution of Arbitral Tribunal then considering the nature of goods which is of perishable nature can trial Court say that though the applicant needs interim protection, the Court would first decide C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 as to whether the remedy for interim measures under Section 17 before the Arbitral Tribunal is an efficacious remedy or not and then only after pronouncing the order on efficacious remedy, would decide the issue on merits. Even if Section 9(3) of the Act is taken into account then also overall circumstances are required to be taken into consideration and the trial Court is required to pass an order bearing in mind efficacy of remedy. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent further contended that the application preferred by the present respondent under Section 9(1) for interim measures is in respect of charges to be paid by the present petitioner for using its Jetty. Now, since the petitioner has stopped paying money, the respondent needs money, whereas, the petitioner has stopped paying money for every ships that comes in. According to Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent even if the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted but a man is under debt, he cannot wait till he is declared insolvent. When the petitioner has stopped paying money to the present respondent, the urgency is required to be seen and therefore, considering the fact that present respondent has preferred application for interim measures as he wants urgent money, the Commercial Court should be permitted to pronounce the order which is kept reserved. How the other side can say that present respondent C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 does not require any protection. According Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent the entire genesis of Section 9 revolves around urgency and protection. The urgency would also cover efficacy of remedy provided under Section 17 but to determine that, the matter is required to be decided and therefore, also it was insisted upon that the Court must permit the trial Judge to pronounce the order. It was submitted that since the respondent owed an amount of more than Rs.800 crores as a dire urgency though the petitioners have continued to use Jetty facilities which the respondent is providing, the petitioner is not paying for the same and hence there cannot be a better urgency then the urgency which the respondent has. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that today the order does not exist and therefore, it would not lie in the mouth of the petitioner to say that order is without jurisdiction. Suppose, if the learned trial Court dismisses the application, then in that case, can it be said that he has jurisdiction to dismiss the application or it is only in case if the trial court pronounces the order, it can be contended that the order is without jurisdiction. Reserving the order for pronouncement, cannot be said to be an order without jurisdiction. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent took the contention in respect of prayer of writ of certiorari in C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 this petition. Elaborate arguments in respect of whether writ of certiorari can be prayed or not, were made. \n8.3. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent further contended that considering the fact that both the parties have preferred separate applications under Section 9, before the Commercial Court seeking interim protection and hence there should be two separate applications pointing out bar under Section 9(3) of the Act. In the instant case, the present petitioner has preferred only one application and that too in his own application for interim measures stating that the now his application is not required to be decided in view of the fact that Arbitral Tribunal is constituted but at no point of time present petitioner has preferred any such application in the application preferred by the present respondent before the Commercial Court in Section 9 proceedings seeking interim measures and therefore, it can be said that the present petition preferred by the petitioner is an appeal in his own application. In case, if an application or appeal is preferred, the ground must be established on the basis of statute. The contention of the petitioner that a Judge must examine first and determine as to whether circumstances exist for a Judge to pass an order under Section 9(3), in that case, along with C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 that the Judge is required also to decide Section 9 application because entire Section 9 application is preferred on the basis of urgency for seeking interim measures. Merely on the ground that a Judge must decide as to remedy under Section 17 is an efficacious remedy or not, it cannot be said that a Judge should first decide the aspect of efficacy of remedy under Section 17 considering the fact that Section 9 application itself is preferred on the basis of urgency to seek interim measures and considering the fact that in absence of there being any specific provision under Section 9(3) which may mandate a Judge to decide the issue of efficacy of remedy under Section 17. A Judge is required to determine and decide both the issues of efficacy of remedy under Section 17 and urgency together and therefore, if the Commercial Court is permitted to pronounce the judgment, which is kept reserved since 7.6.2021, permitting him to pronounce the order would be in consonance with the scheme of the Act and more particularly, as per Section 9. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent then took us to prayer clause of the application preferred by the petitioner before the Commercial Court and drew attention of the Court that the prayer sought for by the petitioner before the Commercial Court is to refer the dispute to the Arbitral Tribunal. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that under Section 9 application, the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Court does not have any power either to transfer the dispute to Arbitral Tribunal or to refer it to the Arbitral Tribunal. Looking to the prayer made in the original application before the Commercial Court, argument advanced by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner itself would be self contradictory. The Commercial Court has yet to decide whether there is any urgency or not, the contentions of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner are more based on assumption than reality as in case there was no urgency, the trial Court also has an option to dismiss the application, but the trial court has heard both the applications together for 16 days and that itself shows that there is an element of urgency. \n8.4. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent further submitted by reiterating that present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India would also not lie, as today there is no order and whatever he has challenged cannot be said to be without jurisdiction. The right of a Judge to dismiss an application cannot be said to be without jurisdiction, more particularly, looking to the prayers made in the application to refer all the matters to the Arbitral Tribunal. The order either can be correct order or erroneous order but fact remains that as per the scheme of the Act, the learned Judge has no power to transfer C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 or refer the matter and therefore, resultant effect of the order is such that the learned trial Judge has refused to refer the matter to the Arbitral Tribunal. The same way order of the trial Court of reserving the matter for pronouncement of order also cannot be said to be without jurisdiction. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that by way of present amendment in the prayer clause now the present petitioner is trying to cure the defect and to expand the scope of the prayer. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent further submitted that the learned trial Judge was right in considering three scenario, which may occur in a given case. (1) Section 9 application is filed after constitution of Tribunal (2) Pending hearing of Section 9 application, Tribunal is constituted and (3) after the matter is heard but before judgment is pronounced, the Tribunal is constituted. In first and second scenario, considering provisions of Section 9(3) it can be safely presumed that once the Tribunal is constituted Court must not entertain Section 9 application of parties. However, looking to the language of Section 9(3) in 3rd scenario jurisdiction of Civil Court is not ousted in entertaining such application and therefore, the learned trial Court has passed the order bearing in mind the scheme of the Act. Even the order that the trial Court may pass is appealable C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 order under Section 37 of the Act and even in appeal under Section 37, this very issue will be argued but at that juncture there will be reason for passing an order on hand. Today as the situation has occurred that the petitioner is trying to ensure that the Tribunal may not be allowed to give reasons but still the order must be set aside. Such an attempt may not be permitted as unless Court comes to know as to whether there exist any special circumstances or inefficacious and unless such issue is decided, the matter cannot be referred to Tribunal or party may approach the Tribunal. If argument of the petitioner is believed, in that case, it will take a long time. The Court has consumed time in hearing the parties for 16 hearings. If the application for interim measures is not decided, in that case, the respondent may be bankrupt and may be tried under Insolvency of Bank Code and therefore, also learned counsel insisted for dismissal of the petition by allowing trial Judge to permit him to pronounce the order. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent then submitted that every application under Section 9 once filed and if the interpretation of the same, as per the petitioner is believed, in that case, such application will take a long time to be decided and by that time urgency will be lost. As in such a scenario, moment any application under C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Section 9 is filed, a party would say that Tribunal is not yet constituted, though provision of arbitration is there and may seek adjournment. Thereafter, after sometime, if Arbitral Tribunal is constituted and yet if such an application is preferred or is already pending, a party may take a stand that, now in view of the fact that Arbitral Tribunal is constituted and in view of Section 9(3) of the Act, allow the Tribunal to consider prayer for interim measures under Section 17. This would only prolong the proceedings and purpose behind granting or considering application for interim measures would be frustrated. Therefore, under such circumstances, what is expected from the Court is to act in aid of Arbitrator usually but that does not mean that aspect of urgency and efficacy of remedy under Section 17 is overlooked. A Judge is expected to decide the application under Section 9 considering the urgency of the party seeking interim measures and may come to a conclusion that there is an urgency or that remedy under Section 17 is an efficacious remedy but any order that a Judge may pass, cannot be said to be without jurisdiction. Further, once such an application is decided then that order is also an appealable order and therefore, rule of aid of the Arbitrator would be not to start the parallel proceedings under Section 227 of the Constitution of India so that on one can go to C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 the Hon'ble Supreme Court and everything gets settled. Arbitration Act is complete code in itself and therefore, Court must act in aid of Arbitration Act. The proper way to act in aid of Arbitration Act would be to prefer an appeal under Section 37 and not to prefer petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \n8.5. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent further submitted that filing petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India against an order passed by the Commercial Court and thereafter to carry the order that may be passed in a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India would reach upto the Hon'ble Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. If this happens in every arbitral proceedings and in respect of every Section 9 applications, that itself would frustrate the very purpose of Scheme of the Act and therefore, on the basis of the aforesaid submission, it was submitted that the Commercial Court may be permitted to pronounce the judgment and if the petitioner feeling aggrieved by the same, it would not render him remediless and there is still remedy of challenging the aforesaid order under Section 37 of the Act and in that appeal, the petitioner can take all the contentions that the petitioner may chose to and therefore, the present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 on a premise that the order that the Commercial Court may pass on an application under Section 9 after constitution of Arbitral Tribunal would be without jurisdiction, is without any basis and on the premise of misinterpretation of provision of law. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent further submitted that here it is more a case of petitioner's reluctance to avail remedy available under Section 37, may be because the petitioner does not want the learned Judge of Commercial Court to pass an order but wording of Section 9(3) it is not even remotely indicated that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court is ousted. In fact, Section 5 of the Arbitration Act which reads thus:\n\"Section 5: Extent of judicial intervention: Notwithstanding anything contained in nay other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this Part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part.\" \nIt was submitted that non-obstante clause in the language of Section 5 is provided to uphold the intention of the Legislature as provided in the Preamble to adopt UNCITRAL Model of Law and Rules, to reduce excessive judicial interference which is not contemplated under the Arbitration Act. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent then relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhaven Construction Through Authorized Signatory C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Premjibhai K Shah vs. Executive Engineer Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd and Another reported in 2021 SCC Online SC 8 and submitted that in the said case a sole arbitrator was appointed and application was filed disputing the jurisdiction of sole Arbitrator, petition under Article 227 was filed challenging the jurisdiction of sole Arbitrator and sole Arbitrator was appointed by the Court and question arose as to whether such a petition would lie or not, whether appointment of sole Arbitrator can be challenged under Article 227 of the Constitution of India or not and there, in para 11 to 22, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed thus: \n\"11. We need to note that the Arbitration Act is a code in itself. This phrase is not merely perfunctory, but has definite legal consequences. One such consequence is spelled out under Section 5 of the Arbitration Act, which reads as under \"Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this Part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part.\" The non-obstante clause is provided to uphold the intention of the legislature as provided in the Preamble to adopt UNCITRAL Model Law and Rules, to reduce excessive judicial interference which is not contemplated under the Arbitration Act. \n12. The Arbitration Act itself gives various procedures and forums to challenge the appointment of an arbitrator. The framework clearly portrays an intention to C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 address most of the issues within the ambit of the Act itself, without there being scope for any extra statutory mechanism to provide just and fair solutions. \n13. Any party can enter into an arbitration agreement for resolving any disputes capable of being arbitrable. Parties, while entering into such agreements, need to fulfill the basic ingredients provided under Section 7 of the Arbitration Act. Arbitration being a creature of contract, gives a flexible framework for the parties to agree for their own procedure with minimalistic stipulations under the Arbitration Act. \n14. If parties fail to refer a matter to arbitration or to appoint an arbitrator in accordance with the procedure agreed by them, then a party can take recourse for court assistance under Section 8 or 11 of the Arbitration Act. \n15. In this context, we may state that the Appellant acted in accordance with the procedure laid down under the agreement to unilaterally appoint a sole arbitrator, without Respondent No. 1 mounting a judicial challenge at that stage. Respondent No. 1 then appeared before the sole arbitrator and challenged the jurisdiction of the sole arbitrator, in terms of Section 16(2) of the Arbitration Act. \n16. Thereafter, Respondent No. 1 chose to impugn the order passed by the arbitrator under Section 16(2) of the Arbitration Act through a petition under Article 226/227 of the Indian Constitution. In the usual course, the Arbitration Act provides for a C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 mechanism of challenge under Section 34. The opening phase of Section 34 reads as 'Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3)'. The use of term 'only' as occurring under the provision serves two purposes of making the enactment a complete code and lay down the procedure. \n17. In any case, the hierarchy in our legal framework, mandates that a legislative enactment cannot curtail a Constitutional right. In Nivedita Sharma v. Cellular Operators Association of India, (2011) 14 SCC 337, this Court referred to several judgments and held:\n\"11. We have considered the respective arguments/submissions. There cannot be any dispute that the power of the High Courts to issue directions, orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, certiorari, mandamus, quo warranto and prohibition under Article 226 of the Constitution is a basic feature of the Constitution and cannot be curtailed by parliamentary legislation - L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261. However, it is one thing to say that in exercise of the power vested in it under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court can entertain a writ petition against any order passed by or action taken by the State and/or its agency/ instrumentality or any public authority or order passed by a quasi- judicial body/authority, and it is an altogether different thing to say that each and every petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 must be entertained by the High Court as a matter of course ignoring the fact that the aggrieved person has an effective alternative remedy. Rather, it is settled law that when a statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievances, a writ petition should not be entertained ignoring the statutory dispensation. \n(emphasis supplied) \n18. It is therefore, prudent for a Judge to not exercise discretion to allow judicial interference beyond the procedure established under the enactment. This power needs to be exercised in exceptional rarity, wherein one party is left remediless under the statute or a clear 'bad faith' shown by one of the parties. This high standard set by this Court is in terms of the legislative intention to make the arbitration fair and efficient. \n19. In this context we may observe M/s. Deep Industries Limited v. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, (2019) SCC Online SC 1602, wherein interplay of Section 5of the Arbitration Act and Article 227of the Constitution was analyzed as under:\n\"15. Most significant of all is the non- obstante clause contained in Section 5 which states that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, in matters that arise under Part I of the Arbitration Act, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part. Section 37 grants a constricted right of first appeal against certain judgments and orders and no others. \nC/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Further, the statutory mandate also provides for one bite at the cherry, and interdicts a second appeal being filed (See Section 37(2)of the Act)\n16. This being the case, there is no doubt whatsoever that if petitions were to be filed under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution against orders passed in appeals under Section 37, the entire arbitral process would be derailed and would not come to fruition for many years. At the same time, we cannot forget that Article 227 is a constitutional provision which remains untouched by the non-obstante clause of Section 5 of the Act. In these circumstances, what is important to note is that though petitions can be filed under Article 227 against judgments allowing or dismissing first appeals under Section 37 of the Act, yet the High Court would be extremely circumspect in interfering with the same, taking into account the statutory policy as adumbrated by us herein above so that interference is restricted to orders that are passed which are patently lacking in inherent jurisdiction.\" \nhas not been able to show exceptional circumstance or 'bad faith' on the part of the Appellant, to invoke the remedy under Article 227 of the Constitution. No doubt the ambit of Article 227 is broad and pervasive, however, the High Court should not have used its inherent power to interject the arbitral process at this stage. It is brought to our notice that subsequent to the impugned order of the sole arbitrator, a final award was rendered by him on merits, which is challenged by C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 the Respondent No. 1 in a separate Section 34 application, which is pending. \n21. Viewed from a different perspective, the arbitral process is strictly conditioned upon time limitation and modeled on the 'principle of unbreakability'. This Court in P. Radha Bai v. P. Ashok Kumar, (2019) 13 SCC 445, observed:\n36.3. Third, Section 34(3) reflects the principle of unbreakability. Dr Peter Binder in International Commercial Arbitration and Conciliation in UNCITRAL Model Law Jurisdictions, 2nd Edn., observed:\n\"An application for setting aside an award can only be made during the three months following the date on which the party making the application has received the award. Only if a party has made a request for correction or interpretation of the award under Article 33 does the time-limit of three months begin after the tribunal has disposed of the request. This exception from the three-month time- limit was subject to criticism in the working group due to fears that it could be used as a delaying tactics. However, although \"an unbreakable time- limit for applications for setting aside\" was sought as being desirable for the sake of \"certainty and expediency\" the prevailing view was that the words ought to be retained \"since they presented the reasonable consequence of Article 33\". \nAccording to this \"unbreakability\" of C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 time-limit and true to the \"certainty and expediency\" of the arbitral awards, any grounds for setting aside the award that emerge after the three-month time- limit has expired cannot be raised. \n37. Extending Section 17 of the Limitation Act would go contrary to the principle of \"unbreakability\" enshrined under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. \n(emphasis supplied)\n22. If the Courts are allowed to interfere with the arbitral process beyond the ambit of the enactment, then the efficiency of the process will be diminished.\"\nCiting the above referred paragraphs, Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent then submitted that after making the aforesaid observation, the Hon'ble Supreme Court opined that the High Court erred in utilizing its discretionary powers available under Articles 226 & 227 of the Constitution of India and allowed the appeal and impugned order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court was quashed and set aside and the Hon'ble Supreme Court granted liberty to the respondent no.1 to raise legally permissible objections regarding jurisdiction in pending Section 34 proceedings. By relying upon the aforesaid judgment, Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 submitted that present petition also deserves to be dismissed at the threshold as the petitioner has failed to show bad faith or exceptional circumstances as stated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the paragraphs referred herein above. It is complete abuse and misuse of process of law and the petitioner should rather avail remedy of preferring an appeal under Section 37 once the Judge of the Commercial Court passes an order, in case if he is desirous to challenge the same. It was contended that in case if the application preferred by the present respondent is dismissed, in that case, the matter ends and therefore, present petition is nothing but a tool to consume time and in that event the trial Court must be directed to pronounce the order as whole time consumed in this petition and any further proceedings in continuation of this proceedings would amount to wastage of precious time of judicial process.\n8.6 Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent then dealt with aspect of Section 9(1) to 9 (3) to counter the argument of Mr. Mihir Thakore, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner. It was submitted that stage of application 9(3) has not yet arisen. The learned Judge of Commercial Court is aware about provisions of Section 9 and he will pass the order in accordance with scheme of the Act since the present petition is a premature as occasion C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 for learned Judge of Commercial Court has not arisen to pass any order and there should not be any challenge against the pronouncement of such order by seeking direction to mandate the Trial Court not to pronounce the order. \n8.7. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent then distinguished the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Tufan Chatterjee (supra) and after taking us to the facts of the case elaborately, it was submitted that not only on facts but on law also judgment in case of Tufan Chetterjee (supra) would not apply in the facts of the present case as the aforesaid judgment is in respect of position prevailing prior to amendment of the Act and the application under Section 9 was moved prior to amendment. In the case of Tufan Chatterjee (supra) ,application for interim relief under Section 9 was moved in the Court in August 2015 whereas the amendment took place w.e.f. 23.10.2015. While application was pending, arbitral proceedings commenced under 1996 Act, an Arbitral Tribunal was constituted. The moot question before the Court in that case was whether the amendment Act would denude the Court of power to grant interim relief to the applicant under section 9. The proceedings which has commenced before amendment of the Act or not and whether such amendment would automatically stay the proceedings before the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Arbitral Tribunal and therefore law laid down in the case of TufanChatterjee (supra) by the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court would not apply in the facts of the present case. While making the aforesaid submission, Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent drew attention of this Court to para 12 of the said judgment, which reads thus:\n\"12.The short question in this appeal is whether the Court has been denuded of power to grant interim relief to the appellant under Section 9 of the Act, from the date on which the Amendment Act of 2015 came into force, since an Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted and arbitral proceedings have commenced.\" \n8.8 Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that if the argument of Mr. Mihir Thakore, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner is accepted, that once Arbitral Tribunal is appointed the Court losses its jurisdiction but in the case of Tufan Chatterjee (supra) the challenge was also against the order passed by the Court dated 5.1.2016 passed by the Civil Court under application under Section 9 of the Act and the appeal was dismissed, that itself would suggest that said judgment would not help the petitioner as the order passed by the Civil Court was upheld. The judgment of Tufan Chatterjee(supra), according to, Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 does not deal with post amendment proposition. In fact, according to Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent, the said judgment says that once prior protection is given by the Court, the same does not require any interference even if the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted thereafter. The party may approach the Tribunal and till Tribunal decides the issue of interim order, the prior protection granted would remain operative. Thereafter, Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent tried to distinguish the judgment in case of Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra). It was submitted by Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent that the aforesaid judgment has no relevance if read from the context of the facts of the present case. It was submitted that in case of Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra) the Tribunal was not functional and considering that fact into consideration, judgment was delivered, which is not the fact in the present case and therefore, reliance placed by the petitioner on the aforesaid judgment is misplaced. It was submitted by Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent that in case of Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra) since Tribunal was not functional the remedy under Section 17 was held to be inefficacious and therefore, an application under Section 9 was entertained. The proposition in the present case is absolutely opposite. In case of Manbhupinder Singh Atwal C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 (supra), the application under Section 17 was pending but because of non availability of Arbitrator, Arbitral Tribunal had become non functional and therefore, remedy under Section 9 was exhausted and entertained. In the instant case, application under Section 9 is already pending and hearing is concluded. It is nobodies case that remedy under Section 17 would be inefficacious and therefore, also in view of the fact that the judgment in case of Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra) deals with entirely on different scenario, the same is not applicable to the facts of the present case. Thereafter, Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent took us to the judgment of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in the case of Benara Bearings & Pistons Ltd vs Mahel Engine Components India Private Limited reported in 2017 SCC Online Del 7226 and submitted that looking to the controversy in question and considering the facts of the present case, this judgment is the only judgment which would render some assistance in determining the issue on hand as the said judgment takes care of a situation which arose post amendment Act. Para 24 of the said judgment reads thus:\n\"24.It was contended on behalf of the appellant that as the petition under Section 9 was filed on 27.04.2016 and the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted on 28.07.2016, the learned Single Judge ought C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 not to have delivered the judgment dated 26.08.2016. According to the learned counsel for the appellant, when the Arbitral Tribunal had been constituted, that is, on 28.07.2016, this Court had already taken up the petition under Section 9 and on 29.04.2016 had passed an interim order in favour of the appellant. It was contended that because of the provisions of Section 9(3), once the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted on 28.07.2016, the Court ought to have relegated the parties to seek their remedy before the Arbitral Tribunal but with the injunction order of 29.04.2016 intact! There was a great deal of debate as to what has meant by the word entertain as used in Section 9(3). On the one hand, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the said word meant not only entertainment of application at the threshold but the continuation of the application. On the other hand, it was contended on behalf of the respondent that the word entertainment only referred to the consideration of the application at the threshold. It was also contended on behalf of the respondent that as there was no arbitration agreement between the parties because of the fact that there was no binding contract, the provisions of Section 9 would not come into play at all. It was further contended that an appeal is a continuation of the original proceedings and, therefore, the submission that the application under Section 9 could not be entertained by the Single Judge would also apply to this appeal and would, therefore, be a self-defeating argument on behalf of the appellant. The provisions of Section 4 of the said Act were also relied upon to submit that the fact that the appellant participated and continued to participate in the Section 9 proceedings before the learned Single Judge amounted to a waiver, in any event. We are of the view that Section 9(3) does not operate as an C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 ouster clause insofar as the courts powers are concerned. It is a well- known principle that whenever the Legislature intents an ouster, it makes it clear. We may also note that if the argument of the appellant were to be accepted that the moment an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the Court which is seized of a Section 9 application, becomes coram non judice, would create a serious vacuum as there is no provision for dealing with pending matters. All the powers of the Court to grant interim measures before, during the arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but prior to its enforcement in accordance with Section 36 are intact (and, have not been altered by the amendment) as contained in Section 9(1) of the said Act. \nFurthermore, it is not as if upon the very fact that an Arbitral Tribunal had been constituted, the Court cannot deal with an application under sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the said Act. Section 9(3) itself provides that the Court can entertain an application under Section 9(1) if it finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious.\" \nMr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that it was the respondent who preferred an application for interim measures to get protective order. The said application was objected and contested by the petitioner and it took 16 hearings for the Court to adjudicate the issue. Ultimately, the learned Judge has reserved the order after 16 effective hearings and thereafter now the petitioner has come up with a case that there is an efficacious C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 remedy under Section 17 of the Act as the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted. If such circumstance is permitted to continue, in that case, it may take six more months before the Arbitral Tribunal to adjudicate the issue in respect of interim measures. For all these times, urgency would remain; the respondent is facing financial crunch and liquidity problem. The first hearing before the Arbitral Tribunal after pleadings are over is scheduled in the year 2022. Under the circumstances, when an application for interim measures is fully heard before the Commercial Court and only order is reserved, the same must be given precedent and learned Judge of the Commercial Court must be permitted to pronounce the order. \n8.9. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent then relied upon the judgment in case of Energo Engineering Projects Ltd vs. TRF Limited reported in 2016 SCC Online Del 6560 and pointed out that in case of Energo Engineering Projects Limited (supra) the facts were such that the learned Single Judge directed the application under Section 9 of the Act filed by the respondent to be treated as application under Section 17 of the 1996 Act and issue direction that the same may be heard by the Arbitral Tribunal as and when such Tribunal commenced first meeting. After narrating the subject matter, learned Senior Counsel drew our C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 attention to the observations made by the Court in para 30 of the judgment, which reads thus:\n\"30. In our view, the learned Single Bench patently erred in holding \"there is no impediment or situation where the remedy under Section 17 of the Act is not efficacious\". The Learned Single Bench failed to appreciate that the pendency of a Special Leave Petition in which the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal was under challenge, was in itself, a circumstance which rendered the remedy of the parties under Section 17 uncertain and not efficacious.\" \nThe Division Bench of the Delhi High Court ultimately by observing as stated above, allowed the appeal and directed the Single Judge to hear and dispose of Section 9 application filed by the respondent in the said case. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that both the aforesaid judgments of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in case of Benara Bearings & Pistons Ltd (supra) and Energo Engineering Projects Ltd (supra) are in fact in favour of the present respondent and the same would not help the present petitioner. Thereafter, Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent distinguished the judgment cited by the learned Senior counsel Mr.Mihir Thakore in case of Ardee Infrastructures Private Limited (supra) and submitted that in that case, the question was with regard to whether prior to 2015 amendment where there was an automatic C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 stay, whether a direction of deposit of decreetal amount can be given and hence the judgment in case of Ardee Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd (supra) would also not be applicable to the facts of the present case.\n8.10.Mr . Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent thereafter submitted that judgment cited and relied upon by Mr.Thakore, learned counsel for the petitioner in respect of Article 227 of the Constitution of India setout parameters of the High Court in exercise of powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. This judgment cannot be applied to the Arbitration Act. The only judgment that can be applied to the arbitral proceedings or a matter relating to the arbitration is the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhaven Construction (supra) and that is the only law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court with respect to exercise of powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India in context of Arbitration Act. He further submitted that exercise of powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is not an alternative remedy, it is jurisdictional remedy. The statute provides for full-fledged appeal which is broader than petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. It was contended that appeal is on jurisdiction, is an appeal on facts, every aspects of the matter can be C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 agitated. It was contended that this Court be persuaded in Section 9(1) to 9(3) of the Act when the appeal is provided. Referring to the judgment of the Achutunanda Baidya (supra), more particularly para 10 thereof, it was contended that same does not apply to the case on hand. It was contended that para 10 relates to the High Court power of superintendence and such general parameters will not apply to the case on hand and not in context of Arbitration Act. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that reliance placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner in respect of Ajay Singh (supra) is not applicable in facts of the present case as the said case was in respect of criminal matter. \n8.11.Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent contended that reliance placed upon in case of Shalini Shyam Shetty(supra) and the proposition canvassed by the learned counsel for the petitioner is in context of Code of Civil Procedure and not in respect Arbitration Act. As far as proposition of law in case of Arbitration Act is concerned, the only applicable law is in respect of Bhaven Construction (supra). Thereafter, Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent made submissions in respect of interpretation of Section 9(3) of the Act and submitted that entertainment of the application must be after Tribunal has been constituted. If C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 that is the case then plain reading of Section is that once Arbitral Tribunal is constituted then the application must be filed before the Court which is not the case here. In the instant case, application under Section 9 was filed much before the constitution of Arbitral Tribunal and order is made reserved after hearing the parties much before the constitution of Arbitral Tribunal. The order was reserved on 7.6.2021 whereas the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted more than a month thereafter on 9.7.2021.In between also, the matter was posted for orders and this aspect according to Mr. Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent was one of the most significant aspect as before constitution of Arbitral Tribunal the matter was kept for orders and therefore, once Arbitral Tribunal was constituted on 9.7.2021 the Court would not entertain application under sub-section (1) of Section 9 after 9.7.2021 as the Tribunal was constituted on that day but as bar of Section 9(3) would come into play only from 9.7.2021 and not prior thereto. It was then submitted that language of Section 9(3) is looked into. Section 9(3) provides that \".....unless the Court finds that circumstances exist which may not render efficacious\". According to Mr. Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent language of Section 9(3) would suggest that if an application is filed under Section 9 after C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 9.7.2021 the date on which the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted then the Court will not entertain unless it finds that the proceedings under Section 17 is not efficacious and therefore, such provision can only apply to the situation on hand. In other words, if Section 9 application is filed after Arbitral Tribunal is constituted when the matter is before the Tribunal, Section 9 application will still lie, if the petitioner is able to show that Section 17 is not an efficacious remedy. According to Mr. Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent, argument of the petitioner is absolutely different and the say of the petitioner is that under Section 9, it is for the petitioner to show that Section 17 is not an efficacious remedy. In fact, according to Mr. Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent, it is for the Court to apply its mind and decide as to whether remedy provided under Section 17 can be said to be an efficacious remedy or not and therefore, Section 9(3) would not apply at all to the situation on hand. Further language of Section 9(1) also provides that at every stage date during or after arbitral proceedings but before its enforcement under Section 36, an application can be filed under Section 9 which also means that application under Section 9 can be filed even after Arbitral Tribunal is constituted and therefore, it is for the Court to come to a C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 conclusion that remedy provided under Section 17 is not efficacious remedy. According to Mr. Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent, therefore, in this context that the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in case of Benara Bearings & Pistons Ltd (supra) observed that provision of Section 9 does not prevent a party from arguing under Section 9 for getting order under Section 9, even if the Tribunal is being constituted as Section 9 has not an ouster clause. It does not oust the jurisdiction of the Civil Court. If the legislature had an intention to prescribe the jurisdiction, it would have said so, moment the Tribunal is constituted an application for interim measures shall not lie before the Court. Even language of Section 9(1) also suggests that application for interim measures can be filed at any stage as stated above and there is no prohibition for a Court to pass any order even after Arbitral Tribunal is constituted. It was contended that Section 9(3) does not have any pre-condition and therefore, judgments relied upon by Mr.Thakore, learned senior counsel for the petitioner are not applicable to the facts of the present case. It was contended by Mr. Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent that judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner in case of Kundan Lal (supra), Hindustan Commercial Bank Limited (supra) and Martin & Harris Ltd (supra) whereby C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 the word 'entertain' is interpreted in the context of facts of the respective cases and in context of language of the said statute and therefore, aforesaid interpretation of word 'entertain' is misplaced. Interpretation of word 'entertain' differs from context to context, situation to situation and varies from object of act and therefore, expression of word entertain must be understood in context of this statute. It would be misdirection in law in interpreting statute or word in a statute in the context of another statute in a different context. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent then took us to the language of Article 134 of the Constitution of India and submitted that expression 'entertain' and 'hearing' are two different expressions and therefore entertain, hearing and disposal are three separate and distinct and cannot be mixed with each other. Referring to Section 18 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Mr.Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that it depends upon the nature of proceedings and the nature of statutes, in which the word is used, the manner in which the word is used. It was submitted that while interpreting the particular word, the object and context of statute is required to be taken into consideration. Mr.Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent also relying upon the language of Order 41 Rule 4 and Order 41 Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 reiterated that the word 'entertain' is required to be interpreted, keeping in mind the object of the statute and the context in which word is used. \n8.12 Mr.Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that application pointing out bar of Section 9(3) was preferred by the present petitioner in his application under Section 9 and no separate application was preferred in respect of application under Section 9 of the Act preferred by the present respondent. It was contended that nature of reliefs claimed by both the parties in their separate applications under Section 9 are different and therefore, it is for the petitioner to prefer application pointing out bar of Section 9(3) and to approach Arbitral Tribunal for interim measures in respect of his own application but in absence of any application filed by the petitioner in Section 9 proceedings initiated by the present respondent, it is not open for the petitioner to ask to refer the dispute under Section 9 for interim measures to the Arbitral Tribunal. However, Mr.Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent did not dispute to the Law Commission Report and submitted that idea is that the Court should no longer interfere with the proceedings of arbitration and therefore, in fact such object would be achieved only in case if the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Commercial Court is permitted to pronounce the order and if aggrieved by the same, parties may take recourse of preferring an appeal under Section 37 of the Act. While summing up his submissions, Mr.Sibal, learned Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that the petitioner can always avail remedy provided under Section 37 of the Act rather than approaching this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India by filing present petition and more particularly, looking to the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Bhaven Construction (supra) i.e. only remedy available to the present petitioner and if this petition is entertained, it will open up Pandora's box and the flood gates of the litigation will open up which would defeat the basic purpose of Arbitration Act and prayed for dismissal of petition.\n9. Mr.Mihir Thakore, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner in rejoinder extensively referred to the written submission made by Mr.Gaurav Banerjee, learned senior counsel dated 3.8.2021. Mr. Thakore, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner even in rejoinder once again at length reiterated the submissions made by him at the time of his main arguments, more particularly, as regard interpretation of Sections 9(1), 9(2) and 9(3) of the Act and mainly emphasised upon principle of party C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 autonomy. In support of his contention, Mr.Thakore, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bharat Aluminium Company vs. Kaiser Aluminum Technical Services Inc reported in (2016) 4 SCC 126 and in case of PASL Wind Solutions Private Limited vs.GE Power Conversion India Private Limited reported in 2021 SCC Online SC 331. Mr. Thakore also referred to some of the judgments of the Foreign Courts citation of which are as under:\n1. Econet Wireless Ltd vs.Vee Networks Ltd reported in (2006) EWHC 1568 (Comm).\n2. Gerald Metals SA vs. The Trustees of the Timis Trust and others (2016) EWHC 2327.\n3. NCC International AB vs. Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd (2008) 2 SLR 565.\n4. Gary Born, International Commercial Arbitration, Volume II (Third Edition, 2021).\n5. Leviathan Shipping Co.Ltd vs.Sky Sailing Overseas Co. Ltd (1998) 4 HKC 347. \nUpon relying on those judgments, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner once again emphasised principle of party autonomy. The learned counsel submitted that once Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, role of Court becomes very limited and the Court is required and expected only to aid Arbitral Tribunal. Mr.Thakore, learned C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Senior counsel for the petitioner repeated and reiterated more or less what was argued at the time of advancing principal argument. Learned counsel in its rejoinder submitted that petitioner does not have any objection if the very pleadings which are there before the Commercial Court are put before Arbitral Tribunal without any new filing. Mr. Thakore, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner while reiterating the contention already taken in his submission as well as in rejoinder, further took this Court to the facts as narrated in the application filed by the parties under Section 9 before the Commercial Court at Surat and contended that these are not matter which cannot await for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide. Mr. Thakore, learned senior counsel for the petitioner further contended that as such prayers prayed for are made for money release and the same can be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal after two months. Mr. Thakore also submitted that it is not his submission that this Court may decide the issue, however he submitted that prayers prayed for are not of such urgent nature of demolition of building which cannot be determined by the Tribunal and Tribunal is not only constituted but it has specifically provided that either party may move the Tribunal under Section 17 and prayers prayed for more adequately be determined by the Arbitrator. It was also contended that as such C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 no fresh pleadings are required and Tribunal can fix it within 15 days or one month to determine the matter. Mr. Thakore, also contended that what is nature of urgency is to be tested and tried to highlight prayers from the point of view of urgency and paying debts and interest and as such according to Mr. Thakore, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner whole claim made by the respondent is for recovery of money. It was also contended that urgency cannot be pleaded for the purpose of keeping the matter before the Court and not going before the Arbitral Tribunal. Mr. Thakore, at the end also reiterated that contention as regard Article 227 of the Constitution of India as well as judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhaven Construction (supra) , more particularly referring to para 16 and 20 contended that remedy under Section 37 is against the order on merits and not on an issue whether it should be referred to Arbitral Tribunal or not. It was contended that once it is brought to the notice of the Court that Arbitral Tribunal is constituted by merely placing order of the High Court, in such event, the Court will have to application unless of-course it finds that it is urgent and relegate parties to Arbitral Tribunal. According to Mr. Thakore that is the intent of Section 9(3) of the Act. It was contended that Court cannot pass order on merits C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 unless it comes to the conclusion that it is required to be passed because it is so urgent. It was also reiterated that urgency cannot be there in financial matter of this nature. It was contended by Mr.Thakore that even if the orders passed on merits and appeal preferred under Section 37 before the High Court, the High Court may as well as at that stage duty bound to relegate the parties to arbitration. Mr. Thakore contended that even if order is passed and appeal is preferred under Section 37 of the Act before the High Court and Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the High Court would have to relegate the parties to arbitration unless ofcourse High Court feels that its is urgent. It is contended by Mr. Thakore that once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction and further referred to para 49 of the judgment of Shalini Shetty (supra) as well as judgment of Achunanan Vaidhya (supra) and Ajay Singh (supra) and contended that High Court can interfere and same would not amount to interfering with the arbitral process but it would be supporting the arbitral proceedings. \n10. Before dealing with the submissions made by both the sides, it would be appropriate to refer to the prayers as originally prayed for in this petition under Article 227 of the Constitution. \nC/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 The petitioner in para 39(b) has prayed as under- \"b. That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to call for the records and the proceedings in Commercial Civil Misc. Application No. 2 of 2021] and Commercial Civil Misc. Application No. 99 of 2021 and thereafter be pleased to issue a writ of certiorari, and quash and set aside the order in Annexure - B herein passed by the Learned Judge passed in Commercial Civil Misc. Application No. 2 of 2021 and allow the Interim Application filed by the Petitioner in AMNS' Section 9 Petition;\" \nDuring the course of argument, the respondent objected to the prayer and submitted that a writ of certiorari would not lie against the order passed by a civil court/competent court. Mr. Mihir Thakore, learned senior advocate appearing for the petitioner candidly submitted that a writ of certiorari would not lie. Draft amendment dated 02.08.2021 was tendered by the petitioner, which was taken on record, wherein it is prayed as under - \"b. That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to quash and set aside the Impugned Order dated 16 July 2021, passed by the Learned Judge below the Interim Application (Annexure-B) filed by the Petitioner herein of 2021 and allow the said Interim Application filed by the Petitioner in AMNS' Section 9 Petition.\" \nC/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 11. We are in total agreement with the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties that writ of certiorari would not lie against the order of Civil Court and therefore, no further elucidation on the said aspect is necessary. In fact, the learned counsel for the petitioner has also agreed that such a writ of certiorari would not lie and therefore, no further discussion on the prayer originally prayed for would be necessary. As far as amendment is concerned, it may be noted that in the title of the petition, it is clearly mentioned that it is a matter under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Considering the impugned order and the nature of controversy involved in this petition, ultimately, what is challenged in the present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution is the order dated 16.07.2021 passed by the Commercial Court, Surat, below interim application filed by the petitioner. Considering the judgments cited by both the sides, the petition under Article 227 of the Constitution would be maintainable and the prayer sought for in the draft amendment would not change the nature of the controversy and in opinion of this Court, therefore, the amendment deserves to be granted. The petitioner is permitted to amend the petition accordingly as prayed for in the draft amendment. The draft amendment to be carried out forthwith. \nC/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 12. In order to appreciate the contentions raised by both the sides, even at the cost of repetition, it would be appropriate to refer to some basic facts leading to the present controversy. The petitioner as well as respondent are party to the agreement dated 21.02.2011. Suffice it to note that as provided under Article 15 of the said agreement, the petitioner herein evoked arbitration clause and ultimately, the dispute has been referred to arbitration. The factual matrix indicate that the petitioner herein filed an application under Section 9 of the Act before the Commercial Court at Surat on 15.01.2021 and prayed for interim measures. Similarly, the respondent also filed an application under Section 9 of the Act on 15.03.2021 and also prayed for interim measures. As the facts indicate from the record, both the applications were extensively heard for about 16 effective hearings before the Commercial Court at Surat and the hearing was concluded on 07.06.2021. The learned Trial Court kept both the applications for orders. It is an admitted position that till the said date, i.e., till 07.06.2021, the Arbitral Tribunal was not constituted and the petition filed under Section 11(6) of the Act being IAAP No. 5 of 2021 was pending for adjudication before this Court. With consent of both the parties, IAAP No. 5 of 2021 came to be allowed and Arbitral Tribunal came to be constituted by this Court vide order C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 dated 09.07.2021. The record also indicates that though the Trial Court had kept the matter for orders on 07.06.2021, the same was not pronounced and meanwhile, Arbitral Tribunal came to be constituted by this Court vide order dated 09.07.2021 as aforesaid. The contention raised in this petition as well as the application filed before the Trial Court by the petitioner are required to be considered in light of these basic factual matrix. The record indicates that lastly, the Trial Court had kept both the applications under Section 9 for orders on 20.07.2021 and on 16.07.2021, the petitioner herein approached the trial court and filed the present application and inter alia prayed as under - \"a. Pass an order referring all disputes between the parties as mentioned in the AMNS Petition and EBTL Petition to the arbitral tribunal for adjudication.\" \nThe Trial Court heard both the sides and passed the impugned order dismissing the application. Both the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as learned counsel for the respondent have argued the matter extensively before this Court and have relied upon plethora of judgments which are referred to herein after. Considering the submissions made by both the sides, it is contended by the petitioner mainly as under - C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 1. That the petition is maintainable under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \n2. That the present petition is not premature or speculative. \n3. That the impugned order is in violation of Section 9(3) of the Act and overall construct of Arbitration Act. \n4. That the word 'entertain' occurring in Section 9(3) of the Act would preclude the Court from proceeding further with the application under Section 9 once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted and the Court is bound to refer the pending applications under Section 9 to the Arbitral Tribunal for its adjudication. \nAs against this, it is mainly pointed by the learned counsel for the respondent as under - 1. Whether the High Court can direct the Trial Court to not pronounce its judgment in applications filed by both parties under Section 09 of the Arbitration Act, in exercise of its powers under Article 227 of the Constitution? \n2. Whether the petitioner can maintain a petition under Article 227 when its remedy lies under Section 37 of the Arbitration C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Act? \n3. Whether the present Petition exceeds the jurisdiction of the Hon'ble Court under Article 227 of the Constitution where no case of exceptional circumstance or 'bad faith' is either alleged or demonstrated in the Petition? \n4. Whether the Petition is maintainable where the relief of a writ of certiorari is prayed for? \n5. Subject to the above, whether the Ld. Judge was right in holding that Section 9(3) is not triggered in the present facts Applications had already been admitted and heard and only the formality of pronouncement of orders remained? \n6. Whether the proper interpretation of Section 9 and Section 17 of the arbitration Act would require that the clock be set back on concluded judicial proceedings in light of the express legislative intent to enable the process to be \"more user friendly, cost effective and lead to expeditious disposal of cases\"? \n13. Before we revert to the main contentions and merits of the matter, we may consider the matter C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 from the angle which was canvassed by the learned counsel for the respondent that the present petition is not maintainable under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the main contention of the respondent was that today, there is no order. The learned Commercial Court has reserved the order and therefore, the occasion has not arisen for the Court to look into the order and consider whether he has acted beyond his jurisdiction or not and in support of this contention, it was contended by the respondent that relying upon the judgment of Bhaven Construction (supra) that arbitration act being a complete code in itself, it provides for an appeal under Section 37 of the Act. Provision of appeal is already there in Arbitration Act against any order which may be passed in an application under Section 9. Reliance has been placed upon the judgment in the case of Bhaven Construction (supra) by submitting that once the trial court passes any order, then only in case if it grants any relief under section 9, the said order is subject to further challenge under Section 37 of the Act and in case if the trial court comes to the conclusion that there is an efficacious remedy under section 17, in that case, the proper remedy would be to prefer an appropriate application before the arbitral tribunal. However, considering the peculiar facts of the case, we are not convinced with the aforesaid C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 submission made on behalf of the respondent. What is to be seen and adjudicated in this matter is the order passed by the trial court on an interim application filed by the petitioner seeking direction from the Court below to refer the pending interim applications to Arbitral Tribunal. The facts clearly reveal that the respective applications under section 9 were fully heard together, but order was reserved by the trial court and thereafter, when the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, whether the trial court should be permitted to pronounce the order or not or that the prayer prayed for by the petitioner to refer the pending applications to Arbitral Tribunal or not is the subject matter of the present petition. If any such application is made for limited purpose by the petitioner in that case, such petition is maintainable under Article 227 of the Constitution as the order under challenge is not an order passed either under section 9 of the Act or under Section 17 of the Act and this order, which is under challenge is passed in respect of whether the learned trial judge should be allowed to pass an order or not and therefore, this order is certainly not an order under section 9 of the Act, which can be challenged under section 37 of the Act. This order is not an order passed on an application for interim measures preferred by either party under section 9 and therefore, though it is an C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 undisputed fact that the Arbitration Act is complete code in itself, considering the nature of application dated 16.07.2021. We can safely hold that the order under challenge before us is merely an order passed by the trial court over which the High Court has supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution and therefore, such order is very much subject to challenge under Article 227 of the Constitution and would not be appealable under section 37 of the Act because today there is no order passed by the trial court either under section 9 granting or refusing interim relief to either of the party.\n14. However, we make it clear that the view expressed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Bhaven Construction (supra) is in respect of jurisdiction of Arbitral Tribunal whereas here the issue on hand is entirely different issue and therefore, though we are in complete agreement with the ratio laid down in the case of Bhaven Construction (supra), in facts of this case, the order under challenge is held to be an order passed by trial court and hence, we hold that the petition under Article 227 of the Constitution is maintainable. Even considering the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court as well as other Hon'ble High Courts relied upon by both the sides, the present petition under C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Article 227 is maintainable, detailed reference of which would not be necessary in view of the observations made hereinabove. \n15. The main question which arises for consideration of this Court is whether once Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, can a court entertain an application under Section 9(1) of the Act or not. Section 9 of the Act pre 2015 amendment reads as under - \"9. Interim measures, etc. by Court.--\nA party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36, apply to a court-- (i)for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely:\n-- \n(a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement;\n(b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration;\n(c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject- matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence;\n(d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver;\n(e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient, and the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it. \nAt this stage, it would be appropriate to note that Section 9(1) as it stands as on date, was originally section 9 in the 1996 Act. By Act 3 of 2016, with effect from 23.10.2015, sub- sections(2) and (3) came to be inserted. Post 2015 amendment, Section 9 of the Act reads as under - \"9. Interim measures, etc. by Court.--\n(1) A party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36, apply to a court-- (i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely:\n--\nC/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 (a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement;\n(b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration; \n(c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject- matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence;\n(d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver;\n(e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient, and the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it.\n(2) Where, before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, A court passes an order for any interim measure of protection under sub- section(1), the arbitral proceedings shall be commenced within a period of ninety days from the date of such order or within such further time as the Court may determine. \n(3) Once the arbitral tribunal has been constituted, the Court shall not entertain an application under sub-section(1), unless the Court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under section 17 efficacious. \nC/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Section 17 of the Act prior to 2015 amendment stood as under- \"17. Interim measures ordered by arbitral tribunal - \"(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a party, order a party to take any interim measure of protection as the arbitral tribunal may consider necessary in respect of the subject- matter of the dispute.\n(2) The arbitral tribunal may require a party to provide appropriate security in connection with a measure ordered under sub-section (1).\"\nBy 2015 amendment, Section 17 came to be amended. Further, by amending Act of 2019 being Act 33 of 2019, \"or at any time after making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36\" came to be omitted. Section 17 as it stands today, reads as under - \"17. Interim measures ordered by arbitral tribunal - (1) A party may, during the arbitral proceedings apply to the arbitral tribunal -\n(i)for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely - (a) The preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 matter of the arbitration agreement;\n(b) Securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration;\n(c) The detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken, or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence;\n(d) Interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver;\n             (e) Such    other    interim    measure                       or                  protection    as  may   appear   to                      the                  arbitral tribunal to be just                             and                  convenient,\nand the arbitral tribunal shall have the same power for making orders, as the court has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it.\n(2) Subject to any orders passed in an appeal under section 37, any order issued by the arbitral tribunal under this section shall be deemed to be an order of the Court for all purposes and shall be enforceable under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), in the same manner as if it were an order of the Court.\"\n16. Thus, from the bare reading of the aforesaid section 9, as mentioned hereinabove, before 2015 amendment, section 9 provided for interim measures etc., by the Court at three occasions, C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 before or during arbitral proceeding or at any time after making of the arbitral award, but before it is enforced in accordance with Section 36 of the Act. Before 2015 amendment, sub- section (3) of Section 9 was not in existence. Taking aid of the recommendations of the Law Commission, the same shows that sub-section (2) was recommended to be inserted to ensure timely initiation of arbitral proceedings by party who is granted interim measure of protection. Similarly, the Law Commission recommended sub- section (3) of section 9 as under :\n\"(3) Once the Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted, the Court shall, ordinarily, not entertain an Application under this provision unless circumstances exist owing to which the remedy under section 17 is not efficacious.\" \nWith the object to reduce the role of Court in relation to grant of interim measures, once the Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted, it is further provided that once the Tribunal is seized of the matter, it is most appropriate for the Tribunal to hear all interim applications. The recommendation of Law Commission further shows that such provision was recommended in spirit of UNCITRAL MODEL LAW as amended in 2006. The amendment in Section 17 of the Act also provides Arbitral Tribunal with the same powers as Court would have under Section 9 of the Act. At this juncture, it may be noted that the Parliament while inserting sub-section (3) of C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Section 9, instead of words 'ordinarily not entertained' has provided 'shall not entertain an application under sub-section (1)'. Referring to the impugned order at this stage, the learned trial court has given restricted meaning to word \"entertain\" occurring in sub- section(3) of section 9 in a narrow sense. The learned counsel for the petitioner has heavily relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in the case of Tufan Chatterjee (supra), judgment of this Court in Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra) and judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in Nehru Nagar Vijay Lenyadri(supra) to buttress his argument. Whereas the learned counsel appearing for the respondent has relied upon the judgment in the case of Benara Bearings & Pistons Ltd. (supra) of the Delhi High Court. \n17. The question therefore which deserves consideration by this Court at this stage is interpretation of section 9 as a whole in facts arising in the case on hand. As said earlier, section 9(1) has not undergone any change or amendment except it being re-numbered as sub- section (1) of Section 9. This measure is available to a party, before commencement of arbitral proceedings, during arbitral proceedings and even after the award is passed till it is enforced in accordance with Section 36 of the Act. Sections 9(1), 9(2) and 9(3) are C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 to be read in harmonious manner and Section 9(3) cannot be read in isolation. When an application for interim measures for any of the purposes provided under section 9(1) is filed before the arbitral proceedings commences, sub- section (3) of section 9 will have no application. It is true that once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, sub-section (3) of section 9 will come into play. In the instant case, the eventuality as provided under sub- section (2) of Section 9 is not relevant. Section 9(3) provides that the once Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted, the Court shall not entertain the application under sub-section (1) of Section 9, unless the Court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious. In opinion of this Court, therefore, there is no ouster of the jurisdiction of the Court. Even considering the objects and reasons of introduction of sub-section (3) of Section 9, the purport and purpose of the amendment was to reduce the role of the Court and not to eradicate the role of the Court. Sub-section (3) of Section 9 therefore does not take away the jurisdiction of the Court in dealing with the application under Section 9(1) of the Act once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted. However, later part of sub-section (3) of Section 9 clearly provides that the Court can entertain such an application under Section 9(1) C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 after the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted only if it finds that the alternative remedy as provided under section 17 is not efficacious. Though, there is no total ouster in order to reduce the role of the Court, it does provide for a restriction. The word 'entertain' as interpreted by the learned trial court with respect is very narrow in nature. The word 'entertain' occurring in sub-section (3) of section 9 would not merely mean to admit a matter for consideration, but it also entails the whole procedure till adjudication, i.e., passing of final order. Therefore, in opinion provides that if an application under section 9 is filed after constitution of Arbitral Tribunal, while entertaining such application, the Court is duty bound to examine whether remedy provided under section 17 is efficacious or not and if it finds that it is not efficacious, it can entertain and if it finds that the remedy of Arbitral Tribunal is efficacious, it can refuse to entertain application under Section 9 of the Act. Having come to the aforesaid conclusion, while examining the fact situation of the case on hand, it is an admitted position that the application under Section 9(1) was filed by the petitioner before the constitution of Arbitral Tribunal and even the application under section 9(1) filed by the respondent was before the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 constitution of Arbitral Tribunal. It is an admitted position that both the applications under section 9(1) of the Act were heard before the constitution of Arbitral Tribunal and in fact, as per the record, the matter was kept for orders on 07.06.2021. Even that date was before constitution of Arbitral Tribunal. If the Trial Court would have pronounced the order on 07.06.2021, the situation which has arisen as on date, would not have arisen at all. However, the fact remains that the Trial Court had no occasion uptil now to examine whether the remedy under section 17 is efficacious or not in the instant case. By the application, which is subject matter of this petition, the trial court is made aware by the parties that now the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted by this Court vide order dated 09.07.2021 passed in IAAP No. 5 of 2021 and therefore, the Trial Court before passing any order will have to take into consideration the provisions of section 9(3) of the Act. However, as rightly contended by the respondent, jurisdiction of the trial court is not denuded by operation of section 9(3) of the Act and therefore, it is for the trial court to decide whether the remedy under section 17 which is similar to the remedy as provided under section 9(1) is efficacious or not and under such circumstances, the trial court cannot be prevented from passing an order. As can be seen from the scheme of the Act, Arbitration Act is a C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 complete Code in itself and if the decision is contrary or otherwise erroneous, it can be remedied by either party by filing an appeal as provided under Section 37 of the Act. Thus, though the trial court, in opinion of this Court, has committed an error in giving restricted meaning to word 'entertain', the fact remains that the trial court cannot be prevented from passing an order and/or considering whether the remedy under section 17 is efficacious or not and therefore, even though this Court does not agree with the reasons given by the Trial Court, ultimately, the trial court has rightly dismissed the same. In opinion of this Court, thus the application filed by the petitioner is a premature petition. \n18. It may also be noted that peculiar fact arises in this writ petition. As noted hereinabove, Section 9 applications were filed by the respective parties before the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted and hearing was over. It is no doubt true that still the order is to be passed and as per the conclusion arrived at by this Court, it would be the duty of the trial court to consider the provisions of sub-section (3) of Section 9 before passing final order on the applications filed by the petitioner as well as the respondent.\nC/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 19. As far as interpretation of the word 'entertain' is concerned, both the side have placed reliance on number of judgments before us to convince that word 'entertain' may be interpreted in a way that it may be suitable to the either side. However, on considering all these judgments as well as considering the language of respective statute like Section 18 of CPC, Article 134(2) of the Constitution of India as well as Section 9(3) of the Arbitration Act, we are of the view that instead of catching a particular word in the language of a particular statute and interpreting that particular word strictly by dictionary meaning, what is required is to be examined in the context in which that particular word is used in the statute. While interpreting the word, we cannot overlook the object for which a particular statute is introduced by the legislature and therefore, considering all the above referred aspect, we are of the view that the word 'entertain' should not be interpreted in its strict dictionary meaning by restricting its interpretation to a very narrow meaning. The interpretation of the word must be in the context of object of the Act and it should be given a purposeful interpretation, which may aid in achieving the purpose behind the scope and object of the provision and therefore, as far as section 9(3) is concerned, we hold that the word 'entertain' would not only mean that admitting for consideration but it would mean the whole C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 gamut upto its final adjudication and passing of an order on merits. \n20. Though we are in total agreement with the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the role of the Court is to assist the arbitral proceeding, however, the provisions of section 9(1) read with section 9(3) cannot be totally ignored to mean that once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, there is total ouster of court. If that would have been the intention of the legislature or parliament, it would have also amended section 9(1) of the Act. Even at the cost of repetition, we reiterate that section 9(1) of the Act enables a party to approach the Court for interim measures at three different stages, before the arbitral proceedings, during arbitral proceedings or after the award is passed till it is enforced in accordance with Section 36 of the Act. In light of such clear cut provisions under section 9(1) of the Act, section 9(3) cannot be read as total ouster in order to reduce the role of the Court. It is no doubt true that sub-section (3) of Section 9 provides for restriction of exercise of powers by the Court and it has to decide whether the remedy provided under section 17 is efficacious or not. However, considering the peculiar facts of this case, the prayers prayed for by the petitioner in the interim application C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 before the trial court cannot be granted. The learned counsel for the petitioner has also taken this Court through the law prevailing in England, Singapore, USA, Hong Kong and South Africa. We are in total agreement with the principles enunciated in the said submission that the international practice is of \"Court- Subsidiarity\", however, such proposition cannot be read in isolation but are to be applied in facts of each case. \n21. The learned counsel for the petitioner heavily relied upon the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in Tufan Chatterjee (supra) and Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra) to canvass the case of the petitioner. As far as judgment in the case of Tufan Chatterjee (supra) is concerned, the said judgment in principal canvasses the proposition that once the Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted, unless the court is satisfied that circumstances existed, which may not render remedy provided under Section 17 efficacious, the Court cannot entertain the application for interim relief under section 9(1) of the Act. However, in the instant case, what is required to be seen is that the hearing was concluded on 07.06.2021. On an interim application preferred by both the sides under section 9(1) of the Act, the date on which the order was reserved by the Commercial Court, the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 Tribunal was not constituted and therefore, the Commercial Court had no occasion to consider the matter from the point of view as to whether remedy under section 17 can be said to be efficacious or not. Arbitral Tribunal was constituted on 09.07.2021 and thereafter, the application was made seeking relief to refer the dispute to Arbitral Tribunal and submitting that now in view of the fact that Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, commercial court should not pronounce the order, in these facts of the case, today the situation has arisen that the commercial court is still seized of with the matter. Order is not passed and therefore, since the order is not passed, it would not be prudent to presume that the commercial court will not touch this aspect and will pass an order ignoring the mandatory provisions of section 9(3) of the Act and therefore, in facts of this case, the judgment of Tufan Chatterjee (supra) will not be applicable to the case on hand. \n22. Secondly, by relying upon the judgment in the case of Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra), the petitioner tried to canvass that once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, it is for the Court to consider as to whether the remedy under section 17 is an efficacious remedy or not before entertaining the application under C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 section 9 of the Act. In the case of Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra) though the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted, but for one reason or another, since the same was not functional and as that fact had come on record, the Court held that the remedy under section 17 of the Act would not be an efficacious remedy and therefore, the Court had an occasion to consider whether the remedy under section 17 is an efficacious remedy or not. In the instant case, the Tribunal is constituted by consensus order by both the parties vide order dated 09.07.2021 before this Court. As submitted by the parties, the first meeting of the arbitral proceeding took place on 30.07.2021 and even during the course of hearing of this petition, it was not the case of the either party that though Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, it has become non-functional. However, in facts of this case, the trial court have had no occasion to examine the fact as to whether the remedy under section 17 of the Act in these facts of circumstances is not efficacious remedy and hence, the judgment in the case of Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra) is not applicable to the facts of the present case. Either party can approach the Arbitral Tribunal under section 17 directly as the same is not barred by statute. \nC/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 23. As far as the judgment in the case of Benara Bearings & Pistons Ltd.(supra) is concerned, it is true that the said judgment takes care of a situation post 2015 amendment in the Act, but in that judgment the aspect of section 9(3) of the Act has not been dealt with. At the same time, the Court while delivering the judgment in the case of Benara Bearings & Pistons Ltd.(supra) also had no occasion to interpret the word 'entertain' and therefore, even the said judgment would not apply stricto senso in the peculiar facts arising in this case. \n24. Considering the submissions made before us as well as the judgments cited before us by both the sides, though the learned trial court has not given proper reasons for dismissing the application filed by the petitioner, the trial court has committed no error in not granting the prayer prayed for by the petitioner in the interim application filed in CMA No.2 of 2021. In our opinion the trial court should be permitted to pronounce the order on both the applications under section 9 pending before it keeping in mind the observations made by us in this judgment and taking into consideration the provisions of section 9(3) of the Act. \n25. Before parting, we may also refer to the prayers prayed for by the petitioner in the present C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 application before the Trial Court wherein the petitioner has prayed as under - \"a. Pass an order referring all disputes between the parties as mentioned in the AMNS Petition and EBTL Petition to the arbitral tribunal for adjudication; and b. Pass such other order/s which this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.\" \nThe application in question is styled as interim application on behalf of the applicant, i.e., the present petitioner. Referring to Section 9(3) of the Act and relying upon the judgment of Calcutta High Court in the case of Tufan Chatterjee (supra), as well as judgment of this Court in Manbhupinder Singh Atwal (supra), it is prayed that the Court may pass an order referring all dispute of the parties to the Arbitral Tribunal for adjudication. Section 9(3) of the Act does not provide for referring of the dispute to the Arbitral Tribunal for adjudication. The scope and object of section 9 is only limited to the interim measures and it is not akin to the provisions of section 8 of the Act wherein the Court has power to refer the parties to the arbitration where there is an arbitration agreement. Section 9 of the Act only deals with the interim measures and it is not within the scope of this section for the Court to refer the dispute to the Arbitral Tribunal. Moreover, section 9 can be resorted C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 to by a party even before the arbitral proceedings and pendency of any arbitral proceeding is not a pre-condition for exercise of power by a Court under Section 9. In view of the aforesaid therefore, the prayer prayed for by the petitioner in the interim application before the trial court in opinion of this Court is beyond the scope and ambit of section 9 of the Act and such prayer cannot be granted. \n26. Resultantly, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned order in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India with the conclusion arrived at by the learned trial court. \n27. The petition fails and is hereby dismissed. \nHowever, there shall be no order as to costs. \n(R.M.CHHAYA, J) (NIRZAR S. DESAI,J) FURTHER ORDER After the order was pronounced, Mr. Navin Pahwa, learned senior advocate appearing for the petitioner has prayed for extension of order dated 26.07.2021 for a further period of three weeks to enable the C/SCA/10492/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 17/08/2021 petitioner to approach the Hon'ble Apex Court. The same is objected to by Mr. Soparkar, learned senior advocate appearing for the respondent. \nIn facts of this case, we deem it fit to direct the trial court not to pronounce its order in both the applications till 03.09.2021. \n(R.M.CHHAYA, J) (NIRZAR S.

(spdc) and the state of sikkim (sos) the appellants in arbitration appeal no. 1 of 2020. 1.(ii) on 30.09.2017, the sole arbitrator had passed the award (the award) on all the 35 issues framed by it. the sole arbitrator granted all the prayers, except prayer [h] in favour of amalgamated transpower (india) limited (atpl). the total amount awarded against prayers [f], [g] & [i] is ₹4,40,55,44,212/(rupees four hundred and forty crores, fifty-five lakhs, forty-four thousand, two hundred and twelve only) along with prayers [a], [b] and [c] and alternatively, if prayers [a], [b] and [c] are not discharged by the respondents, an award of ₹10,95,22,00,945/(rupees one thousand ninety-five crores, twenty-two lakhs, nine hundred and forty-five only) as against prayers [d] & [g]. the sole arbitrator has awarded the aforesaid sums along with interest thereon @15% till the pronouncement of award, i.e., 30.09.2017. the sole arbitrator further awarded simple interest @18% per annum from the date of award till the date of payment. the sole arbitrator further awarded a sum of ₹41.07 lakhs towards costs along with interest @15% per annum from the date of award till date of

sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. 1.(iv) amalgamated transpower (india) limited (atpl) -the appellant in arbitration appeal no. 1 of 2021 -is also aggrieved by the impugned judgment. atpl has challenged the impugned judgment to the extent it has set aside the findings of the sole arbitrator with respect to issues no. 9, 20 and 11. 1.(v) issue no.9 was whether atpl, in the alternative to prayers [a], [b] and [c] was entitled to an award of damages in its favour for a sum of ₹418.50 crores. 1.(vi) issue no.20 was whether prayer [d] could be maintained without sufficient pleading. 1.(vii) issue no.11 was whether atpl was entitled to damages for a sum of ₹49.66 crores, as claimed in prayer [f]. 1.(viii) the sole arbitrator held that prayer [d] was a claim for compensation for damages to be paid by spdc and the sos for nonadherence to prayers [a], [b] and [c] and allowed the same to have effect upon their failure to adhere to the said prayers. the sole arbitrator also held issues nos.20 and 11 in favour of atpl. 1.(ix) on 28.12.2017, spdc and the sos filed an application under section 34 of the arbitration act against atpl aggrieved by the award. atpl didn't challenge the award although it did not grant prayer [h]. genesis of the dispute 2.(i) on 22.12.1998, a tender was floated by spdc inviting bids for construction of hydro electric power projects (heps) on 100 percent debt financing basis. atpl submitted its bid on 05.01.1999, which was accepted. spdc issued letter of intent on 11.03.1999 for sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. setting up the heps of different capacities for a total cost of ₹275 crores on 100 percent debt financing basis. 2.(ii) an agreement dated 18.04.1999 (the first agreement) was entered between spdc, the sos and atpl, to initially develop four heps (rolep-i proposed to be 9 mw capacity, rolep-ii proposed to be 12 mw capacity, ralong proposed to be 16 mw capacity and chakungchu proposed to be 24 mw capacity) of varying capacities through debt financing and implementation schemes in the state of sikkim as run of the river schemes. a significant clause in the first agreement, being clause 10, reads as follows:―10. any variation in this agreement or to any of the appendices can be done subject to the parties duly signing any supplementary agreement to be referred as addendum to this agreement.‖ 2.(iii) on 03.07.1999, the sos gave an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for repayment of the principal amount and interest thereon and raised an amount of ₹50.01 crores as bond amount against the guarantee. 2.(iv) on 22.01.2002, spdc and the sos moved a proposal for allotment of the projects to atpl on build own operate and transfer (boot) basis for an initial period of 35 years to be renewed on mutually agreed terms and conditions. atpl was required to give bank guarantee to take over the borrowings made by spdc. 2.(v) on 21.12.2002, another agreement (the second agreement) was executed which superseded the first agreement. this agreement also contained a similar and significant clause, as sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. stated in paragraph 2(ii) hereinabove. this clause, being clause 25, reads as follows:―25. any variation or amendment to this agreement can be done subject to the parties duly signing any supplementary agreement to be referred as addendum to this agreement.‖ 2.(vi) admittedly, simultaneously with the execution of the second agreement, ownership of all the three (now revised) heps (rolep 36 mw, ralong 40 mw and chakungchu-50 mw) were transferred to atpl. on 19.02.2003, reconciliation of accounts in terms of the second agreement took place. it reflects that the sos had paid interest of ₹21,37,77,543/(rupees twenty-one crores, thirty-seven lakhs, seventy-seven thousand, five hundred and fortythree only), on the bonds. 2.(vii) the reconciliation of accounts signed by the parties also accepts the fact that expenditure incurred by spdc as per the second agreement was verified by the parties. it endorsed and accepted that the reconciliation of accounts in terms of the second agreement would be an addendum to it. 2.(viii) spdc gave their confirmation of the expenditure incurred by spdc and the sos towards the three heps on 02.09.2003 amounting to ₹85.35 crores as per details attached therewith. 2.(ix) admittedly and significantly, however, no detailed project reports (dprs) were submitted by atpl for any of the three heps, namely, rolep, ralong and chakungchu within a period of 6 (six) months, as per agreement entered into by and between the parties. subsequently, it transpires that atpl submitted a single dpr for rolep hep for 36 mw after which techno-economic sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. clearance was granted by the sos on 06.05.2003 with a clear understanding that the proposed capacity could be modified based on bankable final optimization study. admittedly, the estimated installed capacity was later enhanced to 60 mw. however, no fresh dpr for the enhanced capacity of rolep was ever submitted by atpl at any subsequent point of time. nor was any dpr ever submitted subsequently in respect of the two other heps, namely, ralong hep and chakungchu hep. on the basis of the preliminary dpr of rolep hep, as submitted by atpl, the sos granted lease of 10.796 hectares of land at the rolep site vide lease deed dated 29.05.2004. however, admittedly again, the lease rent of ₹10,000/per annum has not been paid by atpl, till date. 2.(x) there were several review meetings held by the then chief secretary from time to time. during the course of hearing of this matter, our attention was drawn to the minutes of the meetings held on 21.08.2003, 14.11.2003, 09.03.2004, 26.04.2004, 23.07.2004, and 15.10.2004. these meetings discussed the progress of the project and sought to clear the bottlenecks. none of the minutes of the meetings records the intention of the parties to amend the second agreement nor was the second agreement ever amended in terms of clause 25. the minutes of the meeting held on 09.03.2004 and 15.10.2004 also records the presence of a third party, namely, larsen and toubro limited (l&t), who was never made a party before the sole arbitrator at any point of time. 2.(xi) the record reveals that an attempt was made to work out an addendum to amend and restate the second agreement. although correspondences were exchanged between the parties, no sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. such addendum was ever signed by and between the parties in terms of clause 25 of the second agreement. 2.(xii) on 22.06.2006, sos issued a final notice to atpl. the notice stated that the delay and the mounting pressure from bond holders had compelled the sos to take certain decisions. atpl was thus required to redeem the bond liability of rs.50.01 crores, including interest, by 31.07.2006. the notice also sought response from atpl confirming the redemption to be communicated to the managing director, spdc, by 10.07.2006. the notice informed atpl that failure to redeem the bond liability would lead to termination of the second agreement and all three heps awarded to atpl would stand withdrawn without any further notice, leaving the sos free to award the projects to interested developers. the notice further sought for refund of the excess payment drawn by atpl against raising of bonds and the advance drawn by atpl towards construction of roads for rolep hep. the notice also sought a written confirmation from atpl agreeing to the redemption of the bonds to reach spdc by 10.07.2006, to be followed by total redemption of rs.50.01 crores by 31.07.2006 to the bond holders. it would be an assumed indicator of atpl's seriousness in developing the projects. 2.(xiii) on 02.05.2008, the sos wrote to atpl terminating the second agreement considering the failure of atpl to abide by its terms and conditions and the delay in the implementation of the project. finally, the dispute was referred to arbitration. the hon'ble supreme court appointed the sole arbitrator on 05.12.2011. sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. the proceedings before the sole arbitrator and the commercial court 3. atpl filed its statement of claims on 08.06.2012. on 09.09.2012, spdc and sos filed their statement of defence and counter claim. atpl filed its rejoinder on 24.11.2012. spdc and the sos filed their replication on 08.06.2013 and atpl its sur-rejoinder on 24.08.2013. the award was passed on 13.09.2017. spdc and sos, thereafter, filed an application under section 34 of the arbitration act challenging the award before the commercial court. the commercial court passed the impugned judgment on 26.12.2019. the award 4.(i) the sole arbitrator granted all the prayers in favour of atpl, except prayer [h]. while granting prayer [a], the sole arbitrator directed spdc and the sos to perform all its obligations under the second agreement in a time bound manner. it further directed spdc and the sos, as agreed in the meeting dated 15.10.2004, to provide land, required access roads and bridges for the three heps within a specific time-frame. the sole arbitrator awarded perpetual injunction against spdc and the sos and directed them not to deal with the three heps contrary to the second agreement in terms of prayer [b]. the sole arbitrator awarded mandatory injunction in favour of atpl directing spdc and the sos to allow the three heps to be implemented by atpl in terms of prayer [c]. having granted all the three prayers [a], [b] and [c] in favour of atpl, the sole arbitrator went on to award the alternative prayer [d] on the condition that it shall have effect upon sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. failure of the respondent to adhere to prayers [a], [b] and [c]. atpl, however, had specifically prayed for grant of damages under prayer [d] only if the sole arbitrator did not grant prayers [a], [b] and [c]. 4.(ii) the sole arbitrator while deciding issue no.2 found that there was no provision under the second agreement permitting its termination unilaterally by the sos; that spdc, which was a separate legal entity, had not taken a decision to terminate the second agreement; that sos had not issued any show cause notice before issuance of letter dated 02.05.2008, in violation of the rules of natural justice; that the ground of delay by atpl was not justified as it was spdc and sos who had continuously deferred the performance of its obligation to provide land and access road without which the construction work of the projects could not start; that the letter dated 02.05.2008 was issued with mala fide intention and ulterior motive. 4.(iii) while deciding issues nos. 3, 22 and 23, the sole arbitrator held that the second agreement regarding submission of bank guarantee by atpl was modified by the minutes of the meeting dated 09.03.2004 and 26.04.2004. sole arbitrator also held that in the minutes of the meeting dated 15.10.2004, further major changes took place in terms of the second agreement. it was held that the parties to the joint meeting dated 09.03.2004, 26.04.2004 and 15.10.2004 decided to modify their respective obligations and spdc and the sos had signed these minutes on their own free will. the sole arbitrator found that spdc and the sos had the right to modify the terms of the agreement under section 63 of the indian sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. contract act, 1872. the sole arbitrator held that atpl was no longer required to provide bank guarantee till spdc and the sos provided entire land record for rolep and chakungchu project in view of the agreement between the parties in the meeting held on 09.03.2004 and 26.04.2004. it was further held that since the land was not provided by spdc and the sos, the feasibility of submitting any bank guarantee by atpl did not arise and subsequently after the decision of the parties in the meeting held on 15.10.2004, the responsibility to repay the bond holder was taken over by the sos and consequently, the question of atpl providing bank guarantee did not arise. 4.(iv) while deciding issues nos. 4 and 28, the sole arbitrator concluded that it was not necessary to decide whether the second agreement was in the nature of boo or boot arrangement. it also held that the sos had transferred the ownership of the three heps to atpl. the impugned judgment rendered by the commercial court 5.(i) the opinion of the sole arbitrator that m/s rolep hydro electric power co. ltd. and velankani renewable energy pvt. ltd. were not necessary parties was upheld by the commercial court. 5.(ii) the opinion of the sole arbitrator that neither the letter dated 22.06.2006 nor the letter dated 02.05.2008 had the effect of terminating the second agreement was also upheld. 5.(iii) the commercial court upheld the view of the sole arbitrator that the minutes of meeting dated 09.03.2004, 26.04.2004 and 15.10.2004 modified the second agreement and sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. they were in the nature of addendum and supplemental to the second agreement. it was held that clause 25 of the second agreement did not disentitle the parties to amend it. 5.(iv) contrary to the findings of the sole arbitrator, it was held that the recital in the second agreement makes it clear that the parties had in fact agreed to do the project on boot basis and the terms of the second agreement was clear and unambiguous. 5.(v) the commercial court also upheld the view of the sole arbitrator that spdc and sos had failed to perform their part of the promise as per the minutes of the meeting dated 09.03.2004, 26.04.2004 and 15.10.2004 and relinquished their claim for bank guarantee from atpl; as such there was no question of breach on the part of atpl. 5.(vi) the commercial court upheld the grant of specific performance in favour of atpl by the sole arbitrator. however, it was held that since atpl had itself sought damages in the alternative to specific performance, the sole arbitrator exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction in awarding both damages as well as specific performance of the second agreement. it was also held that the sole arbitrator had committed patent illegality while doing so. it was held that when a party claims specific performance or damages in the alternative, it is always entitled to elect between the two remedies. 5.(vii) the commercial court set aside the sole arbitrator's finding on issues no. 9 and 20 while maintaining the findings on issue no.6. the award, to the extent it granted damages, was set aside, being patently illegal and unjust. sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. 5.(viii) the commercial court also set aside the reasoning and findings of the sole arbitrator on issue no.11, which awarded further damages even for the expenses incurred in executing various works by atpl in performance of its obligation to develop the project prior to the issuance of letter dated 02.05.2008 by the sos as being patently illegal and unjust. it was held that those expenses incurred by atpl were incurred in performance of its part of the second agreement. since spdc and sos are required to now perform their part of the second agreement they could not be obliged to incur the expenses which atpl was required to incur under the second agreement. 5.(ix) accordingly, the commercial court partly allowed the petition under section 34 of the arbitration act preferred by spdc and sos. the second agreement 6.(i) the second agreement signed between spdc, the sos and atpl on 21.12.2002, acknowledged that subsequent to the first agreement, parties performed various obligations and responsibilities and that it was understood that the ownership of the projects was to be transferred to atpl, who would develop, own and operate the projects on boot basis and not on debt financing and implementation scheme as agreed earlier. 6.(ii) spdc, the sos and atpl agreed that the second agreement would supersede the first agreement. 6.(iii) they also agreed that the project would consist of rolep, ralong and chakungchu with 36 mw, 40 mw and 50 mw, sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. respectively, as estimated installed capacity. they agreed that atpl shall operate these projects on boot basis for a period of 35 years to be renewed for another 35 years on mutually agreed terms. 6.(iv) they agreed under clause 25 that any variation or amendment to the second agreement could be done subject to the parties duly signing any supplementary agreement, which was to be referred as addendum to the second agreement. for convenience, clause 25 is again reproduced hereinbelow:―25. any variation or amendment to this agreement can be done subject to the parties duly signing any supplementary agreement to be referred as addendum to this agreement.‖ 6.(v) they made it clear that the second agreement sets forth the entire understanding between the parties relating to the subject matter and superseded all other prior agreements and understanding. 6.(vi) atpl clearly agreed to take over the responsibilities of payment of bond amount to the extent of ₹50.01 crores; interest already paid @ 13.75%; and interest @12.45% to be paid half yearly after reconciliation of accounts. atpl also agreed to furnish bank guarantee for the said amounts within a period of 12 months of signing of the second agreement. 6.(vii) the second agreement recorded that atpl had taken over the responsibility of repayment of the bond and interest thereon on the understanding that the ownership of the projects was transferred to atpl. 6.(viii) it was agreed that the balance amount of the money raised (₹50.01 crores) lying with spdc and the sos was to be sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. released to atpl against equal amount of bank guarantee to be submitted by atpl. 6.(ix) sos was required to provide land on lease of 99 years to atpl immediately upon identification of such land jointly by atpl and sos. the annual lease rent was quantified at ₹10,000/per annum, till the projects were with atpl. 6.(x) spdc and the sos, at their cost, were to provide access roads to the major structures of the project as required by atpl. 6.(xi) spdc and the sos were required to complete land acquisition, transfer it to atpl and also construct access roads to major structures of the projects after confirmation by atpl regarding required roads and bridges. 6.(xii) atpl was required to give their confirmation (details of roads and bridges) within six months of signing of the agreement. 6.(xiii) in case spdc and the sos gave consent to atpl to bear the cost of roads and bridges and committed to complete them within reasonable specified time to enable atpl to complete the projects on time, only then atpl was required to submit the dprs for these projects within six months thereafter. 6.(xiv) atpl was to obtain clearances and approvals from various agencies and organisations of the government of sikkim including clearances from the state forest, environment and pollution control boards, etc., which were to be facilitated by spdc and the sos. similarly, atpl was also required to obtain clearances and approvals from government of india and other agencies outside sikkim, and spdc and sos were to provide the necessary assistance. sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. 6.(xv) atpl was to provide the sos 12% of total electricity generated, after deduction of auxiliary consumption and transformation losses free of cost for the first 15(fifteen) years from the date of commencement of commercial production and thereafter from the 16th year, 15% of the total electricity generated after deduction of auxiliary consumption and transformation losses from each of the projects or money equivalent thereof. 6.(xvi) atpl was also required to give sos from the year following one year of commencement of commercial production, 2% from their annual net profit of each of these projects, which could be enhanced commensurate with higher power generation and increased profit. 6.(xvii) clause 24 of the second agreement is reproduced hereinbelow:―24. the first party and the second party shall have the right to carry out the survey and investigation/explore/execute any river valley schemes in the upstream as well as downstream of the projects, except those permitted under this agreement, without detriment to the projects mentioned in this agreement including their operation, generation, etc. the third party shall not have any claim over generation from any other projects existing and being envisaged in the upstream/downstream of the three projects, except those permitted under this agreement. in case, construction of approach roads including bridges to major structures of ralong and/or chakungchu heps involve very long time and high cost; or get resistance from forest and environment department of the state/central governments; and if their clearances take considerable time; or these two projects, after detail geo-technical investigation, are found to be techno-economically unviable to make the arrangements under this agreement viable the first party and the second party shall immediately allot one or more projects of similar sizes downstream of ralong and rolep projects to be selected by the third party, where such road works will involve less time and cost, in favour of the third party on the similar terms and conditions as mentioned in this agreement.‖ submission of the parties 7. mr. jishnu saha, learned senior advocate, representing spdc and the sos, relying upon the provisions of sections 34 and sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. 37 of the arbitration act and the opinions expressed by the hon'ble supreme court on those provisions from time to time submitted that the learned commercial court had failed to appreciate that the award was vitiated on various other grounds besides those which were upheld by the commercial court holding that it amounted to the sole arbitrator committing patent illegality. he submitted that the sole arbitrator went beyond the terms of the second agreement and granted reliefs which were not even sought for by atpl; that the award was in conflict with the public policy of india as it was in contravention to the fundamental policy of indian law and also in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice; that the award was vitiated by patent illegality appearing in the face of the award. mr. saha pointed out that the award reflects non-application of judicial mind inasmuch as the sole arbitrator passed the award beyond what was even claimed by atpl. it was argued that the sole arbitrator had passed the award in violation of sections 16, 21(1) and (2) of the specific relief act, 1963. he also submitted that in respect of the three (3) heps, not a brick or a stone was laid by atpl and as such, the award carrying a fantastic sum, will shock the conscience of the court. 8. mr. p. k. das, as representative of atpl, sought to defend the award and challenge that part of the impugned judgment rendered by the commercial court, which held that some parts of the award were patently illegal. he argued that in view of the admission of spdc and the sos, in reply to the claim petition regarding the relevant time for submission of dprs, no issue was framed by the sole arbitrator. it is the case of atpl that there is no sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. statutory provision to support the submission of spdc and the sos that until dprs were submitted by atpl, their obligation to provide land, access roads and bridges would not commence. the finding of the sole arbitrator regarding issues no. 21, 30 and 31 remained unassailed. he argued that the reason for not laying a single brick or stone for any of the heps is attributable to the failures of spdc and the sos and not atpl. he argued that spdc and the sos had clearly admitted in their appeal that the second agreement was not determinable in response to the finding in the award that their counter claim was barred by limitation. he submitted that the finding of the sole arbitrator on issues nos. 26 and 27 has been upheld in the impugned judgment which has not been challenged in their appeal by spdc and sos. various grounds taken in the appeal preferred by spdc and the sos were neither taken before the sole arbitrator nor before the commercial court. the terms of the second agreement were modified by the minutes of the meeting dated 09.03.2004, 26.04.2004 and 15.10.2004. the award is not patently illegal as the sole arbitrator had examined each of the issues and rendered his findings on each of them, most of which remains unassailed. the appeal of spdc and the sos is an assortment of contradictory pleas which are liable to be rejected. with regard to the grant of ₹265.10 crores by the sole arbitrator in the claim of atpl for damages of ₹120 crores only, mr. das submitted that the sole arbitrator had considered the cost escalation from the date of termination, i.e., 02.05.2008, till the filing of the claim petition, i.e., 02.05.2012, on civil costs as per cea/cwc norms. it was further argued that the calculation of price sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. escalation as provided by atpl as annexure ̳a' to their replication remain unassailed by spdc and the sos. thus, spdc and the sos were precluded from challenging it before this court. with regard to the sole arbitrator awarding more than what was claimed for, mr. das submitted that even if the award is considered as perverse on that ground, the same did not go to the root of the matter and therefore the entire award could not be set aside. the relevant provisions of the arbitration & conciliation act, 9. sections 34 and 37 of the arbitration act, to the extent relevant, are set out hereunder:―34. application for setting aside arbitral award. -(1) recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3). (2) an arbitral award may be set aside by the court only if -(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that-. (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matter beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration: provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or . (b) the court finds that -. (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of india. [explanation 1.for the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the public policy of india, only if, -(i)the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81; or (ii)it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law; or (iii)it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice.] [explanation 2. for the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute.] (2a) an arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the court, if the court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the fact of the award: sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or buy reappreciation of evidence.] . x x x 37. appealable orders.(1) an appeal shall lie from the following orders (and from no others) to the court authorized by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the court passing the order, namely:. (c) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34. .‖ law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court renusagar judgment 10.(i) the hon'ble supreme court in renusagar power co. ltd. vs. general electric co. , construed the term ―public policy‖ under section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards (recognition and enforcement) act, 1961, and held that an award contrary to (i) the fundamental policy of indian law; or (ii) the interests of india; or (iii) justice or morality; would be set aside on the ground that it would be contrary to the public policy of india. scope of section 34 of the arbitration & conciliation act, 1996 10.(ii) in oil & natural gas corporation ltd. vs. saw pipes ltd.2, the hon'ble supreme court construed the expression, ―the public policy of india‖ contained in section 34(2)(b)(ii) of the arbitration act, 1996 and held that award could be set aside if it is contrary to: (a) fundamental policy of indian law; or (b) the interest of india; or (c) justice or morality; or (d) in addition, if it is patently illegal. it (1994) supp (1) scc 644 (2003) 5 scc 705 sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. was also held that the illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality is of trivial nature it cannot be held that award is against the public policy. award could be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of the court. such award is opposed to public policy and is required to be adjudged void. 10.(iii) the hon'ble supreme court in mcdermott international inc. vs. burn standard co. ltd. & others held that the arbitration act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness. intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only; like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. the court cannot correct errors of arbitrators. it can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin arbitration if it is desired. so, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it. the hon'ble supreme court also examined judgments of various high courts and thereafter concluded that there can be no doubt that given the law laid down by it, section 34 of the arbitration act cannot be held to include within it a power to modify an award. the jurisdiction of the court and the scope of section 34 of the arbitration act is thus sufficiently clear. (2006) 11 scc 181 sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. 10.(iv) in associate builders vs. delhi development authority 4, the hon'ble supreme court examined section 34 of the arbitration act and the various judgments rendered and went on to explain the various grounds available in interfering with arbitral awards. disregarding orders of superior courts in india as well as the binding effect of the judgment of the superior court was considered as being contrary to the fundamental policy of indian law. it was also held that equally important and fundamental to the policy of indian law is the principle that a court and so also a quasi-judicial authority must, while determining the rights and obligations of parties before it, do so in accordance with the principles of natural justice. non-application of mind is a defect that is fatal to any adjudication. a decision which is perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would have arrived at the same will not be sustained in a court of law. judicial approach ensures that authority acts bona fide and deals with the subject in a fair, reasonable and objective manner and that its decision is not actuated by any extraneous consideration. judicial approach in that sense acts as a check against flaws and faults and can render the decision of a court, tribunal or authority vulnerable to challenge. it was held that the juristic principle of a judicial approach demands that a decision be fair, reasonable and objective. on the obverse side, anything arbitrary and whimsical would obviously not be a determination which would either be fair, reasonable or objective. it was also held that it was neither necessary nor proper to attempt an exhaustive (2015) 3 scc 49 sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. enumeration of what constitutes the fundamental policy of indian law nor is it possible to place the expression in the straightjacket of a definition. the hon'ble supreme court also explained the next ground on which an award may be set aside, i.e., that it is contrary to the interest of india and held that this ground is to evolve on a case to case basis. the hon'ble supreme court held that the third ground of public policy is, if an award is against justice or morality. the fourth ground available according to the hon'ble supreme court was patent illegality. it was held that contravention of substantive law of india would result in the death knell of an arbitral award. it was explained that such illegality must go to the root of the matter and cannot be of trivial nature. a contravention of the arbitration act itself would be regarded as patent illegality. contravention of section 28(3) of the arbitration act was also held to be the third subhead of patent illegality. the arbitral tribunal is required to decide in accordance with the terms of the contract and shall take into account the usages of the trade applicable to the transaction. a caveat, however, cautioned that if an arbitrator construes a term of the contract in a reasonable manner, it will not mean that the award can be set aside on this ground. construction of the terms of the contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide unless the arbitrator construes the contract in such a way that it could be said to be something that no fair minded or reasonable person would do. it is settled law that where a finding is based on no evidence, or an arbitral tribunal takes into account something irrelevant to the decision which it arrives at; or ignores vital evidence in arriving at his decision, such decision would necessarily be perverse. the next sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. ground on which an award may be set aside is that it is contrary to the interest of india which concerns itself with india as a member of the world community in its relation with foreign power. the third ground of public policy is, if an award is against justice or morality. an award can be said to be against justice only when it shocks the conscience of the court. it was also held patent illegality as a principle contains three sub-heads, i.e., contravention of substantive law of india, contravention of the arbitration act and contravention of the terms of the contract. 10.(v) in maharashtra state electricity distribution co. ltd. vs. datar switch gear ltd. & others , the hon'ble supreme court had held that a court hearing a section 34 petition does not sit in appeal. 10.(vi) in ssangyong engineering & construction co. ltd. vs. national highways authority of india (nhai) , the hon'ble supreme court explained that under the guise of interfering with an award on the ground that the arbitrator has not adopted a judicial approach, the courts cannot intervene on the merits of the award. it also clarified that violation of principles of natural justice would continue to be a ground for challenge of an award. the hon'ble supreme court explained that the ground for interference on the basis that the award is in conflict with justice and morality is to be understood as a conflict with the ―most basic notions of morality or justice and it is only such arbitral award that shocks the conscience of the court that can be set aside on this ground.‖ it was also opined that patent illegality appearing on the face of the award (2018) 3 scc 133 (2019) 15 scc 131 sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. which refers to such illegality as goes to the root of the matter but which does not amount to mere erroneous application of the law may also be a ground of challenge. re-appreciation of evidence was held not permissible under the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. a mere contravention of the substantive law of india, by itself, is no longer a ground available to set aside an arbitral award. however, if the arbitrator gives no reason for an award and contravenes section 31(3) of the arbitration act, that would certainly amount to patent illegality on the face of the award. it was held that the construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes the contract in a manner that no fair minded or reasonable person would; in short, that the arbitrator's view is not even a possible view to take. also if the arbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits an error of jurisdiction. this ground of challenge will now fall within the new ground added under section 34(2-a). a finding based on no evidence at all or an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at his decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. additionally, a finding based on documents taken behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator would also qualify as a decision based on no evidence in as much as such decision is not based on evidence led by the parties, and therefore, would also have to be characterised as perverse. sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. 10.(vii) the hon'ble supreme court in mmtc ltd. vs. vedanta ltd.7 held that a section 34 proceedings does not contain any challenge on the merits of the award. 10.(viii) in psa sical terminals pvt. ltd. vs. board of trustees of v.o. chidambranar port trust tuticorin and others 8, the hon'ble supreme court held that it is more than settled legal position that in an application under section 34, the court is not expected to act as an appellate court and re-appreciate the evidence. the scope of interference will be limited to grounds provided under section 34 of the arbitration act. the interference would be so warranted when the award is in violation of ―public policy of india‖, which has been held to mean, ―the fundamental policy of indian law‖. a judicial intervention on account of interfering on the merits of the award would not be permissible. however, the principles of natural justice as contained in section 18 and 34(2)(a)(iii) of the arbitration act would continue to be the grounds of challenge of an award. the ground for interference on the basis that the award is in conflict with justice or morality is now to be understood as a conflict with the ―most basic notions of morality or justice‖. it is only such arbitral award that shocks the conscience of the court that can be set aside on the said ground. an award would be set aside on the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award and as such, which goes to the roots of the matter. however, an illegality with regard to a mere erroneous application of law would not be a ground for interference. equally, re-appreciation of evidence would (2019) 4 scc 163 2021 scc online sc 508 sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. not be permissible on the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. a decision which is perverse, though, would not be a ground for challenge under ―public policy of india‖, would certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. however, a finding based on no evidence at all or an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. it was also held that to understand the test of perversity it would be relevant to refer to paragraphs 31 and 32 from the judgment in associate builders (supra). 10.(ix) in state of chhattisgarh & another vs. sal udyog private limited9, the hon'ble supreme court explained what constitutes patent illegality and held that when the arbitrator fails to decide matters in accordance with the terms of contract governing the parties, it would attract patent illegality thereon. 10.(x) in indian oil corporation ltd. vs. shree ganesh petroleum rajgurunagar10 and delhi airport metro express private limited vs. delhi metro rail corporation limited11, the hon'ble supreme court reiterated the restricted grounds on which only an award may be interfered with and set aside. scope of section 37 of the arbitration & conciliation act, 1996 11.(i) we shall now examine the jurisdiction and scope of section 37 of the arbitration act. in punjab state civil supplies corporation ltd. and another vs. ramesh kumar and company and (2022) 2 scc 275 (2022) 4 scc 463 (2022) 1 scc 131 sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. others , the hon'ble supreme court held that the jurisdiction in a first appeal arising out of a decree in a civil suit is distinct from the jurisdiction of the high court under section 37 of the arbitration act arising from the disposal of a petition challenging an arbitral award under section 34. it was held that the high court was required to determine as to whether the district judge had acted contrary to the provisions of section 34 of the arbitration act in rejecting the challenge to the arbitral award. 11.(ii) in haryana tourism ltd. vs. kandhari beverages ltd.13, the hon'ble supreme court held that the award can be set aside under section 34/37 of the arbitration act, if the award is found to be contrary to (a) fundamental policy of indian law; or (b) the interest of india; or (c) justice or morality; or (d) if it is patently illegal. it also held that the high court while deciding an appeal under section 37 cannot enter into the merits of the claim. 11.(iii) in dr. a. parthasarathy and others vs. e. springs avenues pvt. ltd. and others , the hon'ble supreme court reiterated that under section 37 of the

reliefs:\"a] pass an award of specific performance in favour of the claimant company and against the opposite parties thereby enforcing the terms of the agreement dated 21.12.2002 and thereby directing the opposite parties to perform all their obligations under the said agreement in a time bound manner; and b] pass an award of perpetual injunction in favour of the claimant company and against the opposite parties thereby restraining the opposite parties from dealing with the 3 hydro electric projects contrary to agreement dated 21.12.2002; and c] pass an award of mandatory injunction in favour of the claimant company and against the opposite parties thereby directing the opposite parties to implement the 3 hydro electric projects in terms of the agreement dated 21.12.2002; or d] in the alternative to prayer [a], [b] and [c], pass an award of damages in favour of the claimant company and against the opposite parties for a sum of ₹418.50 crores; and e] pass an award of declaration in favour of the claimant company and against the opposite parties declaring that the letter of termination dated 02.05.2008 is illegal, malafide and void and has no legal effect; and f] pass an award of damages in favour of the claimant company and against the opposite parties for a sum of ₹496,689,279/(rupees forty nine crores sixty six lakhs eighty nine thousand two hundred and seventy nine only) in terms of paragraph 76 of the claim petition; and g] pass an award of damages in favour of the claimant company and against the opposite parties for a sum of ₹471,353,405/(rupees forty seven crores thirteen lakhs fifty three thousand four hundred and five only) in terms of paragraph 77 of the claim petition; and h] pass an award of damages in favour of the claimant company and against the opposite parties for a sum of ₹1,080,000,000/(rupees one hundred and eight crores) in terms of paragraph 78 of the claim petition; and i] award of damages in favour of the claimant company and against the opposite parties for a sum of ₹1,200,000,000/(rupees one hundred and twenty crores) in terms of paragraph 79 of the claim petition; and sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. j] pass an award of interest in favour of the claimant company and against the opposite parties from the date of breach at the rate of 18 per cent per annum; and k] pass an award of cost of the instant arbitral proceedings in favour of the claimant company and against the opposite parties; and l] pass such other and further award(s)/order(s) in favour of the claimant company and against the opposite parties as this hon'ble tribunal may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.‖ 13. the award of a fantastic sum as damages by the sole arbitrator has caught our attention. that apart and in any event, the conscience of this court has been rudely shaken upon going through the entire facts and circumstances of the instant case. admittedly, although the second agreement was signed in the year 2002, till date, not a single brick or stone has been laid by atpl for any of the three heps. it is atpl's case that because of the defaults of spdc and the sos, they had not been able to do so. a cursory glance of the prayers quoted above reflects, however, that only prayer [f] for damages for a sum of ₹496,689,279/(rupees forty-nine crores, sixty-six lakhs, eighty-nine thousand, two hundred and seventy-nine only), was the claim for actual expenditure. the claim of atpl, however, was that they had incurred total expenditure of ₹220,278,098/(rupees twenty-two crores, two lakhs, seventyeight thousand and ninety-eight only), for field investigation and survey, preparation of dpr, environmental studies, geo-technical and geo-physical investigation, construction of temporary structures, drilling on the river, gauge and discharge system and cost of establishment, cost of site establishment and cost of consultancy. this will appear from atpl's claim petition itself. evidently, atpl's claim as actual expenditure was only for sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. preliminary works. as against the actual expenditure, admittedly incurred by atpl, the sole arbitrator has awarded ₹4,40,55,44,212/(rupees four hundred and forty crores, fifty-five lakhs, forty-four thousand, two hundred and twelve only), as award of claim in prayer [f], [g] and [i] along with interest thereon and ₹10,95,22,00,945/(rupees one thousand ninety-five crores, twenty-two lakhs, nine hundred and forty-five only), in the alternative, if award [a], [b] and [c] are not discharged by spdcl and the sos in favour of atpl. admittedly and significantly, all this in the absence of any dprs, save and except one dpr for the rolep hep and that too, at the initial stage and limited to 36 mw. prayer [d] 14. the commercial court has held that the sole arbitrator has committed patent illegality by awarding damages in terms of prayer [d] of rs.418.50 crores when atpl itself has sought for it only in the event the sole arbitrator did not award prayers [a], [b] and [c] in his favour. prayer [a] was for specific performance of the second agreement. prayer [b] was for award for perpetual injunction restraining spdc and the sos from dealing with the three heps contrary to the second agreement. prayer [c] was for award of mandatory injunction directing spdc and the sos to implement the three heps in terms of the second agreement. the sole arbitrator granted all the three prayers [a], [b] and [c] and thereafter also decided to examine prayer [d] and granted it against spdc and the sos, in case they failed to adhere to prayers [a], [b] and [c]. in associate builders (supra), the hon'ble supreme court sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. has held that an award can be said to be against justice only when it shocks the conscience of the court. the hon'ble supreme court illustrated it by giving an example of a claimant being content with restricting his claim to a particular amount in a statement of claim before the arbitrator and at no point seeking anything more. the arbitral award, however, awarded him much more than his claim without any acceptable reason or justification. in the present case as well, although the claim was precisely for grant of prayers [a], [b] and [c] and if the sole arbitrator did not grant those prayers, atpl had sought for damages as claimed in prayer [d] as an alternative, the sole arbitrator nevertheless went beyond the scope of the prayers made by atpl and granted prayer [d] without any acceptable reason or justification even after granting prayers [a], [b] and [c]. 15. this part of the award is also against section 21 of the specific relief act, 1963. when the sole arbitrator awarded specific performance in terms of prayer [a], compensation could be granted only on a finding that it was not sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case. there was no such finding recorded by the sole arbitrator. further, the sole arbitrator could not have awarded compensation unless atpl had claimed such compensation in its claim petition. when, therefore, atpl had sought for damages in terms of prayer [d] as an alternative to non-grant of prayers [a], [b] and [c], the sole arbitrator was not authorised or competent to even determine the compensation sought for in prayer [d], leave alone grant the same in the manner he did. sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. 16. further, section 36 of the arbitration act provides for enforcement of arbitral award in accordance with the provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908, as if it were a decree of a court. when, thus, the sole arbitrator granted prayer [a] for specific performance of second agreement -obviously, on the conclusion that it could have been specifically performed -there was no need for the sole arbitrator to ignore section 36 of the arbitration act. the presumption that at some future stage, spdc and sos would not be able to specifically perform and based on such presumption, proceeding not only to determine the compensation payable on such failure -but even going ahead to grant it -was grossly and patently erroneous on part of the sole arbitrator. 17. the sole ground of determining prayer [d] that spdc and the sos may not, in the future, specifically perform the contract, therefore, is not an acceptable reason or justification. it is held that the award of damages in terms of prayer [d] by the sole arbitrator would squarely fall as one which is contrary to justice and which shocks the conscience of this court. the conclusion of the commercial court setting the award in terms of prayer [d] aside is upheld. prayer [i] 18. prayer [i] was a claim for damages for a sum of ₹120 crores for loss suffered towards cost escalation in the cost of three heps with effect from 02.05.2008. the basis of this claim was that if atpl had to complete the project in accordance with the second agreement, it would have been completed by 02.05.2008. according sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. to atpl, the cost of civil construction of the project was ₹4 crores per mw which had escalated by 6% per annum from 02.05.2008 till the date of construction. atpl claimed that as on the date of the claim, the total cost escalation caused due to failure of spdc and the sos was ₹120 crores for 126 mw of the three heps. the sole arbitrator granted ₹265.10 crores to atpl for cost escalation instead. the sole arbitrator completely ignored or lost complete sight of the crucial fact that atpl had not even laid a single brick or stone for any of the projects or submitted the fundamental requirement of dprs for chakungchu and ralong heps till date for the project to see even the light of day. by the same reasoning, as held above, the grant of an award of damages of the sum of ₹265.10 crores, when atpil had sought for a specific sum of ₹120 crores only -in prayer [i] -as their claim for cost escalation, necessarily requires to be set aside, being against the most basic notions of justice and which shocks the conscience of the court. prayer [a] on the issue of specific performance 19. prayer [a] sought specific performance of the second agreement directing spdc and the sos to perform their obligations under it. this prayer was not amended by atpl. the sole arbitrator framed issue no.6 to the effect whether atpl is entitled to an award of specific performance in its favour for enforcement of the second agreement. thus, it is certain that atpl had not sought for specific performance of those minutes of the meetings. the sole arbitrator had held that atpl sought direction upon spdc and the sos to perform their obligations under the second agreement and what sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. was decided on 15.10.2004. the sole arbitrator infers this from paragraph 82 of the claim petition. contrarily, in paragraph 82 of the claim petition, atpl has not sought so. the sole arbitrator, therefore, clearly went beyond the pleadings and the prayer of atpl in order to hold as above. on minutes of the meeting held on 15.10.2004 20. while answering issue no.6, the sole arbitrator has also referred to issue no.3. issue no.3 framed by the sole arbitrator was whether the terms of the second agreement stood modified, as pleaded by atpl. the sole arbitrator refers to the contention of atpl with regard to issues no. 3, 22 and 23 in paragraphs 276 to 278 of the award. in paragraph 278, the sole arbitrator records that ―.thereafter another joint meeting was held on 15.10.2004 which resulted in clear modification of the agreement dated 21.12.2002.‖ besides that sentence, the sole arbitrator has not set out any contention of atpl that the second agreement stood modified by subsequent minutes of the meetings between the parties. 21. issues are framed based on the pleadings of the parties. the claim petition does not assert that the second agreement stood modified by minutes of any meetings held between the parties. even if the sole arbitrator was of the opinion that atpl had, in fact, pleaded that the minutes of the meeting dated 15.10.2004 had modified the second agreement, it was clearly contrary to the record of the said minutes. the minutes of the meeting dated 15.10.2004 was entered between the sos, atpl and larsen & toubro (l&t) and not between the parties to the second sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. agreement. on a cursory glance of the minutes of the meeting, it is clear that l&t had reconfirmed their interest in developing the three heps and that their consortium would be the single largest shareholder in the special purpose vehicle (spv) in which atpl would also be a shareholder. l&t also wanted the confirmation by the sos that the projects had been allotted to atpl on competitive bidding and they had no objection in joining the spv as the single largest shareholder for implementation of the projects. l&t also informed that the spv would develop rolep followed by chakungchu and ralong heps. the said minutes also record that if the sos fulfil their commitments on the five points therein, spv agreed to release ₹50.01 crores by february 2007 which would be utilised by sos towards repayment of the principle bond amount and the balance principle amount lying in the bank along with ₹5 crores advanced to atpl (who, in turn, have advanced ₹1.85 crores to l&t) shall be utilised for servicing the interest. in order to implement the project on time, the sos committed to provide all infrastructure and state level clearances as detailed therein. further, the minutes of the meeting dated 15.10.2004 clearly records that it would be formalised by a detailed agreement between the sos, spdc, atpl and l&t, which was never done. the claim petition asserts an agreement entered between atpl and l&t. it is thus clear that the minutes recorded the broad understanding if l&t came forward and took over the projects from atpl by forming an spv with them as the single largest party and atpl as a shareholder only. admittedly, this did not happen. unfortunately, the sole arbitrator not only completely ignored this crucial fact and sought to impose the sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. obligation under the minutes of 15.10.2004 on spdc and the sos in favour of atpl -in a manner which is in gross ignorance of the record before him -he also lost sight of the fact that l&t was never made a party before the arbitral tribunal by atpl at any point of time. the subsequent minutes also do not dwell on this crucial aspect. on minutes of the meeting held on 09.03.2004 22. the minutes of the meeting dated 09.03.2004 also records clearly that it was chaired by the then chief secretary for review of progress of the three heps. it also records that the presence of l&t and atpl was required to forward copy of specification issued by them to l&t to spdc. again, certain steps contemplated to be taken by the parties in the review meeting held by the then chief secretary in the presence of l&t which ultimately did not take over the project could not have firstly modified the second agreement, as held by the sole arbitrator and the commercial court and secondly, could not have bound spdcl and the sos, especially in the absence of l&t as a party to the arbitral proceeding. on minutes of the meeting held on 26.4.2004 23. the minutes of the meetings held on 26.04.2004 also reveal that it was held by the then chief secretary to take stock of the progress of the three heps, clear bottlenecks and never intended to modify the second agreement. 24. under section 63 of the indian contract act, 1872, there must be a clear intention to relinquish a right that is fully known to a sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. party, as waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right. the minutes of the meetings referred to, does not reflect such clear intention. in view of the specific clause 25 of the second agreement, we are also of the considered view that the minutes of the above meetings could not have modified the second agreement as held by the sole arbitrator and the commercial court, ignoring what was clearly written in the said minutes of the meetings, and reading only those paragraphs which would give an impression that spdc and the sos had agreed to modify the second agreement. 25. the award of the sole arbitrator granting specific performance of the second agreement, which was held modified by the minutes of the meeting dated 15.10.2004, is beyond prayer [a] of atpl's claim petition and thus, wholly contrary to justice and which shocks the conscience of this court. the finding of the sole arbitrator on this aspect is also against the terms of the second agreement, which the sole arbitrator directed specific performance of. the sole arbitrator has clearly committed an error of jurisdiction wandering outside the scope and purview of the second agreement. 26. further, the second agreement was in terms of article 166 and 299 of the constitution of india and expressed to be made by the governor of the state of sikkim. article 299 specifically provides that contracts made in exercise of executive power of the state shall be expressed to be made by the governor or other specified authority and shall be executed on behalf of the governor by such persons and in such manner as he may direct or authorise. sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. in chatturbhuj vithaldas jasani vs. moreshwar parashram and others 17, the hon'ble supreme court held that article 299 was not inserted for the sake of mere form and the provision was there to safeguard against unauthorised contracts. it was also held that if, in fact, a contract is unauthorised or in excess of authority, the government should be safeguarded. the language of article 299 therefore suggests that any variation in terms of the contract made under it should also be made in accordance with the same procedure as the original contract. the minutes of the meetings referred to above does not comply with the provisions of article 299 of the constitution of india as well apart from the crucial fact that it is not even in accordance with the specific clause, being clause 25 of the second agreement. 27. while granting specific performance, the sole arbitrator directed spdc and the sos to make over the required land, access roads and bridges for rolep, chakungchu and ralong heps within a specified time-frame in terms of the second agreement, as stood modified by the minutes of meeting dated 15.10.2004. it does not, however, spell out what were the required lands, access roads and bridges to be provided by spdc and the sos. more importantly, the second agreement contains various reciprocal obligations between the parties. the sole arbitrator has not directed fulfilling of any of the reciprocal obligations of atpl except for directing it to make payments of certain amounts for getting land and access roads for a.i.r. 1954 s.c. 263 sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. bridges for rolep hep, land and access roads for bridges for chakungchu hep and land and access roads for ralong hep. 28. the second agreement required each of the party to perform certain obligations. as admitted by atpl in the claim petition itself, the ownership of the three heps was transferred to atpl, which was stipulated under clause one (1). the first clause also stipulated that atpl was to develop, own, operate these projects on boot basis. however, admittedly, none of the projects have been developed with the laying of even one brick or a stone, leave alone being operated by atpl. by clause two (2), as seen above, atpl agreed to take over the responsibility of payment of bond amount to the extent of ₹50.01 crores; interest at the rate of 12.45%, payable half yearly; and interest already paid at a higher rate (13.75%) after reconciliation of account which was to be completed within 60 days of signing of the second agreement. admittedly, reconciliation of account was completed on 19.02.2002, within the period of 60 days of signing of the second agreement. thus, atpl was bound to take over the responsibility of payment of bond amount and interest thereon as aforesaid after reconciliation of account on 19.02.2002. atpl was to also furnish necessary bank guarantee from a nationalised bank for ₹50.01 crores as well as guarantees for payment of interest within a period of 12 months from signing of the second agreement. however, admittedly, atpl has not done so, till date. 29. the second agreement clearly records that spdc and the sos had under the first agreement borrowed funds of the said amount of ₹50.01 crores through bonds to finance the sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. implementation of the three heps, which was required to be repaid. the sole arbitrator, however, held issues nos.3, 22 and 23 in favour of atpl and thereby further held that the second agreement had been modified in the meeting of the parties dated 09.03.2004, 26.04.2004 and 15.10.2004; that after the meeting of the parties dated 15.10.2004, atpl was no longer responsible to repay the bond holder; and that spdc and the sos had relinquished their claim for bank guarantee. 30. we have already concluded that the minutes of the meetings could not have either modified or amended the second agreement for four clear reasons. firstly, clause 25 of the second agreement clearly envisaged a ―supplementary agreement‖ to be termed as an ―addendum‖ signed by the parties for any variation or amendment thereof, which was never done. thus, there was a clear bar of doing it in any other manner other than what had been specifically agreed upon by and between the parties under clause 25 of the second agreement. it would have been a different scenario had clause 25 specifically allowed the parties to modify and/or vary and/or amend the second agreement by means of holding meetings and recording in its minutes of any decision to modify and/or vary and/or amend the second agreement. secondly, the minutes of the meeting held on 15.04.2004 were on the proposal of l&t coming into the picture and taking over the projects, which did not happen. consequently, spdc and the sos cannot be held bound by the minutes of the meeting of 15.04.2004 without l&t taking over the projects. similarly, as stated earlier, l&t was never made a party. thirdly, the minutes of the other meetings were only for the purpose sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. of the then chief secretary taking stock of the projects and attempting to clear the bottlenecks and not for the purpose of amending the second agreement. fourthly, article 299 of the constitution of india prohibits the amendment of a government contract like the second agreement, without its compliance. additionally, a holistic reading of the second agreement makes it apparent that spdc and the sos had clearly transferred their liability under the first agreement, having borrowed ₹50.01 crores, to atpl and that atpl had agreed to take it over. this was the most essential condition of the second agreement. however, the sole arbitrator, as well as the commercial court, completely ignored the record of the case which was most material and held that the minutes of the meeting dated 15.10.2004 with l&t had modified the second agreement and that spdc and the sos had abandoned their right under the second agreement. although, we would like to exercise caution and restraint, we cannot ignore the fact that the findings of the sole arbitrator borders towards perversity. 31. for the above reasons, it is also held that the finding of the sole arbitrator that atpl was no longer required to pay the bond amount or give the bank guarantee in terms of the second agreement is patently illegal on the face of the award and liable to be set aside. additionally, it is also held that the sole arbitrator has construed the contract in a manner that no fair minded or reasonable person would and that his view is not even a possible view to take, even remotely. 32. at this juncture, it would be important to examine the finding of the sole arbitrator that spdc and the sos had failed to sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. perform their part of the second agreement by providing atpl with lands and access roads and bridges. 33. the second agreement, envisaged atpl doing the preliminary survey, making the dprs and identifying specific locations for establishing the major structures of the projects, requiring and confirming the access roads to the major structures from spdc and the sos. spdc and the sos were then to provide access roads as required and confirmed by atpl at their cost. admittedly, land in rolep was provided on lease to atpl when atpl submitted their preliminary and the only dpr. admittedly, atpl never submitted any dpr either for chakungchu or ralong heps. without the dprs -being an essential part for the purpose of giving shape to the heps under the agreement -there has been no progress at all. 34. admittedly, atpl has submitted only one dpr, i.e., for 36 mw rolep hep. quite evidently for development of the three heps, as envisaged in the second agreement, to be built, owned, operated and subsequently transferred to spdc and the sos by atpl, it was important for atpl to have prepared and submitted dprs to provide for a proper road map for all the projects' successful execution. as atpl was to build, own and operate it, quite obviously, as envisaged in the second agreement, atpl was to provide for details of roads and bridges and require it from spdc and the sos. atpl was also required to submit the dprs and in case spdc and the sos gave their consent to bear the cost of roads and bridges and commit to complete these within reasonable specified time to enable atpl to complete the projects on time, atpl was sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. then required to submit the dprs of these projects within six months thereafter. spdc gave the confirmation of the expenditure incurred by spdc and the sos in terms of clause 13 of the second agreement, towards the three heps on 02.09.2003. thus, atpl was contractually bound to submit the dprs for the three heps within six months from 02.09.2003. the record, however, clearly reveals that this was not done. 35. the sole arbitrator as well as the commercial court have completely misread the terms of the second agreement to mean that there was no requirement for atpl to submit dprs. this finding is not only against the terms of the second agreement but also against sheer common sense and logic. the terms of the second agreement did not and could not have implied that atpl, the proposed builder, owner and operator may not submit dprs for such huge projects. it would be unfathomable that such hydroelectric power projects could be executed without any dprs that would outline its feasibility, viability and potential. it would be equally absurd to think that without any detailed information about the projects, including its scope, objective, budget, timelines, etc., prepared by experts, such hydro-electric power projects would see the light of day. 36. the fact that atpl had submitted dpr for 36 mw rolep hep in three volumes covering various aspects of the project asserts the indispensible nature of dprs for the proposed heps. we are, therefore, constrained to notice that the sole arbitrator has awarded specific performance of the second agreement, as held modified by the minutes of the meeting dated 15.10.2004, without the dprs. sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. 37. it was argued on behalf of atpl that the sole arbitrator did not even frame an issue with regard to the relevant time for submission for dprs as spdc and the sos in their reply to the claim petition filed by atpl had admitted certain facts. however, to the contrary, spdc and the sos took a clear stand that atpl had failed to submit dprs, as required, in their reply to the claim petition. 38. we are of the considered view that this approach of the sole arbitrator as well as of the commercial court is contrary to not only the terms of the second agreement but also to common sense and logic. we hold that the award of specific performance by the sole arbitrator, in the manner as aforesaid, amounts to patent illegality on the face of the award and shocks the conscience of this court as it veers towards perversity. 39. the commercial court while examining the appeal of spdc and the sos against the award under section 34 of the arbitration act, went on to uphold the grant of specific performance in favour of atpl. however, it is seen that the commercial court did not examine the grant of specific performance of the second agreement, as held modified by minutes of the meeting dated 15.10.2004. thus, for the same reason for setting aside the award of specific performance by the sole arbitrator, we set aside the finding of the commercial court as well. 40. as we have held that the minutes of the meetings between the parties do not amount to modification of the second agreement, it necessarily follows that the parties were bound to carry out their respective obligations. it was atpl who approached the sole arbitrator for arbitration by filing the claim petition seeking sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. specific performance of the second agreement. as held by the hon'ble supreme court in c. haridasan vs. anappath parakkattu vasudeva kurup & others , the provisions of section 16 of the specific relief act, 1963, have to be mandatorily complied with by the parties seeking relief of specific performance. the relief of specific performance cannot be granted in favour of a party who has not performed his obligations under the contract. section 16 provides that specific performance of a contract cannot be enforced in favour of a person, inter alia, who has become incapable of performing, or violates any essential term of the contract that on his part remains to be performed, or acts in fraud of a contract, or wilfully acts at variance with, or in subversion of, the relation intended to be established by the contract; or who fails to prove that he has performed or has always been ready and willing to perform the essential terms of the contract which are to be performed by him, other than terms the performance of which has been prevented or waived by the defendant. 41. if it is the contention of atpl that by the subsequent minutes of the meetings they were not required to perform an essential term of the contract of taking over the bond amount and interest thereon which had been borrowed by spdc and the sos in terms of the first agreement, quite clearly, atpl has become incapable of performing and violated the essential term of the second agreement and thus, could not have sought its specific performance. thus, the question of award of compensation under (2023) scc online 36 sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. section 21 of the specific relief act, 1963, as argued by atpl, does not arise. in kanshi ram vs. om prakash jawal & others19, the hon'ble supreme court held that it is well settled law that granting decree for specific performance of a contract of immovable property is not automatic. it is one of discretion to be exercised on sound principles. 42. the sole arbitrator found that spdc and the sos had the right to modify the terms of the agreement under section 63 of the indian contract act, 1872 and therefore, they were bound by the decision taken in those meetings. section 63 only recognises the right of every promisee to dispense with or remit, wholly or in part, the performance of the promise made to him, or may extend the time for such performance, or may accept instead of it any satisfaction which he thinks fit. however, it does not deal with the manner in which a party could dispense with it. this manner was clearly envisaged in clause 25 of the second agreement and, therefore it could have been done only in terms of clause 25 and in no other way. the reliance of the sole arbitrator to section 63 of the indian contract act, 1872 to validate the theory of modification of the second agreement by the subsequent minutes of the meeting was clearly misdirected. 43. it is seen that the sole arbitrator has taken in oral deposition of witnesses contrary to the clear language of the terms of the second agreement, the minutes of the meetings as well as various exchanges between the parties and by doing so held that (1996) 4 scc 593 sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. the terms of the second agreement had been completely varied so as to even do away with one of the essential obligations of atpl to take over the responsibility of the payment of bond amount, interest thereon and also provide bank guarantee for the same. it is settled law that a document speaks for itself and no oral evidence can be admitted to contradict, vary, add or subtract from its express terms. the finding of the sole arbitrator to that extent is contrary to the fundamental policy of indian law. it reflects patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, which goes to the root of the matter and not just mere misapplication of the law. prayer [e] on termination of the second agreement 44. the learned commercial court upheld the opinion of the sole arbitrator that neither the letter dated 26.02.2006 nor the letter dated 02.05.2008 had the effect of terminating the second agreement. it opined that the unilateral decision of the sos to issue letter dated 02.05.2008 cannot be considered to be the decision of spdc automatically as it was a separate legal entity. a perusal of the second agreement makes it apparent that there were three parties to it. the parties were separate legal entities who had entered the second agreement with specific obligations and liabilities. it also reflects that there was a specific provision for serving of notices to each of the parties. clause 28, which was invoked by atpl, is the arbitration clause which provided that all matters, questions, disputes or differences whatsoever arising between the parties in respect of construction, meaning, operation or effect of the contract or relating to the contract or relating to sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. breach thereof shall be settled by way of arbitration. it is contended that the second agreement does not contain a termination clause and therefore it could not have been terminated. in rajasthan breweries limited vs. the stroh brewery company , a division bench of delhi high court held that even in the absence of a specific clause authorising and enabling either party to terminate the agreement in the event of happening of the events specified therein, from the very nature of the agreement, which is private commercial transaction, the same could be terminated even without assigning any reason by serving a reasonable notice. the second agreement was an agreement for developing heps. the second agreement envisaged atpl developing, owning and operating these heps on boot basis for a period of 35 years to be renewed for another 35 years on mutually agreed terms and conditions. 70 years was the outer limit of the total period contemplated by the second agreement for atpl to operate the heps. atpl was to transfer the ownership of the three heps after the expiry of the period envisaged therein. the second agreement also contains certain essential conditions to be fulfilled within certain timelines. the first of which, as envisaged by the second agreement, was for spdc and the sos to transfer the ownership of the three heps to atpl as required by clause 1, which was admittedly done. the second essential condition was for atpl to take over the responsibility of payment of bond amount, interest thereon and also provide bank guarantee for the same within a timeline. admittedly, atpl has, till date, not taken 2000 scc online del 481 sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. over the responsibility of payment of bond amount, interest thereon or provided bank guarantee as envisaged by clause 2 of the second agreement. it would be equally absurd to suggest that one of the parties who had substantial stakes in the three heps and was therefore a signatory to the second agreement as an independent party, could not have terminated it on the failure of the defaulting party to fulfil its essential obligations merely because another party did not sign the termination letter issued by the other. there was no binding clause in the second agreement which provided that spdc and sos should only act jointly. failure of any of the parties to the second agreement to fulfil their respective essential obligations without which the purpose of the agreement may itself be unachievable should entitle the suffering party to determine the contract although there was no termination clause. the fact that the sos issued notice dated 22.06.2006 and thereafter, the letter of termination dated 02.05.2008, is not in dispute. the language of the notice as well as the letter of termination makes the intention of the sos to terminate the second agreement, certain. the failure of any of the parties to comply with the terms of the second agreement would lead to the dispute being referred to arbitration. spdc has not protested the termination by the sos. we are, thus, of the view that the sos had the right to terminate the second agreement on the failure of atpl to comply with any of its essential terms, even if there was no specific termination clause. the only question is whether the termination by the sos was justifiable. as we have held that atpl had failed to take over the responsibility of payment of the bond amount, interest thereon and also provide bank guarantee sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. for the same, which was an essential term of the second agreement, we are of the considered view that atpl was clearly in default. atpl was also in default for not submitting the dprs for chakungchu and ralong heps and the revised dpr for the revised rolep hep. the fact that atpl had clearly sought to run away from their most essential obligation under the second agreement by misleading the sole arbitrator into believing that the minutes of the meeting held with l&t on 15.10.2004 had modified the second agreement and thereby spdc and the sos had abandoned their right has also established beyond reasonable doubt that they were not interested in the three projects as agreed upon. thus, we are of the considered view that the termination of the second agreement by the sos was justified and we set aside the findings of the sole arbitrator as well as the commercial court granting prayer [e] in favour of atpl. prayers [b] & [c] 45. in view of what we have held above, the grant of prayer [b] and [c] in favour of atpl by the sole arbitrator as well as the commercial court cannot also stand. it is accordingly set aside. prayer [f] 46. prayer [f] was a claim for award of damages for a sum of ₹496,689,279/(rupees forty-nine crores, sixty-six lakhs, eightynine thousand, two hundred and seventy-nine only), in terms of paragraph 76 of the claim petition. in paragraph 76, atpl had pleaded that it had spent huge amounts for field investigation and survey, preparation of detailed project report, environmental sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. studies, geo-technical and geo-physical investigation, construction of temporary structures, drilling on the river, gauze and discharge system and cost of establishment, cost of site establishment and cost of consultancy for which it had spent ₹220,278,098/(rupees twenty-two crores, two lakhs, seventy-eight thousand and ninetyeight only), from 21.12.2002 till 02.05.2008. atpl therefore claimed the said amount along with interest @ 9% compounded annually on year to year basis amounting to ₹496,689,279/(rupees forty-nine crores, sixty-six lakhs, eighty-nine thousand, two hundred and seventy-nine only). 47. the second agreement was an agreement for implementation of the three heps on boot basis. the sole arbitrator directed the specific performance of the second agreement by spdc and the sos for implementation of three heps. spdc and the sos submitted that having sought for specific performance, atpl could not have asked for prayer [f] as well, as those were expenses which ought to have been incurred by atpl. they further submitted that atpl having quantified damages in lieu of specific performance in prayer [d], they could not have claimed damages on account of expenses incurred as claimed in prayer [f] as well. the sole arbitrator, however, granted prayer [a] for specific performance, the alternative prayer for quantified damages as claimed in prayer [d] and thereafter, also awarded the claim for expenses incurred in terms of prayer [f] without assigning any reason whatsoever for granting them. the direction upon spdc and sos to specifically perform the second agreement would necessarily presuppose that atpl would have to fulfil their obligations under it. sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. this would mean that atpl would have to incur all the expenses it reflected as their expenses in prayer [f] and sought to claim it from spdc and the sos. thus, having granted specific performance of the second agreement, as prayed for in prayer [a] by atpl, there was no reason for the sole arbitrator to grant prayer [f]. further, atpl had also claimed damages in prayer [d] at the rate of rs.1.5 crores per mw for 279 mw for the three projects. this prayer [d] having been granted in favour of atpl, it would also cover the expenses incurred by atpl for the implementation of the heps as per the second agreement as claimed in prayer [f]. there is, however, no cogent or justifiable reason or rationale to grant prayer [f] by the sole arbitrator. we, therefore, set aside the award of prayer [f] in favour of atpl. the award, thus, also suffers from non-application of mind. however, as we have not granted specific performance of the second agreement in terms of prayer [a] and damages in terms of prayer [d], we leave it to the parties to determine the actual expenses only that may have been incurred by atpl and whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, it is at all payable to atpl, by way of arbitration. needless to say, the issue of any counterclaim by spdc and sos to be considered in this regard, is also kept open. prayer [g] 48. in prayer [g], atpl had claimed award of damages for a sum of ₹471,353,405/(rupees forty-seven crores, thirteen lakhs, fifty-three thousand, four hundred and five only), in terms of paragraph 77 of the claim petition in which it had stated that as per sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. the reconciliation of the accounts done on 19.02.2003 the spdc was to pay atpl a sum of ₹21,22,48,608/(rupees twenty-one crores, twenty-two lakhs, forty-eight thousand, six hundred and eight only), which was lying with them. atpl also sought interest @9% per annum from 19.02.2003, till date of payment and it claimed that the total amount due as on the date of making the claim as ₹471,353,405/(rupees forty-seven crores, thirteen lakhs, fiftythree thousand, four hundred and five only). atpl also stated that the calculation of interest from 19.02.2003 on the said amount was shown in schedule b of the claim petition. clause 2 and clause 3 of the second agreement would be relevant to appreciate this claim which is extracted below:―2. in terms of the superseded agreement dated 18th april, 1999, the first party assisted by the third party have borrowed funds amounting to rupees 50.01 crores through bonds to finance the implementation of the said projects which is to be repaid along with the interest by the first party and the second party. the first and the second party have given a state government guarantee to secure the payment of principal and the interest thereof. it has now been agreed that the third party shall take over the responsibilities of the payment of bond amount upto an amount of rs.50.01 crores, and interest at the rate of 12.45% payable half-yearly and also interest already paid at a higher rate (13.75%) after reconciliation of account. reconciliation of accounts shall be completed within a period of sixty days from the date of signing of the agreement. the third party shall furnish necessary bank guarantee from a nationalized bank totalling upto rs.50.01 crores, as well as guarantees for payment of interest payable on outstanding principle amount within a period of 12 months of signing of this agreement. further, the third party and the first party, with the consent of the lenders, shall release state govt. guarantee within 12 months from the date of signing of this agreement. the third party shall also take over the responsibilities of payment of bond amount upto rs.50.01 crore together with the interest accrued and also the expenditures incurred on account of bond registration fees, stamp duty, fees paid to the trustee bank and advocates for registration of bond if any. 3. the balance amount of the money raised (rs.50.01 crores) lying with the first party and the second party shall be released to the third party against the equal amount of bank guarantee from any nationalized bank sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. to be submitted by the third party through the trustee bank (central bank of india).‖ 49. a bare perusal of the above two clauses reflects that spdc assisted by atpl had borrowed funds amounting to ₹50.01 crores through bonds to finance the implementation of the three projects which was liable to be repaid along with interest by the spdc and the sos in terms of the first agreement. it is also clear that spdc and the sos had given state government guarantee to secure the payments of principle and interest thereof. vide clause 2 of the second agreement, atpl agreed to take over the responsibilities of the payment of bond amount up to an amount of ₹50.01 crores; an interest at the rate of 12.45%, payable half yearly and also interest already paid at a higher rate (13.75 %) after reconciliation of accounts. reconciliation of accounts was to be completed within a period of sixty days from the date of signing of the second agreement. atpl was also required to furnish necessary bank guarantee from a nationalised bank totalling up to ₹50.01 crores, as well as guarantee for payment of interest payable on outstanding principal amount within a period of 12(twelve) months of signing of the second agreement. atpl and spdc, with the consent of the lenders, was to release state government guarantee within 12(twelve) months from the date of signing of the second agreement. atpl was also to take over the responsibility of payment of bond amount up to ₹50.01 crores together with interest accrued and also the expenditures incurred on account of bond registration fee, stamp duty, fees paid to the trustee bank and advocates for registration of bond if any. importantly, as agreed under clause 3 of the second agreement, the balance amount of the sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. money raised (₹50.01 crores) lying with spdc and the government of sikkim was to be released to atpl against equal amount of bank guarantee from any nationalised bank to be submitted by the atpl through the trustee bank (central bank of india). 50. reading clauses 2 and 3 of the second agreement together, it is amply clear that by entering upon the second agreement, spdc and the sos had sought to get out of the financial burden it had incurred under the superseded first agreement dated 18.04.1999. the balance money in terms of clause 3 of the second agreement was clearly payable only upon atpl taking over the sovereign debt of the sos and guarantee payment of the same along with the payment of interest and other expenses already borne. the sole arbitrator, however, directed the payment of damages in terms of prayer [g] without atpl taking over the sovereign debt of the sos and guaranteeing payment of the same along with the payment of interest and other expenses. this was not in terms of the second agreement and the sole arbitrator by awarding damages as claimed in prayer [g] made out a new contract between the parties, which is impermissible. further, the sole arbitrator proceeded on the basis that the second agreement was modified by the minutes of the meeting dated 15.10.2004 with l&t. however, even while doing so, the sole arbitrator went beyond even the minutes of the meeting dated 15.10.2004, which contemplated atpl paying the sos a sum of ₹50.01 crores in three tranches, which the sos would use to discharge its sovereign debt. it was also contemplated therein that spdc need not pay atpl the balance of the sum of ₹50.01 crores lying with it as it would be used sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. to service the interest on the debt till the repayment of the same from out of the monies received from atpl in three tranches. therefore, the sole arbitrator, while awarding prayer [g], seems to have gone not only beyond the terms of the second agreement but also beyond the terms of the minutes of the meeting dated 15.10.2004. it reflects complete non-application of mind as well and the decision on this aspect is irrational. prayer [h] 51. as atpl has not challenged the sole arbitrator's award declining to grant damages in terms of prayer [h], we do not interfere with it. prayers [j] & [k] 52. consequently, the award of interest in terms of prayer [j] and costs in terms of prayer [k] are also set aside. atpl may claim the actual cost incurred by them, as prayed for in prayer [f] and interest thereon by way of fresh arbitration, if they so desire. spdc and sos are at liberty to file their counter-claim in this regard. conclusion 53. in conclusion, the impugned judgment -to the extent it declines grant of prayers [d] and [f] in favour of atpl -is upheld. the finding that rolep hydro electric power co. ltd. and velankani renewable energy private limited were not necessary parties is upheld. the finding of the commercial court that the recital in second agreement makes it clear that the parties had in fact agreed to do the project on boot basis is upheld. the setting aside of the sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. finding of the sole arbitrator on issues no.9, 11 and 20 are also upheld. the finding of the commercial court, upholding the reasoning of the sole arbitrator that the letter dated 02.05.2008 did not terminate the contract (prayer [e]) and that the ground for termination was unjustified, is set aside. it is found that on the failure of atpl to fulfil the essential term of the second agreement of taking over the responsibility of bond amount, interest thereon as well as provide bank guarantee for the same, sos had rightly issued the letter dated 02.05.2008 terminating the contract. the finding of the commercial court that the petitioners therein (spdc and sos) had relinquished their claim for submission of bank guarantee in terms of the minutes of the meetings dated 09.03.2004, 26.04.2004 and 15.10.2004, is also set aside. it is held that the commercial court's finding that clause 25 of the second agreement did not disentitle the parties to amend it is grossly erroneous and against the plain and simple intention of clause 25. the language of clause 25 is clear and unambiguous. it is also held that the finding of the commercial court that the minutes of the meetings dated 09.03.2004, 26.04.2004 and 15.10.2004, were in the nature of addendum and supplemental is also grossly erroneous and against the clear and unambiguous language and intention of clause 25 of the second agreement. the finding of the commercial court, upholding the reasoning of the sole arbitrator that since spdc and sos had failed to perform their promise as per the minutes of the meetings dated 09.03.2004, 26.04.2004 and 15.10.2004, they had relinquished their claim for bank guarantee and therefore there was no question of breach by atpl, is also set aside. grant of specific sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. vs. amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. & amalgamated transpower (india) ltd. vs. m/s sikkim power development corporation ltd. & anr. performance (prayer [a]), perpetual injunction (prayer [b]) and mandatory injunction (prayer [c]) against spdc and sos by the sole arbitrator in favour of atpl, which was upheld by the commercial court, is set aside. the award of damages in favour of atpl, in terms of prayers [f], [g], [i] by the sole arbitrator are set aside. grant of interest and cost in terms of prayers [j] and [k], consequently, is also set aside. non-grant of prayer [h] by the sole arbitrator to atpl is not interfered with. atpl may, if they so desire, claim the actual cost incurred by them in terms of prayer [f] and interest thereon against spdc and the sos by way of fresh arbitration. spdc and sos are at liberty to file their counter-claim in this regard. consequently, arbitration appeal no. 1 of 2020 is allowed to the extent above, while arbitration appeal no. 1 of 2021 preferred by atpl stands dismissed. 54. consequently, the amount deposited by spdc and sos in terms of the order of the hon'ble supreme court dated 14.10.2022 in special leave petition (civil) no. 18211-18212 of 2022, shall be released along with interest accrued thereon. 55. the two appeals stand disposed of accordingly. 56. parties to bear their respective cost.
