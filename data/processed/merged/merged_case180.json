The appellants have filed the present intra-court appeals under Section 37(1)(b) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereafter 'the A&C Act') read with Section 13 of the  Commercial Courts Act, 2015 impugning a common judgment dated 22.06.2020 (hereafter 'the impugned judgment') delivered by the learned Single Judge in petitions filed by the respondent (hereafter 'S&W') under Section 9 of the A&C Act, being Sterling and Wilson International FZE v. Sunshakti Solar Power Projects Private Limited & Ors. [O.M.P (I) (COMM.) 460/2018] and Sterling and Wilson International FZE v. Skypower Solar India Private Limited & Ors. [O.M.P (I) (COMM.) 461/2018].\n2. The appellants in the present appeals belong to a Group of Companies (hereafter 'the Skypower Group'). The appellant in FAO(OS) (COMM) 29/2022 was arrayed as respondent no.1, and the appellants in FAO(OS) (COMM)No. 30/2022 were arrayed as respondent nos. 2 to 6 in OMP (I) (COMM) 461/2018. \n3. Appellant no.1 in FAO (OS) (COMM.) 30/2022, Skypower Holdings LLC (hereafter also referred to as 'SHL'), is the parent company of Skypower Solar India Private Limited (hereafter also referred to as 'SIPL'), which is the appellant in FAO(OS) 29/2022. SIPL is a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, having its registered office at 16A/20, W.E.A. Main Ajmal Khan Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi-110005. \n4. Skypower Southeast Asia Holdings 2 Ltd., appellant no. 3 in FAO(OS)(COMM)No.30/2022 (hereafter also referred to as 'Holdings 2 Ltd.'), is a company incorporated under the laws of Mauritius and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Skypower Global Cooperatief U.A (hereafter also referred to as 'SGC'). SGC is a company incorporated under the laws of Netherlands and was arrayed as original respondent no.3 in OMP (I) (COMM) 461/2018. Holdings 2 Ltd. also holds 0.81% of the paid-up share capital in SIPL, in addition to holding the entire shareholding of Skypower Southeast Asia Holdings 4 Ltd. (hereafter also referred to as 'Holdings 4 Ltd.').\n5. Holdings 4 Ltd. (original respondent no.5), is a company registered in Mauritius. It holds the entire shareholding of Skypower Southeast Asia IV Investments Ltd. (hereafter also referred to 'IV Investments Ltd.'), arrayed as original respondent no.6 and having 99.19% holding in SIPL. \n6. Skypower Global Canada (hereafter 'Skypower Canada') and CIM Group (hereafter 'CIM') were arrayed as respondent nos.7 and 8 respectively in O.M.P (I) (COMM.) 461/2018 but are not parties to the present appeals. \n7. The appellants, Skypower Canada, and CIM Group are hereafter also referred to as 'the Skypower Entities'. \n8. S&W had filed a petition under Section 9 of the A&C Act and was the petitioner in the original petition OMP(I)(COMM) 461/2018. \n9. S&W is an affiliate of Sterling and Wilson Private Limited (hereafter 'SWPL'), which is an Indian entity incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013.\n10. It is submitted by the parties in the present appeals that disputes in respect of Sunshakti Solar Power Projects Private Limited, which were subject matter of O.M.P (I) (COMM.) 460/2018, have been settled. The present appeals are confined to the interim measures of protection granted in OMP(I)(COMM) 461/2018, by the impugned judgement. \n11. By way of the impugned judgment, the learned Single Judge had, inter alia, directed the appellants [original respondent nos.1 to 6 in O.M.P (I) (COMM.) 461/2018] to furnish a bank guarantee to secure a sum equal to 50% of the total of USD 34,133,214 within a period of four weeks, from the date of the impugned judgment to the satisfaction of the Registrar of this Court. \nFACTUAL CONTEXT 12. S&W is a company incorporated under the laws of United Arab Emirates, having its registered office at P.O Box No.54811, Dubai, United Arab Emirates and is a part of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group. S&W is, inter alia, engaged in the business of supply of solar modules, PV (Photovalatic) Inverters, and trackers that are needed for commissioning solar power projects. It is stated that S&W has a commercial presence in the trade of MEP (mechanical, electrical and plumbing) and solar materials in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. \n13. SIPL is the owner of a 50MW capacity solar power plant and attendant facilities at Village Chhirbel, Khandwa District, Madhya Pradesh (hereafter 'the Project').\n14. S&W, inter alia, claims that it is entitled to receive the supply price of USD 30,719,892.60. S&W claims that it had supplied solar module PV inverters and other equipment (Offshore Supplies) to SIPL for commissioning the Project in terms of the Offshore Supply Agreement dated 19.05.2017 (hereafter 'the OSA'). In terms of the OSA, S&W was entitled to 90% of the price of the Offshore Supplies (Supply Price), amounting to USD 30,719,892.60 on achievement of the Commercial Operation Date (COD) of the Project. The COD was achieved on 05.09.2017 and accordingly, S&W had raised an invoice for 90% of the Supply Price. The said invoice was received by SIPL on 16.11.2017. S&W claims that SIPL has acted in breach of the OSA and had not paid the invoiced amount within a period of fourteen days of the receipt of the invoice, as agreed. According to S&W, SIPL's obligation to pay the Supply Price was independent of any other contractual arrangement between SIPL (or its affiliated entities) with SWPL or any of its group entities. \n15. S&W further alleges that SIPL in collusion with other Skypower Entities had breached its obligation of ensuring that an adequate security (Offshore Security) is created in the form of pledge of 100% shares directly held by SGC (original respondent no.3) and Holdings 4 Ltd. (original respondent no.4), which directly or indirectly hold 100% of the paid-up capital of SIPL. \n16. The appellants dispute the aforesaid claims. According to the appellants, the OSA is not independent of the other agreements and the documents executed between some of the Skypower Entities and SWPL. \n17. It is stated that the concerned state instrumentalities of Madhya Pradesh had invited bids for setting up of solar power plants. Some of the Skypower Entities had participated in the bids and were successful. Accordingly, they were permitted to set up 57.5MWP (50.0 MW AC) Photovoltaic Solar Plant with tracker technologies at Chirwel, Madhya Pradesh. The MP Power Management Company Limited (hereafter 'State Discom') and SIPL along with two other affiliated companies entered into a Power Purchase Agreement dated 18.09.2015.\n18. The Project included units and auxiliaries such as water supply, treatment or storage facilities, bays for transmission system in the switchyard, dedicated transmission line up to the delivery point, buildings, structures, equipment, plant and machinery and other facilities for generation and supply of power in terms of the Power Purchase Agreement. SIPL claims that at the material time, SWPL and S&W represented to the concerned Skypower Entities that they had the experience, expertise, capability and know-how for implementing the Project. \n19. The appellants claim that the concerned Skypower Entities entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Heads of Terms (HOT) dated 18.04.2016 with SWPL and an Amended HOT dated 19.12.2016 in respect of the design, supply, construction, development and commissioning of the Project. In terms of the Amended HOT, it was agreed that the Offshore Supplies for the project would be undertaken by an Offshore affiliate of SWPL. According to the appellants, it was agreed that separate contracts would be entered into for the Offshore Supplies and other supplies but SWPL would undertake the entire responsibility for the same. The appellants contend that it was always understood that works in relation to the Project would be undertaken by SWPL and S&W as a single point entity. It claims that reading of all the agreements indicates that the Project was awarded to the Sterling and Wilson Group (SWPL and S&W) on a turn key basis. The Amended HOT also stipulate the same. The appellants claim that on 19.05.2017, the several contractual documents including the OSA were entered into for executing the Project. These also included six contractual documents between SIPL and SWPL (Development Agreement, Service Contract, Civil Works Contract, Onshore Supply Agreement, Operation and Management Agreement, Wrap Agreement). The OSA was signed only by SIPL and S&W. Although, other entities were not signatories to the Offshore Supply Agreements, S&W had executed a Side Letter on Liquidated Damages, indemnity and composite costs, which were linked to other contractual documents. \n20. According to the appellants, although separate documents were executed for Onshore Contracts and Offshore Supplies, it was always understood and agreed between the parties that these separate contractual agreements were a part of a single consolidated contract, which would be executed by SWPL and its affiliate entities. \n21. The appellants claim that SWPL and its affiliates had breached the terms of the agreements. Although the appellants do not deny receipt of the Offshore Supplies, they dispute their obligation to pay for the same on account of claims in respect of performance of other agreements, which were allegedly breached. \n22. Since the invoices submitted by S&W had not been paid, S&W sent a letter dated 21.05.2018 to SIPL communicating that it had invoked the dispute resolution mechanism under Clause 23.1.2 of the OSA. \n23. SIPL responded by a letter dated 19.06.2018 declining to make the payment on the ground that SWPL had not complied with its material obligations under the Onshore EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) Contracts including the Wrap Agreement. It claimed that as per the Side Letter on Liquidated Damages executed by S&W, it was not liable to pay the invoiced amount as claimed. \n24. Thereafter, discussions were held, inter alia, between SIPL and S&W. However, the disputes remained unresolved. On 28.07.2018, S&W sent an e-mail to SIPL accepting the addition of a dispute resolution provision, that is, arbitration according to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre Rules (hereafter 'the SIAC Rules') to be included in the OSA. \n25. Subsequently, on 18.09.2018, SIPL sent an e-mail to S&W claiming that it had scheduled diligence activities for the Project. S&W replied on 24.08.2018 stating that no sale will be permitted by it till it is paid its legitimate dues. \n26. On 03.10.2018 SIPL responded to S&W's e-mails, requesting for details pertaining to the indemnity claims in respect of the Project and the OSA. Further, on 2.11.2018, S&W sent a letter to SIPL refuting the objections put forth by it in its letter dated 27.07.2018. It is S&W's case that the provisions of the Indemnity Letter are in respect of the payment of taxes and the letter is not relevant to the obligation to pay the Offshore Supply Price. \n27. It is submitted that on 10.11.2018, a representative of a potential buyer of SIPL's affiliate project addressed an e-mail to S&W. The said buyer, inter alia, sought details of S&W's outstanding claims against SIPL stating that the same were sought for undertaking due diligence of the said Project. \n28. S&W claims that after the lapse of 12 months from receiving the invoices, on 5.12.2018, SIPL asked S&W to rescind and withdraw the same on the ground that the invoices were not in accordance with the provisions of the OSA and the Onshore EPC Contracts on account of alleged deficiencies in the Project. \n29. On 12.12.2018, S&W refuted the claims raised by SIPL in its letter dated 05.12.2018, and reiterated its claim for payment of 90% of the Offshore Supply Price. \n30. In view of the aforesaid dispute, S&W commenced arbitration against original respondent nos.1 to 8 on 16.03.2019, to be conducted by SIAC. \n31. Thereafter, S&W filed a petition under Section 9 of the A&C Act being OMP (1) COMM. 461/2018 titled Sterling & Wilson International FZE v. Skypower Solar India Private Limited and Others, (arraying the appellants in the present appeals as respondent nos.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) and seeking an interim injunction in order to secure its claim, while the arbitral proceedings were pending. \n32. By an order dated 18.12.2018, a learned Single Judge of this Court granted temporary injunction to S&W against the appellants (original respondent nos.1 to 6) in terms of prayer (c) of the said petition. In terms of the said prayer the appellants and its directors, officers, servants, agents were restrained from creating third party rights and/or otherwise encumbering the Project. The appellants, Skypower Canada and CIM, were also directed to disclose the extent of shareholdings of each of their companies. The order was subsequently modified on 11.01.2019 to read as under:\n\"I.A. No. 303/2018 (for modification of the order dated 18.12.2018)\n1. This application is allowed and the expression 'Respondent no. 1' written in the third line of paragraph 3 of the order dated 18.12.2018 will be read as 'Respondent no.4'. \n2. Also, the figure of 'USD 31,250,711.70' written in paragraph 1 of the order be read as 'USD 34,723,013', without in any manner observing the merits of the cases of the respective parties. \n3. I.A. stands disposed of.\" \n33. Thereafter, by an order dated 21.01.2019, the learned Single Judge recorded that the entire shareholding of Holdings 2 Ltd. is held by SGC and directed that there will be no further transfer of the said shareholdings. \n34. On 22.06.2020, the learned Single Judge passed the impugned judgment, partly allowing the prayer or for interim relief and directed the original respondents (appellants, Skypower Canada and CIM) to furnish a Bank Guarantee for 50% of the claim against the Offshore Supply Price. The learned Single Judge also restrained SGC, Holdings 4 Ltd. and IV Investment Ltd. from transferring, disposing off, creating a charge and/or encumbering, in any manner their shares and other securities held by them in SIPL, SGC and Holdings 4 Ltd.\n35. Aggrieved, the appellants have filed the present appeals. \nREASONING AND CONCLUSION 36. At the outset it is necessary to note that the question whether the court has the jurisdiction to order interim measures for protection under Section 9 of the A&C Act in aid of the arbitral proceedings conducted overseas, was not agitated before this Court. The appellants concede that the learned Single Judge has rightly held that this Court has the jurisdiction to issue interim orders in aid of arbitration being conducted overseas under the aegis of the SIAC and according to its Rules. \n37. The memoranda of appeals mention several grounds, other than the impugned order falls foul of the principles under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereafter 'the CPC'), for assailing the impugned order. But, as noted above, the same were not pressed. It is relevant to note that one of the questions raised before the learned Single Judge was whether the court could issue any orders of interim measures of protection, under Section 9 of the A&C Act against the appellants in FAO(OS)(COMM) 30/2022, as they were not signatories to the Arbitration Agreement. The learned Single Judge referred to various principles including the Group of Companies Doctrine as accepted by the Supreme Court in Chloro Controls India Private Limited v. Severn Trent Water Purification Inc. & Ors.1, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited v. Canara Bank & Ors.2 and Ameet Lalchand Shah & Ors. v. Rishabh Enterprises & Anr.3 and expressed a prima facie view that in the given facts, even though the said appellants were not signatories to the arbitration agreement, they could be compelled to arbitrate. The said issue - which was stoutly contested before the learned Single Judge - was not pressed in these appeals. However, it is necessary to record that although, Mr Dayan Krishnan had not pressed the said issue before us, he reserved the rights of the appellants to raise the same before the learned Arbitral Tribunal. \n38. The controversy in the present appeals is in a narrow compass. Mr Dayan Krishnan and Mr Nayar, learned senior counsels, who advanced submissions on behalf of the appellants, confined these appeals to assailing the direction issued for submission of a bank guarantee equivalent to 50% of the amounts claimed by S&W. Further, they circumscribed the challenge by founding the same on a singular (2013) 1 SCC 641 2019 SCC OnLine SC 995 (2018) 15 SCC 678 ground that the said direction is contrary to the principles under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC. \n39. In view of the above, the only question to be addressed by this Court is whether the impugned directions to furnish a Bank Guarantee equivalent to 50% of the amount claimed by the respondent, can be faulted on the ground that the conditions for issuing such a direction as stipulated under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC, are not satisfied. \n40. The appellants contend that the direction to furnish a Bank Guarantee to secure S&W's claims amounts to attachment before decree and no such direction can be issued without satisfying the conditions for issuing such an order under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC. Mr. Wadhwa, the learned senior counsel appearing for S&W countered the aforesaid contention and urged that the findings of the learned Single Judge clearly warrant issuance of such directions. \n41. Mr Wadhwa, referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in Essar House Private Limited v. Arcellor Mittal Nippon Steel India Limited4 and submitted that the powers of a court under Section 9 of the A&C Act are wider than the powers under the provisions of the CPC. He further emphasized that the Supreme Court had approved the view of this Court in Ajay Singh & Ors. v. Kal Airways Private Limited & Ors.5 as well as the Bombay High Court in Jagdish Ahuja & Anr. v.\n2022 SCC OnLine SC 1219 2017 SCC OnLine Del 8934 Cupino Limited6 and Valentine Maritime Ltd. v. Kreuz Subsea Pte Limited & Anr.7. He also relied on the observations of the Supreme Court to the effect that if a strong prima facie case is made out and the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioner, the court would not withhold relief on a mere technicality of absence of averments. In addition, he referred to the decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. v. Sterlite Technologies Limited.8.\n42. Before proceeding further, it would be relevant to refer to the findings of the learned Single Judge on which the impugned directions rest. The learned Single Judge had considered Clause 12.2.1 of the OSA and noted that in terms of the said agreement, S&W was entitled to 90% of the Offshore Supply Price on achieving of the COD. It was further entitled to the remaining 10% of the Offshore Supply Price on Final Acceptance. The Court noted that the commercial operations had commenced, and admittedly, the said milestones were achieved. This was also reflected by the certificates issued by the State Discom. Thus, the Court concluded that, prima facie, S&W would be entitled to 90% of the Offshore Supply Price. The Court noted that the OSA expressly recorded that it was a complete agreement. And, S&W was not in breach of its obligations in respect of the Offshore supplies. \n2020 SCC OnLine Bom 849 2021 SCC OnLine Bom 75 2016 SCC OnLine Del 604 43. In view of the above, the learned Single Judge accepted that S&W had established a prima facie case in its favour. In view of the undisputed facts, the learned Single Judge returned findings on a prima facie basis, to the following effect:\n(i) that S&W's obligations under the OSA were limited to the Offshore supplies;\n(ii) that S&W had fulfilled its obligations;\n(iii) that the cover of Offshore Security cover was not provided to S&W;\n(iv) that the Offshore Supply Price payable to S&W was required be secured by the shareholding of Holdings 2 Ltd.\n(respondent no.4), which was held by SGC (respondent no.3). Holdings 4 Ltd. was a holding company for SIPL (respondent no.1) and the security in respect of the shares of Holdings 4 Ltd. would effectively secure S&W by an indirect control of the shareholding of SIPL, despite S&W completing its supplies which were used in setting up a project and for achieving the COD, no amount was paid to S&W; and (v) that the OSA between S&W and SIPL was independently executed. \n44. The learned Single Judge found that the balance of convenience was in favour of S&W. The Offshore Supply Price payable to S&W was required to be secured by the shareholding of Holdings 2 Ltd.\n(respondent no.4), which was held by SGC (respondent no.3). Holdings 2 Ltd. was the holding company of SIPL and securing the shares of Holdings 2 Ltd. would effectively secure the indirect control of the shareholding of SIPL. However, contrary to the agreement between the parties, the said security was not created. The learned Single Judge found that S&W was unsecured in respect of the Offshore Supplies and was not protected by the hypothecation deed or the equitable mortgage documents. \n45. The learned Single Judge additionally observed that the interim directions were required to be issued against the non-signatories [appellant nos. 1 to 5 in FAO(OS)(COMM) 30/2022 as well as Skypower Canada and CIM Group, which were arrayed as respondent nos. 7 & 8 in OMP(I) (COMM) 461/2018 but are not parties to the present appeals]. The learned Single Judge reasoned that the change in the shareholding pattern of SIPL would have a material bearing on the arbitration proceedings and the execution of the arbitral award that may be rendered on culmination of the arbitral proceedings. \n46. In view of the above, the learned Single Judge interdicted respondent no.3 (SGC), respondent no.5 (Holdings 4 Ltd.) and respondent no.6 (IV Investments Ltd.) from transferring, disposing of, creating a charge and/or encumbering in any manner the shares and securities held by them in respondent nos.1, 4 and 6 (SIPL, Holdings 2 Ltd. and IV Investments Ltd.). As noticed at the outset, the appellants have not pressed their challenge to the said directions. \n47. There is no finding (prima facie or otherwise) by the learned Single Judge that, if S&W prevails in the arbitral proceedings, it would be unable to enforce the arbitral award in its favour if the amounts as claimed are not secured. There is no allegation that appellant nos. 2 to 6 are alienating their assets and are acting in a manner that would frustrate the enforcement of an arbitral award that may be delivered in favour of S&W.\n48. Mr Darpan Wadhwa, learned senior counsel appearing for S&W contended that powers to pass interim measures of protection under Section 9 of the A&C Act are wide and not constrained by the provisions of the CPC. He submitted that the learned Single Judge had clearly made observations to the effect that S&W was unsecured; it had established a prima facie case; and the balance of convenience was in its favour. He submitted that in view of the aforesaid prima facie findings, it was not necessary for S&W to establish that the appellants were acting in a manner that would frustrate the arbitral award that may be in its favour. \n49. We have carefully examined the impugned judgment. Whilst, the learned Single Judge has found that S&W has established a prima facie case and that the balance of convenience is also in its favour, there is no finding to the effect that appellant nos. 2 to 6 are alienating their assets or would do so and frustrate S&W's recourse to enforce the arbitral award if it prevails in the arbitral proceedings. There is no finding that absent an order for securing the amounts in dispute, S&W would be unable to enforce the Arbitral Award that may be made in its favour. The learned Single Judge had accepted that any change in the shareholding pattern of original respondents no.2 to 8 would have a bearing on the arbitration proceedings as well as the execution of the Arbitral Award. The observations to the said effect are contained in paragraph 74 of the impugned judgment, which reads as under:\n\"74. It is clear that under Section 9, the Court has the power to issue interim directions to non-parties to Arbitration Agreement. Keeping in view the judgements referred to above, in my opinion, Petitioner is right in its contention that if the shareholding pattern of Respondents changes by transferring shares, there is likelihood of changes in the management, overall control and the decision making power. This would have a significant bearing on the Arbitration Proceedings as well as the ultimate execution of the Award. Thus, interim directions are required to be issued against Respondent Nos. 2 to 8. The judgments relied upon by Respondents are distinguishable on the facts of this case and thus of no avail to them.\"\n50. In view of the above, the learned Single Judge had issued directions interdicting original respondent nos. 3, 5 and 6 (SGC, Holdings 4 Ltd. and IV Investments Ltd.) from transferring, disposing of, creating a charge and/or encumbering their shares or any securities by original respondent nos.1, 4 and 6 (SIPL, Holdings 2 Ltd. and IV Investments Ltd.) in any manner. As noted above, there are no findings to the effect that if the original respondent nos. 2 to 8 do not secure S&W by furnishing a Bank Guarantee, the enforcement of an Arbitral Award in favour of S&W would be frustrated. However, the learned Single Judge had observed that if S&W succeeded in securing an award in its favour, realization of its dues from the Project \"may be a long drawn battle and may also involve complications due to interest of the State Discoms in the same.\"\n51. Paragraph 85 of the impugned judgement is relevant and is set out below: \n\"85. Prima facie, it appears that the Hypothecation Deed does not secure the Offshore Supply Price. Learned Senior Counsels for the Petitioner are also right in their contention that the project has liabilities towards the State Discoms under the various PPAs and is also encumbered with SWPL. In case the Petitioner succeeds in getting an Award in its favour, realization of its dues from the Project may be a long drawn battle and may also involve complications due to the interest of the State Discoms in the same. This Court cannot lose sight of the undisputed fact that the project has utilized the Offshore Supplies made by the Petitioner and is functional and generating revenue for the Respondents. The dues of the Petitioner under the OSA need to be secured and preserved as a step in aid of Arbitration, which is the purpose and intent of the Legislature in enacting Section 9 of the Act.\"\n52. It is material to note that there is no cavil that the direction issued by the learned Single Judge for furnishing the Bank Guarantee is in the nature of an order under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of CPC. \n53. The question as to the conditions required to be satisfied for issuance of orders in the nature of attachment before decree, for securing the claims made by a party, under Section 9 of the A&C Act, has been the subject matter of several decisions. \n54. Before discussing the same, it would be relevant to refer to Section 9(1) of the A&C Act. The same is reproduced below:\n\"Interim measures, etc. by Court.--(1) A party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with Section 36, apply to a court:--\n(i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely:--\n(a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement;\n(b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration;\n(c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence;\n(d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver;\n(e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the Court to be just and convenient, and the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it.\"\n55. The last limb of Section 9(1) of the A&C Act, expressly provides that the courts would have the same powers for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it. Thus, the powers to be exercised under Section 9 of the A&C Act are expressly qualified to be limited to those that are available to a court in respect of any proceedings before it. To put it conversely Section 9 of the A&C Act does not confer any additional powers, which are otherwise not available in relation to proceedings before courts. \n56. In Firm Ashok Traders & Anr. v. Gurmukh Das Saluja & Ors.9, the Supreme Court had referred to Section 9 of the A&C Act and had observed as under:\n\"13. ...The reliefs which the Court may allow to a party under clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 9 flow from the power vesting in the Court exercisable by reference to \"contemplated\", \"pending\" or \"completed\" arbitral proceedings. The Court is conferred with the same power for making the specified orders as it has for the purpose of and in relation to any proceedings before it though the venue of the proceedings in relation to which the power under Section 9 is sought to be exercised is the Arbitral Tribunal...\"\n57. In Adhunik Steels Ltd. v. Orissa Manganese and Minerals (P) Ltd.10, the Supreme Court had observed as under:\n\"11. It is true that Section 9 of the Act speaks of the court by way of an interim measure passing an order for protection, for the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods, which are the subject-matter of the arbitration (2004) 3 SCC 155 (2007) 7 SCC 125 agreement and such interim measure of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient. The grant of an interim prohibitory injunction or an interim mandatory injunction are governed by well-known rules and it is difficult to imagine that the legislature while enacting Section 9 of the Act intended to make a provision which was dehors the accepted principles that governed the grant of an interim injunction. Same is the position regarding the appointment of a receiver since the position regarding the appointment of a receiver since the section itself brings in the concept of \"just and convenient\" while speaking of passing any interim measure of protection. The concluding words of the section, \"and the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose and in relation to any proceedings before it\" also suggest that the normal rules that govern the court in the grant of interim orders is not sought to be jettisoned by the provision. \nMoreover, when a party is given a right to approach an ordinary court of the country without providing a special procedure or a special set of rules in that behalf, the ordinary rules followed by that court would govern the exercise of power conferred by the Act. On that basis also, it is not possible to keep out the concept of balance of convenience, prima facie case, irreparable injury and the concept of just and convenient while passing interim measures under Section 9 of the Act.\"\n58. In Natrip Implementation Society v. IVRCL Limited11, a Single Judge of this Court (one of us, Vibhu Bakhru, J.) had in the context of the powers to secure an amount claimed prior to the passing of the arbitral award observed as under:\n\"17. It is also clear from the opening sentence of section 9(1)(ii) of the Act that the measures that can be ordered are \"interim measures of protection\". It, plainly, follows that the principles that would be applicable for grant of orders under section 9(1)(ii) of the Act would be the principles 2016 SCC OnLine Del 5023 that may be applicable to grant of such orders as are applicable to proceedings before the Court. An order for securing the amount claimed prior to an arbitral award is essentially in the nature of attachment before judgement and thus, the principles as applicable for grant of such orders in proceedings before the Court - that is, as applicable under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereafter 'the CPC') - would be equally applicable for grant of relief under Sections 9(1)(ii)(b) or 17(1)(ii)(b) of the Act (as amended by Act 3 of 2016) prior to the publishing of the arbitral award. In Rite Approach Group Ltd. v. Rosoboronexport: 111 (2004) DLT 816, Global Company v. M/s National Fertilizers Ltd.: AIR 1998 Delhi 397 and Gatx India Pvt Ltd. (supra), this Court held that it would take guidance from the principles given in Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC for grant of orders under Section 9 of the Act.\n18. It is also well settled that the granting of orders under section 9 of the Act are discretionary in nature and equitable considerations would apply for grant of such orders. Thus, orders as prayed under section 9(1) of the Act would be granted only if it is necessary and equitable. \nxxxx xxxx xxxx 20. In order for the court to exercise its powers under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC, it is necessary that twin conditions be satisfied. First, that the plaintiff establishes a reasonably strong prima facie case for succeeding in the suit; and second, that the court is prima facie satisfied that the defendant is acting in a manner so as to defeat the realisation of the decree that ultimately may be passed. The object of Sections 9(1)(ii)(b) and 17(1)(ii)(b) of the Act is similar to the object of order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC. The Arbitral Tribunal while exercising powers under Section 17(1)(ii)(b) of the Act or the Court while exercising power under Section 9(1)(ii)(b) of the Act must be satisfied that it is necessary to pass order to secure the amount in dispute. Such orders cannot be passed mechanically. Further, the object of the order would be to prevent the party against whom the claim has been made from dispersing its assets or from acting in a manner to so as to frustrate the award that may be passed.\"\n59. In Nimbus Communication Ltd. v. Board of Control for Cricket in India & Anr.12 the Bombay High Court held as under:--\n\"22. The judgment of the Supreme Court in Adhunik Steels has noted the earlier decision in Arvind Constructions which holds that since section 9 is a power which is conferred under a special statute, but which is exercisable by an ordinary Court without laying down a special condition for the exercise of the power or a special procedure, the general rules of procedure of the Court would apply. Consequently, where an injunction is sought under section 9 the power of the Court to grant that injunction cannot be exercised independent of the principles which have been laid down to govern the grant of interim injunctions particularly in the context of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. The Court, consequently would be obligated to consider as to whether there exists a prima facie case, the balance of convenience and irreparable injury in deciding whether it would be just and convenient to grant an order of injunction. Section 9, specifically provides in sub-clause (d) of clause (ii) for the grant of an interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver. As regards sub-clause (b) of clause (ii) the interim measure of protection is to secure the amount in dispute in the arbitration. The underlying object of Order 38 Rule 5 is to confer upon the Court an enabling power to require a defendant to provide security of an extent and value as may be sufficient to satisfy the decree that may be passed in favour of the plaintiff. The exercise of the power to order that security should be furnished is, however, preconditioned by the requirement of the satisfaction of the Court that the defendant is about to alienate the property or remove it beyond the limits of the Court with an intent to obstruct or delay execution of the decree that may be 2012 SCC OnLine Bom 287 passed against him. In view of the decisions of the Supreme Court both in Arvind Constructions and Adhunik Steels, it would not be possible to subscribe to the position that the power to grant an interim measure of protection under section 9(ii)(b) is completely independent of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 or that the exercise of that power is untrammelled by the Code. The basic principle which emerges from both the judgments of the Supreme Court is that though the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is a special statute, section 9 does not either attach a special condition for the exercise of the power nor does it embody a special form of procedure for the exercise of the power by the Court. The second aspect of the provision which has been noted by the Supreme Court is the concluding part of section 9 under which it has been specified that the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of and in relation to any proceedings before it. This has been interpreted in both the judgments to mean that the normal rules that govern the Court in the grant of an interlocutory order are not jettisoned by the provision. The judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in National Shipping Company (supra) notes that though the power by section 9(ii)(b) is wide, it has to be governed by the paramount consideration that a party which has a claim adjudicated in its favour ultimately by the arbitrator should be in a position to obtain the fruits of the arbitration while executing the award. The Division Bench noted that the power being of a drastic nature, a direction to secure the amount claimed in the arbitration petition should not be issued merely on the merits of the claim, unless a denial of the order would result in grave injustice to the party seeking a protective order. The obstructive conduct of the party against whom such a direction is sought was regarded as being a material consideration. However, the view of the Division Bench of this Court that the exercise of power under section 9(ii)(b) is not controlled by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 cannot stand in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Adhunik Steels\". \n(Emphasis added) \n60. In Ajay Singh & Ors. v. Kal Airways Private Limited5, the Co- ordinate Bench of this Court had observed as under:\n\"27. Though apparently, there seem to be two divergent strands of thought, in judicial thinking, this court is of the opinion that the matter is one of the weight to be given to the materials on record, a fact dependent exercise, rather than of principle. That Section 9 grants wide powers to the courts in fashioning an appropriate interim order, is apparent from its text. Nevertheless, what the authorities stress is that the exercise of such power should be principled, premised on some known guidelines - therefore, the analogy of Orders 38 and 39. Equally, the court should not find itself unduly bound by the text of those provisions rather it is to follow the underlying principles...\" \n(Emphasis added) \n61. In National Highway Authority of India v. Punjab National Bank & Ors.13, a Division Bench of this Court considered the petition of the respondent bank for disbursement of payment, which it claimed was due to it notwithstanding the arbitrable disputes. In that case the concession agreement expressly provided the obligation to make certain payment on termination of the concession agreement. This Court was of the view that notwithstanding the controversy and disputes regarding termination of the agreement in question, undisputedly, such demands would be payable. Accordingly, this Court directed deposit of the said amount in a petition filed under Section 9 of the A&C Act. In regard to 2017 SCC OnLine Del 11312 the exercise of powers under Section 9 of the A&C Act, this Court observed as under:\n\"37. On the question of exercise of power under Section 9 of the A&C Act, we have already referred to Clauses 37.3.1 of the Concessionaire Agreement which is an express and mandatory provision when said agreement is terminated on account of concessionaire fault. We have also referred to Clauses 3.2 and 4.2 of the tripartite Escrow Agreement which refers to termination payment. To accept the plea of NHAI that section 9 of the A&C Act cannot be invoked, would negate and obliterate the aforesaid Clauses and their effect. In the aforesaid circumstances the ratio of decision of the Division Bench of this Court in Value Source Mercantile Limited v. Span Mechnotronix Limited:\n(2014) 143 DRJ 505, is apposite, if not definite and conclusive. Referring to Section 9 of the A&C Act, this decision emphasized that the said provision uses the expression 'interim measure of protection' as distinct from the expression 'temporary injunction' used in Rules 1 and 2 of Order XXXIX of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. \nInterim injunction is one of the measures or orders prescribed in Clause (d) to Section 9(ii) of the A&C Act, albeit a party to the arbitration agreement is entitled to apply for an seek 'interim measure of protection'. Clause (e) to Section 9(ii) is a residuary power of the court to issue or direct other \"interim measures of protection\". Thus, the court has the power to issue or direct other interim measurers of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient. Section 9 encompass the power of making orders as the Civil Court has for the purpose of, and in relation to any proceedings before it. This decision refers to Rule 10 of Order XXXIX of the aforesaid Code which empowers the Court to direct to deposit payment of the admitted amount. Therefore the court exercising power under Section 9 of the A&C Act has the same power as that of a civil court during pendency of the suit.\"\n62. As noted at the outset, there is no dispute that the directions issued by the learned Single Judge to furnish the Bank Guarantee to partly secure the claims of S&W are in the nature of an order under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC. Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC, is set out below:\n\"5. Where defendant may be called upon to furnish security for production of property.-- (1) Where at any stage of a suit, the Court is satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise, that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against him,--\n(a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property, or (b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court , the Court may direct the defendant, within a time to be fixed by it, either to furnish security, in such sum as may be specified in the order, to produce and place at the disposal of the Court, when required, the said property or the value of the same, or such portion thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy the decree, or to appear and show cause why he should not furnish security. (2) The plaintiff shall, unless the Court otherwise directs, specify the property required to be attached and the estimated value thereof. \n(3) The Court may also in the order direct the conditional attachment of the whole or any portion of the property so specified. \n(4) If an order of attachment is made without complying with the provisions of sub-rule (1) of this rule, such attachment shall be void.\"\n63. The principle for granting orders under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC are now well settled. In Raman Tech. & Process Engineering Co. & Anr. v. Solanki Traders14, the Supreme Court had observed that the power under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 are drastic and extraordinary powers and are required to be used sparingly and in accordance with the rule. The Supreme Court also observed that the purpose of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 was not to convert an unsecured debt as a secured one. The object of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 was to prevent any defendant from defeating the realization of a decree that may ultimately be passed in favour of the plaintiff. The relevant extract of the said decision is set out below:\n\"4. The object of supplemental proceedings (applications for arrest or attachment before judgment, grant of temporary injunctions and appointment of receivers) is to prevent the ends of justice being defeated. The object of Order 38 Rule 5 CPC in particular, is to prevent any defendant from defeating the realization of the decree that may ultimately be passed in favour of the plaintiff, either by attempting to dispose of, or remove from the jurisdiction of the court, his movables. The Scheme of Order 38 and the use of the words \"to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against him\" in Rule 5 make it clear that before exercising the power under the said Rule, the court should be satisfied that there is a reasonable chance of a decree being passed in the suit against the defendant. This would mean that the court should be satisfied that the plaintiff has a prima facie case. If the averments in the plaint and the documents produced in support of it, do not satisfy the court about the existence of a prima facie case, the court will not go to the next stage of examining whether the (2008) 2 SCC 302 interest of the plaintiff should be protected by exercising power under Order 38 Rule 5 CPC. It is well-settled that merely having a just or valid claim or a prima facie case, will not entitle the plaintiff to an order of attachment before judgment, unless he also establishes that the defendant is attempting to remove or dispose of his assets with the intention of defeating the decree that may be passed. Equally well settled is the position that even where the defendant is removing or disposing his assets, an attachment before judgment will not be issued, if the plaintiff is not able to satisfy that he has a prima facie case. \n5. The power under Order 38 Rule 5 CPC is a drastic and extraordinary power. Such power should not be exercised mechanically or merely for the asking. It should be used sparingly and strictly in accordance with the Rule. The purpose of Order 38 Rule 5 is not to convert an unsecured debt into a secured debt. Any attempt by a plaintiff to utilize the provisions of Order 38 Rule 5 as a leverage for coercing the defendant to settle the suit claim should be discouraged. Instances are not wanting where bloated and doubtful claims are realised by unscrupulous plaintiffs, by obtaining orders of attachment before judgment and forcing the defendants for out-of court settlements, under threat of attachment.\" \n64. The powers of a court under Section 9 of the A&C Act to direct interim measures are wide and in the given cases, the court can direct furnishing of a security to secure the claims of the applicant pending the conclusion of the arbitral proceedings. Further, orders under Section 9 of the A&C Act can be passed before, during or after the arbitral proceedings. However, it is equally well settled that the powers available to a court for making orders under Section 9 of the A&C Act are the same as that the court has, for the purpose of, or in relation to, any proceedings before it. Thus, the powers under Section 9 of the A&C Act cannot be exercised in disregard of the provisions of the CPC or their underlying principles. \n65. In Essar House Private Limited v. Arcellor Mittal Nippon Steel India Limited4, the Supreme Court had approved the view of this Court in Ajay Singh & Ors. v. Kal Airways Private Limited5 that Section 9 of the A&C Act grants wide powers to the courts in fashioning an appropriate interim order. However, it is material to note that in Ajay Singh & Ors. v. Kal Airways Private Limited5, this Court had also stressed that the exercise of such power should be \"principled, premised on some known guidelines.\" The reference to Orders 38 and 39 of the CPC was in the aforesaid context. However, the Court was not bound by the text of those provisions but had to follow the underlying principles. The decision of the Bombay High Court in Jagdish Ahuja & Anr. v. Cupino Limited6 is not materially different. The reading of the said decision indicates that the Court had followed its earlier decision in Nimbus Communications Limited v. Board of Control for Cricket in India & Anr.12 and emphasized that the Court while exercising the powers under Section 9 of the A&C Act has the discretion to grant a wide range of interim measures of protection. However, the Court was required to be guided by the principles which the civil courts ordinarily employ for considering interim relief, particularly, under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 and Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC. However, the Court reiterated the view that, in exercise of powers under Section 9 of the A&C Act, the Court is \"not unduly bound by their texts\". This is, essentially, the same view as expressed by this Court in Ajay Singh & Ors. v. Kal Airways Private Limited5.\n66. In Valentine Maritime Ltd. v. Kreuz Subsea Pte Limited. & Anr.7 - a decision relied upon by S&W that was also referred to by the Supreme Court in Essar House Private Limited v. Arcellor Mittal Nippon Steel India Limited4 - the Bombay High Court had reiterated the aforesaid principles. Contrary to the contentions advanced by Mr Wadhwa, the High Court in the said case had, after referring to the decisions in Adhunik Steels Ltd. v. Orissa Manganese and Minerals (P) Ltd.10 and Nimbus Communications Ltd. v. Board of Control for Cricket in India & Anr.12, held that the decision of the Division Bench of the Court in National Shipping Companies of Saudi Arabia v. Sentrans Industries Limited15 to the effect that exercise of powers under Section 9 (ii)(b) of the A&C Act was not controlled by the CPC, was not sustainable. Paragraph 95 of the said decision is set out below:\n\"95. Insofar as judgment of this Court delivered by the Division Bench of this court in case of Nimbus Communications Limited v. Board of Control for Cricket in India (supra) relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the VML is concerned, this Court adverted to the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Adhunik Steels Ltd. v. Orissa Manganese and Minerals (P) Ltd., (2007) 7 SCC 125 and held that in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in case of Adhunik Steels Ltd., (supra) the view of the Division Bench in case of National Shipping Company of Saudi Arabia (supra) that the exercise of power under section 9(ii)(b) is not controlled by the provisions of the Code of Civil 2004 SCC OnLine Bom 25 Procedure, 1908 cannot stand. This court in the said judgment of Nimbus Communications Limited (supra) held that the exercise of the power under section 9 of the Arbitration Act cannot be totally independent of the basic principles governing grant of interim injunction by the civil Court, at the same time, the Court when it decides the petition under section 9, must have due regard to the underlying purpose of the conferment of the power upon the Court which is to promote the efficacy of arbitration as a form of dispute resolution.\" \n(Emphasis Added) \n67. It is also relevant to refer to decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Tahal Consulting Engineers India Pvt. Ltd. v. Promax Power Ltd.16 68. In the said case, this Court had referred to the earlier decisions and had held as under:\n\"39. Turning then to the powers of the Arbitral Tribunal to pass an order of attachment before the Award is rendered or framing directions for securitising the claim that may be laid before it, the Court notes that it is now well settled that while the Arbitral Tribunal may not be strictly bound by the principles which inform Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code, it could adopt principles analogous to those comprised in that provision. Courts have repeatedly held that while the power to attach before Award may not have been specifically set out in Sections 9 and 17 of the Act, such an order could be made if circumstances so warrant. Indubitably, while the Arbitral Tribunal or for that matter the Court under Section 9 may not be strictly bound by the rigidity of the discretion vested upon a court by the Code, at the same time when it does choose to exercise that 2023 SCC OnLine Del 2069 power it must do so guided by the principles accepted as relevant and germane for that power being wielded.\" \n69. We concur with the aforesaid view. The law in regard to issuing orders in the nature of securing the claims made by a party are now well settled. Whilst the court is not unduly bound by the texts or Order XXXVIII Rule 1 and 2 or Order XXXVIII Rule (5) or any other provisions of CPC, the substantial principles for grant of such interim measures cannot be disregarded. These principles must be duly satisfied for the court to issue any interim measures of protection under Section 9 of the A&C Act. \n70. The principles underlying the object of Order XXXVIII Rule (5) of the CPC are, as noticed earlier, well settled. Such orders are required to be issued in case where the court is satisfied that the party has established a strong prima facie case and that the respondents are acting in a manner that would defeat the realization of the decree. These principles must be equally satisfied for securing protective orders under Section 9 of the A&C Act, which are in the nature of orders under Order XXXVIII Rule (5) of the CPC. \n71. Mr Wadhwa had strongly relied on paragraphs 48 and 49 of the decision of the Supreme Court in Essar House Private Limited v. Arcellor Mittal Nippon Steel India Limited.4 The said paragraphs are set out below: \n\"48. Section 9 of the Arbitration Act confers wide power on the Court to pass orders securing the amount in dispute in arbitration, whether before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, during the arbitral proceedings or at any time after making of the arbitral award, but before its enforcement in accordance with Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. All that the Court is required to see is, whether the applicant for interim measure has a good prima facie case, whether the balance of convenience is in favour of interim relief as prayed for being granted and whether the applicant has approached the court with reasonable expedition. \n49. If a strong prima facie case is made out and the balance of convenience is in favour of interim relief being granted, the Court exercising power under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act should not withhold relief on the mere technicality of absence of averments, incorporating the grounds for attachment before judgment under Order 38 Rule 5 of the CPC.\"\n72. The aforesaid observations cannot be read in isolation. Although the Supreme Court had held that an applicant is required to establish a good prima facie case as well as the balance of convenience in his favour, for the grant of interim relief. However, the said observations cannot be read to mean that other underlying principles for the grant of interim orders as contemplated under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC are required to be ignored or disregarded. In a subsequent paragraph, the Supreme Court had observed that a mere technicality of the absence of averments incorporating the grounds for attachment before the judgment under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC should not withhold relief. However, these observations read in the context of the decision, clearly indicate that the same cannot be read to mean that the underlying principles for the grant of interim relief as contemplated under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC can be disregarded. It is material to note that in Essar House Private Limited v. Arcellor Mittal Nippon Steel India Limited4, the Supreme Court was considering an appeal against an order of the Commercial Court of the Bombay High Court. In its order, the Bombay High Court had held that Section 9 of the A&C Act does not preclude a Court to pass an equitable order for securing the claim of the applicant in a case where \"once having rendered a prima-facie finding that the applicant would have good chances of succeeding in the arbitration and if the claim made by the applicant is not secured, he would not be able to enjoy fruits of the arbitral award on its execution.\" Thus, the underlying principle that the interim orders for securing a claimant in an arbitral proceeding can be made only in cases where the court is prima facie satisfied that but for securing the claimant, it would be unable to reap the benefits of a favourable award, was satisfied in that case. \n73. In Sanghi Industries Limited v. Ravin Cables Ltd. & Anr.17 - which was delivered after the decision in Essar House Private Limited v. Arcellor Mittal Nippon Steel India Limited4- the Supreme Court considered a case where the appellant was directed to deposit an amount realized by invocation of the performance guarantees. The respondent had filed a petition under Section 9 of the A&C Act seeking to interdict the invocation of the bank guarantees. However, before any order could be passed, the bank guarantees were invoked and the appellant had realised the payments in respect of the said bank guarantees. In the 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1329 aforesaid context, the learned Commercial Court had passed an order directing the appellant to deposit the amount realized by it by invoking the bank guarantees, in the court. In the appeal preferred against the said order, the Supreme Court held as under:\n\"4. Having heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties and in the facts and circumstances of the case, more particularly, when the bank guarantees were already invoked and the amounts under the respective bank guarantees were already paid by the bank much prior to the Commercial Court passed the order under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 and looking to the tenor of the order passed by the Commercial Court, it appears that the Commercial Court had passed the order under Section 9(ii)(e) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 to secure the amount in dispute, we are of the opinion that unless and until the preconditions under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC are satisfied and unless there are specific allegations with cogent material and unless prima facie the Court is satisfied that the appellant is likely to defeat the decree/award that may be passed by the arbitrator by disposing of the properties and/or in any other manner, the Commercial Court could not have passed such an order in exercise of powers under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. At this stage, it is required to be noted that even otherwise there are very serious disputes on the amount claimed by the rival parties, which are to be adjudicated upon in the proceedings before the arbitral tribunal. \n4.1 The order(s) which may be passed by the Commercial Court in an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 is basically and mainly by way of interim measure. It may be true that in a given case if all the conditions of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC are satisfied and the Commercial Court is satisfied on the conduct of opposite/opponent party that the opponent party is trying to sell its properties to defeat the award that may be passed and/or any other conduct on the part of the opposite/opponent party which may tantamount to any attempt on the part of the opponent/opposite party to defeat the award that may be passed in the arbitral proceedings, the Commercial Court may pass an appropriate order including the restrain order and/or any other appropriate order to secure the interest of the parties. However, unless and until the conditions mentioned in Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC are satisfied such an order could not have been passed by the Commercial Court which has been passed by the Commercial Court in the present case, which has been affirmed by the High Court.\" \n[Emphasis Added] \n74 . In the present case, there are no observations or findings to the effect that if the orders for furnishing of the bank guarantee are not granted, S&W would be unable to enforce the Arbitral Award against appellant nos. 2 to 6. There is also no material on record to even remotely suggest that appellant nos. 2 to 6 are alienating their assets or acting in a manner that would frustrate the enforcement of the Arbitral Award, if S&W India prevails in the arbitral proceedings. Clearly, an order directing them to furnish a Bank Guarantee, militates against the principles underlying under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC. \n75. Appellant no.1 (SHL) is a special purpose vehicle in respect of the project. In regard to the said company the respondent is protected to the extent that the impugned order effectively restrains any change in the shareholding of the said company. \n76. In view of the above, we allow the present appeals to the limited extent of setting aside the direction to the appellants to provide a bank guarantee to partly secure the claims of the respondent. We clarify that all other interim measures of protection granted in terms of the impugned order continue to be operative. \n77. It is also clarified that this would not preclude the respondent from seeking such interim relief as advised in the arbitral proceedings. Needless to state that any application made by the respondent shall be considered uninfluenced by any observations made in this order. \nVIBHU BAKHRU, J AMIT MAHAJAN, J NOVEMBER 10, 2023 RK/gsr",

chhibbar, senior advocate with mr. vaibhav sehgal, advocate and ms. ateevraj sandhu, advocate for the respondent. ***** gurvinder singh gill, j. 1. the petitioner assails order dated 15.5.2023, passed by learned commercial court, ludhiana, vide which a petition filed by the petitioner under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (hereinafter, referred to, in short, as 'the act'), has been returned back to the petitioner, after 5 years of its institution on the ground that the court at ludhiana has no territorial jurisdiction and that the same is to filed in the courts at delhi. 2. a few facts, necessary to notice are that the respondent is owner of a plot situated in ludhiana which he had leased out in favour of the petitioner. a 'memorandum of agreed terms' (moat) dated 28.2.2008 (annexure p-1) cr-6898-2023 (o&m) (2) 2024:phhc:004418 with regard to said lease was executed at ludhiana. the said moat provided for resolution of disputes by way of arbitration. the relevant extract from moat, pertaining to arbitration reads as under: arbitration: in case of any disputes and differences arising out of the lease, between the lessor and the lessee shall be settled mutually between the parties, failing which the same shall be settled by arbitration under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 or the then prevailing arbitration laws. the venue for arbitration shall be at delhi and the proceedings shall be conducted in english only. 3. a perusal of aforesaid arbitration clause reveals that it is only the 'venue' of arbitration which had been agreed upon by the parties in the moat (annexure p-1) and no 'seat' of arbitration was specifically or impliedly designated by the parties. 4. some relevant development which took place ever since a dispute arose amongst the parties are stated herein-under, chronologically: 11.09.2009 : respondent filed a petition under section 11 of the act in this court (annexure p-8). 16.11.2010 : high court ordered for appointment of an arbitrator (annexure p-10). 27.03.2017 : a 'majority award' (annexure p-11) was passed by two arbitrators against the petitioner whereas 'minority award' (annexure p-12) by one arbitrator was passed in favour of the petitioner. however, there was no determination of seat by the arbitral tribunal under section 20 (2) of the act. cr-6898-2023 (o&m) (3) 2024:phhc:004418 30.5.2017 : although, the majority award was in favour of the respondent, yet the respondent filed a petition under section 34 of the act before the commercial court at ludhiana, i.e. arbitration case no. 1855 of 30.5.2017 (annexure p-13) so as to seek some enhancement by way of modification of majority award. 3.7.2017 : the petitioner also filed a petition under section 34 of the act before the commercial court at ludhiana, i.e. arbitration case no. 1859 of 3.7.2017 (annexure p-14) seeking setting aside of the majority award. petitioner categorically mentioned therein that ludhiana court has the jurisdiction. 11.07.2018 : respondent filed his reply dated 11.7.2018 (annexure p-16) to the petition under section 34 of the act filed by petitioner at ludhiana. in reply to para 19 of the petition regarding jurisdiction at ludhiana, the respondent did not specifically deny the averments regarding jurisdiction but simply replied that the same is a matter of record. 12.03.2022 : the respondent filed an application for execution of the majority award vide execution application no. 501 of 2022 (annexure p-17) in the court at ludhiana. 14.05.2022 : respondent unconditionally withdrew 'arbitration case no. 1855 of 2017' by simply stating that he does not wish to pursue 'modification' of the award, as is evident from order dated 14.5.2022 (annexure p-18). 28.09.2022 : subsequently, an application dated 28.9.2022 (annexure p-19) under section 151 cpc was filed by respondent seeking dismissal of objection petition filed by the petitioner under section 34 of the act, on the ground that the court at ludhiana does not have jurisdiction to entertain the matter. cr-6898-2023 (o&m) (4) 2024:phhc:004418 15.05.2023 : the aforesaid application (annexure p-19) filed by respondent was allowed vide order dated 15.5.2023 (annexure p-23) by the commercial court, ludhiana, while holding that the court at ludhiana does not have jurisdiction and that the courts at delhi have the exclusive jurisdiction. the petition was accordingly returned back. 5. the learned counsel for the petitioner, while assailing the impugned order dated 15.5.2023, made the following submissions: (i) that the commercial court, ludhiana fell in error in relying upon the view taken by hon'ble supreme court in bgs sgs soma jv v. nhpc limited, (2020) 4 scc 234, so as to hold that the venue of arbitration as designated in agreement defines absolutely the seat as well whereas the said judgment has been read down in a subsequent judgment by a bench of equal strength of hon'ble supreme court in mankastu impex private limited vs. airvisual limited (2020) 5 scc 399; (ii) that mankastu's case (supra) virtually reiterates the view taken earlier by a three judges bench of hon'ble supreme court in union of india vs. hardy exploration and production (2019) 13 scc 472 to the effect that venue of arbitration cannot be treated as seat; (iii) that the respondent is estopped from raising the plea that court at ludhiana lacks jurisdiction as he himself has admitted in his pleadings that court at ludhiana does have jurisdiction and which otherwise also stands established by his conduct. the learned counsel, in order to hammer forth his aforesaid submission placed cr-6898-2023 (o&m) (5) 2024:phhc:004418 reliance upon mankastu's case (supra) to contend that conduct of the parties is a defining factor in determining seat of arbitration; (iv) that the commercial court, ludhiana also fell in error in relying upon bbr (india) private limited v. s.p. singla constructions private limited,(2023)1 scc 693, as the facts of the said case were entirely different and the issue involved was mainly with regard to a situation wherein the venue of arbitration is shifted pursuant to recusal of previous arbitrator and that it was under these circumstances it was held therein that the 'seat' which stood fixed previously could not be changed upon shifting of venue of arbitration. 6. on the other, the learned counsel for the respondent, while opposing the petition, made the following submissions : (i) that since the arbitration clause specifically provides for the venue of arbitration to be at delhi, without there being any reference to seat of arbitration, the venue as agreed amongst the parties has to be treated as seat of arbitration as well in view of ratio of bharat aluminium company ltd. v. kaiser aluminum technical services 2012 (9) scc 552 (in short balco's case); (ii) that the impugned order, holding that it is the court at delhi which is the seat of arbitration, is a well reasoned order, wherein the commercial court, ludhiana has duly taken into account the well settled position of law, as settled in bgs soma's case (supra) and which has been followed consistently by all the high courts; (iii) that judgment in mankastu's case (supra) has not set aside the earlier judgment rendered in bgs soma's case (supra); cr-6898-2023 (o&m) (6) 2024:phhc:004418 (iv) that the high court, while exercising powers under section 11 of the act cannot be termed as 'court' within the meaning of section 2(1)(e) of the act so as to attract provisions of section 42 of the act; (v) that the respondent had approached this court under section 11 of the act and also the court at ludhiana for filing a petition under section 34 of the act at ludhiana under a mistaken belief that court at ludhiana has jurisdiction and that when the respondent realized his mistake, he immediately withdrew his petition under section 34 of the act and as such the factum of filing such petitions cannot operate as any kind of estoppel upon the respondent from raising plea of jurisdiction; (vi) that in case the factum of respondent having approached this court or the court at ludhiana is taken into account so as to confer jurisdiction upon courts at ludhiana, the same will encourage a dangerous trend and the litigating parties will approach different or far-off courts in the first instance so as to assert jurisdiction of such court. the learned counsel cites bbr (india) private limited v. s.p. singla constructions private limited,(2023)1 scc 693, to contend that the concept of 'fastest fingers first' has been deprecated by hon'ble supreme court. 7. the contentions made by both the learned counsel would show that it is mainly the applicability of bgs soma's case (supra), particularly in light of ratio of subsequent judgment in mankatsu's case (supra) which is in question in the instant case. the controversy may be addressed by finding answers to the following questions: (i) whether mankastu's case is to be interpreted in a manner so as to mean that the judgment rendered in bgs soma's case stands set aside? cr-6898-2023 (o&m) (7) 2024:phhc:004418 (ii) whether the view taken in mankastu's case is in absolute conflict with the view taken in bgs soma's case ? (iii) whether the judgment in mankastu's case dilutes the ratio of bgs soma's case ? (iv) whether, the factum of a party having approached a certain high court under section 11 of the act, is a decisive factor for determining jurisdiction of the court where petition under section 34 of the act is to be instituted? (v) whether the conduct of the parties can be taken into account and can be said to furnish some indication as regards intention of parties with regard to 'seat' of arbitration particularly in a case where 'seat' of arbitration is not defined in agreement amongst parties and only the 'venue' of arbitration is defined? 8. before proceeding to find answers to the aforesaid questions, it is apposite to bear in mind the relevant provisions of the act : section 2 (1)(e) : \"court\" means-(i) in the case of an arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the high court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a suit, but does not include any civil court of a grade inferior to such principal civil court, or any court of small cause; (ii) x x x section 20 : place of arbitration. (1) the parties are free to agree on the place of arbitration. (2) failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (i), the place of arbitration shall be determined by the tribunal having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the convenience of the parties. cr-6898-2023 (o&m) (8) 2024:phhc:004418 (3) notwithstanding sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the arbitral tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, meet at anyplace it considers appropriate for consultation among its members, for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, or for inspection of documents, goods or other property. section 42 : jurisdiction.--notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this part or in any other law for the time being in force, where with respect to an arbitration agreement any application under this part has been made in a court, that court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that court and in no other court. 9. a perusal of the aforesaid sections shows that the term 'seat' or 'venue' are nowhere mentioned or defined therein. as a matter of fact, the term 'seat' and 'venue' has not been defined anywhere either under the arbitration act, 1940 or under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. section 20 of the act defines 'place of arbitration' which is used interchangeably for both seat and venue. however, the concept of 'seat' and 'venue', as expounded in various judgments, has assumed humongous significance in arbitration proceedings as it not only determines where the arbitration proceedings are to be conducted but is also crucial in ascertaining the supervisory jurisdiction of court and the curial law (lex arbitri) which governs such arbitration. while the 'seat' of arbitration defines the curial law or procedural law governing the arbitration and also determines which court will exercise supervisory jurisdiction over such arbitration, the term 'venue' of arbitration defines the geographical place where such arbitration is conducted. 10. interestingly, unlike the civil suits where the jurisdiction is determined strictly in accordance with provisions of sections 16 to 20 of cpc and the parties cr-6898-2023 (o&m) (9) 2024:phhc:004418 have no choice in the matter of jurisdiction, the scheme of the arbitration act does give an option to the parties to mutually designate place where arbitration proceedings are to be conducted and the court which is to exercise supervisory jurisdiction, irrespective of the place where cause of action had arisen or where property is situated. 11. the following three modes for determination of jurisdictional seat can be discerned from the scheme of the act, particularly upon perusal of section 20 and 42 of the act: (a) the seat is decided by the parties. (b) if the seat is not agreed by the parties then the seat shall be determined by the arbitral tribunal. (c) if the seat has not been decided by the parties or by arbitral tribunal then the 'court' in which an application under part-i of the act is made, would have jurisdiction. 12. in the absence of any definition in statute as regards 'seat' or 'venue' of arbitration, the law has been settled through various judicial pronouncements. the development of law with regard to determination of 'seat' of arbitration, as discussed in various judgments may be chronologically traced briefly as under: 2009 : 'shashoua's principle' (english law) : the famous english principle popularly known as 'shashoua's principle' was propounded by justice cooke in a case titled roger shashoua v mukesh sharma. the shashoua principle states that when an agreement expressly designates the venue without any express reference to seat, combined with a supranational body of cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 10 ) 2024:phhc:004418 laws and no significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that the venue is actually the seat of arbitration. 2012 : balco's case (constitution bench) : the landmark judgement which distinguished between the concept of \"seat\" and \"venue\" of the arbitration was a judgement delivered by a five judges constitution bench of hon'ble supreme court in balco's case (supra). the hon'ble supreme court analysed the concept of \"seat\" and \"venue\" at length and held that both the concepts are different. the court clarified that the \"seat\" of arbitration is the center of gravity of the arbitration i.e. the place where the arbitration is anchored whereas the \"venue\" is merely the geographical location where such arbitration meetings are conducted. the court further clarified that the term \"place of arbitration\" is used interchangeably under section 20 of the act and that while it denotes \"seat\" in context of section 20 (1) of the act, it would denote \"venue\" under section 20 (3) of the act. however, the hon'ble supreme court, while emphasizing on party autonomy, granted concurrent jurisdiction to two different courts to exercise powers under the act i.e. the court with supervisory jurisdiction over the seat of arbitration and the court in whose jurisdiction the cause of action arose. this observation of the hon'ble supreme court in para 96 created confusion and led to conflicting decisions by different high courts. the relevant extracts from balco's case (supra) are reproduced herein-under: \"96. . . . . we are of the opinion, the term \"subject-matter of the arbitration\" cannot be confused with \"subject-matter of the suit\". the term \"subject-matter\" in section 2(1)(e) is confined to part i. it has a reference and connection with the process of dispute resolution. its purpose is to identify the courts having supervisory control over the arbitration proceedings. hence, it refers to a court which would essentially be a court of the seat of the arbitration process. in our opinion, the provision in section 2(1)(e) has to be construed keeping in view the provisions in section 20 which give recognition to party autonomy. accepting the narrow construction as projected by the learned counsel for the appellants would, in fact, render section 20 nugatory. in our view, the legislature has intentionally given jurisdiction to two courts i.e. the court which would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is located and the courts where the arbitration takes place. this was necessary as on many occasions the agreement may provide for a seat of arbitration at a place cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 11 ) 2024:phhc:004418 which would be neutral to both the parties. therefore, the courts where the arbitration takes place would be required to exercise supervisory control over the arbitral process. for example, if the arbitration is held in delhi, where neither of the parties are from delhi, (delhi having been chosen as a neutral place as between a party from mumbai and the other from kolkata) and the tribunal sitting in delhi passes an interim order under section 17 of the arbitration act, 1996, the appeal against such an interim order under section 37 must lie to the courts of delhi being the courts having supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and the tribunal. this would be irrespective of the fact that the obligations to be performed under the contract were to be performed either at mumbai or at kolkata, and only arbitration is to take place in delhi. in such circumstances, both the courts would have jurisdiction i.e. the court within whose jurisdiction the subject-matter of the suit is situated and the courts within the jurisdiction of which the dispute resolution i.e. arbitration is located. 2018 : hardy's case (three judges bench) : the first judgment on domestic arbitration for the purpose of determination of jurisdictional seat is union of india vs. hardy exploration and production (india) inc. (2019) 13 scc 472 by three judge bench. hon'ble supreme court deviated from the landmark balco's case and the shashoua principle and held that 'venue' can be 'seat' only if there exists some other concomitant factor to support the same. the relevant extracts are reproduced hereinunder: \"30. on a perusal of articles 20 and 31(3) of the uncitral model law, we find that the parties are free to agree on the place of arbitration. once the said consent is given in the arbitration clause or it is interpretably deduced from the clause and the other concomitant factors like the case of harmony innovation shipping ltd. [harmony innovation shipping ltd. v. gupta coal (india) ltd., (2015) 9 scc 172 : (2015) 4 scc (civ) 341] which states about the venue and something in addition by which the seat of arbitration is determinable. the other mode, as article 20 of the uncitral model law provides, is that where the parties do not agree on the place of arbitration, the same shall be determined by the arbitral tribunal. such a power of adjudication has been conferred on the arbitral tribunal. article 31(3) clearly stipulates that the award shall state the date and the place of arbitration as determined in accordance with article 20(1). 35. in the instant case, there has been no adjudication and expression of an opinion. thus, the word \"place\" cannot be used as seat. to cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 12 ) 2024:phhc:004418 elaborate, a venue can become a seat if something else is added to it as a concomitant. but a place unlike seat, at least as is seen in the contract, can become a seat if one of the conditions precedent is satisfied. it does not ipso facto assume the status of seat. thus understood, kuala lumpur is not the seat or place of arbitration and the interchangeable use will not apply in strict sensu.\" 2019 : soma's case (three judges bench) : subsequently, another three judges bench of hon'ble supreme court in bgs sgs soma jv v. nhpc ltd. (2020) 4 scc 234 held that hardy's case (supra) did not lay correct law. it reiterated shashoua's principle and while relying upon the constitutional bench decision in balco's case (supra), held that sub-section (3) of section 20 refers to `venue' whereas the `place' mentioned in sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) refers to the `jurisdictional seat'. hon'ble apex court in bgs sgs soma's case (supra) also dealt with the situation where the parties have not agreed on or have not fixed the jurisdictional `seat of arbitration', and has laid down a broad principle to determine the `seat of arbitration' which would determine the location of the court that would exercise supervisory jurisdiction. it has broadly been held that when 'venue' of arbitration is defined, the same should be treated as 'seat' of arbitration unless there is any indication to the contrary. para 61 of the judgment reads as under: \"61. it will thus be seen that wherever there is an express designation of a \"venue\", and no designation of any alternative place as the \"seat\", combined with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration, and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that the stated venue is actually the juridical seat of the arbitral proceeding. cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 13 ) 2024:phhc:004418 hon'ble apex court in bgs sgs soma's case (supra), crystallized the law as applicable, where the parties by agreement have not fixed jurisdictional seat, as under: \"82. on a conspectus of the aforesaid judgements it may be concluded that whenever there is the designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the venue of the arbitration proceedings, the expression arbitration proceedings would make it clear that the venue is really the seat of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression does not include just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award at that place. . . . further the fact that arbitral proceedings shall be held at a particular venue would also indicate that the parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby, that that place is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. this, coupled with there being no other significant contrary indicia, that the stated venue is merely a venue and not the seat of the arbitral proceedings, would then conclusively show that such a clause designates a seat of the arbitral proceedings. . . . in a national context, this would be replaced by the arbitration act 1996 as applying to the stated venue which then becomes the seat for the purpose of arbitration..\" hon'ble apex court in bgs sgs soma's case (supra), in concluding paragraphs clearly held that hardy's case did not lay correct law. para 96 is reproduced herein-under: \"96. the decision in hardy exploration and production (india) inc. (supra) is therefore contrary to the five judge bench in balco (supra), in that it failed to apply the shashoua principle to the arbitration clause in question. the hardy exploration and production (india) inc. (supra) decision would lead to the result that a foreign award would not only be subject to challenge in the country in which it was made, but also subject to challenge under section 34 of part i of the arbitration act, 1996, which would lead to the chaos spoken of in paragraph 143 of balco (supra), with the concomitant risk of conflicting decisions, as held in venture global engineering (supra) [overruled in balco (supra)], which would add to problems relating cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 14 ) 2024:phhc:004418 to enforcement, and undermine the policy underlying the new york convention and the uncitral model law. we, therefore, declare that the judgment in hardy exploration and production (india) inc. (supra), being contrary to the five judge bench in balco (supra), cannot be considered to be good law.\" 2020 : mankastu's case : (three judges bench) : another three judges bench of hon'ble supreme court in mankastu inpex private ltd. v. airvisual ltd. (2020) 5 scc 399 observed that judgment in soma's case being a judgment delivered by a three judges bench could not have overruled hardy's judgment being a judgment delivered by a bench of equal strength. it determined the seat as per the 'venue' of arbitration. in the said case the agreement provided that the arbitration would be administered in hong kong and the place of arbitration shall be hongkong. however, the agreement also stated that the courts at delhi will have jurisdiction over the matter. it was held therein that hongkong is the seat of arbitration since there was additional 'indicia' in favour of hong kong. the relevant paras are as under: \"20. it is well settled that \"seat of arbitration\" and \"venue of arbitration\" cannot be used interchangeably. it has also been established that mere expression \"place of arbitration\" cannot be the basis to determine the intention of the parties that they have intended that place as the \"seat\" of arbitration. the intention of the parties as to the \"seat\" should be determined from other clauses in the agreement and the conduct of the parties. 21. in the present case, the arbitration agreement entered into between the parties provides hong kong as the place of arbitration. the agreement between the parties choosing \"hong kong\" as the place of arbitration by itself will not lead to the conclusion that the parties have chosen hong kong as the seat of arbitration. the words, \"the place of arbitration\" shall be \"hong kong\", have to be read along cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 15 ) 2024:phhc:004418 with clause 17.2. clause 17.2 provides that \". any dispute, controversy, difference arising out of or relating to mou shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered in hong kong.\". on a plain reading of the arbitration agreement, it is clear that the reference to hong kong as \"place of arbitration\" is not a simple reference as the \"venue\" for the arbitral proceedings; but a reference to hong kong is for final resolution by arbitration administered in hong kong. the agreement between the parties that the dispute \"shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered in hong kong\" clearly suggests that the parties have agreed that the arbitration be seated at hong kong and that laws of hong kong shall govern the arbitration proceedings as well as have power of judicial review over the arbitration award. 22. as pointed out earlier, clause 17.2 of mou stipulates that the dispute arising out of or relating to mou including the existence, validity, interpretation, breach or termination thereof or any dispute arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and finally resolved by the arbitration administered in hong kong. the words in clause 17.2 that \"arbitration administered in hong kong\" is an indicia that the seat of arbitration is at hong kong. once the parties have chosen \"hong kong\" as the place of arbitration to be administered in hong kong, the laws of hong kong would govern the arbitration. the indian courts have no jurisdiction for appointment of the arbitrator.\" 2022 : bbr vs. s.p. singla's case (two judges bench) in a recent case, bbr (india) private limited v. s.p. singla constructions private limited,(2023)1 scc 693, the hon'ble supreme court while taking note of the above referred judgments, expounded on 'seat of arbitration' in the following words: \"15. . . . . in other words, the term `court' as defined in clause (e) to sub-section (1) of section 2, which refers to the `subject matter of arbitration', is not necessarily used as finally determinative of the court's territorial jurisdiction to entertain proceedings under the act. in bgs sgs soma (supra), this court observed that any other construction of the provisions would render section 20 of the act nugatory. in view of the court, the legislature had given jurisdiction to two courts: the court which should have jurisdiction cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 16 ) 2024:phhc:004418 where the cause of action is located; and the court where the arbitration takes place. this is necessary as, on some occasions, the agreement may provide the `seat of arbitration' that would be neutral to both the parties. the courts where the arbitration takes place would be required to exercise supervisory control over the arbitral process. the `seat of arbitration' need not be the place where any cause of action has arisen, in the sense that the `seat of arbitration may be different from the place where obligations are/had to be performed under the contract. in such circumstances, both the courts should have jurisdiction, viz., the courts within whose jurisdiction `the subject matter of the suit' is situated and the courts within whose jurisdiction the dispute resolution forum, that is, where the arbitral tribunal is located.\" in bbr's case (supra), it was further held that once the jurisdictional `seat' of arbitration is fixed in terms of sub-section (2) of section 20 of the act, then, without the express mutual consent of the parties to the arbitration, `the seat' cannot be changed. however, the said observations are in a different context where upon recusal of the earlier arbitrator, the subsequently appointed arbitrator chose to hold arbitration proceedings at a different place. the question as regards significance of intention of parties was never in issue. 13. question no. (i), (ii) and (iii) : (i) whether mankastu's case is to be interpreted in a manner so as to mean that the judgment rendered in bgs soma's case stands set aside? (ii) whether the view taken in mankastu's case is in absolute conflict with the view taken in bgs soma's case ? (iii) whether the judgment in mankastu's case dilutes the ratio of bgs soma's case ? cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 17 ) 2024:phhc:004418 the aforesaid three questions, being inter-related are being taken up together. as already noticed above, almost all the judgments delivered by hon'ble apex court have duly acknowledged the significance of existence of special circumstances, which could be an indicator as regards the intention of the parties. though, in bbr's case, a judgment by a two judges bench, it has been observed that a seat once fixed cannot be changed but said observations are in a different context where upon recusal of earlier arbitrator, the subsequently appointed arbitrator chose to hold arbitration proceedings at a different place. the question as regards significance of intention of parties was never in issue. it is well settled that a judgment has to be construed in the backdrop of the facts and circumstances in which the judgment has been delivered and that a few phrases or sentences in a judgment, cannot be read out of context. as evident upon perusal of the judgments noticed above, hardy's case and soma's case are at variance with each other inasmuch as while hardy's case states that 'venue' ipso-facto will not be a seat unless some 'indicia' in favour of the 'venue' being 'seat' is shown to exist, whereas soma's case states that 'venue' will be 'seat' unless some contrary indicia shows otherwise. in none of the aforesaid two contrary views, has any absolute principle been laid and in both the views, there is room for exception whenever there is any indicia suggestive of any intention or manner. the relevant lines from para 35 of hardy's case read as under: 35. . . . thus, the word \"place\" cannot be used as seat. to elaborate, a venue can become a seat if something else is added to it as a concomitant. 14. similarly soma's case also draws exceptions in para 61, the relevant extract of which is reproduced herein-under: cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 18 ) 2024:phhc:004418 \"61. it will thus be seen that wherever there is an express designation of a \"venue\", and no designation of any alternative place as the \"seat\", combined with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration, and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that the stated venue is actually the juridical seat of the arbitral proceeding. 15. while the judgments in hardy's case and in soma's case do refer to a certain indicia but apparently it refers to the indicia discerned from various clauses in the agreement between the parties. thus, the subsequent judgment in mankatsu's case wherein conduct of the parties has also been held to be a determining factor to infer intention of the parties can only said to have added a new dimension to the term 'indicia' as referred in soma's case so as not just to be confined to clauses in the agreement but even to look into definite and consistent conduct of the parties indicative of intention of the parties. in other words, the 'indicia' may even be gathered from conduct of the parties. the relevant extract from para 20 of mankatsu's judgment is reproduced hereinunder: \"20. it is well settled that \"seat of arbitration\" and \"venue of arbitration\" cannot be used interchangeably. it has also been established that mere expression \"place of arbitration\" cannot be the basis to determine the intention of the parties that they have intended that place as the \"seat\" of arbitration. the intention of the parties as to the \"seat\" should be determined from other clauses in the agreement and the conduct of the parties.\" 16. thus, mankatsu's case has merely reiterated that 'indicia' in an acknowledged exception to the general rule as regards jurisdiction, when sought to be conferred on the basis of 'venue' agreed upon by the parties. it will not be appropriate to hold that mankatsu's case has over-ruled soma's case. nor can it be said that mankatsu's case is in conflict with ratio of soma's case. when soma's case itself leaves room for exceptions, mankatsu's cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 19 ) 2024:phhc:004418 case has just added another dimension to the term 'indicia'. questions no. (i), (ii) and (iii) stand answered accordingly. 17. question no. (iv) : (iv) whether, the factum of a party having approached a certain high court under section 11 of the act, is a decisive factor for determining jurisdiction of the court where petition under section 34 of the act is to be instituted? the said question essentially pertains to scope of section 42 of the act and as to how the term 'court' existing therein is to be interpreted. section 2(1)(e) of the act, which defines the term `court' and section 42 of the act read as under: \"2. definitions.(1) in this part, unless the context otherwise requires,(e) \"court\" means(i) in the case of an arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the high court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subjectmatter of a suit, but does not include any civil court of a grade inferior to such principal civil court, or any court of small causes;\" 42. jurisdiction.notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this part or in any other law for the time being in force, where with respect to an arbitration agreement any application under this part has been made in a court, that court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that court and in no other court.\" cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 20 ) 2024:phhc:004418 18. the question as to whether term 'court' as existing in section 42 of the act is to be interpreted in the same manner as defined in section 2(i)(e) of the act, came to be considered specifically by a three judges bench of hon'ble apex court in state of west bengal and others vs. associated contractors 2015(1) scc 32, upon a specific reference made for settling the said issue. the controversy involved therein was also with respect to the 'court' which would have jurisdiction to entertain a petition under section 34 of the act. the division bench, upon noticing certain conflict in earlier judgments on the issue involved, had referred the matter to a larger bench. the referral order is reproduced reads as under: \"4. we have perused the decisions cited by learned counsel for the parties, which are all decisions of two judges bench. in our opinion, the law has to be clarified beyond doubt as to which court will have the jurisdiction to entertain and decide an application for setting aside the award under section 34 of the act read with section 2(e) of the act and other provisions, including section 42 of the act. we, therefore, refer the matter to a larger bench to decide this question of law.\" 19. the three judges bench, upon consideration, held as under: \"16. . . .it is obvious that section 11 applications are not to be moved before the \"court\" as defined but before the chief justice either of the high court or of the supreme court, as the case may be, or their delegates. this is despite the fact that the chief justice or his delegate have now to decide judicially and not administratively. again, section 42 would not apply to applications made before the chief justice or his delegate for the simple reason that the chief justice or his delegate is not \"court\" as defined by section 2(1)(e). the said view was reiterated somewhat differently in pandey & co. builders (p) ltd. v. state of bihar & anr., 2007(2) rcr (civil) 457 : (2007) 1 scc 467 at paras 9, 23-26. 17. that the chief justice does not represent the high court or supreme court as the case may be is also clear from section 11(10): cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 21 ) 2024:phhc:004418 \"the chief justice may make such scheme as he may deem appropriate for dealing with matters entrusted by sub-section (4) or sub-section(5) or sub-section (6) to him.\" the scheme referred to in this sub-section is a scheme by which the chief justice may provide for the procedure to be followed in cases dealt with by him under section 11. this again shows that it is not the high court or the supreme court rules that are to be followed but a separate set of rules made by the chief justice for the purposes of section 11. sub-section 12 of section 11 reads as follows: \"(a) where the matters referred to in sub-sections (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (10) arise in an international commercial arbitration, the reference to \"chief justice\"' in those sub-sections shall be construed as a reference to the \"chief justice of india\"'. (b) where the matters referred to in sub-sections (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (10) arise in any other arbitration, the reference to \"chief justice\" in those sub-sections shall be construed as a reference to the chief justice of the high court within whose local limits the principal civil court referred to in clause (e) of sub-section (1) of section 2 is situate and, where the high court itself is the court referred to in that clause, to the chief justice of that high court.\" it is obvious that section 11(12)(b) was necessitated in order that it be clear that the chief justice of \"the high court\" will only be such chief justice within whose local limits the principal civil court referred to in section 2(1) (e) is situate and the chief justice of that high court which is referred to in the inclusive part of the definition contained in section 2(1) (e). this subsection also does not in any manner make the chief justice or his designate \"court\" for the purpose of section 42. again, the decision of the chief justice or his designate, not being the decision of the supreme court or the high court, as the case may be, has no precedential value being a decision of a judicial authority which is not a court of record.\" 20. hon'ble apex court, while answering the reference, summed up its conclusions as under: \"25. our conclusions therefore on section 2(1)(e) and section 42 of the arbitration act, 1996 are as follows: (a) section 2(1)(e) contains an exhaustive definition marking out only the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district or a high court having original civil jurisdiction in the state, and no other court as \"court\" for the purpose of part-i of the arbitration act, 1996. cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 22 ) 2024:phhc:004418 (b) the expression \"with respect to an arbitration agreement\" makes it clear that section 42 will apply to all applications made whether before or during arbitral proceedings or after an award is pronounced under part-i of the 1996 act. (c) however, section 42 only applies to applications made under part-i if they are made to a court as defined. since applications made under section 8 are made to judicial authorities and since applications under section 11 are made to the chief justice or his designate, the judicial authority and the chief justice or his designate not being court as defined, such applications would be outside section 42. (d) section 9 applications being applications made to a court and section 34 applications to set aside arbitral awards are applications which are within section 42. (e) in no circumstances can the supreme court be \"court\" for the purposes of section 2(1)(e), and whether the supreme court does or does not retain seisin after appointing an arbitrator, applications will follow the first application made before either a high court having original jurisdiction in the state or a principal civil court having original jurisdiction in the district as the case may be. (f) section 42 will apply to applications made after the arbitral proceedings have come to an end provided they are made under part-i. (g) if a first application is made to a court which is neither a principal court of original jurisdiction in a district or a high court exercising original jurisdiction in a state, such application not being to a court as defined would be outside section 42. also, an application made to a court without subject matter jurisdiction would be outside section 42. the reference is answered accordingly.\" 21. it, thus, stands well settled that high court while dealing with an application under section 11 of the act would not be acting as a 'court of principal jurisdiction' so as to fall within the meaning of 'court' as defined in section 2(1)(e) of the act. consequently, section 42 of the act will not get attracted merely upon filing of a petition under section 11 of the act. in other words, filing of a petition in a particular high court will not ipso-facto confer jurisdiction upon any court to for entertaining petition under section 34 of the act. however, such fact, cannot be absolutely washed off the record and, if such fact coupled with other similar acts, is found to be suggestive of any cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 23 ) 2024:phhc:004418 other relevant fact, the same could assume some significance. question no (iv) is answered accordingly. 22. question no. (v) : (v) whether the conduct of the parties can be taken into account and can be said to furnish some indication as regards intention of parties with regard to 'seat' of arbitration particularly in a case where 'seat' of arbitration is not defined in agreement amongst parties and only the 'venue' of arbitration is defined? while answering question no. (i), (ii), and (iii), it has been opined that mankatsu's case does not over-rule soma's case but has just added another dimension to the scope of exception carved out in the earlier judgments in the nature of 'contrary indicia' concept. the judgment in mankatsu's case has the effect of enlarging the scope of exception so as to include the conduct of the parties as a relevant fact for determining existence of any 'contrary indicia' as regards seat of arbitration. in other words, the 'contrary indicia' is not only to be inferred from the agreement but can well be gathered from conduct of the parties. 23. in this context, a reference also needs to be made to a recent judgment of hon'ble the apex court delivered in the case titled as m/s ravi ranjan developers private limited versus aditya kumar chatterji, 2022 scc online 568. in the said case, the issue before hon'ble the apex court was as regards the maintainability of a petition under section 11(6) of the act for appointment of an arbitrator, which had been filed in the court at calcutta. the parties in the said case had agreed that the \"sitting of arbitral tribunal\" shall be at calcutta. in other words the 'venue' was defined as calcutta. the property in question, however, was situated in muzaffarpur i.e. within the cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 24 ) 2024:phhc:004418 state of bihar and the office of the appellant was also situated in patna (bihar). the respondent approached the courts at muzzarpur under section 9 of the act seeking interim relief. the respondent also approached the municipal corporatuin at muzzarpur seeking stoppage of construction, but said application was dismissed. although, the appellant, while opposing the petition under section 11(6) of the act filed in calcutta high court by respondent had specifically raised objections as regards jurisdiction at calcutta but calcutta high court accepted the petition under section 11(6) of the act. a review petition filed by appellant was also dismissed. the order of appointment of arbitrator by the calcutta high court was challenged by the appellant. the respondent therein raised a plea in defence to the effect that impugned order was passed upon 'consent' of the appellant and also cited case-law to contend that once venue is designated, the same has to be construed as 'seat as well. para 15 and para 35, wherein such contentions have been noticed are reproduced herein-under: \"15. the question before this court is, whether the calcutta high court at all had jurisdiction to entertain the application filed by the respondent and appoint an arbitrator. mr. sanjay ghosh, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, argued with force, that the initial order of appointment of arbitrator was passed by the court by consent. the appellant appeared in the arbitration proceedings. in other words, the appellant acquiesced to the reference of the disputes to the arbitrator appointed by the high court.\" x x x \"35. in support of his argument that the calcutta high court had exclusive jurisdiction to entertain and decide the application under section 11(6) filed by the respondent, mr. ghosh cited indus mobile distribution private limited v. datawind innovations private limited and ors., (2017) 7 scc 678, hindustan construction company limited v. nhpc limited and anr., (2020) 4 scc 310 and bgs sgs soma jv v. nhpc limited, (2020) 4 scc 234 and argued that once a seat of arbitration is designated, the clause cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 25 ) 2024:phhc:004418 designating the seat of arbitration becomes an exclusive jurisdiction clause, as a result of which, only the courts within whose territorial limits, the seat is located would have jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts.\" 24. hon'ble apex court, while turning down the aforesaid contentions made by respondent therein held as under: \" 41. it is well settled that a judgment is a precedent for the issue of law that is raised and decided. the judgment has to be construed in the backdrop of the facts and circumstances in which the judgment has been rendered. words, phrases and sentences in a judgment, cannot be read out of context. nor is a judgment to be read and interpreted in the manner of a statute. it is only the law as interpreted by in an earlier judgment, which constitutes a binding precedent, and not everything that the judges say.\" x x x \"48. in this case, the parties, as observed above did not agree to refer their disputes to the jurisdiction of the courts in kolkata. it was not the intention of the parties that kolkata should be the seat of arbitration. kolkata was only intended to be the venue for arbitration sittings. accordingly, the respondent himself approached the district court at muzaffarpur, and not a court in kolkata for interim protection under section 9 of the a&c act. the respondent having himself invoked the jurisdiction of the district court at muzaffarpur, is estopped from contending that the parties had agreed to confer exclusive jurisdiction to the calcutta high court to the exclusion of other courts. neither of the parties to the agreement construed the arbitration clause to designate kolkata as the seat of arbitration. we are constrained to hold that calcutta high court inherently lacks jurisdiction to entertain the application of the respondent under section 11 (6) of the arbitration act. the high court should have decided the objection raised by the appellant, to the jurisdiction of the calcutta high court, to entertain the application under section 11 (6) of a&c act, before appointing an arbitrator.\" 25. the judgment in ravi ranjan's case (supra), cannot, however be interpreted to mean that a view different from bgs soma's case has been cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 26 ) 2024:phhc:004418 taken. rather an exception in the nature of 'contrary indicia' as carved out in earlier judgments by three judges bench has been drawn on the basis of conduct of the respondent therein particularly the fact that the respondent therein had himself approached district courts at muzzarpur (bihar) by way of filing an application under section 9 of the act. 26. the view taken in ravi ranjan's case (supra) would also be justified by application of provisions of section 42 of the act. para 31 of the said judgment would be indicative of the mandatory nature of section 42 of the act, which is reproduced herein under: \"31. there could be no doubt, as argued by mr. sinha, that section 42 of the a&c act is mandatory. the section has obviously been enacted to prevent the parties from being dragged into proceedings in different courts, when more than one court has jurisdiction. where with respect to any arbitration agreement, any application under part i of the a&c act has been made in a court, that court alone would have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement, and the arbitral proceedings, would have to be made in that court and in no other court, unless, of course, the court in which the first application had been instituted, inherently lacked jurisdiction to entertain that application. the section which starts with a non obstante clause, is binding irrespective of any other law for the time being in force, and irrespective of any other provision in part i of the a&c act.\" 27. while the present case can safely be decided on the basis of application of section 42 of the act, similar to the facts in mankastu's case (supra) but since question as regards relevance of conduct has been raised, it is necessary to observe that before drawing any inference of contrariety from conduct of either of the parties, it would be expected that such conduct is scrutinized minutely so as to be assured that the act in question is not just a stray act committed with malafide intention by a party in an cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 27 ) 2024:phhc:004418 attempt to oust or confer jurisdiction upon a certain court. in case such a practice is encouraged, the same could lead to bench hunting. any party could conveniently choose to institute any kind of frivolous application before a court of his choice and later claim that jurisdiction stands conferred upon such court in terms of section 42 of the act. 28. the special circumstance in the present case impelling this court to look into conduct of the respondent is that it is now the respondent himself who is asserting jurisdiction to be of court at delhi as against his consistent conduct during the last five years to the contrary. he is trying to wriggle out of his admissions in pleadings which are indicative of the jurisdiction being at ludhiana. here is a case where the respondent never chose to raise any objection as regards jurisdiction while filing reply to petition under section 34 of the act filed by appellant and had infact himself filed a petition under section 34 of the act at ludhiana even before the petitioner filed his petition under section 34 of the act. 29. taking into account any recent stray act to infer contrariety as against settled position of law will defeat the very purpose of relevant provisions. before considering any conduct as an indicator of intention, the existence of malafides has also to be ruled out. question no. (v) is answered accordingly in affirmative but with the cautions indicated above. 30. having answered the questions framed above, the facts need to be adverted to. while in the instant case, the agreement is silent as regards the 'seat' of arbitration but it does provide that the arbitration proceedings were to be conducted in delhi. if broad principle that 'venue' is 'seat', was simply was to be applied then certainly there would have been no cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 28 ) 2024:phhc:004418 controversy. however, while applying the said principle, the existence of 'contrary indicia' is to be ruled out, as has been held by bgs soma's case itself. in the present case, though 'venue' of arbitration was agreed to be delhi but as regards the 'seat', the conduct of the respondent shows something to the contrary. the said conduct is delineated herein-under: (i) the respondent had instituted a petition in this court under section 11(6) of the act. though, as already discussed above, it is well settled that the high court while dealing with a petition under section 11(6) of the act would not fall within the meaning and ambit of 'court' as defined by section 2(i)(e) of the act, but filing of such petition is indeed a circumstance, which cannot be absolutely overlooked and may be taken into account particularly if some admissions made therein throw light on intention or conduct of any of the parties. in the present case, the respondent, in his aforesaid petition admitted that the cause of action has accrued within the territorial jurisdiction of this hon'ble court. para 10 is reproduced herein below: \"10. in view of the above, it is evident that disputed has arisen between the parties which can be adjudicated by the arbitral tribunal under the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. that the cause of action has accrued within the territorial jurisdiction of this hon'ble court. therefore, this hon'ble court has jurisdiction to try and entertain the present dispute.\" (ii) it is the respondent himself who approached the court at ludhiana in the first instance and filed a petition under section 34 of the act on 30.5.2017 (annexure p-13), wherein a specific pleading regarding cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 29 ) 2024:phhc:004418 jurisdiction was made in paragraph no. 4, which is reproduced herein-under: \"4. that this court has the jurisdiction as moat was executed at ludhiana. the property which was leased is situated at ludhiana. the application under section 11 of the arbitration act, 1996 was filed in the punjab and haryana high court as district ludhiana falls within the jurisdiction of hon'ble punjab and haryana high court. otherwise also, when the dispute relate to immovable property, the lis is to be filed in the court within whose jurisdiction the said property is situated. therefore, this hon'ble court has the jurisdiction to entertain and try the present petition.\" (iii) subsequently, on 3.7.2017, the petitioner also filed a petition (annexure p-14) under section 34 of the act in the court at ludhiana, wherein the petitioner in para no. 19 of the petition asserted that the court at ludhiana has jurisdiction and there was no specific denial to the said assertion in the reply filed by the respondent, which was merely to the effect that the same is a matter of record. para 19 and its reply are reproduced herein-under: para 19: \"that this court has got the jurisdiction to try and entertain the present petition as moat was executed at ludhiana and the property which was to be leased is situated at ludhiana and the application u/s 11 of the arbitration and conciliation act, was filed within the jurisdiction of hon'ble punjab and haryana high court. otherwise also the dispute relates to immovable property which is within jurisdiction of this hon'ble court and as such this hon'ble court is competent to entertain the present petition.\" reply : \"that the contents of para no. 19 of the objection petition are matter of record.\" (iv) that the respondent himself chose to file an execution petition (annexure p-17) in the court at ludhiana on 12.3.2022; cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 30 ) 2024:phhc:004418 (v) that after about 5 years of filing petition under section 34 of the act, the respondent chose to unconditionally withdraw his petition under section 34 by stating that he does not wish to pursue for modification of award; 31. the aforesaid conduct shows that it is a case where the respondent has consistently been asserting that the court at ludhiana has jurisdiction. it is not a case of any isolated application filed at ludhiana but is a case where the respondent has consciously being instituting and pursuing the petitions at ludhiana, whether filed by him or against him and never objected to jurisdiction at ludhiana. the venue which had been as agreed upon amongst the parties for the purpose of conduct of proceedings of arbitration i.e. delhi, could have been treated as 'seat' as well provided there was no 'indicia' to the contrary. the factum of the respondent having approached the court at ludhiana in the first instance for filing petition under section 34 of the act coupled with his specific averments as regards ludhiana having jurisdiction, as noticed above and having regularly pursued the petitions in ludhiana without ever having raised any doubt regarding jurisdiction for a good 5 years while specifically asserting that ludhiana has jurisdiction cannot be said to be a stray act on the part of the respondent but is a consistent conduct on his part admitting the jurisdiction at ludhiana. the respondent himself having chosen to approach the court at ludhiana is rather estopped from raising such an argument at this stage with regard to lack of jurisdiction at ludhiana. such like consistent conduct, would certainly constitute 'contrary indicia' so as to be excepted from the general principle that 'venue' of arbitration cr-6898-2023 (o&m) ( 31 ) 2024:phhc:004418 is to be deemed as 'seat' of arbitration in case seat is not defined in agreement. 32. the commercial court, ludhiana has, however, overlooked the said aspect and applied only the broad principle laid down in bgs soma's case whereas the instant case is a case falling under exception carved out in bgs soma's case itself. keeping in view the existence of 'indicia' contrary to the inference which could normally have been drawn regarding the seat being at delhi on the basis of agreed 'venue' being at delhi, it is held that it is the courts at ludhiana and not at delhi which is the 'seat' of arbitration. 33. in view of the discussion made above, the petition merits acceptance and is hereby accepted. the impugned order dated 15.5.2023 passed by the commercial court, ludhiana is hereby set aside. 34. the parties are directed to appear before the commercial court of ludhiana where the matter was pending before passing of impugned order on 31.1.2024. 5.1.2024 (gurvinder singh gill) kamal judge whether speaking/reasoned: yes/no whether reportable: yes/no"
