KARIA                      6th September 2018 ORAL JUDGMENT (PER : HONOURABLE Mr. JUSTICE AKIL KURESHI) \nThe petitioner has challenged an order dated 8th  June 2018  passed   by   the   Commercial   Court,   Vadodara   below   application  C/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT Exh. 9 in Commercial Execution Petition No. 8 of 2017.\nBrief facts are as under :\nPetitionerVadodara Mahanagar Seva Sadan [hereinafter to  be referred to as, \"the said Corporation\"], had floated a tender for  construction   of   66   MLD   Sewage   Treatment   Plant   at   Gajaravadi,  Vadodara. The respondent herein was one of the tenderors. The  rate of the respondent being the lowest, was awarded the contract.  During   the   course   of   execution   of   the   work,   dispute   surfaced  between the contractor and the Corporation. The agreement had  an arbitration clause. The respondentcontractor, therefore, sought  arbitration   for  resolution  of   such   disputes.  In  such  proceedings,  the Corporation also raised a counter claim. The total value of the  contractor's   claim   and   the   counter   claim   of   the   Corporation  exceeded   Rs.   1   Crore.   On   15th  November   2010,   the   Arbitrator  passed an award in favour of the contractor. In such award, the  learned Arbitrator provided as under :\n\"For the reasons aforesaid, the claim of the claimant  is partly allowed.\n[1] The claimant is held entitled to an amount of  Rs.   4,67,000/=   [Rupees   Four   Lacs,   Sixty   Seven  Thousand   only]   per   month   towards   operation   and  maintenance   charges   for   Gajrawadi   Sewage  Treatment Plant from 26 October 2004 to 24 October  C/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT 2007.   It   is,   however,   clarified   that   the   respondent Corporation   would   deduct   the   amount   which   has  already   been   paid   to   the   claimant   towards   ad   hoc  charges.\n[2] The   claimant   is   also   entitled   to   refund   of  Security Deposit of Rs. 63,000/=.\n[3] The claimant is held entitled to interest at the  rate   of   9   per   cent   per   annum   on   the   outstanding  amount of operation and maintenance charges as also  on Security Deposit with effect from 01 April 2008 till  the date of payment of amount by the Corporation. [4] The   claimant   is   entitled   to   Rs.   5,00,000/=  [Rupees Five Lacs only] towards Arbitration Costs. \n[5] The   counter   claim   of   the   respondent Corporation is dismissed. \nAward is accordingly passed.\" \nThe   Corporation   filed   an   appeal   under   Section   34   of   the  Arbitration   and   Conciliation   Act,   1996   [\"Arbitration     Act\"   for  short] before the concerned Civil Court. Upon establishment of the  Commercial   Court   under   the   Commercial   Courts,   Commercial  Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act,  2015 [\"the Act of 2015\" for short], the matter was transferred to the  Commercial Court at Vadodara. \nBy   a   judgment   dated   26th  August   2016,   the   Commercial  Court dismissed such an application. Subsequently, the contractor  filed   Execution   Petition   No.   8   of   2017   before   the   Commercial  Court,   Vadodara   seeking   recovery   of   a   sum   of   Rs.   54,59,647/=  C/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT with   interest.   In   such   proceedings,   the   petitioner   appeared   and  resisted the claim by filing application Exh. 9 raising a contention  that   in   terms   of   Order   VII   Rule   11   [d]   of   the   Code   of   Civil  Procedure, 1908 [\"CPC\" for short] , the execution petition should  be dismissed and in the alternative, the same should be returned  to the contractor for presentation before appropriate court having  jurisdiction  to  execute   the decree.  In short,  the contention  of the  Corporation   is   that   the   claim   of   the   contractor   in   the   execution  proceedings   is   below   Rs.   1   Crore   and   that   therefore,   the  Commercial   Court   would   have   no  jurisdiction  to   execute   the  decree.\nLearned advocate for the petitioner heavily relied on Section  2   [c]   of   the   Act   of   2015   which   defines   the   term   \"Commercial  dispute\"  and Section 2 [i] of the said Act which defines the term  \"Specified Value\". According to his contention, in the present case,  the   valuation   of   the   execution   petition   was   below   Rs.   1   Crore  which   would   not   be   covered   within   the   definition   of   the   term  \"specified   value\"   and   that   therefore,   the   Commercial   Court   at  Vadodara   has   no  jurisdiction  to   entertain   the   execution   petition. \nC/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT Similar contention was raised before the Court below. The learned  Judge rejected the application on the ground that the application  for setting aside arbitral award was filed before the Commercial  Court and was also decided by the Commercial Court  at which  point   of   time,   the   Corporation   had   raised   no   dispute   about   the  jurisdiction. The learned Judge also noted that the combined value  of the claim and the counter claim before the Arbitrator was over  Rs.   1   Crore.   The   Commercial   Court,   therefore,   was   the   correct  court having jurisdiction to entertain the application for execution.  The learned Judge was doubtful whether the provisions of Order  VII Rule 11 CPC would apply to an execution petition. Be that as it  may, on merits, the application was rejected. \nHaving heard learned advocate for the petitioner and having  perused   the   documents   and   statutory   provisions   applicable,   we  find no force in the stand of the Corporation.   As is well known,  once an award is passed by the Arbitral Tribunal, the same can be  challenged   in   terms   of   Section   34   of   the   Arbitration   Act.   Sub section   [1]   thereof   provides   for   recourse   to   a   Court   against   an  arbitral award that may be made only by an application for setting  C/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT aside   such   award   in   accordance   with   subsection   [2]   and   sub section [3].  If such an application for setting aside arbitral award is  not  filed,  or  if  filed  and the same is not  entertained, the award  could be enforced in terms of Section 36 of the Arbitration Act.  Section 36 provides that where the time for making an application  to set aside the arbitral award under Section 34 has expired, then  subject   to   the  proviso  to   subsection   [2],   such   award   shall   be  enforced in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil  Procedure, 1908 in the same manner as if it were a decree of the  Court.  The expression \"in the same manner as if it were a decree of the   Court\" is of significance. \nSection 2 [e] of the Arbitration Act defines the term \"Court\"  as under :\n\"Court\"   means   the   principal   Civil   Court   of  original  jurisdiction in a district, and includes the  High   Court   in   exercise   of   its   ordinary   original  civil  jurisdiction, having  jurisdiction  to decide the  questions   forming   the   subjectmatter   of   the  arbitration   if   the   same   had   been   the   subject matter   of   a   suit,  but   does   not   include   any   civil  court   of  a  grade inferior  to such  principal  Civil  Court, or any Court of Small Causes.\"\nC /SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT As per this  provision, thus, in case of an arbitration; other  than   international   commercial   arbitration,   the   Court   means   the  principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district; including  the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction,  having  jurisdiction  to   decide   the   questions   forming   the   subject  matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subjectmatter of  a   suit,   excluding   any   civil   court   of   a   grade   inferior   to   such  principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes. Thus, for the  purpose of Section 34, where there is a reference to recourse to a  Court against an arbitral award and for the purpose of Section 36  for enforcement of an arbitral award, where there is a reference to  the arbitral award being executed in the same manner as if it were  a   decree   of   the   Court,   the   definition   of   the   term   \"Court\"   as  contained in Section 2 [e] of the Arbitration Act would come into  play.\nWith this clarity, we may refer to the  relevant provisions of  the   Act   of   2015.     This   Act   vests   exclusive  jurisdiction  in   the  Commercial   Courts   to   decide   the   commercial   disputes   of   a  specified   value.   We   have   noted   that   these   terms   \"commercial   C/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT dispute\" and \"specified value\" have been defined under Section 2 [c]  and 2 [i]  respectively. The Corporation has not raised any dispute  that the dispute was a commercial one. Section 2 [i] defines the  term \"Specified Value\" in relation to a commercial dispute, as to  mean value of the subject matter in respect of a suit as determined  in   accordance   with   Section   12   which   shall   not   be   less   than   one  crore   rupees   or   such   higher   value,   as   may   be   notified   by   the  Central   Government.   Section   12   of   the   Act   of   2015   refers   to,  \"determination   of  specified  value\". Subsection [1]  thereof  provides  inter   alia  that   the   specified   value   of   the   subjectmatter   of   the  commercial   dispute   in   a   suit,   appeal   or   application   shall   be  determined, as per clause [a]  where the relief sought in a suit or  application   is   for   recovery   of   money,   the   money   sought   to   be  recovered   in   the   suit   or  application   inclusive  of  interest;  if  any,  computed upto the date of filing the suit or application, as the case  may be, shall be taken into account for determining such Specified  Value. Subsection [2] of Section 12 further provides that aggregate  value   of   the   claim   and   counter   claim;   if   any,   as   set   out   in   the  statement of claim and the counterclaim; if any, in an arbitration  C/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT of a commercial dispute shall be the basis of determining whether  such   arbitration   is   subject   to   the  jurisdiction  of   a   Commercial  Division, Commercial Appellate Division or Commercial Court; as  the case may be. In terms of these provisions and in particular sub section   [2]   of   Section   12   of   the   Act   of   2015,   for   deciding   the  specified   value   of   the   subject   matter   of   a   commercial   dispute,  which   is   the   subjectmatter   of   arbitration,   the   valuation   of   the  claim   and   the   counter   claim  both  together   would   be  taken  into  consideration. It was because of this reason that the application of  the Corporation for setting aside the arbitral award correctly came  to   be   transferred   to   the   Commercial   Court,   upon   such   Court  having been established.\nThe   Corporation   has   now   raised   a   contention   that   the  application for setting aside the arbitral award may be competent  before the Commercial Court, however, the Execution Petition of  the Contractor would not be, since the claim of the contractor in  such Execution Petition is   below Rs. 1 Crore. In this context, we  may refer to the relevant provisions of the Code. \nC/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT Section 37 of the CPC pertains to definition of Court which  passed   a   decree   and   provides   that   the   expression   \"Court   which   passed   a   decree\",   or   words  to  that  effect,  shall,   in  relation   to  the  execution   of   decrees,   unless   there   is   anything   repugnant   in   the  subject or context, be deemed to include - [a] where the decree to  be   executed   has   been   passed   in   the   exercise   of   appellate  jurisdiction, the Court of first instance, and [b] where the Court of  first instance has ceased to exist or to have jurisdiction to execute it,  the Court which, if the suit wherein the decree was passed was  instituted at the time of making the application for the execution of  the decree, would have  jurisdiction  to try such suit.  Section 38 of  the CPC pertains to \"Court by which decree may be executed\" and  provides that a decree may be executed either by the Court which  passed it, or by the Court to which it is sent for execution. In terms  of Section 38 of the CPC, thus, a decree is executable by a Court  which passed it. \nWe may recall, subsection [1] of Section 36 of the Arbitration  Act  provides  that   where the time for making  application  under  Section 34 has expired, then subject to the proviso to subsection [2],  C/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT such award shall be enforced in terms of provisions of CPC; in the  same manner as if it were a decree of the Court. By this deeming  fiction, thus, the Court having  jurisdiction  over the subject matter  would be the Court competent to execute it; as per Section 38 of  the CPC. \nSince   in   the   present   case,  jurisdiction  of   the   subject   matter  which was part of the arbitration proceedings ordinarily lies with  the Commercial Court and it was because of this reason that the  application for setting aside the arbitral award was transferred to  the Commercial Court, it was the Commercial Court which was  competent to enforce the arbitral award; as if it  were  a decree of  that Court.   We, therefore, find no force in the contentions of the  Corporation. \nWe may refer to the decision of Division Bench of this Court  in case of M/s. OCI Corporation vs. Kandla Export Corporation &  Ors.,  reported   in 2017  [1]  GLH 383 in which  the question  as to  which Court would be competent to entertain   execution petition  to   enforce   award   from   an   international   commercial   arbitration  came   up   for   consideration   before   the   Court.   The   Court,  C/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT considering the provisions of the Arbitration Act; as amended by  the Arbitration Act, 2015 and the provisions of the Act of 2015 and  in particular Section 15 thereof, concluded as under : \"11.00. The sum and substance of the above discussion would be, (1) Where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, all the applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such commercial Division has been constituted in the High Court i.e. in the present case High Court of Gujarat. \n(2) Where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute but not of a specified value and if such arbitration is international commercial arbitration, considering the provisions of Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 the same shall be heard, decided and disposed of by the concerned High Court. \n(3) Where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is other than international arbitration, all the applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 shall be filed in and heard, decided and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such commercial court has been constituted. \nConsidering section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act, all the applications / appeals in question under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, therefore are required to be transferred to the concerned Commercial Division of the High Court of Gujarat or C/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT before the Gujarat High Court or before the concerned commercial court and as observed hereinabove and as the case may be. \n12.00. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, all these applications stand disposed of and it is held that the concerned Executing Court before whom the respective Execution Petitions are pending shall not have any jurisdiction to execute foreign awards for which the Execution Petitions are filed. Consequently, the concerned Commercial court to return the respective Execution Petitions to the concerned original applicant to present it before appropriate Court considering the observations made in para 11 of the present judgment and order.\" Thus,   in   subpara   [3]   of   para   11   of   the   judgment ,   it   was  observed   that   where   the   subject   matter   of   an   arbitration   is   a  commercial dispute of a specified value and if such arbitration is  other than international arbitration, all the applications or appeals  arising   out   of   such   arbitration   under   the   provisions   of   the  Arbitration   Act   would   be   filed   and   heard,   and   decided   by   the  Commercial   Court   exercising   territorial   jurisdiction   over   such  arbitration   where   such   Commercial   Court   has   been   constituted.  We   note   that   SLP   against  such  judgment   was  dismissed  by  the  Supreme Court on 3rd March 2017. \nWe may also take note of the judgment of the Supreme Court  in  case of  Kandla Export Corporation vs. M/s. OCI Corporation,  SCALE 2018 [2] 368 in  which the question considered by the Court  C/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT was whether an appeal not maintainable under Section 50 of the  Arbitration Act is nonetheless maintainable under Section 13 [1] of  the Act of 2015. This proceeding was a sequel to the earlier dispute  of   execution   of   an   international   arbitration   award   in   which;   as  noted above, the Division Bench held that the execution petition  would lie before the Commercial Division of the High Court. In  such proceeding, objections were filed by the judgmentdebtor in  the   High   Court.   The   High   Court,   dismissed   the   objections   and  allowed the   execution petition. Against such order of the High  Court,   an   appeal   was   filed   under   the   Act   of   2015   before   the  Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court   which   was   dismissed   by   the  High   Court   holding   that   the   Act   of   2015   did   not   provide   any  additional right to appeal which was not otherwise available to the  appellants under the provisions of the Act. Against such judgment  of   the   High   Court,   the   loosing   party   approached   the   Supreme  Court. The Supreme Court, while dismissing the appeal held and  observed as under :\n\"23. This, in fact, follows from the language of  Section   50   itself.   In   all   arbitration   cases   of  enforcement   of   foreign   awards,   it   is   Section   50  C/SCA/13736/2018 JUDGMENT alone that provides an appeal. Having provided  for an appeal, the forum of appeal is left \"to the  Court   authorized   by   law   to   hear   appeals   from  such   orders\".   Section   50   properly   read   would,  therefore,  mean that if an appeal lies under the  said provision, then alone would Section 13 [1] of  the Commercial Courts Act be attracted as laying  down the forum which will hear and decide such  an appeal . \" \nWe have  taken note of these judgments mainly to remove  any   possibility   of   confusion   regarding   jurisdiction   of   the  Commercial Courts to entertain execution petitions in relation to  arbitral awards involving commercial disputes of  specified value.\nThe decision of Division Bench of this Court in case of M/s.   OCI   Corporation   vs.   Kandla   Export   Corporation   &   Ors.  [Supra]  supports our view. The decision of the Supreme Court in case of  Kandla Export Corporation  [SCALE 2018 (2) 368] was rendered in  relation to entirely different situation. \nPetition is dismissed. \n[Akil Kureshi, J.] [B.N Karia, J.] Prakash",

'm/s m.k. auto sales corporation'. 9. h.s. sahni states that on 07.07.1998, he applied for registration of the word mark \"m.g.i\", under class 12, by trademark application no. 809099 and the word mark \"m.g.\", under class 12, by trademark application no. 809098. he claimed use of the said marks since 01.04.1989. however, with respect to the word mark \"m.g.\", a rectification was filed on behalf of the appellants on 18.02.2020. the said matter is pending adjudication before the trademark registry. 10. h.s. sahni further states that in 2019, he applied for registration of the below mentioned trademarks, however, the same are pending. the details of the same are mentioned below:2022/dhc/004764 no. trademarks application class user status no. claimed 1 4166884 12 01.04.1989

no. a-132145/2019. the other trade dress/packaging, as claimed to be used by him, is relevant and set out below: the said copyrights are claimed to be used since 1989. 2022/dhc/004764 12. on a comparison of the copyrights of the parties, it is apparent that they are almost identical. the said copyrights are relevant and reproduced below: m.g. cables m.k. auto 13. h.s. sahni states that in the month of march, 2019, he came to know about the use of the impugned marks \"m.g. cable\" and \"m.g. cables (india)\", in respect of identical goods being sold by the appellants. h.s. sahni claims that the appellants are manufacturing, and selling identical products like automobile components including clutch cables, control cables, front brake cable, rear brake cables, speedometer cables, seat lock cables etc., under the impugned trademark \"m.g. cable\" and trade name \"m.g. cables (india)\", which is nearly identical/deceptively similar to its registered trademarks, that are, \"m.g.\" and \"m.g.i.\". 14. thereafter, h.s. sahni, through his advocates, issued a cease-anddesist notice dated 02.04.2019 and, inter alia, called upon the appellants to cease and desist from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, stocking or otherwise dealing in cables and wires or any other cognate or allied goods under the impugned marks \"m.g.\" and \"m.g. cables (india)\" 2022/dhc/004764 15. pursuant to the said notice, on 13.05.2019, the appellants filed a suit against h.s. sahni [being cs no. 115/2019], inter alia, seeking a decree of declaration that the appellants are the prior and legal user of the trademark \"m.g. cable\" and copyright in the packaging titled \"m.g. cable\"; permanent injunction against h.s. sahni to restrain him from making \"groundless threats of legal proceedings\"; damages to the tune of ₹5,00,000/-. however, the said suit was dismissed by the court on the ground of the non-prosecution. 16. on 03.07.2019, the appellants filed a second suit being cs (comm) no. 146/2019, inter alia, seeking a permanent injunction against h.s. sahni from infringing their registered trademarks. 17. on 04.07.2019, the learned commercial court granted an ex parte ad interim injunction against h.s. sahni and restrained it from using the impugned mark \" \" the case set up by the appellants: 18. the appellants state that on account of their continuous use in the trademark and copyright \"m.g. cable\", they have acquired enviable goodwill and reputation among the public and trade and thus, the said mark and copyright have acquired distinctive character and are associated with its business. the appellants further claim that they adopted a unique trade dress for its products inasmuch as the packaging of its product (control cables) in yellow and orange colour with its logo in the 2022/dhc/004764 background in black make the same distinctive. the appellants also state that their gross sales in the year 2018 were rs 1,25,00,805/19. the appellants claims that h.s. sahni has not manufactured or sold any products bearing the impugned mark \"m.g. cable\" till the month of april, 2019. they referred to the following invoices, produced as evidence by h.s. sahni, in support of their contention: copy of the invoices 2022/dhc/004764 20. the appellants claims that h.s. sahni is a habitual infringer inasmuch as the invoices filed by him pertaining to several years, mention the marks 'ronak', 'automax', 'wirepool' 'datsun' etc., which were other well-known trademarks, in addition to the mark \"m.g.i\". the appellants further claimed that if h.s. sahni was manufacturing the products bearing the mark \"m.g. cables\", it would have advertised its own products in the invoices and not used words to the effect \"always insist original datsun control cables\". 21. the appellants have also asserted that the impugned copyright and device mark of h.s. sahni also has the letters 'm' and 'g' written in the exact same manner as that of its mark ( ). the case set up by h.s. sahni: 2022/dhc/004764 22. h.s. sahni states that the appellants, by using the impugned mark \"m.g. cable\" and adopting \"m.g. cables (india)\" are infringing his registered trademarks \"m.g.\" and \"m.g.i.\". further, the trade name and the impugned marks used by the appellants were visually, phonetically and structurally identical to his registered trademarks. he further contended that the placement of the letters 'm' and 'g' had been deliberately copied by the appellants and the word 'cable' is a generic word describing the goods and therefore, if the generic word is ignored, the similarity in the two marks is apparent. he also contended that the appellants had registered their marks under class 6, however, they were attempting to dishonestly produce and market their goods under class 12 by using the trademarks that were deceptively similar to his registered trademarks. the impugned order: 23. on 02.09.2019, the learned commercial court considered the rival submissions and prima facie, found merit in the appellants' case. the learned commercial court was of a prima facie view that h.s. sahni had infringed the appellants' trademark and had passed off his goods as those of the appellants. the relevant extract of the impugned order is reproduced below:'24. from the above discussion and the argument advanced by both the parties and from the careful perusal of the documents filed in support therein, it is reflected that plaintiff has prima facie shown that he is having registered trademark for the mark 'm.g.cable'. plaintiff has also been able to show that he is the prior user since 2022/dhc/004764 1996 and as per the documents with particular mention of 'm.g. cable' since, 2000 onwards. plaintiff has also been able to show prima facie that he is having a copyright of his trade-dress. defendant on the other has not been able to show prima facie his prior use than the plaintiff. more particularly the trade-dress used by the defendant appears to be similar to the trade-dress of the plaintiff. the tradedress of both the parties which are available on the judicial record have been perused thoroughly. plaintiff has also been able to show prima facie that he has also obtained noc from registrar of trademark as well. thus, the judgments relied upon by the plaintiff and more particularly chinna trust (supra) are applicable in present facts and circumstances and the judgment devans (supra) which has been relied upon by the defendant is equally applicable in the present facts and circumstances. the plaintiff has therefore been able to establish the prima facie case in his favour and against the defendant. as per the ratio laid down in the above cited judgments, it is reflected that there can be registration of certificate for a product in different classes as there may be overlapping with regard to the categories mentioned therein. in such circumstances, it is the prior use which has to be considered. in the present case it appears to be in favour of plaintiff as mentioned above. in such circumstances therefore, balance of convenience is also tilted in favour of plaintiff and i am of the considered opinion that, he shall suffer an irreparable loss on each and every day if the relief sought by him is not granted. 25. the defendant on the other hand has not been able to substantiate his argument in the light of the material so available before this court, therefore, application under order xxxix rule 4 cpc is dismissed and application under order xxxix rule 1 and 2 cpc is allowed. 26. defendant, its associates, agents etc are restrained from using the registered trademark and registered copyright vested in the trade-dress/packaging 'm. g. cable' and/or 2022/dhc/004764 any other mark deceptively and confusingly similar to the plaintiffs registered trademark and registered copyright vested in the trade dress/packaging 'm. g. cable' amounting to infringement of plaintiffs registered trademark and copyright during pendency of the suit.' 24. aggrieved by the impugned order, the parties filed the present intra court appeals. reasons and conclusion: 25. the appellants as well as h.s. sahni claim that they are the prior users of the trademark \"m.g. cables\". the learned commercial court had found in favour of the appellants and observed that they had been able to show prior user since the year 1996. further, the appellants had also established copyright in the trade dress used by them. as opposed to same, the learned commercial court found that h.s. sahni has not been able to, prima facie, establish that he was a prior user of the trademark in question. 26. the first and foremost question, to be addressed, is whether the aforesaid findings of the learned commercial court warrant any interference in these proceedings. there is no document available on record which suggests that h.s. sahni was using trademarks \"m.g\", \"m.g.i\" or \"m.g cable\" since the year 1989, as claimed by him. 27. h.s. sahni [through m.k. auto sales corporation] had opposed an application filed by one of the constituent partners of appellant no.2 [m/s mg cables (india)] for registration of the mark \"mgx\", under class 12, by trademark application no.1653480 dated 13.02.2008. in its 2022/dhc/004764 opposition, h.s. sahni had claimed that he had spent a large sum of money in publicity of the trademarks \"m.g.\" and \"m.g.i\"; however, there is no material on record to show any such expenditure on publicity of the said trademarks \"m.g.\"/\"m.g.i\". the earliest invoice placed on record by h.s. sahni, in support of his claim that he was dealing in control cables, is dated 25.08.1989. the image of the said invoice is reproduced below28. the said invoice mentions \"mgi\" and several others marks, namely, \"ronak\", \"automax\", \"wirepool\" and \"datsun\". some of these marks are similar to other well-known marks. further, the printed endorsement on the invoice reads: \"always insist original datson control cables\". this indicates that h.s. sahni was using the trademarks \"datsun\"/\"datson\" in respect of control cables. some of the invoices for a later period do not indicate the names of any 2022/dhc/004764 brands/trademarks but bear the words \"datsun genuine cables extra fiction free\" in in the shape of a seal. the image of one such invoice dated 09.01.2007 is reproduced below: 29. indisputably, mere registration of the trademarks is not sufficient to establish their use. 30. h.s. sahni had also produced invoices from the year 2018, which mention the trademarks \"mg\", \"mgi\" and \"automax\" on top as well as on the lower portion of the invoices. the said invoices continue to bear the printed words \"datsun genuine cables\" in the form a seal, however, the letters mc(r) have been added. the notation below the trademarks on the bottom of the said invoice continues to read as \"always insist original datsun control cables\". an image of the invoice dated 25.07.2018 is relevant and reproduced below2022/dhc/004764 31. the aforesaid documents do not establish that h.s. sahni was using the trademark \"m.g\"/\"m.g.i\" and not \"datsun\" in respect of automotive control cables. however, even if it is accepted that the aforesaid invoice indicates the use of the trademark \"m.g\"/\"m.g.i\", the said use is not prior to the year 2017 as the earliest such invoice is of the year 2017. 32. the appellants claim that the trademark \"yemgi\" was coined by the father of appellant no.1. he carried on the business under the trade name \"yemgi\". the said word was coined by combining the initials of the appellant no.1 (mukul) and his brother (gaurav). the appellants claim that appellant no.1 and his brother (also a constituent partner of appellant no.2) adopted the trade name \"m.g cables (india)\" in the year 1996 and applied for registration of the trademark \"m.g. cable\" on 30.03.1998 under class 6 (by trademark application no. 796989). 2022/dhc/004764 33. h.s. sahni applied for registration of the trademarks \"m.g\" and \"m.g.i\" under class 12 on 07.07.1998. this was subsequent to the appellants' application for registration of the trademark under class 6. 34. the appellants have also produced other documents such as an mtnl telephone bill dated 24.12.1996 in the name of \"mg cables india\"; certificate bearing registration no. 4/19447/ii under the delhi shop and establishments act, 1954 dated 01.06.1988 reflecting the use of the tradename yemgi; and an ad hoc mcd license (license no. 416) dated 17.05.2019 indicating the use of the tradename \"m/s yemgi industries\". 35. in addition, the appellants have also produced invoices including an invoice dated 18.06.2001, which bears the mark \"m.g cable\" on its top left corner. 36. in view of the above, this court is unable to fault the prima facie finding of the learned commercial court that the appellants were the prior user of the mark \"m.g. cables\". the appellants had applied for and obtained the registration of the copyright in respect of the artistic work of the trade dress of the product \"m.g. cables\" in the year 2013. the extract from the register of the copyrights indicates that appellant no.2 is a registered proprietor of the copyright bearing no.106276/2013, in respect of the following work:2022/dhc/004764 37. as noted above, on 11.05.2019, h.s. sahni has also applied for registration of the following device mark under class 12, by trademark application no. 4173793: 38. it is apparent from the above that h.s. sahni has applied for registration of the device mark, which is almost identical to the appellants' copyright. clearly, h.s. sahni cannot be permitted to use the said trademark or any other deceptively similar trademark in respect of the same product unless he is able to establish his right to do so. 39. the next question, to be addressed, is whether the learned commercial court had erred in not appreciating that whilst h.s. sahni was a registered proprietor of the trademarks \"m.g\"/ \"m.g.i\" under class 2022/dhc/004764 12; appellant no.2 is the proprietor of the registered trademark in class 6 (and not class 12). 40. mr. bansal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of h.s. sahni, emphasised that h.s. sahni had registered the said trademarks under class 12 in relation to \"parts, fittings and accessories of motor land vehicles, control cables, meter cables for use in motor land vehicles\". the appellants' trademark \"m.g. cable\" was registered in class 6 in relation to \"unwrought or partlywrought common metals and their alloys, non-electrical wires and cables nut and bolts and spring all being goods included in class 06\". he submitted that the appellants did not have any registration in respect of control cables or automotive parts but in respect of hardware; therefore, the learned commercial court had erred in granting an interim injunction on the basis of the said registration. 41. the material, placed on record, clearly indicates that the appellants are, inter alia, engaged in the business of dealing with automotive cables/control cables, however, they had secured the registration of the trademark \"m.g. cable\" under class 6 in relation to goods which also included \"non-electrical wires\". class 12 appears to be the apposite class for registration of the product in question (control cables). however, on a broader literal interpretation, the said wires would also fall in the description of \"non-electrical wires\". thus, we cannot readily accept that the registration of the trademarks in favour of the appellants would not inure to their benefit in respect of control cables. the specified classes of goods for purposes of registration of trademarks is a broad classification. it would be erroneous to consider them as distinct airtight silos. 2022/dhc/004764 42. section 7 of the trade marks act, 1999 deals with classification of goods. the said section reads as under: \"7. classification of goods and services. (1) the registrar shall classify goods and services, as far as may be, in accordance with the international classification of goods and services for the purposes of registration of trade marks. (2) any question arising as to the class within which any goods or services falls shall be determined by the registrar whose decision shall be final.\" 43. the international classification of goods and services (nice classification) (9th edition) issued in geneva in the year 2006 gives further sub-classifications of the classification of goods and services. presently, the registry of trade marks in india follows the 10th edition of 'nice classification' of goods and services. the nice classification consists of a list of classes. under the said system, there are 34 classes of goods and 11 classes of services [classes 1 to 34 deal with the specification of goods whereas classes 35 to 45 deal with the specification of services]. 44. class 6 relates to \"common metal and their alloys; metal building material; transportable buildings of metal, materials of metal for railways tracks; non-electric cables and wires of common metal; ironmongery; small items of metal hardware; pipes and tubes of metal, safes and goods of common metal not included in other classes; ores; cables of metal, non-electric\" and goods which are covered under class 2022/dhc/004764 45. it is relevant to refer to class 7, which includes \"machines and machines tools; motors and engineers (except for land vehicles); machine coupling and transmission components (except for land vehicles); agriculture implements other than hand operated; incubators for eggs\". the same includes \"control cables machines, engines, or motors\". class 12 tends to \"vehicles; apparatus for locomotion by land, air or water\". the number of goods indicated under the said classification, however, do not include cables or control cables. 46. the various classes of goods were also set out in the fourth schedule to the trade mark rules, 2002, which was applicable prior to the trade mark rules, 2017 coming into force. class 6 under the said schedule reads as \"common metals and their alloys; metal building material; transportable buildings of metal; materials for metal for railways tracks; non-electrical cables and wires of common metal; ironmongery, small items of metal hardware; pipes and tubes of metal; safes; goods of common metal not included in other classes; ores\". class 12 reads as \"vehicles; apparatus for locomotion by land, air or water\". it is relevant to bear in mind that the registrar is required to classify goods for the purposes of registration of a trademark, however, the trademarks are used by proprietor in respect of specific goods and services. 47. in fdc limited v. docsuggest healthcare services pvt. ltd. & anr.: 2017 (69) ptc 218 (del), this court had held that \"the classification of goods and services under section 7 of the act is not the criterion for deciding the question of similarity in goods and services.\". the court had referred to the following passage from k.c. 2022/dhc/004764 kailasam./ramu vedaraman's law on trade marks & geographical indications 1st edition, 2003:\"classification of goods given in the rules not the criterion whether or not two sets of goods or services are of the same description is not be decided on the basis of the classification of goods and services given in the 4th schedule to the trade marks rules, 2002. the description of goods may be narrower or wider than any of the classes according to the circumstances of the case. as we observed by lindley j., in the australian wine importers trade mark case ((1889) 6 rpc 311). \"if you come to look at that classification, you will find goods of the same description, in one sense, in different classes, and you will find goods of different description in the same class.\" 48. in the case of sri vari pharma v. apex labrotories pvt ltd und ors.: 2015 scc online mad 14278, the court held that \"classification of goods and service under the trademark is a broad classification: whether the plaintiff's product will fall within that classification or not, is purely a subject matter of trial\" 49. it is also well settled that if a person has obtained a registration in respect of entire class of goods but intends to use the registered trademark for only a specific product falling within the said class, the registration granted to him is required to be limited to the goods or services in respect to which the proprietor intends to use the said trademark [see: vishnudas kishendas v. vazir sultan tobacco co. ltd.: 1996 ptc (16) 512 (sc)]. 50. in the present case, the appellants intend to use the trademark only in connection with non-electrical cables and other metal parts. thus, it would be apposite to consider the registration in respect of the said goods. 2022/dhc/004764 as stated above, it was possible, at the material time, to accept the said goods under class 6. in the given facts, we are unable to accept that the registration of the trademark in question, in favour of the appellants, would not inure to its benefit in respect of the goods in question. 51. the next question to be considered is whether the appellants were required to, prima facie, establish their prior use from the date of the registration of the trademarks \"m.g\" or \"m.g.i\" in favour of h.s. sahni. mr. bansal had earnestly contended that it was not sufficient for the appellants to establish that their use of the trademark was prior to the use by h.s. sahni; they were required to establish that they had used the mark prior to registration of the trademark \"m.g\" and \"m.g.i\", in favour of h.s. sahni. he relied upon section 34 of the trade marks act, 1999, in support of his contention. 52. section 34 of the trade marks act, 1999 is reproduced under:\"34. saving for vested rights.--nothing in this act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of registered trade mark to interfere with or restrain the use by any person of a trade mark identical with or nearly resembling it in relation to goods or services in relation to which that person or a predecessor in title of his has continuously used that trade mark from a date prior-(a) to the use of the first-mentioned trade mark in relation to those goods or services be the proprietor or a predecessor in title of his; or (b) to the date of registration of the firstmentioned trade mark in respect of those goods or services in the name of the proprietor of a predecessor in title of his; 2022/dhc/004764 whichever is the earlier, and the registrar shall not refuse (on such use being proved), to register the second mentioned trade mark by reason only of the registration of the first mentioned trade mark.\" 53. a plain reading of section 34 of the trade marks act, 1999 indicates that the rights of a prior user of a mark are protected and cannot be interfered with by a proprietor of a registered trademark. thus, to seek the benefit of section 34 of the trade marks act, 1999, h.s. sahni must establish that he was a prior user of the trademark \"m.g\"/\"m.g.i\". 54. in the case of s. syed mohideen v. p. sulochana bai: (2016) 2 scc 683, the supreme court held as under: \"30.4. conjoint reading of sections 34, 27 and 28 would show that the rights of registration are subject to section 34 which can be seen from the opening words of section 28 of the act which states \"subject to the other provisions of this act, the registration of a trade mark shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor.\" and also the opening words of section 34 which states \"nothing in this act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of registered trade mark to interfere.\" thus, the scheme of the act is such where rights of prior user are recognised superior than that of the registration and even the registered proprietor cannot disturb/interfere with the rights of prior user. the overall effect of collective reading of the provisions of the act is that the action for passing off which is premised on the rights of prior user generating a goodwill shall be unaffected by any registration provided under the act.\" 55. in a subsequent decision, the supreme court in neon laboratories ltd. v. medical technologies ltd: 2016 2 scc 672, referred to section 34 of the trade marks act, 1999 and observed that \"this \"first user\" rule is a seminal part of the act.\". 2022/dhc/004764 56. the next question, to be addressed, is whether h.s. sahni is entitled to the benefit of section 33 of the trade marks act, 1999. it is contended on behalf of h.s. sahni that the appellants were aware of the trademarks registered in his favour as one of the constituent partners of appellant no.2 had applied for registration of the trademark \"mgx\" under class 12, by trademark application no. 1653480 dated 13.02.2008. the said application had been opposed by h.s. sahni [through m.k. auto sales corporation] on 24.03.2009. thus, the appellants were aware of the trademarks \"m.g\" and \"m.g.i\", registered in favour h.s. sahni but had taken no steps to challenge the same. 57. in view of the prima facie findings that h.s. sahni has been unable to show any usage of the trademark \"m.g\"/\"m.g.i\" prior to the year 2017, the question of any acquiescence on the part of the appellants in such use does not arise. further, it is settled law that acquiescence cannot be inferred by mere inaction on the part of the proprietor of a registered trademark. it must be established that the proprietor's conduct had, either tacitly or by positive acts, encouraged the use of the allegedly infringing trademark. 58. in the case of m/s power control appliances & ors. v. sumeet machines private limited: (1994) 2 scc 448, the supreme court held as under:\"26. acquiescence is sitting by, when another is invading the rights and spending money on it. it is a course of conduct inconsistent with the claim for exclusive rights in a trade mark, trade name etc. it implies positive acts; not merely silence or inaction such as is involved in laches.\" 2022/dhc/004764 59. in ramdev food products (p) ltd. v. arvindbhai rambhai patel & ors.: (2006) 8 scc 726, the supreme court observed that: \"106. the defence of acquiescence, thus, would be satisfied when the plaintiff assents to or lays by in relation to the acts of another person and in view of that assent or laying by and consequent acts it would be unjust in all the circumstances to grant the specific relief\". 60. in view of the above, this court finds no infirmity with the decision of the learned commercial court in restraining h.s. sahni from using the trademark \"m.g cable\" or any other deceptively similar marks. however, insofar as restraining h.s. sahni from using the trademarks \"m.g\"/ \"m.g.i\" is concerned, the learned commercial had declined the said interim relief solely on the ground that h.s. sahni was a proprietor of the said registered trademarks. 61. as noted above, the learned commercial court had, prima facie, found that the appellants were prior user of the trademark \"m.g cable\". they held the registered copyright in respect of the artistic work of the label \"m.g cable\". the appellants were also registered proprietors of the trademark \"m.g cable\" albeit under class 6 but in respect of the same products. notwithstanding the same, h.s. sahni has not been restrained from using the mark \"m.g\" and \"m.g.i\". however, it is clear that use of the trademark \"m.g\" and \"m.g.i\" has the propensity to cause confusion in the minds of the customer. after the learned commercial court had passed the impugned order, h.s. sahni had commenced using the following labels:2022/dhc/004764 62. it is seen from the above that the font and manner in which \"mg genuine parts\", is printed on the aforesaid labels are strikingly similar to the font and manner in which \"mg cables\" is printed in the appellants' label. in view of the, prima facie, finding of the learned commercial court with which we concur an interim order, restraining h.s. sahni from using the trademarks \"m.g\" or \"m.g.i\", ought to have been issued. 63. it is well settled that it is necessary to restrain the use of deceptive marks not only to protect the rights of the proprietors of the trademark but to also protect the public at large, who may be misled as to the source of the infringing product. 64. the appellants have already preferred an application seeking cancellation of the registration of the marks in favour of h.s. sahni. in the given facts, this court considers it apposite to restrain h.s. sahni from using the trademarks \"m.g\" and \"m.g.i\" or any other marks deceptively similar to the mark \"m.g cable\" till the disposal of the rectification application filed by the appellants. in terms of section 124 of the trade 2022/dhc/004764 marks act, 1999, the suit is liable to be stayed till the disposal of the said application. 65. the appeal filed by h.s. sahni [fao (comm) 88/2021] is, accordingly, rejected and the appeal filed by mr mukul singhal and m/s m.g. cables [fao (comm) 89/2021] is allowed. pending applications, if any, are disposed of. vibhu bakhru, j amit mahajan, j november 10, 2022 ch"
