Joshi, Jj.\n                                              \n                                    Reserved on   24th October, 2016\n                                   Listed for directions on 3rd March, 2017  \n                                    Pronounced on 29th March, 2017 \n\nOral Order:  (Per V.M. Kanade, J.)\n1] All these appeals can be disposed of by a common order since they are arising out of the common judgment delivered by the learned Single Judge.\nPreliminary Objection:\n2] Mr . Madon, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Respondents in all these appeals has raised a preliminary objection regarding maintainability of these appeals. He submitted that in view of language used in Section 13 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (hereafter referred to as \"Commercial Courts Act\"), appeal against the impugned judgment and order will not be maintainable. \n3] Before considering the rival contentions, it will be necessary to briefly state the relevant facts for the purpose of deciding this preliminary objection. \nCOMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 FACTS:\n4] Prior to 1987, a partnership firm was carrying on business in the name and style of Juggilal Kamlapat Bankers which was reconstituted from time to time and it was finally reconstituted on 21/02/1980. \n5] Sometime in the year 1987, differences arose between the partners of the firm and on 26/03/1987, a deed of dissolution of partnership was executed between the partners and the firm was dissolved with effect from 19/03/1987. A supplemental agreement was also executed on 28/03/1987. Partners agreed to partition and distribute the immovable properties of the said firm amongst the partners. \n6] Since there was some dispute regarding distribution, the Arbitration Suit No.1904 of 1992 was filed by Respondent Nos. 1 to 6 for appointment of an Arbitrator under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. The suit was initially dismissed on the ground of limitation. The matter travelled upto the Supreme Court and the Apex Court held that the suit was within time and the disputes between the parties were referred to the arbitration of the sole arbitrator Mr. Justice S.N. Variava (Retd.).\n7] The learned Arbitrator passed an Award on 04/08/2008 and in COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 the said Award he was pleased to order and direct partition and distribution of various immovable properties of the firm amongst the partners. For the purpose of deciding the preliminary objection of maintainability of these appeals, it is not necessary to go into details of the manner of distribution of properties. \n8] The Award was challenged under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and the Petition challenging the said award was dismissed by this Court on 01/10/2009. Being aggrieved by the said Order, an appeal was preferred under Section 37 of the said Act, 1996 by the Bombay Group and Kanpur Group which was also disposed of on 08/03/2013 and therefore the said Award became executable as a decree. \n9] Since the distribution did not take place and the Award was not complied with, an Execution Application No.2006 of 2015 under Order XXI of CPC was filed in this Court and the relief was claimed for possession of the Bombay property. Respondent No.16 also filed Execution Application No.1913 of 2015. Thereafter, Notice No.1786 of 2015 was issued under Order XXI Rule 22 of the CPC to all the parties in the Execution Application to show cause why the said Award was not executable and why warrant of possession should not be issued. All the parties filed detailed reply to the said notice. Appellants herein opposed and resisted the execution of the Award on COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 the ground that the obligations of the groups in the Award were joint, interlinked and interconnected and to be executed and complied with simultaneously.\n10 ] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Respondents, has raised a preliminary objection regarding maintainability of these appeals and his contention is that these orders which are passed in execution proceedings are not decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Division nor are orders which are specifically enumerated in sub-section (1) of Section 13. He therefore inter alia submitted that these appeals are not maintainable. \n11] On the other hand, Mr. Virag Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants has submitted that these appeals are not restricted either to decrees or orders which are specifically enumerated in the proviso but also would lie against decision of the Commercial Courts or Commercial Division which has the effect of attaining finality and even against such a decision, appeal would be maintainable. It is his contention that the order passed in execution proceedings is in the nature of final order affecting substantive rights of the appellants and, therefore, these appeals are maintainable. \n12] We have heard all the parties at length and they have filed their Written Submissions. \nCOMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Submissions of the learned Senior Counsel Mr. D. D. Madon for Respondent Nos. 1 to 5 in COMAP/4/2016 and for Respondent Nos. 1 to 6 in COMAPL/5/2016 and COMAPL/6/2016 . \n13] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Respondents Nos. 1 to 5 - Kolkata Group made the following submissions:-\n(I) Firstly, he submitted that the objections taken by the Appellants in the execution proceedings fall within the ambit of Section 47 Explanation II (b) of the Civil Procedure Code (\"CPC\"), which deals with all questions relating to the delivery of property in execution. He submitted that the principal objection of the Appellants is that the Respondents are seeking to execute only a part of the Award and, therefore, their contention is that the obligations of all parties to the Award should be performed simultaneously and that the Award should not be executed in parts since the same is fashioned as an indivisible whole. He submitted that as per the Amendment Act 104 of 1976, determination of any questions within \"Section 47\" of the CPC were omitted from the definition of the word \"decree\" and therefore no appeal under Section 96 of the CPC would lie against the orders passed in execution proceedings under Section 47 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 read with Order XXI Rule 22. \n(II) Secondly, he submitted that the provisions of Letters Patent of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court will have no applicability and the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act would prevail over the Letters Patent in its applicability to commercial disputes. He therefore submitted that no appeal could lie under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. He contended that execution proceedings under Section 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (For short \"Arbitration Act\") are not proceedings under the CPC but under the Arbitration Act which is an exhaustive Code by itself and which does not provide for any such appeal and therefore applicability of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent has been impliedly excluded by Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. He relied on the judgment of Jet Airways (India) Limited vs. Subrata Roy Sahara 1 (paras 1, 9, 15-30 & 34) in which it was held that LPA does not lie since the execution was under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act and not under the provisions of the CPC.\nHe further submitted that since no appeal had been provided under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, an appeal would not be maintainable. He submitted that Division Bench in the case of Jet Airways (India) Ltd. 1 2011 SCC OnLine Bom 1379 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 (supra) followed the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Furest Day Lawson vs. Jindal Exports Limited 1 (paras 89-91). He then submitted that in Paramjeet Singh Patheja vs. ICDS Ltd2, the Supreme Court held that the arbitral award cannot be considered to be a decree for any purpose for any Central or State Act. \n(III) Thirdly, he submitted that Section 13(2) of the Commercial Courts Act specifically excludes LPA and therefore in view of binding precedent, the present execution proceedings were not the proceedings under the CPC but the proceedings under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. He submitted that Section 37 of the Arbitration Act does not provide for an appeal from execution proceedings. He submitted that Clause 15 of the Letters Patent is impliedly excluded by the Arbitration Act and no appeal could lie from the order in execution proceedings of an award. \n(IV) Fourthly, he submitted that the term \"judgment\" in Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act must be given the same meaning and definition as in Section 2(9) of the CPC and not the expanded 1 (2011) 8 SCC 333 2 (2006) 13 SCC 322 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 meaning as under the Letters Patent. \n(V) Fifthly, he submitted that the word \"decision\" in Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act must be read to mean \"decree\". \n(VI) Sixthly, he submitted that assuming the word \"decision\" includes judgment and order even then an appeal would not be maintainable under the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that the proviso contained in Section 13(1) provides for appeals only from certain Orders under Order XLIII of the CPC and Section 37 of the Arbitration Act and since the impugned Order is not a decree, no appeal would lie in view of proviso to Section 13(1).\n(VII) Seventhly, he submitted that the Appellants are not obstructionists. He submitted that the present Application was tried and determined under Section 47 and not under Rules 58, 98 or 103 of Order XXI of the CPC. \n(VIII) Eighthly, he submitted that the Appellants never had vested right of appeal prior to enactment of COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 the Commercial Courts Act in view of the legal position settled in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra). He submitted that the right of appeal had been expressly taken away by virtue of the provisions of Section 13(2) of the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court vide its Judgment dated 24/10/2015 in Hubtown Limited vs. IDBI Trusteeship Service Ltd delivered in Commercial Appeal No.7 of 2016 had held that appeal would lie from Order granting conditional leave inter alia on the ground that since the suit was filed prior to the coming into force of the Commercial Courts Act, the Appellants had vested right of appeal. He submitted that, in the present case, there was no right of appeal available to the Appellants prior to coming into force of the Commercial Courts Act. \nSubmissions of the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Virag Tulzapurkar, for the Appellant in COMAPL/5/2016. \n14] Mr. Virag Tulzapurkar the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants made the following submissions:-\n(A) Firstly, he submitted that Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act is a sole provision providing COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 for governing the appeals under the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that the said Section including its heading, uses the expression \"decision\", \"decree\" or a \"judgment\" or an \"order\". He contended that the expression \"decision\" in Section 13(1) of the said Act refers to a decision which has the characteristic and quality of finality i.e. one which conclusively determines the rights of the parties to the proceeding. He submitted that in view of Section 13(1), against such a decision, appeal is maintainable and, therefore, it is not necessary to refer to the proviso of Section 13(1). \n(B) Secondly, he submitted that proviso to Section 13(1) gives an additional right of appeal against such orders as are specifically enumerated (i) under Order XLIII of the CPC and (ii) under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act and merely because \"orders\" or \"decisions\" which have attained finality as provided under Section 13(1) are not mentioned in the proviso, appeal against such orders would not be excluded under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. He, therefore, submitted that the proviso to Section 13(1) has to be read as an independent statutory enactment COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 which gives an additional right of appeal under the Commercial Courts Act. In support of the said submissions, he relied on the following Judgments of the Apex Court:-\n[1] The State of Orissa vs. Debaki Debi and Ors1 [2] Commissioner of Stamp Duties vs. Alan Cavave Atwill and Ors.2 (Pages 330, 331 and 332) [3] Madhu Gopal vs. VI Additional District Judge and Ors3 (Para 7) [4] Swedish Match AB and Anr. vs. Securities and Exchange Board of India & Anr.4 (Paras 65 & 66) He submitted that under the Commercial Courts Act, whether an appeal from a particular \"decision\" lies or not is to be decided on the basis of the nature of the decision itself and its intrinsic character. He submitted that if the decision conclusively or finally adjudicates upon and 1 1964 SC 1413 2 1973 (2) WLR 327 3 AIR 1989 SCC 155 4 (2004) 11 SCC 641 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 determines the rights of parties then an appeal will lie under Section 13(1). \n(C) Thirdly, he submitted that heading of the Section can be used in aid of construing or interpreting a Section. In support of the said submission, he relied upon the following judgments:-\n[1] Oulater Hall & Co. Ltd vs. Board of Trade1 (Pages 832 to 833) [2] Inglis vs. Robertson and Baxter2 ( Page 630) [3] Bhinka and Ors vs. Charan Singh3 (Page 966, para 15) [3] Raichurmatham Prabhakar and Anr. vs. Rawatmal Dugar4 (Page 775, para 14) He submitted that, therefore, a \"decree\" is appealable under Section 13(1) itself, even if it does not find place in and is not referred to in the 1 (1961) 3 W.L.R. 825 2 1898 AC 616 3 AIR 1959 SC 960 4 2004(4) SCC 766 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 proviso. \n(D) Fourthly, he submitted that definition of the word \"decree\" in CPC is incorporated in the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that Section 2(2) of the Commercial Courts Act states that the words and expressions used and not defined under the Commercial Courts Act, but defined under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and the Evidence Act, 1872, should be given the same meaning as assigned to them in the Code and the Act. He submitted that definitions of \"decree\", \"order\" and \"judgment\" as referred to in the CPC, apply to the Commercial Courts Act as they are not separately defined in the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that though the words \"section 47\" were omitted by the 1976 amendment from the definition of the word \"decree\", alternative provisions were made by amendments incorporated in the CPC at about the same time in several provisions of the CPC such as Order 21 Rules 58(4), Rule 98(2) - Bombay Amendment and Order 21 Rule 103 of the CPC (read with Order 21 Rules 97, 98, 99, 101 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 therein). He submitted that any order passed adjudicating any application therein has the force of a decree for the purpose of appeal. He relied on Order XXI Rule 103. He submitted that the Respondents' contention that under Order XXI Rules 97 to 103 only a third party, and not the judgment debtor, could raise objection / obstruction, is not correct. In support of the said contention, he relied upon the following judgments:-\n[1] Nooruddin vs. Dr. K.L. Anand 1 (Para 8) [2] Shreenath and another vs. Rajesh and others2 (Para 10) [3] Brahmdeo Chaudhary vs. Rishikesh Prasad Jaiswal and another3 (Para 6) He submitted that provisions of the CPC themselves viz. Order 21 Rule 98(2) contemplate obstruction by a judgment debtor himself. He submitted that the impugned order in this matter 1 (1995) 1 SCC 242 2 4 SCC 543 3 (1997) 3 SCC 694 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 is an order having the same characteristics and passed under the said provisions viz Order 21 Rule 103 read with Order 21 Rules 97, 98, 99 and 101. He submitted that the impugned order is a decision having the force of a decree and is appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. In support of the said submission, he gave certain illustrations and thereafter relied on the judgment of the Apex Court in Transmission Corporation of A.P. vs. CH.\nPrabhakar and others1 ( Para 18) (E) Fifthly, he submitted that Section 13(1) also refers to \"judgment\" and an appeal from \"judgment\". He submitted that if the impugned order affects the vital and valuable rights of the Appellants, it has to be treated as a judgment under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act and it has a force of final judgment. In support of the said submissions, he relied on the following judgments:-\n[1] Radhy Shyam vs. Shyam Behari 1 (2004) 5 SCC 551 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Singh1 (Para 7) [2] Shah Babulal Khimji vs. Jayaben D. Kania and Anr.2 (Paras 112 and 113) (F) Sixthly, he submitted that for the purposes of execution of a decision, decree, order or judgment passed under the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, the provisions of the CPC as regards the execution are applicable. He submitted that the Commercial Courts Act does not contain any provisions for execution and only the CPC provisions for execution are applicable. \nHe relied on Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act amends certain provisions of the CPC in their application to proceedings in the Commercial Courts Act and the Commercial Court / Commercial Division has to follow these provisions of the CPC amended by the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that amendments to the CPC are found in Schedule to the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that, 1 AIR 1971 SC 2337 2 AIR 1981 SC 1786 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 however, there is no amendment in respect of Order XXI of the CPC. He submitted that all the amendments relate to proceedings upto the stage of judgment and not thereafter. He submitted that had the Parliament desired to amend Order XXI Rule 103 to exclude from the expression \"decree\", the order passed under Rule 103, it would have done so. He therefore submitted that for the purposes of the Commercial Courts Act any order passed under Order XXI Rule 103 continues to be a decree for the purpose of an appeal therefrom. \n(G) Seventhly, on the point of legal fiction, he submitted that where the statutory fiction is to be resorted to, full effect must be given to the statutory fiction and it should be carried to its logical conclusion. In support of the said submission, he relied upon the following judgments:-\n[1] State of Bombay vs. Pandurang Vinayak and others1 (Para 5) [2] American Home Products 1 AIR 1953 SC 244 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Corporation vs. Mac Laboratories Ltd and Anr.1 ( Paras 56, 57 and 66) APPELLANTS' RESPONSE TO THE RESPONDENT NOS. 1 TO 6'S CONTENTIONS: \nIn reply to the contention of the Respondents that in view of the judgment of this Court in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. vs. Subrata Roy Sahara and others2 the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants has made the following submissions:-\n(a) Firstly, he submitted that the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra) was passed when the Commercial Courts Act had not been enacted and had not come into orce.\n(b) Secondly, he submitted that the statutory provisions considered in the said judgment were totally different.\n(c) Thirdly, he submitted that Section 13 of the 1 AIR 1986 SC 137 2 2011 SCC OnLine Bom 1379 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Commercial Courts Act alone governs the right of appeal to the express exclusion of the CPC, Letters Patent and the Arbitration Act. \nAlternatively, he submitted that decision in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra) is not good law since it does not take into consideration judgments of the Apex Court in State of Bombay vs. Pandurang1 (Para 5), American Home Products Corporation vs. Mac Laboratories Ltd and Anr2 (Paras 56, 57, 66) and in East End Dwelling vs. Finsbury3 (Pages 132, 133). He submitted that since these judgments have not been considered, the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra) is not good law and should be ignored. \n(d) Fourthly, he submitted that the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra) requires reconsideration since it has overlooked the settled legal position that the statutory fiction contained in Section 36 of the Arbitration Act must be given full effect. It is contended that the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Ltd (supra) holding that execution 1 AIR 1953 SC 244 2 AIR 1986 SC 137 3 1952 A.C. 109 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 applications in respect of an Award are applications under the Arbitration Act and not under the CPC, is erroneous. He submitted that once an Award is passed, thereafter execution proceedings are under the CPC alone and not under the Arbitration Act. \n(e) Lastly, he submitted that the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra) was based upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Paramjeet Singh Patheja vs. ICDS Ltd.1. He submitted that the said judgment of the Apex Court in Patheja (supra) is misconstrued and misapplied in the the judgment of Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra). It is submitted that ratio in the judgment of Patheja (supra) was with reference to notice under Section 9(2) of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 (For short \"Insolvency Act\") and it was observed that on the basis of an Award, notice under Section 9(2) of the Insolvency Act could not be issued since it was not a decree. It is submitted that in paras 42 and 43 of the judgment in Patheja (supra), the Supreme Court has expressly observed that an Award is a \"decree\" for execution purposes. It is therefore 1 (2006) 13 SCC 322 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 submitted that the conclusion arrived at in the case of Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra) is contrary to the decision in Patheja (supra) Submissions of the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Milind Sathe for the Appellant in COMAPL/6/2016 15] Mr Milind Sathe, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant firstly submitted that the notice was taken out under the provisions of Order XXI Rule 22 of the CPC and this was resisted by the Appellant herein by raising objections which are in the nature of objections under Order XXI Rule 97 of the CPC. He submitted that the order impugned in the appeal is passed on an application which is in the nature of the order contemplated under Rule 101 of Order XXI. He therefore submitted that the order is to be treated as decree under Rule 103 of Order XXI. He submitted that the order impugned in appeal therefore qualifies as \"decree\" under section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. He then invited our attention to Section 13 of the said Act. While interpreting Section 13, he submitted that the Section could not be read to mean that only judgment or order is appealable. He submitted that such an interpretation would lead to a result that, then decree is not provided as being appealable in Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, which would give rise to a situation that an interlocutory order is appealable but an order which is in the form of a decree is not appealable. He submitted that the COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 interpretation of Section 13 and the legislative intent to provide appeal against any \"decision\" of Commercial Division can also be gathered from the draft of \"Commercial Court Bill\" introduced in Parliament. He submitted that the Bill had used the words \"only against\" and \"against no other orders\" and these words are not incorporated in Section 13 of the Act. He therefore submitted that the legislative intent was to provide appeal against all decisions. He submitted that so far as proceedings under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act are concerned, they must be treated as proceedings under Section 47 and Order XXI of the CPC. In support of the said submission, he pointed out firstly that Section 36 expressly provides that the \"Award\" shall be executable \"as if it were a decree\" under the provision of the CPC. Secondly, he submitted that various provisions in Order XXI of CPC contemplate adjudication of right, title and interest of various parties such as in Order XXI Rule 58 and Order XXI Rules 97 to 103 of the CPC. He submitted that these decisions are treated \"as if it were a decree of a Civil Court\". He submitted that since the expression in Section 36 of the Arbitration Act \"as if it were a decree of a Civil Court\" is sought to be argued as not construing as a decree then the provisions of Order XXI Rule 58 as well as Order XXI Rule 103 would be rendered nugatory. He therefore submitted that proceedings under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act must be construed as proceedings under the CPC. He submitted that the Judgment in Jet Airways (India) Limited (supra) has not taken into consideration these issues and COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 therefore is required to be referred to the larger Bench for reconsideration. Lastly, he submitted that the exclusion of applicability of the provisions of the CPC under Section 19 of Arbitration Act is limited to \"arbitral proceeding\" and not to execution of the Award. \nSubmissions of the learned Counsel Mr. Zal Andhyarujina for the Appellant in COMAP/4/2016. \n16] Mr Zal Andhyarujina, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Commercial Courts Act is a specific Act dealing with a specific types of disputes and the object of the Act was to provide an independent mechanism for early resolution of the disputes. He submitted that the plain language of Section 13(1) indicates that \"the decision\" would include a \"judgment and order\". He submitted that the plain language thus is plenary and wide in nature. He submitted that the term \"decision\" has been judicially interpreted. He relied on the judgment in Balanand & Anr. vs. Devkinand & Ors.1(Paras 5 and 6) and also in Ratan & Co vs. Asst. Registrar of Trademarks2 (Para 24). He submitted that the proviso to Section 13(1) is an enabling statutory provision. He submitted that this is also evident from the express exclusionary language of Section 13(2) which provides that \"notwithstanding any other law in force\", no other appeals shall lie. He submitted that the contrast in the language between the proviso to Section 13(1) and Section 13(2) 1 AIR 1963 HP 30 2 AIR 1977 Delhi 93 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 makes it evident that the former is enabling and the latter is disabling/exclusionary. He then submitted so far as the appeals under Section 37(1) of the Arbitration Act are concerned, the Arbitration Act provides that the appeal shall lie from such orders, to the Court authorized by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the orders. He submitted that the effect of Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act on such orders is to make all appeals from those orders to lie before the Commercial Appellate Division. He submitted that under Section 37, appeals could be filed from orders of the Court under Section 9 and 34 which was provided in Section 37(1) and also orders of the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 16 and 17 as specified under Section 37(2). He submitted that under the Arbitration Act, appeals under Section 37(1) would go to Division Bench/Appeal Court and the appeals under Section 37(2) would be heard by the Single Judge. He submitted that however proviso to Section 13 specifically enables an appeal to lie from orders passed by the Commercial Division under Section 37 of the said Act to the Commercial Appellate Division. He submitted that such an appeal is in the nature of second appeal and provides for an appeal where no such appeal previously existed. He submitted that the Commercial Courts Act, being a more specific and later central statute, would override the Arbitration Act which was an older and general statute to the extent of inconsistency and repugnancy. He submitted that the present appeal is maintainable under Section 13(1) of the said Act and the proviso COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 has no application to the facts of the present case. Lastly, he submitted that enforcement of an Award is done in the same manner as if it is a decree of the Court and therefore all provisions applicable to the enforcement under the CPC including appeals which are otherwise available would be available to the parties. He relied on the judgment in SBP & Co. vs. Patel Engineering Ltd.1 (Para 18) and also in Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. & Ors. vs. Vindhya Teleinks Ltd. & Ors 2. He submitted that the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Limited (supra) requires reconsideration. \nREPLY OF MR MADON, THE LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL FOR RESPONDENTS TO THE SUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL MR. SATHE & MR ZAL ANDHYARUJINA, COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANT. \n17] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents has also given in detail his reply as to how the arguments made by the Appellants' Counsel are not tenable. While dealing with the submissions made by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Milind Sathe, he submitted that the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Limited (supra) does not require any reconsideration. He submitted that the legal fiction which is created in Section 36 is for limited purpose and this fiction could not be expanded further. So far as the submission that certain words such as \"and from no other orders\"\nwhich were present in the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division 1 (2005) 8 SCC 618 2 AIR 2009 SCC 3284 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015 were omitted from this Act, is concerned, he submitted that this submission is incorrect since in the main Act, these words are incorporated which read as follows:-\n\"....no appeal shall lie from any order or decree...\" \nIn reply to the submission of the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Sathe that Section 37 of the Arbitration Act and Order XLIII of the CPC only provide for appeals from orders that have not attained finality, he submitted that Section 37(1)(c ) & Section 37(2)(a) of the Arbitration Act provide for appeals from orders that finally dispose of arbitration proceedings. \n18] Referring to the submission of the learned Counsel Mr. Andhyarujina, Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel for the Respondents submitted that such argument is fallacious and based on misreading of the proviso to Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that Mr. Andhyarujina wanted to read the words into proviso as if they they were \"an appeal shall lie from all orders covered under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996\" when, in fact, the proviso clearly mentions that appeal would lie from all such orders that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the CPC and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. He submitted that if submission of Mr. Andhyarujina was to be accepted, COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 provision of Section 37(3) of the Arbitration Act would be rendered otiose. He submitted that the judgments on which reliance has been placed by Counsel Mr. Andhyarujina have no application to the facts of the present case. \nFINDINGS:\n19] After having heard all the Counsels appearing on behalf of Appellants and Respondents and having examined their written submissions, following questions in our view fall for consideration before this Court:-\nQUESTIONS [1] Whether, in an application for execution of an Award passed under the Arbitration Act, 1996, an order passed by the learned Single Judge is appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act as if it is a decree?\n[2] Whether the word \"decision\" means a decree?\n[3] Whether a decision in the form of an order is appealable only under the conditions COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 given in proviso to section 13(1) viz. that the order/decision is appealable only on the grounds mentioned in Section 37 or Section 104 or Order XLIII of the CPC [4] Whether the word \"decision\" which is found in Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act includes a \"decree\" or an \"order\"\nwhich has the effect of having finality or final adjudication of rights of parties? \n[5] Whether, the heading to Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act governs Section 13(1) i.e. whether the word \"decision\" is to be taken as a \"decree\" on account of the heading of the Section?\n[6] Whether ratio of the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra) is applicable to the facts of the present case and is a binding precedent with reference to the facts arising in the present case? \n[7] Whether ratio of the judgment in the COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 case of Paramjeet Singh Patheja (supra) which has been relied upon in the case of Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra) is applicable to the facts of the present case? \n20] In order to appreciate the aforesaid questions which have been raised in these appeals, it is necessary to briefly consider the purpose for which this Act has been passed and also the Scheme of the Act. \n21] The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 was passed by the Parliament on 31/12/2015 and it received the assent of the President on 31/12/2015 and was published in the Gazette of Government of India on 01/01/2016. The Preamble to the Act reads as under:-\n\"An Act to provide for the Constitution of Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts for adjudicating commercial disputes of specified value and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\" \nThe Statement of Objects and Reasons mentions that the Government had proposed to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes and therefore it wanted to constitute an independent mechanism for their early resolution. Clause 6 of the said Statement of Objects and Reasons reads as under:-\nCOMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 \"6. It is proposed to introduce the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015 to replace the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Ordinance, 2015 which inter alia, provides for the following namely :-\n(i) constitution of the Commercial Courts at District level except for the territory over which any High Court is having ordinary original civil jurisdiction;\n(ii) constitution of the Commercial Divisions in those High Courts which are already exercising ordinary civil jurisdiction and they shall have territorial jurisdiction over such areas on which it has original jurisdiction;\n(iii) constitution of the Commercial Appellate Division in all the High Courts to hear the appeals against the Orders of the Commercial Courts and the Orders of the Commercial Division of the High Court;\n(iv) the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of such Commercial Courts and Commercial Division is proposed as one crore rupees; and (v) to amend the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as applicable to the Commercial Courts and Commercial COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Divisions which shall prevail over the existing High Courts Rules and other provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases.\"\nThe Preamble to the Act and the Objects and Reasons disclose the intention of the Parliament that it wanted to provide a separate mechanism for the purpose of speedy disposal of commercial disputes.\n22] \"Commercial dispute\" has been defined under section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act. The definition reveals that all disputes which are commercial in nature are included in the said definition. Constitution of Commercial Courts is provided in Section 3 and it envisages constitution of number of Commercial Courts at District level and in the High Court which has ordinary original civil jurisdiction. It provides for constitution of Commercial Division of the High Court which is presided over by a Single Judge and constitution of Commercial Appellate Division which is presided over by Division Bench. So far as Bombay High Court is concerned, it has ordinary original civil jurisdiction and, as such, the suits and proceedings of commercial nature are to be first heard by the Single Judge and the appeal is provided to the Division Bench under Section 3. \n23] Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act speaks about jurisdiction COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 of Commercial Divisions of High Courts and mentions that all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes would be heard and decided by Commercial Division i.e. by a Single Judge of the High Court. Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act speaks about jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters. Clause (1) of Section 10 mentions the arbitration arising out of international commercial arbitration and clause (2) speaks about arbitration other than international commercial arbitration. \n24] Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act speaks about appeals which arise out of the matters decided by the Commercial Division in civil suits etc and also appeals out of arbitration proceedings presided over by the Commercial Division i.e. Single Judge. It is evident therefore that no separate provisions have been made for differentiating between civil suits and arbitration proceedings. Section 13 combines appeals which are filed in suits and in arbitration proceedings. Section 13 reads as under:-\n\"13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions.- (1) Any person aggrieved by the Decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order, as the case may be:\nProvided that an appeal shall lie from COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996).\n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\"\n25] It will also be relevant to look at some of the other provisions viz. Sections 8, 16 and 21 of the Commercial Courts Act. Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act reads as under:-\n\"8. Bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order.- Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force , no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the Commercial Court. \nPerusal of the said sections indicate that a bar has been imposed against civil revision application or petition against interlocutory order COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 and it specifies that no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the Commercial Court.\nSection 16 of the Commercial Courts Act reads as under:-\n\"16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes.- (1) The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule.\n(2) The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of Specified Value.\n(3) Where any provision of any rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail.\" \nPerusal of the said Section indicates that the provisions of the COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Code of Civil Procedure will apply to the extent, as amended in the Schedule. Perusal of the Schedule indicates that provisions of Order XXI in so far as they relate to execution have not been amended. The said provisions therefore will clearly apply in respect of execution proceedings taken out in civil matters. \nSection 21 of the Commercial Courts Act reads as under:-\n\"21. Act to have overriding effect.- Save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than this Act.\"\nIn Section 21 , it is provided that the Act shall have effect over any other laws which are for the time being in force other than this Act. \n26] So far as the enforcement of Awards is concerned, under the Arbitration Act, Section 36 lays down the manner in which the Award can be enforced. Section 36 of the Arbitration Act reads as under:-\n\"36. Enforcement.- (1) Where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under section 34 has expired, then, subject to the provisions of sub- section (2), such award shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the Code COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), in the same manner as if it were a decree of the Court. \n(2) Where an application to set aside the arbitral award has been filed in the Court under section 34, the filing of such an application shall not only by itself render that award unenforceable, unless the Court grants an order of stay of the operation of the said arbitral award in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3), on a separate application made for that purpose. \n(3) Upon filing of an application under sub-section (2) for stay of the operation of the arbitral award, the Court may, subject to such conditions as it may deem fit, grant stay of the operation of such award for reasons to be recorded in writing:\nProvided that the Court shall, while considering the application for grant of stay in the case of an arbitral award for payment of money, have due regard to the provisions for grant of stay of a money decree under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).\" [Emphasis supplied] 27] It is therefore apparent that for the purpose of enforcement, no separate provisions are to be found in the Arbitration Act and for that purpose, the provisions of Civil Procedure Code 1908 have to be followed as if the Award was a decree of the Court. \nCOMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 28] Upon conjoint reading of the Commercial Courts Act and the Arbitration Act, it is apparent that provisions of the Civil Procedure Code in so far as they are not amended by the Commercial Courts Act, will apply and more particularly they would apply for the enforcement of the Award as if it was a decree of the Court. Legal fiction therefore is created by the Statute and the Award has to be enforced by following the provisions of the CPC relating to execution of decrees. \n29] The last Section under the Arbitration Act which is relevant is Section 37. This Section speaks about appealable orders. It reads as under:-\n\"37. Appealable orders.- (1) An appeal shall lie from the following orders (and from no others) to the Court authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the order, namely:-\n(a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8;\n(b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9;\n(c ) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34.\n(2) An appeal shall also lie to a Court from an order of the arbitral tribunal- (a) accepting the plea referred to in sub- COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 section (2) or sub-section (3) of section 16; or (b) granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under section 17.\n( 3) No second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or take away any right to appeal to the Supreme Court.\" \nSection 37, therefore, lays down the orders against which appeals can be filed. It is relevant to notice here that no appeal has been provided against an order passed in execution proceedings. This will have to be kept in mind while interpreting the word \"decision\" which is found in Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. \n30] In our view, since there is no separate provision of appeal against execution of an Award passed in arbitration proceedings, the word \"decision\" will have to be interpreted accordingly. \n31] Before we consider the rival contentions, it will be necessary to briefly reiterate the law of precedent:\nThe Apex Court in Bank of India and Anr. v. K. Mohandas (2009) 5 SCC 313 observed as follows: (SCC pp. 335-36 paras 54-59) \"54. A word about precedents, before we deal with the aforesaid observations. The classic statement of Earl of COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Halsbury, L.C. in Quinn v. Leathem [1901 AC 495 (HL)], is worth recapitulating first: (AC p. 506) '...before discussing ... Allen v. Flood [1898 AC 1 :\n(1895-99) ALL ER Rep 52 (HL)and what was decided therein, there are two observations of a general character which I wish to make, and one is to repeat what I have very often said before, that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but are governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it. Such a mode of reasoning assumes that the law is necessarily a logical code, whereas every lawyer must acknowledge that the law is not always logical at all.' This Court has in long line of cases followed the aforesaid statement of law. \n55. In State of Orissa v. Sudhansu Sekhar Misra [AIR 1968 SC 647] it was observed: (AIR p. 651, para 13) \"13. ...A decision is only an authority for what it actually decides. What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every observation found therein nor what logically follows from the various observations made in it.\"\n56. In the words of Lord Denning:\nCOMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 \"Each case depends on its own facts and a close similarity between one case and another is not enough because even a single significant detail may alter the entire aspect. In deciding such cases, one should avoid the temptation to decide cases (as said by Cardozo) by matching the colour of one case against the colour of another. To decide, therefore, on which side of the line a case falls, the broad resemblance to another case is not at all decisive.\" \n57. It was highlighted by this Court in Ambica Quarry Works v. State of Gujarat: [(1987) 1 SCC 213] (SCC p. 221, para 18) \"18. ... The ratio of any decision must be understood in the background of the facts of that case. It has been said long time ago that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides, and not what logically follows from it.\"\n58. In Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd. [(2003) 2 SCC 111] this Court held that a little difference in facts or additional facts may make a lot of difference in the precedential value of a decision. \n59. This Court in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. N.R. Vairamani [(2004) 8 SCC 579] emphasised that the courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed. It was further observed that the judgments of courts are not to be construed as statutes and the observations must be read in the context in which they appear to have been stated. The Court went on to say that circumstantial applicability, one additional or different fact may make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases.\" (emphasis in original) COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 The Apex Court in Arasmeta Captive Power Company Pvt. Ltd. vs. Lafarge India Pvt. Ltd and another1, has observed on the question of law of precedent in paras 28, 31, 32, 33 35 and 36 as under:-\n\"28. At this juncture, we think it condign to refer to certain authorities which lay down the principle for understanding the ratio decidendi of a judgment. Such a deliberation, we are disposed to think, is necessary as we notice that contentions are raised that certain observations in some paragraphs in SPB & Company (supra) have been relied upon to build the edifice that latter judgments have not referred to them.\" \n\"31. In Krishena Kumar v. Union of India and Ors. (1990) 4 SCC 207, the Constitution Bench, while dealing with the concept of ratio decidendi, has referred to Caledonian Railway Co. v. Walker's Trustees [(1882) 7 App Cas 259: 46 LT 826 (HL)] and Quinn (supra) and the observations made by Sir Frederick Pollock and thereafter proceeded to state as follows:\n\"The ratio decidendi is the underlying principle, namely, the general reasons or the general grounds upon which the decision is based on the test or abstract from the specific peculiarities of the particular case which gives rise to the decision. The ratio decidendi has to be ascertained by an analysis of the facts of the case and the process of reasoning involving 1 AIR 2014 SC 525 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 the major premise consisting of a pre- existing rule of law, either statutory or judge-made, and a minor premise consisting of the material facts of the case under immediate consideration. If it is not clear, it is not the duty of the court to spell it out with difficulty in order to be bound by it. In the words of Halsbury (4th edn., Vol. 26, para 573)\"\n\"The concrete decision alone is binding between the parties to it but it is the abstract ratio decidendi, as ascertained on a consideration of the judgment in relation to the subject matter of the decision, which alone has the force of law and which when it is clear it is not part of a tribunal's duty to spell out with difficulty a ratio decidendi in order to bound by it, and it is always dangerous to take one or two observations out of a long judgment and treat them as if they gave the ratio decidendi of the case. If more reasons than one are given by a tribunal for its judgment, all are taken as forming the ratio decidendi. \"\n(Emphasis added) \"32. In State of Orissa v. Mohd. Illiyas (2006) 1 SCC 275, it has been stated thus:\n\"12... According to the well-settled theory of precedents, every decision contains three basic postulates: (i) findings of material facts, direct and inferential. An inferential finding of facts is the inference which the COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Judge draws from the direct, or perceptible facts; (ii) statements of the principles of law applicable to the legal problems disclosed by the facts; and (iii) judgment based on the combined effect of the above. A decision is an authority for what it actually decides. What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every observation found therein nor what logically flows from the various observations made in the judgment.\" \n\"33. In Islamic Academy of Education v.\nState of Karnataka (2003) 6 SCC 697, the Court has made the following observations:\n\"2... The ratio decidendi of a judgment has to be found out only on reading the entire judgment. In fact, the ratio of the judgment is what is set out in the judgment itself. The answer to the question would necessarily have to be read in the context of what is set out in the judgment and not in isolation. In case of any doubt as regards any observations, reasons and principles, the other part of the judgment has to be looked into. By reading a line here and there from the judgment, one cannot find out the entire ratio decidendi of the judgment.\" \n(Underlining is by us) \"35. At this stage, we may also profitably refer to another principle which is of assistance to understand and appreciate the ratio decidendi of a judgment. The judgments rendered by a court are not to be read as statutes. In Union of India v. Amrit Lal Manchanda and Anr. (2004) 3 SCC COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 75, it has been stated that observations of courts are neither to be read as Euclid's theorems nor as provisions of the statute and that too taken out of their context. The observations must be red in the context in which they appear to have been stated. To interpret words, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may become necessary for judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they do not interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; their words are not to be interpreted as statutes.\" \n\"36. In Som Mittal v. Government of Karnataka (2008) 3 SCC 574, it has been observed that judgments are not to be construed as statutes. Nor words or phrases in judgments to be interpreted like provisions of a statute. Some words used in a judgment should be read and understood contextually and are not intended to be taken literally. Many a time a judge uses a phrase or expression with the intention of emphasizing a point or accentuating a principle or even by way of a flourish of writing style. Ratio decidendi of a judgment is not to be discerned from a stray word or phrase read in isolation.\" \nThe Apex Court in Zee Telefilms Ltd. and another vs. Union of India and others1 has observed in paras 254, 255 & 256 as under:-\n1 (2005) 4 SCC 649 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 \"Precedent 254. Are we bound hands and feet by Pradeep Kumar Biswas (2002) 5 SCC 111? The answer to the question must be found in the law of precedent. A decision, it is trite, should not be read as a statute. A decision is an authority for the questions of law determined by it. Such a question is determined having regard to the fact situation obtaining therein. \nWhile applying the ratio, the court may not pick out a word or a sentence from the judgment divorced from the context in which the said question arose for consideration. A judgment, as is well known, must be read in its entirety and the observations made therein should receive consideration in the light of the questions raised before it. (See Punjab National Bank v. R.L. Vaid (2004) 7 SCC 698). \n255 . Although decisions are galore on this point, we may refer to a recent one in State of Gujarat v. Akhil Gujarat Pravasi V.S. Mahamandal (2004) 5 SCC 155 wherein this Court held : (SCC p. 172, para 19) \"It is trite that any observation made during the course of reasoning in a judgment should not be read divorced from the context in which it was used.\"\n256. It is further well settled that a decision is not an authority for a proposition which did not fall for its consideration. It is also a trite law that a point not raised before a court would not be an authority on the said question. In A- One Granites v. State of U.P. (2001) 3 SCC 537 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 it is stated as follows : (SCC p. 543, para 11) \"11. This question was considered by the Court of Appeal in Lancaster Motor Co.\n(London) Ltd. v. Bremith Ltd. (1941) 1 KB 675 and it was laid down that when non consideration was given to the question, the decision cannot be said to be binding and precedents sub silentio and without arguments are of no moment\"\n[See also State of U.P. v. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. (1991) 4 SCC 139, Arnit Das v. State of Bihar (2000) 5 SCC 488 (SCC para 20), Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mills (P) Ltd. (2003) 2 SCC 111, Cement Corpn. of India Ltd. v. Purya (2004) 8 SCC 270, Bharat Forge Co. Ltd. v. Uttam Manohar Nakate (2005) 2 SCC 489 and Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan (2005) 2 SCC 42, See para 42.]\" \nThe view of the Apex Court on the law of precedents has to be kept in mind while dealing with the judgments relied upon by all the parties. \n32] We have now to consider the scope and ambit of an appeal which can be filed under Section 13(1) out of the orders which are passed in execution proceedings of an Award. \n33] In this context, provisions of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act will have to be interpreted. Perusal of the said Section indicates that it can be divided in four parts viz heading, which speaks COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 about decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions. The heading is followed by sub-section (1), which speaks about an appeal from the date of judgment or order and it also lays down limitation viz 60 days from the date of the said judgment and order. The third part is the proviso. The proviso provides for an appeal from orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court and the said appeal is restricted to appeals which are enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as amended by this Act and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The fourth part is sub- section (2) which starts with non-obstante clause and clarifies that no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act. If we dissect these four parts, it can be noticed that appeals are provided under sub-section (1) against any decision. In our view, since sub-section (1) has combined the right of appeal against decree or order, the word \"decision\" has been used and the proviso provides for orders which are appealable. The contention of Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants, that the word \"decision\" also includes such orders, which have attained finality cannot be accepted. This can be gathered from the Scheme of the Commercial Courts Act and the Objects and Reasons. The Act was passed for the purpose of speedy disposal of commercial disputes and to improve efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. \nCOMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 34] The proviso to sub-section (1) therefore cannot be said to be an additional enactment provided for appeal against the orders but it restricts the orders against which appeals can be filed. In the present case, Section 37 of the Arbitration Act has restricted the orders against which appeals can be filed. If interpretation which is sought to be given by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Tulzapurkar appearing for the Appellants, is to be accepted then it would not only be contrary to Section 37 but would also be contrary to the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. It is a well settled principle of interpretation that while interpreting a particular provision, it is not open for the Court to add or subtract anything from the said provision. It is therefore not possible to read something more in the word \"decision\" to mean that it also includes orders which are not otherwise appealable. Sub-section (2) of section 2 of the Commercial Courts Act enumerates that the words and expressions used and not defined in this Act but defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and the Evidence Act 1872, shall have the same meaning assigned to them in that Code and the Act. The word \"judgment\" is defined in Section 2(9) of the CPC. Therefore, the said restricted meaning has to be assigned to the word \"judgment\" found in sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act and it will not be possible to expand the meaning of the word \"judgment\" as has been done in the Letters Patent by virtue of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Shah COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Babulal Khimji1(supra) [paras 112, 1113]. The submission of Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellants that the expanded meaning has to be given to the word \"judgment\" or \"decision\" therefore cannot be accepted. \n35] In the context of the facts of the present case, it has to be noted that the Award passed by the arbitral tribunal was confirmed right up to the Supreme Court and the matter was at the stage of execution. The orders which are passed in execution proceedings are appealable to the extent provided under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. An order passed on application under Order XXI Rule 103 is not appealable under the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act arising out of execution of an award. \n36] Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants in COMAPL/5/2016, Mr. Milind Sathe, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant in COMAPL/6/2016 and Mr. Zal Andhyarujina, the learned Counsel appearing for the Appellants in COMAP/4/2016 also laid emphasis on the words \"as if it were a decree\" which are found at various places in the CPC and particularly in Order XXI. It has been contended that the present application has been filed under Order XXI Rules 98, 99, 100 and 101 and therefore as per the provisions of Section 103, the order passed is appealable as a decree. Number of judgments also have been cited by Mr. Tulzapurkar the learned Senior 1 1981 SC 1786 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Counsel appearing for the Appellants that where legal fiction is created, it must be taken to its logical conclusion. He submitted that since the provisions of Order XXI are applicable to Commercial Courts Act wherever words \"as if it were a decree\" are used in the CPC, it becomes an appealable decree. In our view, though the said argument appears to be very attractive at the first blush, on closer scrutiny, it reveals that the said submission is without any substance. For that purpose, it will be necessary to see Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act which gives overriding effect to the provisions of the said Act. Therefore as long as this Act does not provide for an appeal against such orders, these orders are not appealable. \nSecondly, it has to be seen that following reliefs were sought in Notice No.1786 of 2015 taken out by the Appellant in Execution Application No.2006 of 2015 in Arbitration Award dated 4/8/2008. \n\"The mode in which the assistance of the Court required:\n(1) By issuing Notice under Order XXI Rule 22 of CPC, 1908, against the Respondents to show cause, why the award dated 4th August, 2008 should not be executed against them;\n(2) After the said notice is made absolute by this Hon'ble Court, this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to issue a Warrant of Possession under Order XXI, Rule 35, against the COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Respondent No.10 to 16 in the arbitral proceedings in respect of the immovable property i.e. Kamla Cottage, situated at Juhu Tara Road, Juhu, Mumbai - 400049. \n(3) After the said notice is made absolute by this Hon'ble Court, this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to issue a Warrant of Possession under Order XXI, Rule 35, against the Kanpur Group (Respondent Nos. 1 to 9) in the arbitral proceedings) in respect of the following immoveable properties:\n(i) Property at 37, Kanpur known as Kamla Retreat valued at Rs. 9.62 crores.\n(ii) Property at 80/80 Kanpur known as Oil Mills land valued at Rs 7.90 crores and Rs 0.30 crores.\n(iii) Property at 20/131, Patkapur, Kanpur valued at Rs 0.33 crores.\n(4) With regard to the properties / assets of the Respondent Nos. 10 to 16 which are within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court, this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to grant liberty to the Petitioner to seek warrants of attachment and sale, accordingly; \n(5) In the alternative and/or in addition to the aforesaid, this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to issue a certificate of non- satisfaction of the Award, and to transfer the Award under Section 39 of the Code of Civil Procedure read with rules 5 and 6 of Order COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 21 CPC and also read with Section 151 of the CPC for execution to the Court within whose jurisdiction the Respondents' assets are situated.\" \nAppellants are admittedly parties to the Award which has become final. It is not now open for the Appellants to raise their obstruction and again challenge the execution of the Award. \n37] The contention of Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants, and others that provisions of Order XXI Rule 103 will apply is also without any merit. It is clarified however that, in the present case, since execution proceedings are in the nature of enforcement of an Award to which the appellants are parties, they now cannot contend that wherever the words \"as if it were a decree\"\nare used in Order XXI, the same is a decree and not an order. All the judgments on which reliance has been placed by Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants and others therefore will have no application to the facts of the present case. \n38] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents has in support of his submissions relied on the Judgment of the Apex Court in Jet Airways (India) Limited.1 (supra). Division Bench of this Court in para 15 of the said judgment 1 2011 SC OnLine Bom 1379 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 formulated three issues. Para 15 of the said judgment reads as under:-\n\"A. Whether the proceedings under section 36 of the 1996 Act are proceedings under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908?\nB. Whether the provisions of clause 15 of the Letters Patent are applicable to the impugned Judgment and Order and whether applicability of clause 15 has been impliedly excluded by section 37 of the 1996 Act or by the amendment of section 2(2), 47 by Act 104 of 1976 amending the Code? \nC. Whether the Judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Fuerst Day Lawson (supra) is an authority which is applicable only in respect of a foreign award covered by Part II of the 1996 Act or whether the ratio of the said Judgment is a binding precedent even in respect of proceedings under part I of the 1996 Act or the same is obiter dicta?\" \nBrief facts in the said case are that both the appeals were filed, challenging the judgment and order dated 04/05/2011 passed by the learned Single Judge in Execution Application No.161 of 2009 with Chamber Summons Nos. 551/09, 729/09, 603/10 & 477/11 and Notice No.734 of 2009 in Arbitration Award dated 12/04/2007. It is COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 not necessary to further go into the facts of the said case. It is sufficient to point out that the appeals were arising out of the order passed in execution proceedings of Award dated 12/04/2007. \nWhile considering the question-A viz. \"Whether the proceedings under section 36 of the 1996 Act are proceedings under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908?\", after taking into consideration various provisions of the Act and relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Paramjeet Singh Patheja1 (supra), Division Bench of this Court came to the conclusion that the proceedings initiated by the Appellants and the Respondents before the learned Single Judge were the proceedings under Section 36 of the 1996 Act and could not be held to be the proceedings of execution under Section 47 or Order XXI of the CPC. While coming to the said conclusion, the words used in Section 36 of the said Act viz. \"the award shall be enforced under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) in the same manner as if it were a Decree of a Court\" were interpreted and reliance was placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Paramjeet Singh Patheja2 (supra) and relying on the observations made in the said judgment and upon independent consideration of provisions of 1940 Act and 1996 Act, Division Bench came to the conclusion that proceedings under section 36 are not the proceedings under the Code of Civil Procedure. It further observed that the Letters Patent Appeal would 1 (2006) 13 SCC 322 2 (2006) 13 SCC 322 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 not be maintainable in respect of orders passed under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. \nOn the second issue regarding implied exclusion of applicability of Letters Patent, Division Bench, after relying on judgment in (a) Union of India vs. Mohindra Supply Company 1, (b) State of West Bengal vs. Gauranglal Chatterjee2, (c) ITI Ltd. vs. Siemens Public Communications Network Ltd.3 (d) Union of India vs. Popular Construction Company4, (e) Union of India vs. Aradhana Trading Co. 5 (f) Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay vs. Patel Engineering Company Limited,6 had held that Clause 15 of the Letters Patent was impliedly excluded by 1996 Act. While dealing with the issue of implied exclusion by the Code of Civil Procedure, after taking into consideration various judgments of the Apex Court and this Court, Division Bench held that the proceedings under Section 36 of 1996 Act are not the proceedings under the Code and therefore the second issue had become academic. \nLastly, the Division Bench considered the ratio of the Judgment in Furest Day Lawson vs. Jindal Exports Limited 7. In the said case, the question which fell for consideration before the Apex Court was 1 1961 SCR 497 = AIR 1962 SC 256 2 (1993) 3 SCC 1 3 (2002) 5 SCC 510 4 (2001) 8 SCC 470 5 (2002) 4 SCC 447 6 1994 (3) Bom. C.R. 139 7 (2011) 8 SCC 333 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 regarding maintainability of the Letters Patent under Clause 15 of the Calcutta High Court which is in pari materia with that of the Bombay High Court. In the said case, question before the Supreme Court was, whether an order, though not appealable under Section 50 of 1996 Act, would nevertheless be subject to appeal under the relevant provisions of the Letters Patent of the High Court. Section 50 deals with part II of the Arbitration Act viz execution and enforcement of the international award. The Apex Court in the said case came to the conclusion that there was an exclusion of Letters Patent Appeal. Division Bench relied on the conclusion drawn by the Apex Court in Furest Day Lawson1 (supra). \n39] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the the Respondents further relied on the judgment of the Apex Court in Paramjeet Singh Patheja2 (supra). In the said case, brief facts were that the Appellant was a judgment-debtor and an award was passed against him on 26/06/2000 by the Arbitrator. On 16/01/2002, an insolvency notice was issued under Section 9(2) of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 on the basis of the arbitration award. Section 9(2) provides that a debtor commits an act of insolvency if a creditor who has obtained a \"decree or order\" against him for the payment of money issues him a notice in the prescribed form to pay the amount and the debtor fails to do so within the time specified in 1 (2011) 8 SCC 333 2 (2006) 13 SCC 322 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 the notice. The Appellant filed Notice of Motion in the High Court challenging the said notice inter alia on the ground that the Award is neither a decree nor an order for the purposes of provisions of the Insolvency Act and that no notice could be issued under Section 9(2) on the basis of the Award. Division Bench of the Bombay High Court held that the Award is a decree for the purposes of Section 9 of the Insolvency Act and that insolvency notice may therefore be issued on the basis of the Award passed by the Arbitrator. Against the said Order, appeal was filed in the Supreme Court. In this context the Supreme Court framed the following questions of law in para 12 of its judgment in Paramjeet Singh Patheja1 (supra), which reads as under:-\n\"12. The substantial questions of law of paramount importance to be decided by this Court are :\n(i) Whether an arbitration award is a \"decree\" for the purpose of Section 9 of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909?\n(ii) Whether an insolvency notice can be issued under Section 9(2) of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 on the basis of an arbitration award?\"\nThe Apex Court, after examining the provisions of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909, Arbitration Act, 1899 and the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 and various judgments firstly came to the 1 (2006) 13 SCC 322 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 conclusion that the Award passed under the Arbitration Act was not a decree and, secondly, it held that the insolvency notice could not be issued under Section 9(2) of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 on the basis of arbitration award.\n40] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel, relying on the aforesaid judgment therefore submitted that it is a settled position in law that proceedings under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act are not the proceedings under the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 and, secondly, that the provisions of Letters Patent are not applicable and, thirdly, that Commercial Courts Act expressly excluded applicability of Letters Patent Act under sub-section (2) of Section 13. This submission was sought to be repelled by the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants with others on various grounds which are already reproduced hereinabove. However, in brief, their objections were that (a) firstly, the said judgment has been passed prior to coming into force of the Commercial Courts Act, (b) secondly, the said judgment does not consider whether for the purpose of execution of award provisions of CPC are applicable, (c) thirdly, the words which are used in section 36 viz \"as if it were a decree of the Court\" created a legal fiction and it has to be taken to its logical conclusion and (d) lastly, the judgment relied in the case of Paramjeet Singh Patheja1 (supra), the Apex Court has held that an award is not a decree in the context of issuance of notice under Section 9(2) of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1 (2006) 13 SCC 322 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 1909. \n41] Division Bench of this Court in Jet Airways (India) Limited.1 (supra), after relying on the judgment of Paramjeet Singh Patheja2 (supra), in our view, correctly held that the provisions of Civil Procedure Code, 1908 and the Letters Patent have been impliedly excluded by virtue of Sections 36 and 37 of the Arbitration Act. While doing so, it has examined the said issue from all angles. Though it is true that one of the issues which fell for consideration before the Apex Court in Patheja's case was, whether an award is a decree within the meaning of Section 9(2) of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 and it held that the Award is not a decree. It also considered the meaning which is to be attributed to the words \"as if\" and held that the legal fiction must be limited for the purpose for which it is created and therefore the observation made by the Apex Court in the said judgment also will have to be taken into consideration and more particularly, the observation made in paras 42 and 43 would be relevant which read as under:-\n\"42 The words \"as if\" demonstrate that award and decree or order are two different things. The legal fiction created is for the limited purpose of enforcement as a decree. The fiction is not intended to make it a decree for all purposes under all 1 2011 SC OnLine Bom 1379 2 (2006) 13 SCC 322 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 statutes, whether State or Central.\"\n\"43 For the foregoing discussion we hold :\n(i) ........\n(ii).........\n(iii)........\n(iv).........\n(v) A legal fiction ought not to be extended beyond its legitimate field. As such, an award rendered under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 cannot be construed to be a \"decree\" for the purpose of Section 9(2) of the Insolvency Act. \n(vi)\n(vii) It is a well established rule that a provision must be construed in a manner which would give effect to its purpose and to cure the mischief in the light of which it was enacted. The object of Section 22, in protecting guarantors from legal proceedings pending a reference to BIFR of the principal debtor, is to ensure that a scheme for rehabilitation would not be defeated by isolated proceedings adopted against the guarantors of a sick company. To achieve that purpose, it is imperative that the expression \"suit\" in Section 22 be given its plain meaning, namely, any proceedings adopted for realisation of a right vested in a party by law. This would COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 clearly include arbitration proceedings.\" \n42] We are therefore of the view that the words which are used in Section 36 of the Act, particularly the words \"as if it were a decree of the Court\" do not mean that wherever appeals are provided under Order XXI against the orders passed in execution, those appeals would also be maintainable under the Arbitration Act or under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. When 1996 Act was passed and thereafter Commercial Courts Act was passed, law makers were conscious of what \"decree\" or \"order\" and \"award\" are. They were also aware of fundamental difference between the Courts and Arbitrators as far back as in 1909 when the CPC was enacted. It will therefore be not possible to interpret the word \"decision\" to mean a decree and an order which has attained finality. If legislature intended to make an order passed in execution which has attained finality as appealable, it would have done so by providing a proviso that against such an order passed in execution proceedings which attained finality of rights between the parties, appeal would be maintainable. This Court therefore cannot add or subtract something which was not intended by the legislature. It is further well settled that an appeal is a creation of Statute and if no appeal is provided, party does not get a right to file an appeal and no vested right is created in him to file an appeal. The legislature having expressly and impliedly excluded that right, it will not be open for this Court to hold COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 that the word \"decision\" includes not only a decree but also orders which have attained finality. It has to be remembered that the Commercial Courts Act was passed for the purpose of quick disposal of commercial disputes. If the word \"decision\" therefore is interpreted to mean that orders which have attained finality also are appealable, the very purpose for which the Act was passed would be rendered nugatory, otiose and ineffective. \n43] At this stage, it will also be relevant to take into consideration the Law Commission's Report. While dealing with the question of \"appeals\", recommendations of the Law Commission were thus:-\n\"(iv) Appeals 3.23.1 The Bill presently provides for a direct appeal to the Supreme Court. This is proposed to be replaced with a provision, which mandates that there will be no appeals from orders of the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court save under Order XLIII of the CPC and from final judgments of the Commercial Division or Commercial Court. Such appeals will only be to the jurisdictional Commercial Appellate Division. \n3.23.2 It is further recommended that notwithstanding any other law, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against an interlocutory order of the Commercial Court, including an order COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 on a jurisdictional challenge. The purpose here is to prevent the time frames stipulated for case management hearing from becoming redundant by the frequent filing of civil revision applications and petitions against every interlocutory order. By removing a potential source of bottleneck of cases, the Bill hopes to ensure the expedited disposal of cases. \n3.23.3 Moreover, no appeals will be permitted from a finding of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division that the dispute in question is a commercial dispute inasmuch as there is no real prejudice caused to the parties when the Commercial Court or Commercial Division finds that the dispute is a commercial dispute. \n              (v)       Additional Provisions               a.        Arbitration               3.24.1     The   Law   Commission,   in   its   246th                Report   on   the  \"Amendments   to   the                 Arbitration   and   Conciliation   Act\"    has  recommended changes to the A & C Act to inter alia, reduce the intervention of the Court in arbitration proceedings.1 3.24.2 The 246th Report of the Commission has recommended an amendment to definition of \"Court\" in Section 2(e) of the A&C Act, 1996 to mean \"High Court\" in the context of all 1 Law Commission of India, Amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Report No.246 (2014) COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 international commercial arbitrations, irrespective of value. Keeping the suggestions and the amendments proposed in that report, we make the following suggestions with respect to arbitrations that involve commercial disputes. \n3.24.3 First, it is recommended that in case of an international commercial arbitration concerning a commercial dispute of more than Rupees One Crore, any application or appeal arising out of such arbitration under the A&C Act, that has been filed in a High Court will be heard by the Commercial Division of the High Court, where such Commercial Division has been constituted in the High Court. In the absence of the Commercial Division, applications or appeals concerning such international commercial arbitrations will be heard by the regular Bench of the High Court. \n3.24.4 Second, in the case of domestic arbitrations concerning a commercial dispute of more than Rupees One Crore, applications or appeals may lie either to the High Court or a Civil Court (not being a High Court) depending upon the pecuniary jurisdiction. It is recommended that all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitrations under the A&C Act, that have been filed on the original side of the High Court shall be heard by the Commercial Division of the High Court where such Commercial Division is constituted in the High Court. However, in the absence of a COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Commercial Division being constituted, the regular Bench of the High Court will hear such applications or appeals arising out of domestic arbitration. If the application or appeal in such domestic arbitration is not within the jurisdiction of the High Court and would ordinarily lie before a Civil Court (not being a High Court) and there is a Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction in respect of such arbitration, then such application or appeal shall be filed in and heard by such Commercial Court. \n3.24.5 Third, it is recommended that all appeals under the A&C in relation to arbitration cases concerning a commercial dispute of more than Rupees One Crore preferred against an order of the Commercial Division or Commercial Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Appellate Division, where a Commercial Appellate Division has been constituted in the jurisdictional High Court.\" \nHowever, when the final Act was passed, it is apparent that the exclusion of the provisions of the Letters Patent are to be found in sub- section (2). The said sub-section (2) also starts with a non-obstante clause - notwithstanding anything contained in any other law - meaning thereby either CPC, Arbitration Act or the Letters Patent or any other law, no appeal would lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act. \nCOMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 44] Apart from reasons which we have given hereinabove, and in addition to that while deciding the question as to whether \"decision\" includes \"judgment\" and \"decree\", it will have to be considered whether the word \"decision\" has to be used in narrow sense or in a broad sense i.e. whether the word \"decision\" will have to be read only as a \"decree\" or wider meaning has to be given viz that of \"decree\", \"judgment\" and \"order\" which conclusively decides rights of the parties. Though the Letters Patent Act is not applicable as it has been expressly excluded under sub-section (2), it will be necessary to briefly see how the word \"judgment\" has been interpreted by the Apex Court. The word \"judgment\" is narrowly treated under Section 2 of the CPC. When the said question came up for consideration before the Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra), the Supreme Court in paras 112 and 113 of its judgment gave a wider meaning and held that those orders which conclusively decide right of parties could be held to be appealable under the Letters Patent Appeal, though the word \"judgment\" is narrowly construed in the CPC. The Apex Court in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra) did not give narrow meaning to the said word \"judgment\" and, therefore, held that the orders which conclusively decide right of parties, even if they are not appealable under Section 104 or Order XLIII, an appeal would lie under the Letters Patent. \n45] The vexed question is whether similar meaning should be given COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 to the word 'decision' as is found in sub-section (1) of Section 13.\n46] The question which fell for consideration before the Apex Court in Tirumalachetti Rajaram vs. Tirumalachetti Radhakrishnayya Chetty and Others1, was as under:-\n\"If the appellate decree passed by the High Court makes a variation in the decision of the trial court under appeal in favour of a party who intends to prefer an appeal against the said appellate decree, can the said decree be said to affirm the decision of the trial court or not under Article 133(1) of the Constitution?\" \nWhile deciding the said question, the Apex Court also considered the question as to what is the denotation of the word \"decision\". In para 7 of the said Judgment, the Apex Court has observed as under:-\n\"7. The next question to consider is : what is the denotation of the word \"decision\" used in the said clause. The argument for the respondent is that the word \"decision\" does not mean the whole of the decision but the decision on that part of the controversy between the parties which is brought to this Court in appeal. In support of the argument that the decision does not mean the entire decision of the trial court reliance is placed on the provisions of O. 20, Rules 4 and 5. Rule 4 of O. 20 deals with the judgments of Small Cause Courts and judgments of other Courts, and it provides that the judgments falling 1 (1962) 2 SCR 452 : AIR 1961 SC 1795 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 under the first clause need not contain more than the points for determination and decision thereon, whereas the judgments falling under the latter class should contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision thereon and the reasons for such decision. There is not doubt that the decision in the context means the decision on the points for determination. That of course is the meaning of the word \"decision\", but whether or not the word \"decision\" means the decision on one point or the decision of whole suit comprising of all the points in dispute between the parties must inevitably depend upon the context, and the context is plainly inconsistent with the argument that the decision should mean the decision on a specific point. If the word \"decree\" in the first part of the relevant clause means not a part of the decree but the whole of the decree then it would be reasonable to hold that the word \"decision\" must likewise mean the entire decision of the trial court and not a part of it.\" \nSimilarly in para 9 of the said judgment, the Apex Court has observed as under:-\n\"9. The question as to the meaning of the word \"decision\" in the corresponding provision of the Code of 1882 (s. 596) was considered by the Privy Council in Rajah Tasadduq Rasul Khan v. Manik Chand [(1902- 03) 30 IA 35]. The question which arose for the decision of the Privy Council was whether the appellate decree in that case was one of affirmance or not. The appellate decree had confirmed the trial court's decision though on different grounds, and so it was urged that the appellate decree was not one of COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 affirmance. In rejecting this argument the Privy Council stated that \"the natural, obvious and prima facie meaning of the word \"decision\" is decision of the suit by the Court, and that that meaning should be given to it in the section\" (s. 596). The Privy Council examined the definition of the word \"judgment\" in the Code of 1882 and came to the conclusion that the word \"decision\" meant the decision of the suit by the trial court and not the grounds stated in support of the said decision; in the result it was held that the appellate decree which confirmed the decision of the trial court though on different grounds was in law a decree of affirmance. It would thus be seen that this decision undoubtedly supports the conclusion that the word \"decision\" in Art. 133(1) should mean not a part of the decision or the grounds given for it but the decision of the suit as a whole; and if that be so, the clause could be harmoniously construed to mean that in determining the character of the appellate decree we have to look at the appellate decree as a whole, compare it with the decision of the trial court as a whole and decide whether the appellate decree is one of affirmance or not. In this enquiry the nature of the variation made whether it is in favour of the intending appellant or otherwise would not be relevant.\" \nFrom the aforesaid judgment it is apparent that the word \"decision\" would mean the entire decision of the Trial Court and not part of it. \nSecondly, in Raja Tassaduq Rashul Khan and another vs. Manik COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Chand1, Privy Council, while considering the definition of the word \"decision\" has observed as under:-\n\"Now there is no definition of the word 'decision' in the Civil Procedure Code, but there is a definition of the word 'decree'. It says 'decree' means the formal expression of a adjudication upon any right claimed or defence set up in a Civil Court when such adjudication, so far as regards the Court expressing it, decides th suit or appeal. Then, \"judgment\" is defined as meaning \"the statement given by the Judge of the grounds of a decree or order.\" Therefore their Lordships have two things: they have a decree which decides the suit, and they have the word \"judgment,\" meaning the statement of the grounds upon which the learned Judge or the Court proceeds to make the decree. \nMr. DeGruther appears to wish to give the word \"decision\" the same meaning as the word \"judgment\" and he says that it is necessary that the Appellate Court should not only affirm the decree made by the Court below but should also affirm the grounds of fact upon which that judgment was passed. Their Lordships cannot come to that conclusion. They think that the natural, obvious, and prima facie meaning of the word \"decision\" is decision of the suit by the Court, and that that meaning should be given to it in the section.\"\n1 Voll VII The Calcutta Weekly Notes 177 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Similarly, the Apex Court in Diamond Sugar Mills Ltd. & Anr. vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr.1, has considered the meaning of the term \"decision\" and in para 28 it has observed as under:-\n\"28. It is true that when words and phrases previously interpreted by the courts are used by the Legislature in later enactment replacing the previous statute, there is a presumption that the Legislature intended to convey by their use the same meaning which the courts had already given to them. This presumption can however only be used as an aid to the interpretation of the later statute and should not be considered to be conclusive. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter observed in Federal Com. Commission v. Columbia B. System [311 US p. 302] when considering this doctrine, the persuasion that lies behind the doctrine is merely one factor in the total effort to give fair meaning to language. The presumption will be strong where the words of the previous statute have received a settled meaning by a series of decisions in the different courts of the country; and particularly strong when such interpretation has been made or affirmed by the highest court in the land. We think it reasonable to say however that the presumption will naturally be much weaker when the interpretation was given in one solitary case and was not tested in appeal. After giving careful consideration to the view taken by the learned Judge of the Allahabad High Court in Emperor v. Munnalal [ILR 1942 p. 302] about the meaning of the words \"local area\" and proper 1 AIR 1961 SC 652 : (1961) 3 SCR 242 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 weight to the rule of interpretation mentioned above, we are of the opinion that the Constitution-makers did not use the words \"local area\" in the meaning which the learned Judge attached to it. We are of opinion that the proper meaning to be attached to the words \"local area\"\nin Entry 52 of the Constitution, (when the area is a part of the State imposing the law) is an area administered by a local body like a municipality, a district board, a local board, a union board, a Panchayat or the like. The premises of a factory is therefore not a \"local area\".\" \n47] From the above decisions it can be seen that the words and phrases previously interpreted by the Courts have to be used in aid to interpretation of later statute. The word \"decision\" therefore in this context would mean a final decision in the entire suit and therefore a decree. \n48] Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants has relied upon the definition of the word \"decision\" given in Black's Law Dictionary (9th Edition) and has contended that \"decision\" would include an order which finally determines rights of the parties. \nIt is well settled that definition given by a dictionary cannot override the interpretation made by the Court in the context of its meaning as used in the statute and therefore the said submission is unacceptable. It is a settled position in law that dictionary is a COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 secondary and external aid to interpretation of statute and cannot be relied upon when a direct meaning/definition has been in use in law and/or defined specifically in a statute. It has to be noted here that the term \"decision\" was a part of the Code of Civil Procedure 1882 (Section 596) which was later incorporated in Section 110 of the CPC which is now deleted and is also used in Article 133 of the Constitution of India. \nFrom the judgments referred to hereinabove, it is clear that it has been consistently held that the term \"decision\" appearing in thee provisions means decision of the suit. The definition of \"decision\" and \"judgment\" in Black's Law Dictionary is therefore contrary to the settled law in India. \n49] Mr. Andhyarujina the learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the term \"decision\" has to be given a wide import and it includes \"decree\", \"judgment or order\". He relied upon the judgment of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh in Balanand & Anr. vs. Devkinand & Ors1 (paras 5 and 6) and the judgment of High Court of Delhi in Ratan & Co. vs. Asst. Registrar of Trademarks2 (para 24).\nThe said submission cannot be accepted since in para 5 of the said judgment in Balanand (supra) it has been held that the word 1 AIR 1963 HP 30 2 AIR 1977 Delhi 93 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 \"decision\" would not by itself amount to a judgment or order and from para 6 of the said judgment it can be seen that the High Court of Himachal Pradesh was of the view that a \"decision\" was when the suit was disposed of on merits. Secondly, the decsion in Ratan & Co. (supra) does not take into consideration the provisions of Section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the provisions of Article 133(1) of the Constitution of India, the provisions of Section 596 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1882 and the judicial pronouncements of the Privy Council and the Supreme Court. \nTherefore the submissions made by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Tulzapurkar and Mr Milind Sathe and the leanred Counsel Mr. Andhyarujina appearing on behalf of the Appellants are without any substance and \"decision\" therefore being a final decision of the suit is a decree and not an order passed in execution proceedings. \n50] Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants relied on various judgments of the Apex Court regarding the meaning which was to be given to proviso to Section 13(1). He relied upon the following judgments:-\n[1] The State of Orissa vs. Debaki Debi and Ors1 [2] Commissioner of Stamp Duties vs. Alan 1 1964 SC 1413 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Cavave Atwill and Ors.1 (Pages 330, 331 and 332) [3] Madhu Gopal vs. VI Additional District Judge and Ors2 (Para 7) [4] Swedish Match AB and Anr. vs. Securities and Exchange Board of India & Anr.3 (Paras 65 & 66) There cannot be any dispute regarding the ratio of the Judgments of the Privy Council and Supreme Court. The Apex Court in Swedish Match AB (supra) has in para 43 held that the proviso may serve four different purposes, namely :\n(1) qualifying or excepting certain provisions from the main enactment;\n(2) it may entirely change the very concept of the intendment of the enactment by insisting on certain mandatory conditons to be fulfilled in order to make the enactment workable;\n(3) it may be so embedded in the Act itself as to become an integral part of the enactment and thus acquire the tenor and colour of the substantive enactment itself; and (4) it may be used merely to act as an optional addenda to the enactment with the sole object of 1 1973 (2) WLR 327 2 AIR 1989 SCC 155 3 (2004) 11 SCC 641 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 explaining the real intendment of the statutory provisions.\n51] In the present case, the said provision if read as a whole and a plain and grammatical meaning of the said provision is taken into consideration, it can be seen that the proviso has been used to carve out an exception to the general rule that an appeal would lie against the decree and only against those orders which are specifically enumerated in the proviso. \n52] Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants then relied on the following judgments on how the heading of the section can be used in aid of constructing or interpreting the section. \n[1] Oulater Hall & Co. Ltd vs. Board of Trade1 (Pages 832 to 833) [2] Inglis vs. Robertson and Baxter2 ( Page 630) [3] Bhinka and Ors vs. Charan Singh3 (Page 966, para 15) [3] Raichurmatham Prabhakar and Anr. vs. Rawatmal Dugar4 (Page 775, para 14) 1 (1961) 3 W.L.R. 825 2 1898 AC 616 3 AIR 1959 SC 960 4 2004(4) SCC 766 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 53 ] From the conspectus of the cases on which reliance has been placed by the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants, it can be seen that the Courts have held that (i) heading to the section has to be read in conjunction with the main provision and make the two consistent if possible, (ii) headings are not mere marginal notes, but the sections in the group to which they belong must be read in connection with the headings and interpreted by the light of them, (iv) headings are in the nature of preamble to the section, (v) the headings prefixed to sections or sets of sections in some modern statutes are regarded as preambles to those sections. They cannot control the plain words of the statute but they may explain ambiguous words, (iv) if there is any doubt in the interpretation of words in the section, heading certainly help us to resolve the doubt, (v) headings of the title of the section plays a limited role in the construction of statutes. They may be taken as very broad and general indicators of the nature of the subject matter dealt with thereunder. \n54] From the ratio of the aforesaid judgments, in our view, it is apparent that heading of the section 13 deals with appeals from decrees and the proviso to Section 13 (1) carves out an exception in respect of the orders which are specifically enumerated in Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, against which appeal can be filed. The word \"decision\" therefore will have to be interpreted to mean a decree. \nCOMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 55] The next question which has been argued by the learned Counsels appearing for the Appellants is regarding definition of the word \"judgment\". All the learned Counsels for the Appellants have submitted that the word \"judgment\" has to be given a wider meaning as laid down in Radhy Shyam vs. Shyam Behari Singh1 (Para 7) and in Shah Babulal Khimji vs. Jayaben D. Kania and Anr. 2 (Paras 112 and 113). In our view, reference to these judgments is misconceived. Firstly, the question which fell for consideration before the Supreme Court in Radhy Shyam (supra) was : whether the order passed under Order XXI Rule 90 is a \"judgment\" and in that context the Apex Court held that Letters Patent Appeal lay against the order of the learned Single Judge. Similar view was taken by the Apex Court in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra) in which the Apex Court observed that the word \"judgment\" in sub-section (9) of section 2 of the CPC, 1908 has to be given a narrow meaning whereas the word \"judgment\" used in Clause 15 of the Letters Patent has to be interpreted widely. In our view, both these judgments will not be of any assistance to the Appellants since in the said cases the word \"judgment\" was interpreted in the context of the word \"judgment\" used in CPC and the word \"judgment\" used in the Letters Patent. In the present case, in sub- section (2) of Section 13 the words \"Letters Patent Appeal\" have been expressly excluded and as such the word \"judgment\" which is occurring in sub-section (1) of Section 13 cannot be given a wider 1 AIR 1971 SC 2337 2 AIR 1981 SC 1786 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 meaning. \n56] Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants also submitted that it is a well-known principle of interpretation of statute that the construction should not be put upon the statutory provision which would lead to manifest absurdity or futility, palpable injustice, or absurd inconvenience or anomaly. He submitted that when a statute enacts that something shall be deemed to have been done, which in fact and truth was not done, the Court is entitled and bound to ascertain for what purpose and between what persons the statutory fiction is to be resorted and full effect must be given to the statutory fiction and it should be carried to its logical conclusion. He relied on the following judgments:-\n[1] State of Bombay vs. Pandurang Vinayak and others1 (Para 5) [2] American Home Products Corporation vs. Mac Laboratories Ltd and Anr.2 (Paras 56, 57 and 66) In the light of the said judgments, he contended that since section 36 in terms state that an award has to be executed as if it is a decree and wherever the words \"as if it were a decree\" are occurring in Order XXI, 1 AIR 1953 SC 244 2 AIR 1986 SC 137 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 it has to be treated as a decree and therefore it would be appealable as a decree under section 13(1). It was contended that the present order is in the nature of Order under Order XXI Rule 103 which even otherwise states that appeal is provided. In our view ratio of the judgments on which reliance is placed are not applicable to the facts of the present case. The Apex Court in Paramjeet Singh Patheja vs. ICDS Ltd1, in paras 42 and 43 has clearly observed that Section 36 of the Arbitration Act has created a very limited legal fiction for the purpose of enforcement of the abritral awards under the CPC in the same manner as if it was a decree of the Court. It is well settled that even if there is a legal fiction, the same cannot be widened for any purpose which is outside its avowed purpose. It cannot be widened to include a right of appeal since no appeal is provided under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. It is also equally well settled that the fiction intended by the legislature must be restricted to the plain term of the statute and it cannot be used to travel beyond the term of the statute. \nReliance can be placed on the following decisions in State of Travancore-Cochin & Ors. vs. Shanmughah Vilas Cashwnut Factory 2 (Paras 36, 37 and 40) and in Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay vs. Shakuntala (para 8). \n57] So far as submissions of the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Milind Sathe are concerned, he submitted that in the Bill, words \"and from 1 (2006) 13 SCC 322 2 AIR 1953 SC 333 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 no other orders\" were present whereas they were omitted from the text of Section 13 of the said Act. The said submission is without any substance since perusal of the said section clearly discloses that the said words have been incorporated in sub-section (2) of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act which read as under:-\n\"13(2) ............ , no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\" \nHe then, submitted that Section 37 of the Arbitration Act and Order XLIII of the CPC only provided for appeals from orders that have not attained finality. This submission is without any substance since section 37(1)(c ) and Section 37(2)(a) provided for appeals from orders that finally dispose of the arbitration proceedings. \n58] So far as the submissions of the learned Counsel Mr. Andhyarujina are concerned, he submitted that Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act created a new hierarchy of appeals. He submitted that by virtue of the proviso, even appeals under Section 37(2) of the Arbitration Act would lie to the Commercial Appellate Division. This submission is repelled by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Madon appearing on behalf of the Respondents. We agree with the COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 submission made by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Madon. The proviso clearly states that \"appeals shall lie from all such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as amended by this Act and Sections 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The orders passed under Section 37(2) of the Arbitration Act are not Orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court and therefore no appeal shall lie from them to the Commercial Appellate Division under the proviso to Section 13. If the said submission is accepted then provisions of section 37(3) would be rendered otiose since it makes it clear that no second appeal shall lie from the order passed in appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. Moreover, there is no provision of appeal from order passed in execution proceedings under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. \n59] Mr. Andhyarujina further submitted that section 37(3) of the Arbitration Act has not been incorporated into the body of section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. This submission is fallicious since section 13 includes the entire section 37 in the proviso and not merely any part thereof. So far as the judgment on which reliance is placed by the learned Counsel Mr. Andhyarujina is concerned viz. Shin-Etsu Chemical Company Limited vs. Vindhya Telelinks Limited 1, in our view, it will not be applicable to the facts of the present case and therefore cannot be of any assistance to the Appellants. 1 2009 SC 3284 COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 60] We do not wish to go into the question raised by both the parties regarding nature of the order passed by the learned Single Judge on the application under Order XXI Rule 22. According to the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Madon for the Respondents the said order is passed under section 47 which has been excluded from the definition of \"decree' in CPC and therefore is not appealable, whereas according to the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Tulzapurkar and two other Counsels the said Order has been passed not under Section 47 but under Order XXI Rules 97, 98, 99, 101 and 103 and therefore the said order is appealable. Reliance has been placed by the learned Senior Counsel for the Appelalnts on judgments in support of the said submission. We, however, do not propose to go into the said question for the reasons stated hereinabove and, secondly, because in our view the orders passed in execution proceedings of award are not appealable under Section 37 and therefore it is not necessary to go into the said question. \n61] It has to be noted that the question which falls for consideration before this Court is :Whether, in an application for execution of an Award passed under the Arbitration Act, 1996, an oder passed by the learned Single Judge is appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act as if it is a decree? And we are called upon to decide the said question only. \nCOMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 62] We therefore answer the questions framed in para 19 above as under:-\nQUESTIONS ANSWERS [1] Whether, in an application for execution of an Award passed under the Arbitration Act, No 1996, an order passed by the learned Single Judge is appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act as if it is a decree? [2] Whether the word \"decision\" means a Yes decree? \n[3] Whether a decision in the form of an order is appealable only under the conditions Yes given in proviso to section 13(1) viz. that the order/decision is appealable only on the grounds mentioned in Section 37 or Section 104 or Order XLIII of the CPC? \n[4] Whether the word \"decision\" which is found in Section 13(1) of the Commercial No Courts Act includes a \"decree\" or an \"order\" which has the effect of having finality or final adjudication of rights of parties?\n[5] Whether, the heading to Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act governs Section Yes COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 13(1) i.e. whether the word \"decision\" is to be taken as a \"decree\" on account of the heading of the Section?\n[6] Whether ratio of the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra) is applicable to Yes the facts of the present case and is a binding precedent with reference to the facts arising in the present case?\n[7] Whether ratio of the judgment in the case of Paramjeet Singh Patheja (supra) which Yes has been relied upon in the case of Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra) is applicable to the facts of the present case? \nCONCLUSION:\n63] For the reasons stated above, all the appeals are dismissed as they are not maintainable. \n(MRS SWAPNA S. JOSHI, J.) (V.M.

comapl/6/2016 mrs. swapna s. joshi, jj. reserved on 24th october, 2016 listed for directions on 3rd march, 2017 pronounced on 29th march, 2017 oral order: (per v.m. kanade, j.) 1] all these appeals can be disposed of by a common order since they are arising out of the common judgment delivered by the learned single judge. preliminary objection: 2] mr. madon, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondents in all these appeals has raised a preliminary objection regarding maintainability of these appeals. he submitted that in view of language used in section 13 of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015 (hereafter referred to as \"commercial courts act\"), appeal against the impugned judgment and order will not be maintainable. 3] before considering the rival contentions, it will be necessary to briefly state the relevant facts for the purpose of deciding this preliminary objection. comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 facts: 4] prior to 1987, a partnership firm was carrying on business in the name and style of juggilal kamlapat bankers which was reconstituted from time to time and it was finally reconstituted on 21/02/1980. 5] sometime in the year 1987, differences arose between the partners of the firm and on 26/03/1987, a deed of dissolution of partnership was executed between the partners and the firm was dissolved with effect from 19/03/1987. a supplemental agreement was also executed on 28/03/1987. partners agreed to partition and distribute the immovable properties of the said firm amongst the partners. 6] since there was some dispute regarding distribution, the arbitration suit no.1904 of 1992 was filed by respondent nos. 1 to 6 for appointment of an arbitrator under section 20 of the arbitration act, 1940. the suit was initially dismissed on the ground of limitation. the matter travelled upto the supreme court and the apex court held that the suit was within time and the disputes between the parties were referred to the arbitration of the sole arbitrator mr. justice s.n. variava (retd.). 7] the learned arbitrator passed an award on 04/08/2008 and in comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 the said award he was pleased to order and direct partition and distribution of various immovable properties of the firm amongst the partners. for the purpose of deciding the preliminary objection of maintainability of these appeals, it is not necessary to go into details of the manner of distribution of properties. 8] the award was challenged under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 and the petition challenging the said award was dismissed by this court on 01/10/2009. being aggrieved by the said order, an appeal was preferred under section 37 of the said act, 1996 by the bombay group and kanpur group which was also disposed of on 08/03/2013 and therefore the said award became executable as a decree. 9] since the distribution did not take place and the award was not complied with, an execution application no.2006 of 2015 under order xxi of cpc was filed in this court and the relief was claimed for possession of the bombay property. respondent no.16 also filed execution application no.1913 of 2015. thereafter, notice no.1786 of 2015 was issued under order xxi rule 22 of the cpc to all the parties in the execution application to show cause why the said award was not executable and why warrant of possession should not be issued. all the parties filed detailed reply to the said notice. appellants herein opposed and resisted the execution of the award on comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 the ground that the obligations of the groups in the award were joint, interlinked and interconnected and to be executed and complied with simultaneously. 10] mr. madon, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondents, has raised a preliminary objection regarding maintainability of these appeals and his contention is that these orders which are passed in execution proceedings are not decrees of commercial courts and commercial division nor are orders which are specifically enumerated in sub-section (1) of section 13. he therefore inter alia submitted that these appeals are not maintainable. 11] on the other hand, mr. virag tulzapurkar, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has submitted that these appeals are not restricted either to decrees or orders which are specifically enumerated in the proviso but also would lie against decision of the commercial courts or commercial division which has the effect of attaining finality and even against such a decision, appeal would be maintainable. it is his contention that the order passed in execution proceedings is in the nature of final order affecting substantive rights of the appellants and, therefore, these appeals are maintainable. 12] we have heard all the parties at length and they have filed their written submissions. comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 submissions of the learned senior counsel mr. d. d. madon for respondent nos. 1 to 5 in comap/4/2016 and for respondent nos. 1 to 6 in comapl/5/2016 and comapl/6/2016. 13] mr. madon, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondents nos. 1 to 5 kolkata group made the following submissions:(i) firstly, he submitted that the objections taken by the appellants in the execution proceedings fall within the ambit of section 47 explanation ii (b) of the civil procedure code (\"cpc\"), which deals with all questions relating to the delivery of property in execution. he submitted that the principal objection of the appellants is that the respondents are seeking to execute only a part of the award and, therefore, their contention is that the obligations of all parties to the award should be performed simultaneously and that the award should not be executed in parts since the same is fashioned as an indivisible whole. he submitted that as per the amendment act 104 of 1976, determination of any questions within \"section 47\" of the cpc were omitted from the definition of the word \"decree\" and therefore no appeal under section 96 of the cpc would lie against the orders passed in execution proceedings under section 47 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 read with order xxi rule 22. (ii) secondly, he submitted that the provisions of letters patent of the hon'ble bombay high court will have no applicability and the provisions of the commercial courts act would prevail over the letters patent in its applicability to commercial disputes. he therefore submitted that no appeal could lie under clause 15 of the letters patent. he contended that execution proceedings under section 36 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (for short \"arbitration act\") are not proceedings under the cpc but under the arbitration act which is an exhaustive code by itself and which does not provide for any such appeal and therefore applicability of clause 15 of the letters patent has been impliedly excluded by section 37 of the arbitration act. he relied on the judgment of jet airways (india) limited vs. subrata roy sahara 1 (paras 1, 9, 15-30 & 34) in which it was held that lpa does not lie since the execution was under section 36 of the arbitration act and not under the provisions of the cpc. he further submitted that since no appeal had been provided under section 37 of the arbitration act, an appeal would not be maintainable. he submitted that division bench in the case of jet airways (india) ltd. 1 2011 scc online bom 1379 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 (supra) followed the judgment of the hon'ble supreme court in furest day lawson vs. jindal exports limited 1 (paras 89-91). he then submitted that in paramjeet singh patheja vs. icds ltd2, the supreme court held that the arbitral award cannot be considered to be a decree for any purpose for any central or state act. (iii) thirdly, he submitted that section 13(2) of the commercial courts act specifically excludes lpa and therefore in view of binding precedent, the present execution proceedings were not the proceedings under the cpc but the proceedings under section 36 of the arbitration act. he submitted that section 37 of the arbitration act does not provide for an appeal from execution proceedings. he submitted that clause 15 of the letters patent is impliedly excluded by the arbitration act and no appeal could lie from the order in execution proceedings of an award. (iv) fourthly, he submitted that the term \"judgment\" in section 13(1) of the commercial courts act must be given the same meaning and definition as in section 2(9) of the cpc and not the expanded 1 (2011) 8 scc 333 2 (2006) 13 scc 322 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 meaning as under the letters patent. (v) fifthly, he submitted that the word \"decision\" in section 13(1) of the commercial courts act must be read to mean \"decree\". (vi) sixthly, he submitted that assuming the word \"decision\" includes judgment and order even then an appeal would not be maintainable under the commercial courts act. he submitted that the proviso contained in section 13(1) provides for appeals only from certain orders under order xliii of the cpc and section 37 of the arbitration act and since the impugned order is not a decree, no appeal would lie in view of proviso to section 13(1). (vii) seventhly, he submitted that the appellants are not obstructionists. he submitted that the present application was tried and determined under section 47 and not under rules 58, 98 or 103 of order xxi of the cpc. (viii) eighthly, he submitted that the appellants never had vested right of appeal prior to enactment of comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 the commercial courts act in view of the legal position settled in jet airways (india) ltd. (supra). he submitted that the right of appeal had been expressly taken away by virtue of the provisions of section 13(2) of the commercial courts act. he submitted that hon'ble division bench of this court vide its judgment dated 24/10/2015 in hubtown limited vs. idbi trusteeship service ltd delivered in commercial appeal no.7 of 2016 had held that appeal would lie from order granting conditional leave inter alia on the ground that since the suit was filed prior to the coming into force of the commercial courts act, the appellants had vested right of appeal. he submitted that, in the present case, there was no right of appeal available to the appellants prior to coming into force of the commercial courts act. submissions of the learned senior counsel mr. virag tulzapurkar, for the appellant in comapl/5/2016. 14] mr. virag tulzapurkar the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants made the following submissions:(a) firstly, he submitted that section 13 of the commercial courts act is a sole provision providing comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 for governing the appeals under the commercial courts act. he submitted that the said section including its heading, uses the expression \"decision\", \"decree\" or a \"judgment\" or an \"order\". he contended that the expression \"decision\" in section 13(1) of the said act refers to a decision which has the characteristic and quality of finality i.e. one which conclusively determines the rights of the parties to the proceeding. he submitted that in view of section 13(1), against such a decision, appeal is maintainable and, therefore, it is not necessary to refer to the proviso of section 13(1). (b) secondly, he submitted that proviso to section 13(1) gives an additional right of appeal against such orders as are specifically enumerated (i) under order xliii of the cpc and (ii) under section 37 of the arbitration act and merely because \"orders\" or \"decisions\" which have attained finality as provided under section 13(1) are not mentioned in the proviso, appeal against such orders would not be excluded under section 13 of the commercial courts act. he, therefore, submitted that the proviso to section 13(1) has to be read as an independent statutory enactment comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 which gives an additional right of appeal under the commercial courts act. in support of the said submissions, he relied on the following judgments of the apex court:[1] the state of orissa vs. debaki debi and ors1 [2] commissioner of stamp duties vs. alan cavave atwill and ors.2 (pages 330, 331 and 332) [3] madhu gopal vs. vi additional district judge and ors3 (para 7) [4] swedish match ab and anr. vs. securities and exchange board of india & anr.4 (paras 65 & 66) he submitted that under the commercial courts act, whether an appeal from a particular \"decision\" lies or not is to be decided on the basis of the nature of the decision itself and its intrinsic character. he submitted that if the decision conclusively or finally adjudicates upon and 1 1964 sc 1413 2 1973 (2) wlr 327 3 air 1989 scc 155 4 (2004) 11 scc 641 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 determines the rights of parties then an appeal will lie under section 13(1). (c) thirdly, he submitted that heading of the section can be used in aid of construing or interpreting a section. in support of the said submission, he relied upon the following judgments:[1] oulater hall & co. ltd vs. board of trade1 (pages 832 to 833) [2] inglis vs. robertson and baxter2 ( page 630) [3] bhinka and ors vs. charan singh3 (page 966, para 15) [3] raichurmatham prabhakar and anr. vs. rawatmal dugar4 (page 775, para 14) he submitted that, therefore, a \"decree\" is appealable under section 13(1) itself, even if it does not find place in and is not referred to in the 1 (1961) 3 w.l.r. 825 2 1898 ac 616 3 air 1959 sc 960 4 2004(4) scc 766 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 proviso. (d) fourthly, he submitted that definition of the word \"decree\" in cpc is incorporated in the commercial courts act. he submitted that section 2(2) of the commercial courts act states that the words and expressions used and not defined under the commercial courts act, but defined under the code of civil procedure, 1908, and the evidence act, 1872, should be given the same meaning as assigned to them in the code and the act. he submitted that definitions of \"decree\", \"order\" and \"judgment\" as referred to in the cpc, apply to the commercial courts act as they are not separately defined in the commercial courts act. he submitted that though the words \"section 47\" were omitted by the 1976 amendment from the definition of the word \"decree\", alternative provisions were made by amendments incorporated in the cpc at about the same time in several provisions of the cpc such as order 21 rules 58(4), rule 98(2) bombay amendment and order 21 rule 103 of the cpc (read with order 21 rules 97, 98, 99, 101 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 therein). he submitted that any order passed adjudicating any application therein has the force of a decree for the purpose of appeal. he relied on order xxi rule 103. he submitted that the respondents' contention that under order xxi rules 97 to 103 only a third party, and not the judgment debtor, could raise objection / obstruction, is not correct. in support of the said contention, he relied upon the following judgments:[1] nooruddin vs. dr. k.l. anand 1 (para 8) [2] shreenath and another vs. rajesh and others2 (para 10) [3] brahmdeo chaudhary vs. rishikesh prasad jaiswal and another3 (para 6) he submitted that provisions of the cpc themselves viz. order 21 rule 98(2) contemplate obstruction by a judgment debtor himself. he submitted that the impugned order in this matter 1 (1995) 1 scc 242 2 4 scc 543 3 (1997) 3 scc 694 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 is an order having the same characteristics and passed under the said provisions viz order 21 rule 103 read with order 21 rules 97, 98, 99 and 101. he submitted that the impugned order is a decision having the force of a decree and is appealable under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. in support of the said submission, he gave certain illustrations and thereafter relied on the judgment of the apex court in transmission corporation of a.p. vs. ch. prabhakar and others1 (para 18) (e) fifthly, he submitted that section 13(1) also refers to \"judgment\" and an appeal from \"judgment\". he submitted that if the impugned order affects the vital and valuable rights of the appellants, it has to be treated as a judgment under section 13 of the commercial courts act and it has a force of final judgment. in support of the said submissions, he relied on the following judgments:[1] radhy shyam vs. shyam behari 1 (2004) 5 scc 551 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 singh1 (para 7) [2] shah babulal khimji vs. jayaben d. kania and anr.2 (paras 112 and 113) (f) sixthly, he submitted that for the purposes of execution of a decision, decree, order or judgment passed under the provisions of the commercial courts act, the provisions of the cpc as regards the execution are applicable. he submitted that the commercial courts act does not contain any provisions for execution and only the cpc provisions for execution are applicable. he relied on section 16 of the commercial courts act. he submitted that section 16 of the commercial courts act amends certain provisions of the cpc in their application to proceedings in the commercial courts act and the commercial court / commercial division has to follow these provisions of the cpc amended by the commercial courts act. he submitted that amendments to the cpc are found in schedule to the commercial courts act. he submitted that, 1 air 1971 sc 2337 2 air 1981 sc 1786 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 however, there is no amendment in respect of order xxi of the cpc. he submitted that all the amendments relate to proceedings upto the stage of judgment and not thereafter. he submitted that had the parliament desired to amend order xxi rule 103 to exclude from the expression \"decree\", the order passed under rule 103, it would have done so. he therefore submitted that for the purposes of the commercial courts act any order passed under order xxi rule 103 continues to be a decree for the purpose of an appeal therefrom. (g) seventhly, on the point of legal fiction, he submitted that where the statutory fiction is to be resorted to, full effect must be given to the statutory fiction and it should be carried to its logical conclusion. in support of the said submission, he relied upon the following judgments:[1] state of bombay vs. pandurang vinayak and others1 (para 5) [2] american home products 1 air 1953 sc 244 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 corporation vs. mac laboratories ltd and anr.1 (paras 56, 57 and 66) appellants' response to the respondent nos. 1 to 6's contentions: in reply to the contention of the respondents that in view of the judgment of this court in jet airways (india) ltd. vs. subrata roy sahara and others2 the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has made the following submissions:(a) firstly, he submitted that the judgment in jet airways (india) ltd. (supra) was passed when the commercial courts act had not been enacted and had not come into orce. (b) secondly, he submitted that the statutory provisions considered in the said judgment were totally different. (c) thirdly, he submitted that section 13 of the 1 air 1986 sc 137 2 2011 scc online bom 1379 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 commercial courts act alone governs the right of appeal to the express exclusion of the cpc, letters patent and the arbitration act. alternatively, he submitted that decision in jet airways (india) ltd. (supra) is not good law since it does not take into consideration judgments of the apex court in state of bombay vs. pandurang1 (para 5), american home products corporation vs. mac laboratories ltd and anr2 (paras 56, 57, 66) and in east end dwelling vs. finsbury3 (pages 132, 133). he submitted that since these judgments have not been considered, the judgment in jet airways (india) ltd. (supra) is not good law and should be ignored. (d) fourthly, he submitted that the judgment in jet airways (india) ltd. (supra) requires reconsideration since it has overlooked the settled legal position that the statutory fiction contained in section 36 of the arbitration act must be given full effect. it is contended that the judgment in jet airways (india) ltd (supra) holding that execution 1 air 1953 sc 244 2 air 1986 sc 137 3 1952 a.c. 109 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 applications in respect of an award are applications under the arbitration act and not under the cpc, is erroneous. he submitted that once an award is passed, thereafter execution proceedings are under the cpc alone and not under the arbitration act. (e) lastly, he submitted that the judgment in jet airways (india) ltd. (supra) was based upon the decision of the supreme court in paramjeet singh patheja vs. icds ltd.1. he submitted that the said judgment of the apex court in patheja (supra) is misconstrued and misapplied in the the judgment of jet airways (india) ltd. (supra). it is submitted that ratio in the judgment of patheja (supra) was with reference to notice under section 9(2) of the presidency towns insolvency act, 1909 (for short \"insolvency act\") and it was observed that on the basis of an award, notice under section 9(2) of the insolvency act could not be issued since it was not a decree. it is submitted that in paras 42 and 43 of the judgment in patheja (supra), the supreme court has expressly observed that an award is a \"decree\" for execution purposes. it is therefore 1 (2006) 13 scc 322 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 submitted that the conclusion arrived at in the case of jet airways (india) ltd. (supra) is contrary to the decision in patheja (supra) submissions of the learned senior counsel mr. milind sathe for the appellant in comapl/6/2016 15] mr milind sathe, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant firstly submitted that the notice was taken out under the provisions of order xxi rule 22 of the cpc and this was resisted by the appellant herein by raising objections which are in the nature of objections under order xxi rule 97 of the cpc. he submitted that the order impugned in the appeal is passed on an application which is in the nature of the order contemplated under rule 101 of order xxi. he therefore submitted that the order is to be treated as decree under rule 103 of order xxi. he submitted that the order impugned in appeal therefore qualifies as \"decree\" under section 13 of the commercial courts act. he then invited our attention to section 13 of the said act. while interpreting section 13, he submitted that the section could not be read to mean that only judgment or order is appealable. he submitted that such an interpretation would lead to a result that, then decree is not provided as being appealable in section 13 of the commercial courts act, which would give rise to a situation that an interlocutory order is appealable but an order which is in the form of a decree is not appealable. he submitted that the comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 interpretation of section 13 and the legislative intent to provide appeal against any \"decision\" of commercial division can also be gathered from the draft of \"commercial court bill\" introduced in parliament. he submitted that the bill had used the words \"only against\" and \"against no other orders\" and these words are not incorporated in section 13 of the act. he therefore submitted that the legislative intent was to provide appeal against all decisions. he submitted that so far as proceedings under section 36 of the arbitration act are concerned, they must be treated as proceedings under section 47 and order xxi of the cpc. in support of the said submission, he pointed out firstly that section 36 expressly provides that the \"award\" shall be executable \"as if it were a decree\" under the provision of the cpc. secondly, he submitted that various provisions in order xxi of cpc contemplate adjudication of right, title and interest of various parties such as in order xxi rule 58 and order xxi rules 97 to 103 of the cpc. he submitted that these decisions are treated \"as if it were a decree of a civil court\". he submitted that since the expression in section 36 of the arbitration act \"as if it were a decree of a civil court\" is sought to be argued as not construing as a decree then the provisions of order xxi rule 58 as well as order xxi rule 103 would be rendered nugatory. he therefore submitted that proceedings under section 36 of the arbitration act must be construed as proceedings under the cpc. he submitted that the judgment in jet airways (india) limited (supra) has not taken into consideration these issues and comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 therefore is required to be referred to the larger bench for reconsideration. lastly, he submitted that the exclusion of applicability of the provisions of the cpc under section 19 of arbitration act is limited to \"arbitral proceeding\" and not to execution of the award. submissions of the learned counsel mr. zal andhyarujina for the appellant in comap/4/2016. 16] mr zal andhyarujina, the learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the commercial courts act is a specific act dealing with a specific types of disputes and the object of the act was to provide an independent mechanism for early resolution of the disputes. he submitted that the plain language of section 13(1) indicates that \"the decision\" would include a \"judgment and order\". he submitted that the plain language thus is plenary and wide in nature. he submitted that the term \"decision\" has been judicially interpreted. he relied on the judgment in balanand & anr. vs. devkinand & ors.1(paras 5 and 6) and also in ratan & co vs. asst. registrar of trademarks2 (para 24). he submitted that the proviso to section 13(1) is an enabling statutory provision. he submitted that this is also evident from the express exclusionary language of section 13(2) which provides that \"notwithstanding any other law in force\", no other appeals shall lie. he submitted that the contrast in the language between the proviso to section 13(1) and section 13(2) 1 air 1963 hp 30 2 air 1977 delhi 93 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 makes it evident that the former is enabling and the latter is disabling/exclusionary. he then submitted so far as the appeals under section 37(1) of the arbitration act are concerned, the arbitration act provides that the appeal shall lie from such orders, to the court authorized by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the court passing the orders. he submitted that the effect of section 13(1) of the commercial courts act on such orders is to make all appeals from those orders to lie before the commercial appellate division. he submitted that under section 37, appeals could be filed from orders of the court under section 9 and 34 which was provided in section 37(1) and also orders of the arbitral tribunal under section 16 and 17 as specified under section 37(2). he submitted that under the arbitration act, appeals under section 37(1) would go to division bench/appeal court and the appeals under section 37(2) would be heard by the single judge. he submitted that however proviso to section 13 specifically enables an appeal to lie from orders passed by the commercial division under section 37 of the said act to the commercial appellate division. he submitted that such an appeal is in the nature of second appeal and provides for an appeal where no such appeal previously existed. he submitted that the commercial courts act, being a more specific and later central statute, would override the arbitration act which was an older and general statute to the extent of inconsistency and repugnancy. he submitted that the present appeal is maintainable under section 13(1) of the said act and the proviso comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 has no application to the facts of the present case. lastly, he submitted that enforcement of an award is done in the same manner as if it is a decree of the court and therefore all provisions applicable to the enforcement under the cpc including appeals which are otherwise available would be available to the parties. he relied on the judgment in sbp & co. vs. patel engineering ltd.1 (para 18) and also in shin-etsu chemical co. ltd. & ors. vs. vindhya teleinks ltd. & ors 2. he submitted that the judgment in jet airways (india) limited (supra) requires reconsideration. reply of mr madon, the learned senior counsel for respondents to the submissions made by the learned senior counsel mr. sathe & mr zal andhyarujina, counsel for the appellant. 17] mr. madon, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents has also given in detail his reply as to how the arguments made by the appellants' counsel are not tenable. while dealing with the submissions made by the learned senior counsel mr. milind sathe, he submitted that the judgment in jet airways (india) limited (supra) does not require any reconsideration. he submitted that the legal fiction which is created in section 36 is for limited purpose and this fiction could not be expanded further. so far as the submission that certain words such as \"and from no other orders\" which were present in the commercial courts, commercial division 1 (2005) 8 scc 618 2 air 2009 scc 3284 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 and commercial appellate division of high courts bill, 2015 were omitted from this act, is concerned, he submitted that this submission is incorrect since in the main act, these words are incorporated which read as follows:\".no appeal shall lie from any order or decree.\" in reply to the submission of the learned senior counsel mr. sathe that section 37 of the arbitration act and order xliii of the cpc only provide for appeals from orders that have not attained finality, he submitted that section 37(1)(c ) & section 37(2)(a) of the arbitration act provide for appeals from orders that finally dispose of arbitration proceedings. 18] referring to the submission of the learned counsel mr. andhyarujina, mr. madon, the learned senior counsel for the respondents submitted that such argument is fallacious and based on misreading of the proviso to section 13 of the commercial courts act. he submitted that mr. andhyarujina wanted to read the words into proviso as if they they were \"an appeal shall lie from all orders covered under section 37 of the arbitration act, 1996\" when, in fact, the proviso clearly mentions that appeal would lie from all such orders that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the cpc and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. he submitted that if submission of mr. andhyarujina was to be accepted, comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 provision of section 37(3) of the arbitration act would be rendered otiose. he submitted that the judgments on which reliance has been placed by counsel mr. andhyarujina have no application to the facts of the present case. findings: 19] after having heard all the counsels appearing on behalf of appellants and respondents and having examined their written submissions, following questions in our view fall for consideration before this court:questions [1] whether, in an application for execution of an award passed under the arbitration act, 1996, an order passed by the learned single judge is appealable under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act as if it is a decree? [2] whether the word \"decision\" means a decree? [3] whether a decision in the form of an order is appealable only under the conditions comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 given in proviso to section 13(1) viz. that the order/decision is appealable only on the grounds mentioned in section 37 or section 104 or order xliii of the cpc [4] whether the word \"decision\" which is found in section 13(1) of the commercial courts act includes a \"decree\" or an \"order\" which has the effect of having finality or final adjudication of rights of parties? [5] whether, the heading to section 13 of the commercial courts act governs section 13(1) i.e. whether the word \"decision\" is to be taken as a \"decree\" on account of the heading of the section? [6] whether ratio of the judgment in jet airways (india) ltd. (supra) is applicable to the facts of the present case and is a binding precedent with reference to the facts arising in the present case? [7] whether ratio of the judgment in the comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 case of paramjeet singh patheja (supra) which has been relied upon in the case of jet airways (india) ltd. (supra) is applicable to the facts of the present case? 20] in order to appreciate the aforesaid questions which have been raised in these appeals, it is necessary to briefly consider the purpose for which this act has been passed and also the scheme of the act. 21] the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015 was passed by the parliament on 31/12/2015 and it received the assent of the president on 31/12/2015 and was published in the gazette of government of india on 01/01/2016. the preamble to the act reads as under:\"an act to provide for the constitution of commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division in the high courts for adjudicating commercial disputes of specified value and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\" the statement of objects and reasons mentions that the government had proposed to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes and therefore it wanted to constitute an independent mechanism for their early resolution. clause 6 of the said statement of objects and reasons reads as under:comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 \"6. it is proposed to introduce the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts bill, 2015 to replace the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts ordinance, 2015 which inter alia, provides for the following namely :(i) constitution of the commercial courts at district level except for the territory over which any high court is having ordinary original civil jurisdiction; (ii) constitution of the commercial divisions in those high courts which are already exercising ordinary civil jurisdiction and they shall have territorial jurisdiction over such areas on which it has original jurisdiction; (iii) constitution of the commercial appellate division in all the high courts to hear the appeals against the orders of the commercial courts and the orders of the commercial division of the high court; (iv) the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of such commercial courts and commercial division is proposed as one crore rupees; and (v) to amend the code of civil procedure, 1908 as applicable to the commercial courts and commercial comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 divisions which shall prevail over the existing high courts rules and other provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases.\" the preamble to the act and the objects and reasons disclose the intention of the parliament that it wanted to provide a separate mechanism for the purpose of speedy disposal of commercial disputes. 22] \"commercial dispute\" has been defined under section 2(c) of the commercial courts act. the definition reveals that all disputes which are commercial in nature are included in the said definition. constitution of commercial courts is provided in section 3 and it envisages constitution of number of commercial courts at district level and in the high court which has ordinary original civil jurisdiction. it provides for constitution of commercial division of the high court which is presided over by a single judge and constitution of commercial appellate division which is presided over by division bench. so far as bombay high court is concerned, it has ordinary original civil jurisdiction and, as such, the suits and proceedings of commercial nature are to be first heard by the single judge and the appeal is provided to the division bench under section 3. 23] section 7 of the commercial courts act speaks about jurisdiction comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 of commercial divisions of high courts and mentions that all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes would be heard and decided by commercial division i.e. by a single judge of the high court. section 10 of the commercial courts act speaks about jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters. clause (1) of section 10 mentions the arbitration arising out of international commercial arbitration and clause (2) speaks about arbitration other than international commercial arbitration. 24] section 13 of the commercial courts act speaks about appeals which arise out of the matters decided by the commercial division in civil suits etc and also appeals out of arbitration proceedings presided over by the commercial division i.e. single judge. it is evident therefore that no separate provisions have been made for differentiating between civil suits and arbitration proceedings. section 13 combines appeals which are filed in suits and in arbitration proceedings. section 13 reads as under:\"13. appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions.(1) any person aggrieved by the decision of the commercial court or commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order, as the case may be: provided that an appeal shall lie from comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996). (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\" 25] it will also be relevant to look at some of the other provisions viz. sections 8, 16 and 21 of the commercial courts act. section 8 of the commercial courts act reads as under:\"8. bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order.notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the commercial court. perusal of the said sections indicate that a bar has been imposed against civil revision application or petition against interlocutory order comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 and it specifies that no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the commercial court. section 16 of the commercial courts act reads as under:\"16. amendments to the code of civil procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes.(1) the provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the schedule. (2) the commercial division and commercial court shall follow the provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of specified value. (3) where any provision of any rule of the jurisdictional high court or any amendment to the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), by the state government is in conflict with the provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this act, the provisions of the code of civil procedure as amended by this act shall prevail.\" perusal of the said section indicates that the provisions of the comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 code of civil procedure will apply to the extent, as amended in the schedule. perusal of the schedule indicates that provisions of order xxi in so far as they relate to execution have not been amended. the said provisions therefore will clearly apply in respect of execution proceedings taken out in civil matters. section 21 of the commercial courts act reads as under:\"21. act to have overriding effect.save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than this act.\" in section 21, it is provided that the act shall have effect over any other laws which are for the time being in force other than this act. 26] so far as the enforcement of awards is concerned, under the arbitration act, section 36 lays down the manner in which the award can be enforced. section 36 of the arbitration act reads as under:\"36. enforcement.(1) where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under section 34 has expired, then, subject to the provisions of subsection (2), such award shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the code comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court. (2) where an application to set aside the arbitral award has been filed in the court under section 34, the filing of such an application shall not only by itself render that award unenforceable, unless the court grants an order of stay of the operation of the said arbitral award in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3), on a separate application made for that purpose. (3) upon filing of an application under sub-section (2) for stay of the operation of the arbitral award, the court may, subject to such conditions as it may deem fit, grant stay of the operation of such award for reasons to be recorded in writing: provided that the court shall, while considering the application for grant of stay in the case of an arbitral award for payment of money, have due regard to the provisions for grant of stay of a money decree under the provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).\" [emphasis supplied] 27] it is therefore apparent that for the purpose of enforcement, no separate provisions are to be found in the arbitration act and for that purpose, the provisions of civil procedure code 1908 have to be followed as if the award was a decree of the court. comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 28] upon conjoint reading of the commercial courts act and the arbitration act, it is apparent that provisions of the civil procedure code in so far as they are not amended by the commercial courts act, will apply and more particularly they would apply for the enforcement of the award as if it was a decree of the court. legal fiction therefore is created by the statute and the award has to be enforced by following the provisions of the cpc relating to execution of decrees. 29] the last section under the arbitration act which is relevant is section 37. this section speaks about appealable orders. it reads as under:\"37. appealable orders.(1) an appeal shall lie from the following orders (and from no others) to the court authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the court passing the order, namely:(a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8; (b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9; (c ) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34. (2) an appeal shall also lie to a court from an order of the arbitral tribunal(a) accepting the plea referred to in subcomap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 section (2) or sub-section (3) of section 16; or (b) granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under section 17. (3) no second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or take away any right to appeal to the supreme court.\" section 37, therefore, lays down the orders against which appeals can be filed. it is relevant to notice here that no appeal has been provided against an order passed in execution proceedings. this will have to be kept in mind while interpreting the word \"decision\" which is found in section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. 30] in our view, since there is no separate provision of appeal against execution of an award passed in arbitration proceedings, the word \"decision\" will have to be interpreted accordingly. 31] before we consider the rival contentions, it will be necessary to briefly reiterate the law of precedent: the apex court in bank of india and anr. v. k. mohandas (2009) 5 scc 313 observed as follows: (scc pp. 335-36 paras 54-59) \"54. a word about precedents, before we deal with the aforesaid observations. the classic statement of earl of comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 halsbury, l.c. in quinn v. leathem [1901 ac 495 (hl)], is worth recapitulating first: (ac p. 506) '.before discussing . allen v. flood [1898 ac 1 : (1895-99) all er rep 52 (hl)and what was decided therein, there are two observations of a general character which i wish to make, and one is to repeat what i have very often said before, that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but are governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. the other is that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. i entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it. such a mode of reasoning assumes that the law is necessarily a logical code, whereas every lawyer must acknowledge that the law is not always logical at all.' this court has in long line of cases followed the aforesaid statement of law. 55. in state of orissa v. sudhansu sekhar misra [air 1968 sc 647] it was observed: (air p. 651, para 13) \"13. .a decision is only an authority for what it actually decides. what is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every observation found therein nor what logically follows from the various observations made in it.\" 56. in the words of lord denning: comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 \"each case depends on its own facts and a close similarity between one case and another is not enough because even a single significant detail may alter the entire aspect. in deciding such cases, one should avoid the temptation to decide cases (as said by cardozo) by matching the colour of one case against the colour of another. to decide, therefore, on which side of the line a case falls, the broad resemblance to another case is not at all decisive.\" 57. it was highlighted by this court in ambica quarry works v. state of gujarat: [(1987) 1 scc 213] (scc p. 221, para 18) \"18. .the ratio of any decision must be understood in the background of the facts of that case. it has been said long time ago that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides, and not what logically follows from it.\" 58. in bhavnagar university v. palitana sugar mill (p) ltd. [(2003) 2 scc 111] this court held that a little difference in facts or additional facts may make a lot of difference in the precedential value of a decision. 59. this court in bharat petroleum corporation ltd. v. n.r. vairamani [(2004) 8 scc 579] emphasised that the courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed. it was further observed that the judgments of courts are not to be construed as statutes and the observations must be read in the context in which they appear to have been stated. the court went on to say that circumstantial applicability, one additional or different fact may make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases.\" (emphasis in original) comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 the apex court in arasmeta captive power company pvt. ltd. vs. lafarge india pvt. ltd and another1, has observed on the question of law of precedent in paras 28, 31, 32, 33 35 and 36 as under:\"28. at this juncture, we think it condign to refer to certain authorities which lay down the principle for understanding the ratio decidendi of a judgment. such a deliberation, we are disposed to think, is necessary as we notice that contentions are raised that certain observations in some paragraphs in spb & company (supra) have been relied upon to build the edifice that latter judgments have not referred to them.\" \"31. in krishena kumar v. union of india and ors. (1990) 4 scc 207, the constitution bench, while dealing with the concept of ratio decidendi, has referred to caledonian railway co. v. walker's trustees [(1882) 7 app cas 259: 46 lt 826 (hl)] and quinn (supra) and the observations made by sir frederick pollock and thereafter proceeded to state as follows: \"the ratio decidendi is the underlying principle, namely, the general reasons or the general grounds upon which the decision is based on the test or abstract from the specific peculiarities of the particular case which gives rise to the decision. the ratio decidendi has to be ascertained by an analysis of the facts of the case and the process of reasoning involving 1 air 2014 sc 525 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 the major premise consisting of a preexisting rule of law, either statutory or judge-made, and a minor premise consisting of the material facts of the case under immediate consideration. if it is not clear, it is not the duty of the court to spell it out with difficulty in order to be bound by it. in the words of halsbury (4th edn., vol. 26, para 573)\" \"the concrete decision alone is binding between the parties to it but it is the abstract ratio decidendi, as ascertained on a consideration of the judgment in relation to the subject matter of the decision, which alone has the force of law and which when it is clear it is not part of a tribunal's duty to spell out with difficulty a ratio decidendi in order to bound by it, and it is always dangerous to take one or two observations out of a long judgment and treat them as if they gave the ratio decidendi of the case. if more reasons than one are given by a tribunal for its judgment, all are taken as forming the ratio decidendi. \" (emphasis added) \"32. in state of orissa v. mohd. illiyas (2006) 1 scc 275, it has been stated thus: \"12.according to the well-settled theory of precedents, every decision contains three basic postulates: (i) findings of material facts, direct and inferential. an inferential finding of facts is the inference which the comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 judge draws from the direct, or perceptible facts; (ii) statements of the principles of law applicable to the legal problems disclosed by the facts; and (iii) judgment based on the combined effect of the above. a decision is an authority for what it actually decides. what is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every observation found therein nor what logically flows from the various observations made in the judgment.\" \"33. in islamic academy of education v. state of karnataka (2003) 6 scc 697, the court has made the following observations: \"2. the ratio decidendi of a judgment has to be found out only on reading the entire judgment. in fact, the ratio of the judgment is what is set out in the judgment itself. the answer to the question would necessarily have to be read in the context of what is set out in the judgment and not in isolation. in case of any doubt as regards any observations, reasons and principles, the other part of the judgment has to be looked into. by reading a line here and there from the judgment, one cannot find out the entire ratio decidendi of the judgment.\" (underlining is by us) \"35. at this stage, we may also profitably refer to another principle which is of assistance to understand and appreciate the ratio decidendi of a judgment. the judgments rendered by a court are not to be read as statutes. in union of india v. amrit lal manchanda and anr. (2004) 3 scc comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 75, it has been stated that observations of courts are neither to be read as euclid's theorems nor as provisions of the statute and that too taken out of their context. the observations must be red in the context in which they appear to have been stated. to interpret words, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may become necessary for judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and not to define. judges interpret statutes, they do not interpret judgments. they interpret words of statutes; their words are not to be interpreted as statutes.\" \"36. in som mittal v. government of karnataka (2008) 3 scc 574, it has been observed that judgments are not to be construed as statutes. nor words or phrases in judgments to be interpreted like provisions of a statute. some words used in a judgment should be read and understood contextually and are not intended to be taken literally. many a time a judge uses a phrase or expression with the intention of emphasizing a point or accentuating a principle or even by way of a flourish of writing style. ratio decidendi of a judgment is not to be discerned from a stray word or phrase read in isolation.\" the apex court in zee telefilms ltd. and another vs. union of india and others1 has observed in paras 254, 255 & 256 as under:1 (2005) 4 scc 649 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 \"precedent 254. are we bound hands and feet by pradeep kumar biswas (2002) 5 scc 111? the answer to the question must be found in the law of precedent. a decision, it is trite, should not be read as a statute. a decision is an authority for the questions of law determined by it. such a question is determined having regard to the fact situation obtaining therein. while applying the ratio, the court may not pick out a word or a sentence from the judgment divorced from the context in which the said question arose for consideration. a judgment, as is well known, must be read in its entirety and the observations made therein should receive consideration in the light of the questions raised before it. (see punjab national bank v. r.l. vaid (2004) 7 scc 698). 255. although decisions are galore on this point, we may refer to a recent one in state of gujarat v. akhil gujarat pravasi v.s. mahamandal (2004) 5 scc 155 wherein this court held : (scc p. 172, para 19) \"it is trite that any observation made during the course of reasoning in a judgment should not be read divorced from the context in which it was used.\" 256. it is further well settled that a decision is not an authority for a proposition which did not fall for its consideration. it is also a trite law that a point not raised before a court would not be an authority on the said question. in aone granites v. state of u.p. (2001) 3 scc 537 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 it is stated as follows : (scc p. 543, para 11) \"11. this question was considered by the court of appeal in lancaster motor co. (london) ltd. v. bremith ltd. (1941) 1 kb 675 and it was laid down that when non consideration was given to the question, the decision cannot be said to be binding and precedents sub silentio and without arguments are of no moment\" [see also state of u.p. v. synthetics and chemicals ltd. (1991) 4 scc 139, arnit das v. state of bihar (2000) 5 scc 488 (scc para 20), bhavnagar university v. palitana sugar mills (p) ltd. (2003) 2 scc 111, cement corpn. of india ltd. v. purya (2004) 8 scc 270, bharat forge co. ltd. v. uttam manohar nakate (2005) 2 scc 489 and kalyan chandra sarkar v. rajesh ranjan (2005) 2 scc 42, see para 42.]\" the view of the apex court on the law of precedents has to be kept in mind while dealing with the judgments relied upon by all the parties. 32] we have now to consider the scope and ambit of an appeal which can be filed under section 13(1) out of the orders which are passed in execution proceedings of an award. 33] in this context, provisions of section 13 of the commercial courts act will have to be interpreted. perusal of the said section indicates that it can be divided in four parts viz heading, which speaks comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 about decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions. the heading is followed by sub-section (1), which speaks about an appeal from the date of judgment or order and it also lays down limitation viz 60 days from the date of the said judgment and order. the third part is the proviso. the proviso provides for an appeal from orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court and the said appeal is restricted to appeals which are enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. the fourth part is subsection (2) which starts with non-obstante clause and clarifies that no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act. if we dissect these four parts, it can be noticed that appeals are provided under sub-section (1) against any decision. in our view, since sub-section (1) has combined the right of appeal against decree or order, the word \"decision\" has been used and the proviso provides for orders which are appealable. the contention of mr. tulzapurkar, the learned senior counsel for the appellants, that the word \"decision\" also includes such orders, which have attained finality cannot be accepted. this can be gathered from the scheme of the commercial courts act and the objects and reasons. the act was passed for the purpose of speedy disposal of commercial disputes and to improve efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 34] the proviso to sub-section (1) therefore cannot be said to be an additional enactment provided for appeal against the orders but it restricts the orders against which appeals can be filed. in the present case, section 37 of the arbitration act has restricted the orders against which appeals can be filed. if interpretation which is sought to be given by the learned senior counsel mr. tulzapurkar appearing for the appellants, is to be accepted then it would not only be contrary to section 37 but would also be contrary to the provisions of the commercial courts act. it is a well settled principle of interpretation that while interpreting a particular provision, it is not open for the court to add or subtract anything from the said provision. it is therefore not possible to read something more in the word \"decision\" to mean that it also includes orders which are not otherwise appealable. sub-section (2) of section 2 of the commercial courts act enumerates that the words and expressions used and not defined in this act but defined in the code of civil procedure, 1908 and the evidence act 1872, shall have the same meaning assigned to them in that code and the act. the word \"judgment\" is defined in section 2(9) of the cpc. therefore, the said restricted meaning has to be assigned to the word \"judgment\" found in sub-section (1) of section 13 of the commercial courts act and it will not be possible to expand the meaning of the word \"judgment\" as has been done in the letters patent by virtue of the judgment of the supreme court in shah comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 babulal khimji1(supra) [paras 112, 1113]. the submission of mr. tulzapurkar, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants that the expanded meaning has to be given to the word \"judgment\" or \"decision\" therefore cannot be accepted. 35] in the context of the facts of the present case, it has to be noted that the award passed by the arbitral tribunal was confirmed right up to the supreme court and the matter was at the stage of execution. the orders which are passed in execution proceedings are appealable to the extent provided under section 37 of the arbitration act. an order passed on application under order xxi rule 103 is not appealable under the provisions of the commercial courts act arising out of execution of an award. 36] mr. tulzapurkar, the learned senior counsel for the appellants in comapl/5/2016, mr. milind sathe, the learned senior counsel for the appellant in comapl/6/2016 and mr. zal andhyarujina, the learned counsel appearing for the appellants in comap/4/2016 also laid emphasis on the words \"as if it were a decree\" which are found at various places in the cpc and particularly in order xxi. it has been contended that the present application has been filed under order xxi rules 98, 99, 100 and 101 and therefore as per the provisions of section 103, the order passed is appealable as a decree. number of judgments also have been cited by mr. tulzapurkar the learned senior 1 1981 sc 1786 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 counsel appearing for the appellants that where legal fiction is created, it must be taken to its logical conclusion. he submitted that since the provisions of order xxi are applicable to commercial courts act wherever words \"as if it were a decree\" are used in the cpc, it becomes an appealable decree. in our view, though the said argument appears to be very attractive at the first blush, on closer scrutiny, it reveals that the said submission is without any substance. for that purpose, it will be necessary to see section 21 of the commercial courts act which gives overriding effect to the provisions of the said act. therefore as long as this act does not provide for an appeal against such orders, these orders are not appealable. secondly, it has to be seen that following reliefs were sought in notice no.1786 of 2015 taken out by the appellant in execution application no.2006 of 2015 in arbitration award dated 4/8/2008. \"the mode in which the assistance of the court required: (1) by issuing notice under order xxi rule 22 of cpc, 1908, against the respondents to show cause, why the award dated 4th august, 2008 should not be executed against them; (2) after the said notice is made absolute by this hon'ble court, this hon'ble court may be pleased to issue a warrant of possession under order xxi, rule 35, against the comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 respondent no.10 to 16 in the arbitral proceedings in respect of the immovable property i.e. kamla cottage, situated at juhu tara road, juhu, mumbai 400049. (3) after the said notice is made absolute by this hon'ble court, this hon'ble court may be pleased to issue a warrant of possession under order xxi, rule 35, against the kanpur group (respondent nos. 1 to 9) in the arbitral proceedings) in respect of the following immoveable properties: (i) property at 37, kanpur known as kamla retreat valued at rs. 9.62 crores. (ii) property at 80/80 kanpur known as oil mills land valued at rs 7.90 crores and rs 0.30 crores. (iii) property at 20/131, patkapur, kanpur valued at rs 0.33 crores. (4) with regard to the properties / assets of the respondent nos. 10 to 16 which are within the jurisdiction of this hon'ble court, this hon'ble court may be pleased to grant liberty to the petitioner to seek warrants of attachment and sale, accordingly; (5) in the alternative and/or in addition to the aforesaid, this hon'ble court may be pleased to issue a certificate of nonsatisfaction of the award, and to transfer the award under section 39 of the code of civil procedure read with rules 5 and 6 of order comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 21 cpc and also read with section 151 of the cpc for execution to the court within whose jurisdiction the respondents' assets are situated.\" appellants are admittedly parties to the award which has become final. it is not now open for the appellants to raise their obstruction and again challenge the execution of the award. 37] the contention of mr. tulzapurkar, the learned senior counsel for the appellants, and others that provisions of order xxi rule 103 will apply is also without any merit. it is clarified however that, in the present case, since execution proceedings are in the nature of enforcement of an award to which the appellants are parties, they now cannot contend that wherever the words \"as if it were a decree\" are used in order xxi, the same is a decree and not an order. all the judgments on which reliance has been placed by mr. tulzapurkar, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants and others therefore will have no application to the facts of the present case. 38] mr. madon, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents has in support of his submissions relied on the judgment of the apex court in jet airways (india) limited.1 (supra). division bench of this court in para 15 of the said judgment 1 2011 sc online bom 1379 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 formulated three issues. para 15 of the said judgment reads as under:\"a. whether the proceedings under section 36 of the 1996 act are proceedings under the code of civil procedure, 1908? b. whether the provisions of clause 15 of the letters patent are applicable to the impugned judgment and order and whether applicability of clause 15 has been impliedly excluded by section 37 of the 1996 act or by the amendment of section 2(2), 47 by act 104 of 1976 amending the code? c. whether the judgment of the supreme court in the case of fuerst day lawson (supra) is an authority which is applicable only in respect of a foreign award covered by part ii of the 1996 act or whether the ratio of the said judgment is a binding precedent even in respect of proceedings under part i of the 1996 act or the same is obiter dicta?\" brief facts in the said case are that both the appeals were filed, challenging the judgment and order dated 04/05/2011 passed by the learned single judge in execution application no.161 of 2009 with chamber summons nos. 551/09, 729/09, 603/10 & 477/11 and notice no.734 of 2009 in arbitration award dated 12/04/2007. it is comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 not necessary to further go into the facts of the said case. it is sufficient to point out that the appeals were arising out of the order passed in execution proceedings of award dated 12/04/2007. while considering the question-a viz. \"whether the proceedings under section 36 of the 1996 act are proceedings under the code of civil procedure, 1908?\", after taking into consideration various provisions of the act and relying on the judgment of the supreme court in paramjeet singh patheja1 (supra), division bench of this court came to the conclusion that the proceedings initiated by the appellants and the respondents before the learned single judge were the proceedings under section 36 of the 1996 act and could not be held to be the proceedings of execution under section 47 or order xxi of the cpc. while coming to the said conclusion, the words used in section 36 of the said act viz. \"the award shall be enforced under the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) in the same manner as if it were a decree of a court\" were interpreted and reliance was placed on the judgment of the supreme court in paramjeet singh patheja2 (supra) and relying on the observations made in the said judgment and upon independent consideration of provisions of 1940 act and 1996 act, division bench came to the conclusion that proceedings under section 36 are not the proceedings under the code of civil procedure. it further observed that the letters patent appeal would 1 (2006) 13 scc 322 2 (2006) 13 scc 322 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 not be maintainable in respect of orders passed under section 36 of the arbitration act. on the second issue regarding implied exclusion of applicability of letters patent, division bench, after relying on judgment in (a) union of india vs. mohindra supply company 1, (b) state of west bengal vs. gauranglal chatterjee2, (c) iti ltd. vs. siemens public communications network ltd.3 (d) union of india vs. popular construction company4, (e) union of india vs. aradhana trading co. 5 (f) municipal corporation of greater bombay vs. patel engineering company limited,6 had held that clause 15 of the letters patent was impliedly excluded by 1996 act. while dealing with the issue of implied exclusion by the code of civil procedure, after taking into consideration various judgments of the apex court and this court, division bench held that the proceedings under section 36 of 1996 act are not the proceedings under the code and therefore the second issue had become academic. lastly, the division bench considered the ratio of the judgment in furest day lawson vs. jindal exports limited 7. in the said case, the question which fell for consideration before the apex court was 1 1961 scr 497 = air 1962 sc 256 2 (1993) 3 scc 1 3 (2002) 5 scc 510 4 (2001) 8 scc 470 5 (2002) 4 scc 447 6 1994 (3) bom. c.r. 139 7 (2011) 8 scc 333 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 regarding maintainability of the letters patent under clause 15 of the calcutta high court which is in pari materia with that of the bombay high court. in the said case, question before the supreme court was, whether an order, though not appealable under section 50 of 1996 act, would nevertheless be subject to appeal under the relevant provisions of the letters patent of the high court. section 50 deals with part ii of the arbitration act viz execution and enforcement of the international award. the apex court in the said case came to the conclusion that there was an exclusion of letters patent appeal. division bench relied on the conclusion drawn by the apex court in furest day lawson1 (supra). 39] mr. madon, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the the respondents further relied on the judgment of the apex court in paramjeet singh patheja2 (supra). in the said case, brief facts were that the appellant was a judgment-debtor and an award was passed against him on 26/06/2000 by the arbitrator. on 16/01/2002, an insolvency notice was issued under section 9(2) of the presidency towns insolvency act, 1909 on the basis of the arbitration award. section 9(2) provides that a debtor commits an act of insolvency if a creditor who has obtained a \"decree or order\" against him for the payment of money issues him a notice in the prescribed form to pay the amount and the debtor fails to do so within the time specified in 1 (2011) 8 scc 333 2 (2006) 13 scc 322 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 the notice. the appellant filed notice of motion in the high court challenging the said notice inter alia on the ground that the award is neither a decree nor an order for the purposes of provisions of the insolvency act and that no notice could be issued under section 9(2) on the basis of the award. division bench of the bombay high court held that the award is a decree for the purposes of section 9 of the insolvency act and that insolvency notice may therefore be issued on the basis of the award passed by the arbitrator. against the said order, appeal was filed in the supreme court. in this context the supreme court framed the following questions of law in para 12 of its judgment in paramjeet singh patheja1 (supra), which reads as under:\"12. the substantial questions of law of paramount importance to be decided by this court are : (i) whether an arbitration award is a \"decree\" for the purpose of section 9 of the presidency towns insolvency act, 1909? (ii) whether an insolvency notice can be issued under section 9(2) of the presidency towns insolvency act, 1909 on the basis of an arbitration award?\" the apex court, after examining the provisions of the presidency towns insolvency act, 1909, arbitration act, 1899 and the civil procedure code, 1908 and various judgments firstly came to the 1 (2006) 13 scc 322 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 conclusion that the award passed under the arbitration act was not a decree and, secondly, it held that the insolvency notice could not be issued under section 9(2) of the presidency towns insolvency act, 1909 on the basis of arbitration award. 40] mr. madon, the learned senior counsel, relying on the aforesaid judgment therefore submitted that it is a settled position in law that proceedings under section 36 of the arbitration act are not the proceedings under the civil procedure code, 1908 and, secondly, that the provisions of letters patent are not applicable and, thirdly, that commercial courts act expressly excluded applicability of letters patent act under sub-section (2) of section 13. this submission was sought to be repelled by the learned senior counsel for the appellants with others on various grounds which are already reproduced hereinabove. however, in brief, their objections were that (a) firstly, the said judgment has been passed prior to coming into force of the commercial courts act, (b) secondly, the said judgment does not consider whether for the purpose of execution of award provisions of cpc are applicable, (c) thirdly, the words which are used in section 36 viz \"as if it were a decree of the court\" created a legal fiction and it has to be taken to its logical conclusion and (d) lastly, the judgment relied in the case of paramjeet singh patheja1 (supra), the apex court has held that an award is not a decree in the context of issuance of notice under section 9(2) of the presidency towns insolvency act, 1 (2006) 13 scc 322 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 1909. 41] division bench of this court in jet airways (india) limited.1 (supra), after relying on the judgment of paramjeet singh patheja2 (supra), in our view, correctly held that the provisions of civil procedure code, 1908 and the letters patent have been impliedly excluded by virtue of sections 36 and 37 of the arbitration act. while doing so, it has examined the said issue from all angles. though it is true that one of the issues which fell for consideration before the apex court in patheja's case was, whether an award is a decree within the meaning of section 9(2) of the presidency towns insolvency act, 1909 and it held that the award is not a decree. it also considered the meaning which is to be attributed to the words \"as if\" and held that the legal fiction must be limited for the purpose for which it is created and therefore the observation made by the apex court in the said judgment also will have to be taken into consideration and more particularly, the observation made in paras 42 and 43 would be relevant which read as under:\"42 the words \"as if\" demonstrate that award and decree or order are two different things. the legal fiction created is for the limited purpose of enforcement as a decree. the fiction is not intended to make it a decree for all purposes under all 1 2011 sc online bom 1379 2 (2006) 13 scc 322 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 statutes, whether state or central.\" \"43 for the foregoing discussion we hold : (i) . (ii). (iii). (iv). (v) a legal fiction ought not to be extended beyond its legitimate field. as such, an award rendered under the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 cannot be construed to be a \"decree\" for the purpose of section 9(2) of the insolvency act. (vi) (vii) it is a well established rule that a provision must be construed in a manner which would give effect to its purpose and to cure the mischief in the light of which it was enacted. the object of section 22, in protecting guarantors from legal proceedings pending a reference to bifr of the principal debtor, is to ensure that a scheme for rehabilitation would not be defeated by isolated proceedings adopted against the guarantors of a sick company. to achieve that purpose, it is imperative that the expression \"suit\" in section 22 be given its plain meaning, namely, any proceedings adopted for realisation of a right vested in a party by law. this would comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 clearly include arbitration proceedings.\" 42] we are therefore of the view that the words which are used in section 36 of the act, particularly the words \"as if it were a decree of the court\" do not mean that wherever appeals are provided under order xxi against the orders passed in execution, those appeals would also be maintainable under the arbitration act or under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. when 1996 act was passed and thereafter commercial courts act was passed, law makers were conscious of what \"decree\" or \"order\" and \"award\" are. they were also aware of fundamental difference between the courts and arbitrators as far back as in 1909 when the cpc was enacted. it will therefore be not possible to interpret the word \"decision\" to mean a decree and an order which has attained finality. if legislature intended to make an order passed in execution which has attained finality as appealable, it would have done so by providing a proviso that against such an order passed in execution proceedings which attained finality of rights between the parties, appeal would be maintainable. this court therefore cannot add or subtract something which was not intended by the legislature. it is further well settled that an appeal is a creation of statute and if no appeal is provided, party does not get a right to file an appeal and no vested right is created in him to file an appeal. the legislature having expressly and impliedly excluded that right, it will not be open for this court to hold comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 that the word \"decision\" includes not only a decree but also orders which have attained finality. it has to be remembered that the commercial courts act was passed for the purpose of quick disposal of commercial disputes. if the word \"decision\" therefore is interpreted to mean that orders which have attained finality also are appealable, the very purpose for which the act was passed would be rendered nugatory, otiose and ineffective. 43] at this stage, it will also be relevant to take into consideration the law commission's report. while dealing with the question of \"appeals\", recommendations of the law commission were thus:\"(iv) appeals 3.23.1 the bill presently provides for a direct appeal to the supreme court. this is proposed to be replaced with a provision, which mandates that there will be no appeals from orders of the commercial division or the commercial court save under order xliii of the cpc and from final judgments of the commercial division or commercial court. such appeals will only be to the jurisdictional commercial appellate division. 3.23.2 it is further recommended that notwithstanding any other law, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against an interlocutory order of the commercial court, including an order comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 on a jurisdictional challenge. the purpose here is to prevent the time frames stipulated for case management hearing from becoming redundant by the frequent filing of civil revision applications and petitions against every interlocutory order. by removing a potential source of bottleneck of cases, the bill hopes to ensure the expedited disposal of cases. 3.23.3 moreover, no appeals will be permitted from a finding of the commercial court or commercial division that the dispute in question is a commercial dispute inasmuch as there is no real prejudice caused to the parties when the commercial court or commercial division finds that the dispute is a commercial dispute. (v) additional provisions a. arbitration 3.24.1 the law commission, in its 246th report on the \"amendments to the arbitration and conciliation act\" has recommended changes to the a & c act to inter alia, reduce the intervention of the court in arbitration proceedings.1 3.24.2 the 246th report of the commission has recommended an amendment to definition of \"court\" in section 2(e) of the a&c act, 1996 to mean \"high court\" in the context of all 1 law commission of india, amendments to the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, report no.246 (2014) comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 international commercial arbitrations, irrespective of value. keeping the suggestions and the amendments proposed in that report, we make the following suggestions with respect to arbitrations that involve commercial disputes. 3.24.3 first, it is recommended that in case of an international commercial arbitration concerning a commercial dispute of more than rupees one crore, any application or appeal arising out of such arbitration under the a&c act, that has been filed in a high court will be heard by the commercial division of the high court, where such commercial division has been constituted in the high court. in the absence of the commercial division, applications or appeals concerning such international commercial arbitrations will be heard by the regular bench of the high court. 3.24.4 second, in the case of domestic arbitrations concerning a commercial dispute of more than rupees one crore, applications or appeals may lie either to the high court or a civil court (not being a high court) depending upon the pecuniary jurisdiction. it is recommended that all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitrations under the a&c act, that have been filed on the original side of the high court shall be heard by the commercial division of the high court where such commercial division is constituted in the high court. however, in the absence of a comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 commercial division being constituted, the regular bench of the high court will hear such applications or appeals arising out of domestic arbitration. if the application or appeal in such domestic arbitration is not within the jurisdiction of the high court and would ordinarily lie before a civil court (not being a high court) and there is a commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction in respect of such arbitration, then such application or appeal shall be filed in and heard by such commercial court. 3.24.5 third, it is recommended that all appeals under the a&c in relation to arbitration cases concerning a commercial dispute of more than rupees one crore preferred against an order of the commercial division or commercial court, shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial appellate division, where a commercial appellate division has been constituted in the jurisdictional high court.\" however, when the final act was passed, it is apparent that the exclusion of the provisions of the letters patent are to be found in subsection (2). the said sub-section (2) also starts with a non-obstante clause notwithstanding anything contained in any other law meaning thereby either cpc, arbitration act or the letters patent or any other law, no appeal would lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or a commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act. comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 44] apart from reasons which we have given hereinabove, and in addition to that while deciding the question as to whether \"decision\" includes \"judgment\" and \"decree\", it will have to be considered whether the word \"decision\" has to be used in narrow sense or in a broad sense i.e. whether the word \"decision\" will have to be read only as a \"decree\" or wider meaning has to be given viz that of \"decree\", \"judgment\" and \"order\" which conclusively decides rights of the parties. though the letters patent act is not applicable as it has been expressly excluded under sub-section (2), it will be necessary to briefly see how the word \"judgment\" has been interpreted by the apex court. the word \"judgment\" is narrowly treated under section 2 of the cpc. when the said question came up for consideration before the supreme court in shah babulal khimji (supra), the supreme court in paras 112 and 113 of its judgment gave a wider meaning and held that those orders which conclusively decide right of parties could be held to be appealable under the letters patent appeal, though the word \"judgment\" is narrowly construed in the cpc. the apex court in shah babulal khimji (supra) did not give narrow meaning to the said word \"judgment\" and, therefore, held that the orders which conclusively decide right of parties, even if they are not appealable under section 104 or order xliii, an appeal would lie under the letters patent. 45] the vexed question is whether similar meaning should be given comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 to the word 'decision' as is found in sub-section (1) of section 13. 46] the question which fell for consideration before the apex court in tirumalachetti rajaram vs. tirumalachetti radhakrishnayya chetty and others1, was as under:\"if the appellate decree passed by the high court makes a variation in the decision of the trial court under appeal in favour of a party who intends to prefer an appeal against the said appellate decree, can the said decree be said to affirm the decision of the trial court or not under article 133(1) of the constitution?\" while deciding the said question, the apex court also considered the question as to what is the denotation of the word \"decision\". in para 7 of the said judgment, the apex court has observed as under:\"7. the next question to consider is : what is the denotation of the word \"decision\" used in the said clause. the argument for the respondent is that the word \"decision\" does not mean the whole of the decision but the decision on that part of the controversy between the parties which is brought to this court in appeal. in support of the argument that the decision does not mean the entire decision of the trial court reliance is placed on the provisions of o. 20, rules 4 and 5. rule 4 of o. 20 deals with the judgments of small cause courts and judgments of other courts, and it provides that the judgments falling 1 (1962) 2 scr 452 : air 1961 sc 1795 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 under the first clause need not contain more than the points for determination and decision thereon, whereas the judgments falling under the latter class should contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision thereon and the reasons for such decision. there is not doubt that the decision in the context means the decision on the points for determination. that of course is the meaning of the word \"decision\", but whether or not the word \"decision\" means the decision on one point or the decision of whole suit comprising of all the points in dispute between the parties must inevitably depend upon the context, and the context is plainly inconsistent with the argument that the decision should mean the decision on a specific point. if the word \"decree\" in the first part of the relevant clause means not a part of the decree but the whole of the decree then it would be reasonable to hold that the word \"decision\" must likewise mean the entire decision of the trial court and not a part of it.\" similarly in para 9 of the said judgment, the apex court has observed as under:\"9. the question as to the meaning of the word \"decision\" in the corresponding provision of the code of 1882 (s. 596) was considered by the privy council in rajah tasadduq rasul khan v. manik chand [(190203) 30 ia 35]. the question which arose for the decision of the privy council was whether the appellate decree in that case was one of affirmance or not. the appellate decree had confirmed the trial court's decision though on different grounds, and so it was urged that the appellate decree was not one of comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 affirmance. in rejecting this argument the privy council stated that \"the natural, obvious and prima facie meaning of the word \"decision\" is decision of the suit by the court, and that that meaning should be given to it in the section\" (s. 596). the privy council examined the definition of the word \"judgment\" in the code of 1882 and came to the conclusion that the word \"decision\" meant the decision of the suit by the trial court and not the grounds stated in support of the said decision; in the result it was held that the appellate decree which confirmed the decision of the trial court though on different grounds was in law a decree of affirmance. it would thus be seen that this decision undoubtedly supports the conclusion that the word \"decision\" in art. 133(1) should mean not a part of the decision or the grounds given for it but the decision of the suit as a whole; and if that be so, the clause could be harmoniously construed to mean that in determining the character of the appellate decree we have to look at the appellate decree as a whole, compare it with the decision of the trial court as a whole and decide whether the appellate decree is one of affirmance or not. in this enquiry the nature of the variation made whether it is in favour of the intending appellant or otherwise would not be relevant.\" from the aforesaid judgment it is apparent that the word \"decision\" would mean the entire decision of the trial court and not part of it. secondly, in raja tassaduq rashul khan and another vs. manik comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 chand1, privy council, while considering the definition of the word \"decision\" has observed as under:\"now there is no definition of the word 'decision' in the civil procedure code, but there is a definition of the word 'decree'. it says 'decree' means the formal expression of a adjudication upon any right claimed or defence set up in a civil court when such adjudication, so far as regards the court expressing it, decides th suit or appeal. then, \"judgment\" is defined as meaning \"the statement given by the judge of the grounds of a decree or order.\" therefore their lordships have two things: they have a decree which decides the suit, and they have the word \"judgment,\" meaning the statement of the grounds upon which the learned judge or the court proceeds to make the decree. mr. degruther appears to wish to give the word \"decision\" the same meaning as the word \"judgment\" and he says that it is necessary that the appellate court should not only affirm the decree made by the court below but should also affirm the grounds of fact upon which that judgment was passed. their lordships cannot come to that conclusion. they think that the natural, obvious, and prima facie meaning of the word \"decision\" is decision of the suit by the court, and that that meaning should be given to it in the section.\" 1 voll vii the calcutta weekly notes 177 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 similarly, the apex court in diamond sugar mills ltd. & anr. vs. state of uttar pradesh and anr.1, has considered the meaning of the term \"decision\" and in para 28 it has observed as under:\"28. it is true that when words and phrases previously interpreted by the courts are used by the legislature in later enactment replacing the previous statute, there is a presumption that the legislature intended to convey by their use the same meaning which the courts had already given to them. this presumption can however only be used as an aid to the interpretation of the later statute and should not be considered to be conclusive. as mr. justice frankfurter observed in federal com. commission v. columbia b. system [311 us p. 302] when considering this doctrine, the persuasion that lies behind the doctrine is merely one factor in the total effort to give fair meaning to language. the presumption will be strong where the words of the previous statute have received a settled meaning by a series of decisions in the different courts of the country; and particularly strong when such interpretation has been made or affirmed by the highest court in the land. we think it reasonable to say however that the presumption will naturally be much weaker when the interpretation was given in one solitary case and was not tested in appeal. after giving careful consideration to the view taken by the learned judge of the allahabad high court in emperor v. munnalal [ilr 1942 p. 302] about the meaning of the words \"local area\" and proper 1 air 1961 sc 652 : (1961) 3 scr 242 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 weight to the rule of interpretation mentioned above, we are of the opinion that the constitution-makers did not use the words \"local area\" in the meaning which the learned judge attached to it. we are of opinion that the proper meaning to be attached to the words \"local area\" in entry 52 of the constitution, (when the area is a part of the state imposing the law) is an area administered by a local body like a municipality, a district board, a local board, a union board, a panchayat or the like. the premises of a factory is therefore not a \"local area\".\" 47] from the above decisions it can be seen that the words and phrases previously interpreted by the courts have to be used in aid to interpretation of later statute. the word \"decision\" therefore in this context would mean a final decision in the entire suit and therefore a decree. 48] mr. tulzapurkar, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has relied upon the definition of the word \"decision\" given in black's law dictionary (9th edition) and has contended that \"decision\" would include an order which finally determines rights of the parties. it is well settled that definition given by a dictionary cannot override the interpretation made by the court in the context of its meaning as used in the statute and therefore the said submission is unacceptable. it is a settled position in law that dictionary is a comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 secondary and external aid to interpretation of statute and cannot be relied upon when a direct meaning/definition has been in use in law and/or defined specifically in a statute. it has to be noted here that the term \"decision\" was a part of the code of civil procedure 1882 (section 596) which was later incorporated in section 110 of the cpc which is now deleted and is also used in article 133 of the constitution of india. from the judgments referred to hereinabove, it is clear that it has been consistently held that the term \"decision\" appearing in thee provisions means decision of the suit. the definition of \"decision\" and \"judgment\" in black's law dictionary is therefore contrary to the settled law in india. 49] mr. andhyarujina the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the term \"decision\" has to be given a wide import and it includes \"decree\", \"judgment or order\". he relied upon the judgment of the high court of himachal pradesh in balanand & anr. vs. devkinand & ors1 (paras 5 and 6) and the judgment of high court of delhi in ratan & co. vs. asst. registrar of trademarks2 (para 24). the said submission cannot be accepted since in para 5 of the said judgment in balanand (supra) it has been held that the word 1 air 1963 hp 30 2 air 1977 delhi 93 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 \"decision\" would not by itself amount to a judgment or order and from para 6 of the said judgment it can be seen that the high court of himachal pradesh was of the view that a \"decision\" was when the suit was disposed of on merits. secondly, the decsion in ratan & co. (supra) does not take into consideration the provisions of section 110 of the code of civil procedure, 1908, the provisions of article 133(1) of the constitution of india, the provisions of section 596 of the code of civil procedure, 1882 and the judicial pronouncements of the privy council and the supreme court. therefore the submissions made by the learned senior counsel mr. tulzapurkar and mr milind sathe and the leanred counsel mr. andhyarujina appearing on behalf of the appellants are without any substance and \"decision\" therefore being a final decision of the suit is a decree and not an order passed in execution proceedings. 50] mr. tulzapurkar, the learned senior counsel for the appellants relied on various judgments of the apex court regarding the meaning which was to be given to proviso to section 13(1). he relied upon the following judgments:[1] the state of orissa vs. debaki debi and ors1 [2] commissioner of stamp duties vs. alan 1 1964 sc 1413 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 cavave atwill and ors.1 (pages 330, 331 and 332) [3] madhu gopal vs. vi additional district judge and ors2 (para 7) [4] swedish match ab and anr. vs. securities and exchange board of india & anr.3 (paras 65 & 66) there cannot be any dispute regarding the ratio of the judgments of the privy council and supreme court. the apex court in swedish match ab (supra) has in para 43 held that the proviso may serve four different purposes, namely : (1) qualifying or excepting certain provisions from the main enactment; (2) it may entirely change the very concept of the intendment of the enactment by insisting on certain mandatory conditons to be fulfilled in order to make the enactment workable; (3) it may be so embedded in the act itself as to become an integral part of the enactment and thus acquire the tenor and colour of the substantive enactment itself; and (4) it may be used merely to act as an optional addenda to the enactment with the sole object of 1 1973 (2) wlr 327 2 air 1989 scc 155 3 (2004) 11 scc 641 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 explaining the real intendment of the statutory provisions. 51] in the present case, the said provision if read as a whole and a plain and grammatical meaning of the said provision is taken into consideration, it can be seen that the proviso has been used to carve out an exception to the general rule that an appeal would lie against the decree and only against those orders which are specifically enumerated in the proviso. 52] mr. tulzapurkar, the learned senior counsel for the appellants then relied on the following judgments on how the heading of the section can be used in aid of constructing or interpreting the section. [1] oulater hall & co. ltd vs. board of trade1 (pages 832 to 833) [2] inglis vs. robertson and baxter2 ( page 630) [3] bhinka and ors vs. charan singh3 (page 966, para 15) [3] raichurmatham prabhakar and anr. vs. rawatmal dugar4 (page 775, para 14) 1 (1961) 3 w.l.r. 825 2 1898 ac 616 3 air 1959 sc 960 4 2004(4) scc 766 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 53] from the conspectus of the cases on which reliance has been placed by the learned senior counsel for the appellants, it can be seen that the courts have held that (i) heading to the section has to be read in conjunction with the main provision and make the two consistent if possible, (ii) headings are not mere marginal notes, but the sections in the group to which they belong must be read in connection with the headings and interpreted by the light of them, (iv) headings are in the nature of preamble to the section, (v) the headings prefixed to sections or sets of sections in some modern statutes are regarded as preambles to those sections. they cannot control the plain words of the statute but they may explain ambiguous words, (iv) if there is any doubt in the interpretation of words in the section, heading certainly help us to resolve the doubt, (v) headings of the title of the section plays a limited role in the construction of statutes. they may be taken as very broad and general indicators of the nature of the subject matter dealt with thereunder. 54] from the ratio of the aforesaid judgments, in our view, it is apparent that heading of the section 13 deals with appeals from decrees and the proviso to section 13 (1) carves out an exception in respect of the orders which are specifically enumerated in section 37 of the arbitration act, against which appeal can be filed. the word \"decision\" therefore will have to be interpreted to mean a decree. comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 55] the next question which has been argued by the learned counsels appearing for the appellants is regarding definition of the word \"judgment\". all the learned counsels for the appellants have submitted that the word \"judgment\" has to be given a wider meaning as laid down in radhy shyam vs. shyam behari singh1 (para 7) and in shah babulal khimji vs. jayaben d. kania and anr. 2 (paras 112 and 113). in our view, reference to these judgments is misconceived. firstly, the question which fell for consideration before the supreme court in radhy shyam (supra) was : whether the order passed under order xxi rule 90 is a \"judgment\" and in that context the apex court held that letters patent appeal lay against the order of the learned single judge. similar view was taken by the apex court in shah babulal khimji (supra) in which the apex court observed that the word \"judgment\" in sub-section (9) of section 2 of the cpc, 1908 has to be given a narrow meaning whereas the word \"judgment\" used in clause 15 of the letters patent has to be interpreted widely. in our view, both these judgments will not be of any assistance to the appellants since in the said cases the word \"judgment\" was interpreted in the context of the word \"judgment\" used in cpc and the word \"judgment\" used in the letters patent. in the present case, in subsection (2) of section 13 the words \"letters patent appeal\" have been expressly excluded and as such the word \"judgment\" which is occurring in sub-section (1) of section 13 cannot be given a wider 1 air 1971 sc 2337 2 air 1981 sc 1786 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 meaning. 56] mr. tulzapurkar, the learned senior counsel for the appellants also submitted that it is a well-known principle of interpretation of statute that the construction should not be put upon the statutory provision which would lead to manifest absurdity or futility, palpable injustice, or absurd inconvenience or anomaly. he submitted that when a statute enacts that something shall be deemed to have been done, which in fact and truth was not done, the court is entitled and bound to ascertain for what purpose and between what persons the statutory fiction is to be resorted and full effect must be given to the statutory fiction and it should be carried to its logical conclusion. he relied on the following judgments:[1] state of bombay vs. pandurang vinayak and others1 (para 5) [2] american home products corporation vs. mac laboratories ltd and anr.2 (paras 56, 57 and 66) in the light of the said judgments, he contended that since section 36 in terms state that an award has to be executed as if it is a decree and wherever the words \"as if it were a decree\" are occurring in order xxi, 1 air 1953 sc 244 2 air 1986 sc 137 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 it has to be treated as a decree and therefore it would be appealable as a decree under section 13(1). it was contended that the present order is in the nature of order under order xxi rule 103 which even otherwise states that appeal is provided. in our view ratio of the judgments on which reliance is placed are not applicable to the facts of the present case. the apex court in paramjeet singh patheja vs. icds ltd1, in paras 42 and 43 has clearly observed that section 36 of the arbitration act has created a very limited legal fiction for the purpose of enforcement of the abritral awards under the cpc in the same manner as if it was a decree of the court. it is well settled that even if there is a legal fiction, the same cannot be widened for any purpose which is outside its avowed purpose. it cannot be widened to include a right of appeal since no appeal is provided under section 37 of the arbitration act. it is also equally well settled that the fiction intended by the legislature must be restricted to the plain term of the statute and it cannot be used to travel beyond the term of the statute. reliance can be placed on the following decisions in state of travancore-cochin & ors. vs. shanmughah vilas cashwnut factory 2 (paras 36, 37 and 40) and in commissioner of income tax, bombay vs. shakuntala (para 8). 57] so far as submissions of the learned senior counsel mr. milind sathe are concerned, he submitted that in the bill, words \"and from 1 (2006) 13 scc 322 2 air 1953 sc 333 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 no other orders\" were present whereas they were omitted from the text of section 13 of the said act. the said submission is without any substance since perusal of the said section clearly discloses that the said words have been incorporated in sub-section (2) of section 13 of the commercial courts act which read as under:\"13(2) . , no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\" he then, submitted that section 37 of the arbitration act and order xliii of the cpc only provided for appeals from orders that have not attained finality. this submission is without any substance since section 37(1)(c ) and section 37(2)(a) provided for appeals from orders that finally dispose of the arbitration proceedings. 58] so far as the submissions of the learned counsel mr. andhyarujina are concerned, he submitted that section 13 of the commercial courts act created a new hierarchy of appeals. he submitted that by virtue of the proviso, even appeals under section 37(2) of the arbitration act would lie to the commercial appellate division. this submission is repelled by the learned senior counsel mr. madon appearing on behalf of the respondents. we agree with the comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 submission made by the learned senior counsel mr. madon. the proviso clearly states that \"appeals shall lie from all such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 as amended by this act and sections 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. the orders passed under section 37(2) of the arbitration act are not orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court and therefore no appeal shall lie from them to the commercial appellate division under the proviso to section 13. if the said submission is accepted then provisions of section 37(3) would be rendered otiose since it makes it clear that no second appeal shall lie from the order passed in appeal under section 37 of the arbitration act. moreover, there is no provision of appeal from order passed in execution proceedings under section 37 of the arbitration act. 59] mr. andhyarujina further submitted that section 37(3) of the arbitration act has not been incorporated into the body of section 13 of the commercial courts act. this submission is fallicious since section 13 includes the entire section 37 in the proviso and not merely any part thereof. so far as the judgment on which reliance is placed by the learned counsel mr. andhyarujina is concerned viz. shin-etsu chemical company limited vs. vindhya telelinks limited 1, in our view, it will not be applicable to the facts of the present case and therefore cannot be of any assistance to the appellants. 1 2009 sc 3284 comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 60] we do not wish to go into the question raised by both the parties regarding nature of the order passed by the learned single judge on the application under order xxi rule 22. according to the learned senior counsel mr. madon for the respondents the said order is passed under section 47 which has been excluded from the definition of \"decree' in cpc and therefore is not appealable, whereas according to the learned senior counsel mr. tulzapurkar and two other counsels the said order has been passed not under section 47 but under order xxi rules 97, 98, 99, 101 and 103 and therefore the said order is appealable. reliance has been placed by the learned senior counsel for the appelalnts on judgments in support of the said submission. we, however, do not propose to go into the said question for the reasons stated hereinabove and, secondly, because in our view the orders passed in execution proceedings of award are not appealable under section 37 and therefore it is not necessary to go into the said question. 61] it has to be noted that the question which falls for consideration before this court is :whether, in an application for execution of an award passed under the arbitration act, 1996, an oder passed by the learned single judge is appealable under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act as if it is a decree? and we are called upon to decide the said question only. comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 62] we therefore answer the questions framed in para 19 above as under:questions answers [1] whether, in an application for execution of an award passed under the arbitration act, no 1996, an order passed by the learned single judge is appealable under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act as if it is a decree? [2] whether the word \"decision\" means a yes decree? [3] whether a decision in the form of an order is appealable only under the conditions yes given in proviso to section 13(1) viz. that the order/decision is appealable only on the grounds mentioned in section 37 or section 104 or order xliii of the cpc? [4] whether the word \"decision\" which is found in section 13(1) of the commercial no courts act includes a \"decree\" or an \"order\" which has the effect of having finality or final adjudication of rights of parties? [5] whether, the heading to section 13 of the commercial courts act governs section yes comap/4/2016 comapl/5/2016 comapl/6/2016 13(1) i.e. whether the word \"decision\" is to be taken as a \"decree\" on account of the heading of the section? [6] whether ratio of the judgment in jet airways (india) ltd. (supra) is applicable to yes the facts of the present case and is a binding precedent with reference to the facts arising in the present case? [7] whether ratio of the judgment in the case of paramjeet singh patheja (supra) which yes has been relied upon in the case of jet airways (india) ltd. (supra) is applicable to the facts of the present case? conclusion: 63] for the reasons stated above, all the appeals are dismissed as they are not maintainable. (mrs swapna s. joshi, j.)
