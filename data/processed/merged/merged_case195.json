Mathur, with       Mr. Punit Singhvi, for the respondent.\n\n      BY THE COURT: (Per Hon'ble Sharma, J.)\nREPORTABLE By this Miscellaneous appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereafter `the Act of 1996') a challenge has been laid to the judgment dated 25-2-2017 passed by the Commercial Court dismissing the appellant AVVNL's (hereafter `AVVNL') objections under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 to the award dated 25-8-2007 passed by the sole Arbitrator appointed by the Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission Jaipur (hereafter `the Commission') vide order dated 12-2-2007 purporting to exercise its power under Section 4, 94, and 158 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (hereafter `the Act of 2003') read with clause 30 of the Rajasthan Electricity Commission terms and Conditions of (open access) Regulations, 2004 (hereafter `Regulations of 2004').\nThe necessary facts relevant to adjudication of the appeal are that the respondent Hindustan Zinc Limited (hereafter `HZL') has four high tension Electricity Connections for its units at Chanderiya, Debari, Aghucha and Dariba for which four contracts with AVVNL obtain for purchase of electricity. HZL also set up a captive power plant (hereafter `CPP') of 154 MW (2x77 MW) at Chanderiya, which was commissioned in February, 2005 and synchronized with the Rajasthan Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited Grid (hereafter `the RVPNL'). Short term open access to transmission and distribution systems of RVPNL and AVVNL for electricity generated at the CPP was sought under the Regulations of 2004 framed under Sections 42(2) and 181 of the Act of 2003. Requisite permission for open access to the transmission system was granted by RRVPNL on 28-1- 2005 and open access thereafter obtained under agreement dated 11-3-2005. HZL also entered into three open access agreements with the AVVNL on 10-3-2005 for wheeling of power from its CPP on AVVNL's distribution system. The open access capacity allocation agreement between AVVNL and HZL was for Rampura Aghucha-- 20000 KW, for Debari--15000 KW and for Dariba--5000 KW. Open access commenced 24-3-2005 and the power generated by the respondent HZL at its CPP after meeting the requirements of its industrial unit at Chanderiaya was injected at 132 KV and 220 KV grid substations at Chittorgarh from where it was transmitted on RVPN's transmission system and supplied to respondent HZL's units at Aghucha, Debari and Dariba through AVVNL's distribution lines. \nUnder the open access agreements dated 10-3-2005 between AVVNL and HZL it was agreed that charges for existing connections for the sanctioned contract demand of HZL as a Discom consumer and charges as open access consumer would be governed by the tariff and regulatory order/s in force from time to time. The agreements specifically provided for daily scheduling of injection and drawl for each 15 minutes time block. It was also agreed that Availability Base Tariff (ABT) complaint meters capable of recording deviation from schedules of the generating system station contracted by open access consumer for supplying/ injection open access power were to be provided at injection point. Other salient features of the agreement dated 10-3-2005 relevant for this miscellaneous appeal were as under:-\n\"As both the parties are agreeable to modify the existing connection agreement(s) to the extent applicable.\"\n(1) Definitions In this agreement, unless the context otherwise requires- (a) \"Act\" means the Electricity Act, 2003 (Act No.36 of 2003);\n(b) \"ABT Compliant Meter\" means metering system specified for Availability Based Tariff (ABT) in metering code by the commission;\n(c) \"Commission\" means Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission;\n(d) \"Contract Demand\" shall mean the demand in KVA sanctioned for the consumer which the Ajmer Discom makes specific commitment to supply energy from time to time subject to the governing terms and conditions;\n(e) \"Distribution Metering Code\" means the metering code specified by the commission for distribution system of the distribution licensee in the state;\n(f) \"Grid Code\" means the grid code specified by the commission under section 86(1)(h) of the Act for Rajasthan State Transmission System;\n(g) \"Open Access Consumer\" means a person using or interchange against the transmission system and/ or the distribution system of the licensee(s) in the state for transmission and/ or wheeling of electricity in the state;\n(i) \"SLDC\" means the Rajasthan State Lead Dispatch Centre at Heerapura, Jaipur--functioning under sub-section (1) of Section 31 of the Act; \n(j) \"Transmission Metering Code\" means the Grid Metering Code specified by the commission for the Rajasthan State Transmission System;\n(k) \"Terms & Condition of Supply of Electricity\"\nmeans the terms and conditions of supply of electricity-- 2004 issued by Ajmer Discom and includes any modifications thereof from time to time.\n(l) \"Wheeling\" means the operation where by the distribution system and associated facilities of a transmission licensee or distribution licensee as the case may be, are used by another person for conveyance of electricity on charges, terms and Conditions as set birth with in this Agreement;\nWords and expressions used in this Agreement but not defined herein, shall have meaning assigned to them in the Electricity Act, 2003, and Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions for Open Access) Regulation, 2004, Terms and Conditions of Supply of Electricity--2004 in that order. \n(2) Ajmer Discom shall continue to supply power to Open Access Consumer against his existing connections for the sanctioned contract demand(s) as detailed above, subject to terms and conditions as modified by this agreement. (3) Ajmer Discom shall wheel ____ KW power for the consumer on the open access basis on its distribution system from point of injection to the point of drawl as detailed in the Schedule--1 referred to earlier. (4) The wheeling of power by Ajmer Discom on its Distribution System shall be governed by the Open Access Agreement executed by consumer with RVPN under Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions for Open Access) Regulations, 2004 and the specified procedure therein. \n(5) Both the parties agree that the charges for existing connections for the sanctioned Contract Demand(s) as a Discom consumer and charges for Open Access Consumer shall be governed by the tariff and regulatory order in force time to time, except where specific provision has been made in this Agreement. \n7. (g) The Open Access Consumer shall have round the clock facility of communication with SLDC through telephone/ mobile with STD and for transmission/ receipt of fax and e-mails. \n8. Scheduling The following procedure is agreed upon by the parties for scheduling open power at generation and drawal at the receiving point by Open Access Consumer. \n(a) The generating station injecting open access power into State Transmission System or generating stations embedded in the Distribution System and injecting open access power directly into Distribution System shall furnish each day at 10 AM to State Load Despatch Centre. Heerapura, a day-ahead generation schedule for each 15-minute block starting from 00.00 hrs for the ensuing day (b)\n(c) The Open Access Consumer at 10 AM each day shall furnish to Ajmer Discom schedule of drawal on 15 minute block basis which it intent to draw against the open access and on 15 minute block basis schedule against contract demand of existing connections, f any, separately. The drawl schedule of open access power shall be limited to the availability shown by the supplying generator in its schedule. \n9. Settlement (a) The parties agree that the settlement of mismatch between the schedule injection and actual injection by the generating station injecting open access power into State Transmitting System or by the generating station embedded in the Distribution System for each 15 minute block shall be done in following manner (i) Un-schedule generation not exceeding 5% of the generation/ injection scheduled in any 15 minute block at the UI price specified by the Commission for the state from time to time.\n(ii) Generation exceeding 5% of the generation/ injection scheduled in any 15 minute block shall be considered as zero and no UI charges shall be receivable by the generating station for such excess generation.\n(iii) The mismatch between the schedule generation and actual generation shall be determined from the meter data down loaded through MRI and 15 minute block- wise shcedule furnished for each day during the billing month.\n(c) The mismatch in total drawl scheduled by consumer against open access and against existing contract demand and total actual drawn each 15 minute block shall be done in following manner;\n(i) Un-schedule drawl not exceeding 5% of the total schedule made by the consumer against open access and existing Discom Connections in any 15 minute block shall be priced at UI rate and payable by the Open Access Consumer.\n(ii) The balance mismatch in scheduled and actual drawl shall be paid by the Open Access Consumer to the Ajmer Discom at the mutually agreed rates. And in absence of any agreement such drawl would be treated as temporary supply and shall be charged the tariff for temporary supply as contained in Part-II of the \"Tariff for Supply of Electricity--2004\" booklet for the applicable category. \n(iii) The mismatch between the schedule drawl and actual drawl shall be determined from the meter data down loaded through MRI and 15 minute block wise schedule furnished for each day during the billing month. \n10. Energy Losses It is agreed that the energy losses on account of use of the transmission and distribution system shall be done by the Open Access Consumer. The losses shall be considered in proportion of the energy drawl by the Open Access consumer on the basis of loss levels approved by the Commission for the previous year for the voltage level at which Open Access consumers is connected. \n(11) Billing Ajmer Discom shall raise the bills at the end of the month for the use of distribution system for wheeling of Open Access power and against the existing Discom connections of the consumer for the following amount. \n(a) Wheeling charges for the contracted open access power on Discom system as specified by the Commission from time to time. \n(b) The cross-subsidy surcharge as determined by the commission from time to time under Rajasthan Electricity Regulatroy Commission (Terms and Conditions for Open Access) Regulations, 2004 (c) An additional surcharge as determined by the Commission from time to time in case the consumer availing open access and receiving supply of electricity from a licensee other than his existing distribution licensee of his area of supply. \n(d) Energy charges for scheduled energy against existing connections for the Contract Demand of 21000 KVA as Discom Consumer as per applicable tariff. \n(e) Fixed Charges for the contract Demand of 21000 KVA as Discom consumer as per applicable tariff. \n(f) Minimum bill amount as per tariff applicable in force for the contract demand against the existing connections. (12) Payments. \nThe Open Access Consumer shall pay the payments for the bills raised by the Ajmer Discom within the due date indicated in such bills. In the event of monthly bill(s) not paid in full within the period specified on the bill, the Open Access Consumer agree for Late Payment Surcharge for total bills of Discom as per applicable tariff in force from time to time. \n(13) Other tariff provisions Both the parties agree that other tariff provisions shall be governed by the following:\n(a) Billing demand: The Open Access Consumer shall not cause a demand more than 105% of his Contract Demand against his existing Discom's connection. In case he causes a demand or more than 105% of the Contract demand in any 15 minute time block in a particular month, he shall be required to pay extra charge equal to same percentage of the fixed and energy charges against his existing connection bu equal percentage of excess demand caused over and above contract demand. The demand caused by the Open Access Consumer against existing Discom connection in excess of Contract demand shall be computed through following procedure:\n(i) 15 minute block wise total KWh MRI data down loaded at month and shall be converted in to KW giving total demand caused by Open Access Consumer against existing Discom's connection and open access power. \nKwh figures to be divided by time (0,25 hours) to arrive KW. \n(ii) From 15 minute block-wise total KW demand, the power scheduled by the open access consumer against open access in such block shall be deducted to arrive at 15 minute block-wise actual KW drawn against existing connection. \n(iii) Maximum KW caused in any 15 minute block during the month (out of 96 blocks X number of days in billing months) shall be considered as actual maximum demand in KW caused by the consumer during such month. Maximum demand in KVA shall be worked out by applying power factor (PF) of 0.9 (90%) for leyy of Demand Surcharge exceeding contract demand against existing connection. \n(b) Power Factor: The Open Access Consumer shall maintain the average monthly power factor not less than 0.9 for the total power consumer against existing Discom connection and power wheeled on Open Access on single point basis. In case of the average power factor falls below 0.9 (90%), a surcharge of 1% of energy charges computed at the tariff applicable for existing connection shall be charged for total energy consumed against existing Discom connection and power wheeled on open access on single point basis. \nIn the average power factor falls below 0.7 (70%) the installation shall be disconnected and will not be reconnected till the average power factor is improved to the satisfaction of Ajmer Discom. \n(c) Incentive Scheme--Both parties agree that any incentive scheme applicable for large industrial consumers for encouraging higher consumption through rebate on energy charges by whatever name called will not apply under this agreement. \n(d) No incentive for maintaining PF above 0.95 shall be admissible to the open access consumer. \n(14) This agreement shall remain in force during the period of open access permitted by RVPN vide its letter no RVPN/Dir(P8R)/NPP/Open Access/D.1029 dated 28-1- 2005 and thereafter a fresh agreement as a Discom Consumer for such contract demand as may be permitted by Ajmer Discom will have to executed.\n(15) Both the parties agree that during the term of this agreement the contract demand or contracted open access power and any other terms and conditions agreed initially will not be changed without consent of other. On the basis of open access agreements dated 10-3-2005, as mutually agreed the AVVNL billed HZL as per the scheduled/ actual injection and scheduled/ actual drawl under open access and contract demand. However for want of requisite data and software no specific amounts were indicated as UI charges for the mismatch of scheduled and actual drawls simultaneously with other associated charges payable by HZL under the agreements. Instead AVVNL deducted 10% of the energy injected by HZL under the agreements from its CPP towards unscheduled interchange charges as leviable under the agreement dated 10-3-2005. These rule of thumb deductions pending finalization of unscheduled interchange pricing mechanism by the Commission under clause 20 of the Regulations of 2004 aggregated to Rs.9.43 crore for the period April, 2005 to December, 2005. \nAggrieved of deductions aforesaid towards UI charges on approximate basis the respondent HZL filed petition No.87/2006 before the Commission. Its counsel on objections to the maintainability of the dispute relating to UI charges before the Commission in view of clause 29 of the Open Access Regulations, 2004 dealing with redressal mechanism for open access related disputes and complaints submitted that \"Clause 29 of the OA Regulations shall be effective only when the UI mechanism is specified by the Commission\". The Commission vide interim order dated 10-4-2006 directed AVVNL to finalize the HZL's unscheduled interchange settlement account within three months based on applicable orders and clarification issued by it. The Commission further held that AVVNL could recover Unscheduled Interchange (UI) charges but only as provided interalia under clause 20 of the Regulations of 2004 after receipt of schedules of each 15 minutes from HZL and then finalize UI settlement account from the deviations of drawls from the agreed schedule. \nThe Commission thereafter on further hearing of petition No.87/2006 vide final order dated 22-5-2006 found that AVVNL had deducted Rs.8.81 crore and not 9.43 crore towards the UI charges from HZL and observed that to facilitate appropriate energy accounting the basic software wold be got developed for the purpose through its own staff as per the conditions of the agreement dated 10-3-2005. And once the software was finalized, the dispute regarding energy accounting and billing be settled by the dispute redressal mechanism as per clause 29 of the Regulations of 2004. The operative part of the order dated 22-5-2006 is reproduced hereunder:-\n\"9. The Commission has heard the petitioner and respondent on 4-4-06 and it was observed by the Commission that as per clause 8 (a) & (c) of the agreement, open access consumer is to submit a day ahead schedule of injection (from generating station) and drawl against open access from AVVNL at the aforesaid industrial units on 15 minutes block basis and that as per clause-9 (a)(i) & (ii) & 9 (c), (i) (ii), deviation from scheduled generation and scheduled drawl not exceeding 5% of total schedule for open access and AVVNL supply is to be priced at the UI Price specified by the Commission and shall be payable/receivable by the open access consumer. For the generation (i.e. injection) exceeding 5% of the schedule, no amount shall be receivable by generating station and drawl exceeding 5% of total schedule shall be charged at the tariff for temporary supply. On 4-4-2006, the respondent stated that UI settlement account could not be prepared for want of requisite software with them and SLDC and that time is required by the respondent to compile schedules. No definite schedule for accomplishing this task could be indicated by the respondent. The Commission observed that while the respondent was entitled to recover/pay charges as per these provisions, but in no case was entitled to withhold payments in lieu of UI charges for a long period without preparing UI account and billing. Accordingly, such adhoc deduction withholding of the amount is not desirable and conducive to open access. Considering these aspects, the Commission passed the order on 10-4-2006 (placed at Annexure-2). The orders dated 13-2-2006 & 10-4-2006 passed by the Commission and attached herewith, shall from part of this order as confirmed. \n10. In pursuance to para 7 of the order dated 10-04-2006, a meeting was held between AVVNL, HZL & SLDC on 24- 4-2006 for technical discussions and to review the progress. It was informed in the meeting that the petitioner and the respondent have not exchanged hard & soft copy of schedules. It was stated that it could not be done by the respondent, as the copy of schedules prior to June 2005 were not furnished to SLDC and HZL was also not in a position to deliver them to AVVNL due to computer problem. The petitioner and respondent agreed to exchange the same by 26-4-2006. HZL stated that they have furnished BG and AVVNL stated to effect refund, if any, by the end of May 06. AVVNL, however, expressed difficulty on account of non-availability of suitable software for energy accounting and determination of UI from the schedules viz-a-viz actual drawl/ injection. To facilitate energy accounting, the Commission agreed to have basic software developed for the purpose though the Commission's staff. The software shall be as per the provisions of the agreement and shall not be construed as approval of RERC for various provisions of agreement except UI rates. \n11. It was decided that the software would be delivered to AVVNL for billing after testing for errors/improvement. Its copy was also be delivered to HZL & SLDC. Once software is finalized, further upgradation/ improvements shall be effected by AVVNL/SLDC. The Commission observes that this open access is effected in the area of supply of AVVNL and no other distribution licensee is involved in this open access. I case, billing as per provisions of agreement for the aforesaid period is not effected within 3 months of the receipt of the schedules from HZL the balance amount withheld by AVVNL shall be refunded to HZL against Bank Guarantee valid for 6 months. \n12- The Commission reaffirms that one software is finalized, dispute regarding energy accounting and billing shall be settled by dispute redressal mechanism already provided at clause 29 of the Open A ccess Regulations, wherein SLDC is the proper authority to be approached for settlement of the dispute. When SLDC is unable to settle the dispute the State Power Committee ('SPC'), under the provisions of the State Grid Code, will endeavour to resolve it and in case, SPC is also unable to resolve the dispute, the Commission is to be approached.\" \nFollowing the development of software by the Commission's staff AVVNL on 25-1-2007 prepared final bill for the period from May, 2005 to January, 2007 aggregating to Rs.20.6 crores. Thereupon the HZL on 25-1-2007 filed petition No.122/2007 before the Commission invoking Sections 42, 94, 158 of the act of 2003 read with clause 30 of the OA Regulations of 2004 for appointment of an Arbitrator. Despite the Commission's earlier directions by a 3 member bench under its orders dated 10-4-2006 and 22-6-2006 that after bill drawn following finalization of software by the Commission's staff disputes relating to UI account settlement be referred to SLDC under Clause 29 of the Regulations of 2004, vide order dated 12-2-2007 one member of the Commission referred the dispute relating to billing of UI charges to one Mr. R.K. Sharma, ex member of the erstwhile RSEB as sole arbitrator. The reference categorically was \"to resolve the dispute arising out of Open Access availed by M/s. HZL from its Captive Power Plant at Chanderiya (Chittorgarh) to its industrial units located within the area of AVVNL in the matter of UI charges billed by AVVNL\".\nThe respondent filed a claim petition setting up multiple claims before the Arbitrator. The appellant filed reply thereto objecting to the claims except those relating to UI charges levied being beyond the reference. \nOn the basis of pleadings of the parties, the Arbitrator framed 11 issues:-\n1. Whether bilateral agreements entered into to deal with contingencies not provided in the RERC Regulations can be challenged by either party?\n2. Whether the software adopted for billing was in accordance with the bilateral Agreement dated 10-3- 2005? \n3. Whether the petitioner failed to comply with any of the requirements of OA agreement and its effect? \n4. Whether any of the provisions of Open Access Agreement are contrary to the provisions of RERC Regulations and its effect? Whether the amount deducted towards UI charges was justified? \n5. Whether AVVNL is justified in not allowing Power Factor incentive to HZL units? \n6. Whether the wheeling charges billed by the AVVNL are as per the agreement? \n7. Whether the levy of LPS retrospectively by AVVNL is justified particularly when they had deducted 10% on adhoc basis towards UI charges? \n8. Whether AVVNL is justified in claiming temporary supply tariff for injection less than 95% of schedule? \n9. Whether AVVNL is justified in not accounting units in excess of 105% of the schedule? \n10. What claim? Whether interest is payable to the claimant? \n11. Whether AVVNL is justified in levying temporary tariff in terms of clause 9(c)(ii) of the agreement, even though the drawl is within the contract demand? \n12. Whether AVVNL is justified in not allowing any credit for under-drawl of energy below 95% of the schedule? \nVide award dated 25-8-2007, the claim petition of HZL was allowed. \nAggrieved of the award, the appellant filed objections under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 before the Commercial court on the ground that the dispute as to UI charges ought not have been adjudicated by the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator's conclusion as to conditions 2, 5, 8(c), 9, 11(d)(e) and 13(d) of the OA agreements dated 10-3-2005 being illegal and unenforceable were perverse and beyond the reference made to him and that the award was both patently unjust and perverse. \nThe commercial court vide impugned judgment dated 25-2- 2017 dismissed AVVNL's objections to the award dated 25-8-2007. The award thus now hold as an executable decree. \nHence this miscellaneous appeal. \nMr. Virendra Lodha submitted that the dispute of which the reference was made on 12-2-2007 - billing of UI charges - by the commission being related to the OA agreement dated 10-3-2005 could only have been pursued for resolution under clause 29 of the OA Regulations 2004. That clause provides that \"all disputes and complaint relating to open access shall be referred to (the) State Load Dispatch Center, which would investigate and resolve the grievance within thirty days, and where it was so unable to do the matter was to be considered thereafter by State Power Committee. And only when the State Power Committee was not able to resolve the dispute within thirty days of taking seisin, such a dispute or complaint at the instance of open access consumer would be referred to the RERC. Mr. Virendra Lodha submitted that the OA Regulations 2004 had been made under Section 42 (2) read with Section 181 of the Act of 2003 and placed before the State Legislature in terms of Section 182 thereof. They thus partook the character of law and were binding with a stamp of exclusively inter alia as to the manner of resolution of dispute relating to open access. It was submitted that the resort to arbitration in respect of such disputes i.e. regarding billing of UI charges was thus completely misdirected and unsustainable. Mr. Virendra Lodha further submitted that the application moved on 25-1-2007 by the HZL before the commission interalia invoking Sections 42, 94 and 158 of the Act of 2003 as also clause 30 of the Open Access Regulations 2004 was not qua a dispute relating to the relationship between a generating company (CPP here) and the distribution licensee, but one evidently between a open access consumer and a licensee under the Regulations of 2004 in respect of billing for UI charges leviable in the course of availing open access. Such dispute was thus not arbitrable, a specific statutory remedy therefor having been provided under clause 29 of the Open Access Regulations 2004. A reference to the Arbitrator of such a dispute by resort to Section 158 of the Act of 2003 was wholly misdirected, without jurisdiction and of no consequence. An award based on such a reference in regard to a non-arbitrable dispute, is liable to be set aside under Section 34(2)(b)(i) of the Act of 1993. \nMr. Virendra Lodha further submitted that the sole arbitrator travelled beyond the terms of the reference made under the Commission's order dated 12-2-2007 and hence exceeded his jurisdiction in passing the impugned award dated 25-8-2007. It was submitted that the reference made was only to \"resolve the dispute arising out of open access availed by HZL from its capital power plant Chanderiya (Chittorgarh) to its other industrial units located within the area of AVVNL in the matter of UI charges filled by AVVNL in the matter of UI charges billed by AVVNL\". On its plain terms the reference was thus clearly limited to the dispute in regard to UI charge and yet the Arbitrator under his award dated 25-8- 2007 proceeded to entertain and address other issues including those as to whether HZL had complied with all its obligation under the OA agreement dated 10-3-2005; as to whether AVVNL was justified in not allowing power factor incentive to M/s. HZL's units ; whether late payment charges were as per the OA agreements dated 10-3-2005 etc., Mr. Virendra Lodha submitted that even otherwise the Arbitrator acted beyond the reference in respect of billing of UI charges, which billing dispute necessarily had to be considered with reference to the RERC (OA) Regulations, 2004 and the OA open access agreements dated 10-3-2005. In allowing HZL to impugn the various conditions of the OA agreement dated 10-3-2005 - more so when no such challenge was laid in the application moved by HZL before the Commission on 25-1-2007 on which the reference was made was wholly beyond the reference. It was submitted that a reference having been made by the Commission on the application dated 25-1-2007, the sole arbitrator should have confined the consideration and the subsequent award solely to the issue first agitated in the application without entertaining the challenge to the conditions of the agreement dated 10-3-2005. It was submitted that the award dated 25-8-2007 in regard whereto objections have been dismissed by the Commercial Court vide its judgment dated 25-2- 2017, being beyond the reference deserves to be quashed and set aside. \nMr. Virendra Lodha further submitted that even otherwise the award dated 25-8-2007 is ex-facie perverse, inasmuch as the sole arbitrator despite recording that the OA agreements dated 10-3- 2005 entered into between the appellant and respondent HZL were not vitiated either by undue influence or misrepresentation, held condition Nos.2, 5, 8(c), 9, 11(d), (e) and 13(d) thereof to be contrary to the \"Regulations\". It was submitted that this findings of the sole Arbitrator flew in the face of the fact that the agreements dated 10-3-2005 were drafted as per the Commission's order dated 25-5-2004 wherein it was recorded that any mismatch between energy supplied for open access consumer and actual drawl by the consumer, will result in corresponding mismatch (i.e. over drawl/ under drawl) by the distribution licensee from northern region and will be reflected by the NRLDC in its energy account which will be subject to UI charges. And as such UI account was to be billed to STU for the state as a whole the SLDC was to allocate such UI charges among distribution licensee. Further with open access being allowed to consumers such allocation of UI charges was also to be made to the consumers based on its over drawl/ under drawl extrapolated to Ex-CSGS bus bar. \nMr. Virendra Lodha further submitted that subsequently in its order dated 10-4-2006 the Commission with reference to the OA agreement dated 10-3-2005 in para 4 recorded that \"open access agreement is by an large found to be in conformity with the provisions of open access regulations\". Mr. Virendra Lodha pointed out that even in its order dated 22-5-2006 the Commission observed that AVVNL was entitled to recover charges as per the provisions of OA agreement dated 10-3-2005, albeit AVVNL indeed could not withhold credits/ payment otherwise due to HZL in lieu of UI charges for long periods without preparing UI account and billing. Mr. Virendra Lodha hastened to add that the reason for delay in the settlement of UI account was that the HZL was not making available requisite data to AVVNL as was its obligation under the agreements dated 10-3-2005. \nMr. Virendra Lodha then submitted that in any event clause 20 of the OA Regulations 2004 with reference to which the agreements dated 10-3-2005 were interalia entered into provided for unscheduled inter-change pricing. Thereunder charges on the open access consumer for mismatch between scheduled and actual drawl were to be levied in terms of the pricing mechanism as specified by the commission. It was submitted that there were indeed delays in finalizing the pricing mechanism by the consumer for whatever reason but that could not entail negation of the right of AVVNL and the corresponding obligation of the open access consumer--HZL with regard to conditions of the agreement dated 10-3-2005 based on the open access regulations of 2004 in regard to UI charges--when applicable for mismatch in scheduled and actual drawls by the open access consumer. At the worst, Mr. Virendra Lodha submitted delay in finalization of the pricing mechanism for UI charges by the commission would have only entailed deferment of recovery of UI charges--appropriately adjusted. It was submitted that the finding of the Arbitrator on this count holding that non availability of pricing mechanism for UI charges entailed an all time debarment for recovery thereof, even after finalization of software for the purpose by the staff of the commission itself is therefore wholly unsustainable. Mr. Virendra Lodha also emphatically submitted that once the sole arbitrator had recorded in his award dated 25-8-2007 that the agreements dated 10-3-2005 was signed by the parties with eyes open and were not vitiated by undue influence or misrepresentation, there was no reason with the sole arbitrator to strike down clauses 2, 5, 8(c), 9, 11(d)(e) and 13(d) of the agreement. It was submitted that even otherwise there was nothing on record before the sole Arbitrator to holds the agreements dated 10-3-2005 were vitiated by any illegality. It was submitted that the Arbitrator ought to have appreciated that the OA agreement dated 10-3-2005 were a bargain between the AVVNL and HZL and a negation of some of the essential conditions constituting consideration and a sine-qua-non subsequent to its implementation, the HZL having obtained benefits thereunder, was not permissible on the ground of equity. Mr. Virendra Lodha submitted that the HZL was estopped from challenging any condition/s of the agreements dated 10-3-2005, on which basis it obtained open access from the appellant AVVNL on its distribution lines for supply of electricity from its CPP to its three units at Aghucha, Debari and Dariba. It was submitted that the lopsided and unjust construction of agreements dated 10-3-2005 on which the award dated 25-8-2007 is founded is wholly unconscionable bringing it within the mischief of being contrary to public policy as provided for in Section 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Act of 1996. \nMr. Virendra Lodha submitted that the trial court under its impugned judgment dated 25-2-2017 rejecting the appellant's objections to the award dated 25-8-2007 has thus failed to exercise its jurisdiction to set aside the award. It was submitted that the award dated 25-8-2007, was liable to be set aside for reason of submissions made. And the Commercial Court in impugned judgment dated 25-2-2017 for having failed to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act of 1996. \nPer Contra, Mr. R.N. Mathur Senior Advocate, appearing with Mr. Punit Singhvi for HZL submitted that Section 86(1)(f) of the Act of 2003 empowers the Commission inter alia to adjudicate upon all disputes between a licensee and a generating company and in its discretion to refer any such dispute before it for arbitration. It was submitted that Section 2(28) of the Act 2003 defines a generating company to mean a company or body corporate or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or artificial juridical person which owns or operates or maintains a generating station. That would indubitably also include a company operating a captive power plant submitted Mr. R.N. Mathur as HZL was at Chanderiay. Referring to Section 2 (17) of the Act of 2003, Mr. R.N. Mathur submitted that it defines a distribution licensee to mean a licensee authorized to operate and maintain a distribution system for supplying electricity to the consumers in its area of supply and that AVVNL unquestionably is. It was submitted that albeit the HZL was also a consumer of AVVNL with a contracted demand for supply of power to its four units, yet the dispute with regard to imposition of illegal conditions in the open access agreement and wrong billing of UI charges without the pricing mechanism therefore being determined by the Commission under clause 20 of the Regulation of 2004 contrary to Act of 2003, and orders of the Commission, entailed a dispute between the HZL as a generating company (HZL) and AVVNL as the distribution licensee whose infrastructure was being availed for open access. This dispute was thus eminently amenable to adjudication by the Commission under Section 86(1)(f) of the Act of 2003, and thereunder also to arbitration. The reference made to the Arbitrator on 12-2-2007 on HZL's application was thus wholly rated. Mr. R.N. Mathur submitted that in terms of 16 of the Act of 1996 read with Section 4 thereof any objection as to the purported lack of jurisdiction of an Arbitrator to address the dispute on the reference made to him had to be made prior to submission of the reply to the claim petition and when not so agitated at the appropriate time, it entailed a non-reversable waiver. Objection as to jurisdiction of the Arbitrator once standing thus waived under statute, cannot subsequently be resuscitated as an after thought either before the commercial court in objections under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 or subsequently in appeal from its judgment under Section 37. Mr. R.N. Mathur submitted that the Apex Court in the case of Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited Vs. Essar Power Limited [(2008(4) SCC 755] has held in relation to Section 86(1)(f) of the Act of 2003 held that when a dispute between a licensee and the generating company is referred to an Arbitrator it has to be resolved by him. Reliance has been placed on para 56 of the said opinion wherein the Apex Court held that since the coming into force of the Act of 2003 effective 10-6-2003 adjudication of all disputes whether or not covered by clause (a) to (e) and (g) to (k) of Section 86 (1) (f) between the licensee and generating companies can only be resolved by the Commission or the Arbitrator appointed by it. Mr. R. N. Mathur submitted that in this view of the matter the submission of Mr. Virendra Lodha with regard to the dispute agitated by the respondent HZL not being arbitrable entailing the consequences of the award dated 25-8-2007 thereon being set aside is wholly without legal foundation and meritless. \nMr. R.N. Mathur further submitted that in any event the redressal mechanism under clause 29 of the Regulations of 2004 for redressal of the dispute agitated by HZL as to billing of UI charges, for which the reference was made to the sole arbitrator by the commission on 12-2-2007 was not appropriate. The dispute agitated by the HZL was as a generating company being wrongly harassed and being arbitrarily charged various amounts by the distribution licensee whose lines were utilized for wheeling power generated at its CPP. It was submitted that the dispute agitated before the commission under application dated 25-1-2007 did not relate to a matter of open access or billing therefor. In the written submission filed on behalf of HZL it has been submitted that neither was the dispute agitated by respondent HZL one relating to determination of tariff under Section 62 of the Act of 2003 nor for that matter a dispute qua the open access agreement. Mr. R.N. Mathur further submitted that the dispute agitated also similarly was not relatable to Section 42 of the Act of 2003 under Chapter VI pertaining to distribution of energy and hence not one in respect of which HZL as a consumer of electricity supplied by the appellant AVVNL under contracted demand was under obligation to agitate its billing dispute with AVVNL before the forum for redressal of grievances under Section 42(5) of the Act of 2003 and thereafter before the Ombudsman under Section 42(6) of the Act of 2003. \nMr. R. N. Mathur further submitted that the reference made vide order dated 12-2-2007 passed by the commission was open ended--it required adjudication of all disputes relating to AVVNL's arbitrary billing for UI charges. In so addressing the dispute the clauses of the agreements dated 10-3-2005 invoked by AVVNL to buttress the changes were open to consideration, evaluation and setting set aside on being found in the cross-hairs of the Act of 2003 and orders of the Commission. Such offending clauses were capable of being set aside. Similarly other conditions of the open access agreements dated 10-3-2005 which flew in the face of the Act of 2003 empowering only the commission to determine tariffs for supply of electricity and related charges could also be addressed by the Sole Arbitrator, as they were and found to be null and void. Mr. R.N. Mathur submitted that the sole arbitrator in the final judge of both fact and law. His evaluation bonafide made cannot be second guessed by courts which under the Scheme of the Act of 1996 can only minimally interfere on the specific grounds as set out under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 being made out with a semblance of reasonableness. The arbitrator has taken a just and fair view on the agreements dated 10-3-2005, kept them clear of illegal, onerous conditions wholly illegal as also unsustainable in law. In determining the dispute before him the Arbitrator has negated the effort of the AVVNL to apply scheduling to drawl of power a find a mismatch even in regard to contracted supply of electricity to a HT consumer wherein no such scheduling was visualized. And because of which HZL was being meted with huge amounts variously named as UI charges, temporary tariff, LPS and those resulting from denial of benefits of maintaining a PF (Power Factor) which benefits were available to other sundry HT consumers. \nMr. R.N. Mathur finally submitted that the arbitrator has on consideration of the evidence before it on issues struck on the pleadings of the parties passed his award in his best and bonafide judgment as the final judge of both fact and law. His award is thus beyond challenge on merits not the least for the reason that he was an expert in matters relating to electricity. Within the narrow limits of jurisdiction under Section 34/ 37 of the Act of 1996 no ground for setting aside of the award dated 25-8-2007 is thus made out. And for this reason the commercial court under its judgment dated 25-2-2017 has rightly found no ground within Section 34 of the Act of 1996 being made out to set aside the award. So should this court find as no good reason to the contrary has been made out in the appeal. And hence the appeal be dismissed, submitted Mr. R.N. Mathur. \nHeard. Considered. \nIt is no doubt true that in terms of Section 16(2) of the Act of 1996 a plea of lack of jurisdiction of the Arbitrator is to be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence and if unsuccessful at that stage, in objections under section 34 of the Act of 1996 against the final award. Even a plea with regard to the arbitrator exceeding the scope of his authority under the statutory reference made or appointment under the relevant arbitration clause is to be raised in the first instance when the occasion arises and not otherwise. It is equally true that under Section 4 of the Act of 1996 where a party participates in an arbitration without stating its objections to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator, subsequently such a plea is hit by waiver. Yet the limitations of Section 16(2)and 16 (3) read with section 4 of the Act of 1996 relate only to the Arbitrator's jurisdiction, the arbitration agreement being invalid or as to the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal not being proper. And as earlier noted, when not initially raised cannot subsequently be so raised. This obtaining legal position however does not entail taking away the right specifically statutorily conferred under Section 34(2)(b)(i) of the Act of 1996 to a party to an award to lay objections thereto on the ground of the subject matter of the arbitration not being arbitrable. Section 34(2)(b)(i) of the Act of 1996 reads thus:-\n\"the subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force,\"\nThe plain language of Section 34(2)(b)(i) makes it pellucid that objections as to an award for reason of it addressing a non arbitrable dispute can be taken up subsequent to its passing. There can be no waiver thereagainst either with reference to Section 4 of the Act of 1996 or even otherwise. \nThe question that now arises is as to what disputes are non- arbitrable? \nThe Apex Court in case of Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc. Vs. SBI Home Finance Limited [(2011)5 SCC 532] has held that where certain matters are governed by special status, they are not arbitrable. By way of illustration the Apex Court referred to several non-arbitrable disputes such as (i) disputes relating to rights and liabilities which give rise to or arise out of criminal offences; (ii) matrimonial disputes relating to divorce, judicial separation, restitution of conjugal rights, child custody; (iii) guardianship matters; (iv) insolvency and winding-up matters; (v) testamentary matters (grant of probate, letters of administration and succession certificate); and eviction of tenancy matters governed by special statutes where the tenant enjoys statutory protection against eviction and only the specified courts are conferred jurisdiction to grant or decide the disputes. The issue was also considered by the Apex Court in the case of MSP Infrastructure Limited Vs. Madhyapradesh Road Development Corporation Limited [(2015)13 SCC 713] with a similar conclusion. \nThe Apex Court in the case of A. Ayyasamy v. A. Paramasivam [(2016)10 SCC 386] has held that ordinarily every civil or commercial dispute whether based on contract or otherwise which is capable of being decided by a civil court is in principle capable of being adjudicated upon and resolved by arbitration. But such resolution by arbitration of a dispute is subject to the dispute being governed by the arbitration agreement. It was held that classes of dispute which fall within the exclusive domain of special fora under legislation which confers exclusive jurisdiction to the exclusion of ordinary civil court could not be resolved by arbitration. And consequently if the jurisdiction of ordinary civil court is excluded by conferment of exclusive jurisdiction on a specific court as a matter of public policy, such a dispute would not be capable of resolution by arbitration. \nIn the instant case a bare look at the reference dated 12-2- 2007 made by the Commission indicates that it was with regard to the dispute in the matter of UI charges being billed to HZL by the AVVNL for open access to its three units under the open access agreements dated 10-3-2005. It is not in dispute and cannot be so that UI charges sought to be billed on the respondent HZL were in terms of agreement dated 10-3-2005 between AVVNL and HZL for open access to its distribution lines for the supply of electricity from HZL's CPP at Chanderiya. Admittedly the said OA agreements dated 10-3-2005 were founded upon the Regulations of 2004 notified by the Commission in exercise of its power under Section 42(2) read with Section 181 of the Act of 2003, after being laid and approved by the State Legislature under Section 182 thereof. The said Regulations of 2004 thus partook the character of law. Clause 29 of the aforesaid Regulations 2004 provided for redressal mechanism with regard to all disputes and complaints relating to open access. Thereunder in the first instance all disputes and complaints relating to open access were to be made to the State Load Depatch Centre (SLDC) which would then be under an obligation to investigate and resolve such dispute within thirty days, failing which the dispute was to be considered and decided by the State Power Committee (SPC) constituted under Grid Code, in thirty days following. It was only when the SPC was unable to resolve the grievance of the open access consumer (no doubt may be a CPP owner) the matter was to be referred to the Commission, which was to then address the disputes and complaints of the open access consumer. In terms of Section 29 of the Regulations of 2004 the Commission on taking seisin of the disputes and complaints relating to open access could not make a reference to the Arbitrator as no such provision obtained therefor. \nYet in the instant case an application under Sections 42, 94 and 158 of the Act of 2003 read with clause 30 of the Regulations of 2004 was moved by the respondent HZL before the Commission on 25-1-2007, which has been placed on record by the counsel for the respondent HZL along with affidavit with inward No.12362/16-3- 2018. A perusal of the said application evidences that it is captioned as one regarding \"unauthorised deduction and collection from open access consumer\". The caption and so too the application's contents indicate that it was not by HZL in its capacity of a generating company (by virtue of it operating a CPP) but as an open access consumer as defined in Regulations of 2004, using the distribution systems of AVVNL--the distribution licensees. There was not a whisper in the application by HZL that the dispute agitated was one in its capacity as a \"generating company\". The application set out HZL's grievances with regard to the electricity bills raised by AVVNL under pain of disconnection of electricity supply. HZL's case was that the electricity bill dated 25-1-2007 raised on it following the preparation of software by the Commission's staff for settlement of UI charges under the open access agreements dated 10-3-2005 was wholly arbitrary, illegal and in violation of directions of the Commission, and AVVNL could not make \"any recovery through software created two years after the event\". The application further stated that in view of orders dated 10-4-2006 and 22-5-2006 passed by the Commission in petition No.57/2006, the national Electricity Policy and the Terrif Policy, HZL required protection without which it could not survive due to \"undue harassment\" and unfair treatment at the hands of AVVNL leading to existential hardships. Appropriate relief under clause 30 of the Regulations 2004 (Removal of Difficulties) was sought. On the aforesaid averments relating to HZL's grievance it was prayed that for its resolution, the matter of wrongful/ arbitrary billing be resolved through an arbitrator appointed under Section 158 of the Act of 2003. \nOn the aforesaid application dated 25-1-2007 the order of reference was made by the Commission on 12-2-2007 appointing Mr.R.K. Sharma as sole arbitrator to go into the issue of billing of UI charges. \nWe are of the considered view that the contents of the application by the respondent HZL before the Commission evidenced that the dispute agitated therein was one related to billing for UI charges under the open access agreements dated 10-3-2005 by AVVNL. We find no force in the contention of Mr. R.N. Mathur appearing for HZL that the dispute set up before the Commission in the application dated 25-1-2007, on which the matter was referred to the sole arbitrator did not relate to open access agreement/s dated 10-3-2005 or that it related to disputes by HZL as a generating company (CPP owner) and AVVNL as a distribution licensee. To hold so would be perverse and a gross misreading of HZL's application dated 25-1-2007. \nAt this stage it would appropriate to also take note of the fact a three member committee of the Commission constituted of Shanti Prasad, as Chairman, S.N. Dharendra, Member (Finance) and K.L. Vyas member (Technical) in its order dated 10-4-2006 had held that the dispute as to UI charges and matters relating to open access was liable to be adjudicated under clause 29 of the Regulations of 2004. Further the Commission in its order dated 22-5-2006 held in para 12 as under:-\n\"The Commission reaffirms that once software is finalized, dispute regarding energy accounting and billing shall be settled by dispute redressal mechanism already provided at clause 29 of the Open Access Regulations, wherein SLDC is the proper authority to be approached for settlement of the dispute. When SLDC is unable to settle the dispute the State Power Committee (SPC) under the provisions of the State Grid Code, will endeavour to resolve it and in case, SPC is also unable to resolve the dispute, the Commission is to be approached. \nOddly subsequently vide order dated 12-2-2007, one member of the Commission then passed a contradictory order. And instead of requiring the respondent HZL to approach SLDC under clause 29 of the Regulations of 2004 for settlement of dispute in regard to billing of UI charges and other aspects of the agreements dated 10-3-2005, as earlier held by the 3 member Commission, made a reference of the dispute of billing of UI charges to the Arbitrator under purported exercise of powers under Sections 45, 94 and 158 of the Act of 2003 read with Regulations 2004. It is also relevant that Section 86(1)(f) of the Act of 2003 was not adverted to in the order dated 12-2- 2007 not adverted to in HZL's application dated 25-1-2007. \nThat so being, clause 29 of the Regulations 2004 which relates to redressal mechanism for \"all disputes and complaints\" in regard to open access, was the statutory mechanism which alone could have been invoked by HZL for resolution of disputes related to open access including billing of UI charges. The dispute/ complaint by HZL as the open access consumer was thus exclusively to be resolved by the statutory mechanism under clause 29 of the Regulations of 2004 and could not in any circumstance be resolved by resort to any other procedure including a statutory arbitration. No power statutory or otherwise vested with the Commission in the facts of the case to make a reference of a dispute relating to open access to a statutory arbitrator. \nThis also for the reason that disputes under the Open Access Regulations 2004 are plainly not within the jurisdiction of civil courts as per the scheme of the Act of 2003. The jurisdiction of the Civil court in such disputes is barred by necessary implication. This is evident from the fact that a parallel mechanism for resolution of disputes relating to electricity has been set out under the Act of 2003 by way of constitution of Central Electricity Regulatory Commission as also State Electricity Commissions. Decisions whereof are appellable before the Appellate Tribunal under Section 111 of the Act of 2003 and appeals wherefrom lie to the Apex Court under Section 125 of the Act of 2003. In the circumstances disputes/ complaint of the respondent HZL with regard to alleged wrongful billing on account of UI charges under the open access agreements dated 10-3-2005 in the background of Open Access Regulations 2004 were to be exclusively determined under the redressal mechanism provided under Regulation 29 of the Regulations 2004. The respondent HZL thus aggrieved of the allegedly wrong billing of UI charges by AVVNL ought to have only first approached the SLDC and if necessary thirty days thereafter the SPC constituted under Grid Code, and on failure of both, the Commission. We are further of the considered view that in the event of State Commission being approached under clause 29 of the Regulations 2004, it could not exercise its powers under Section 86(1)(f) read with Section 158 of the Act of 2003 to make a reference to the Sole Arbitrator. The Commission could only decide itself. \nWe are of the considered view that in the facts on record and legal position obtaining from the judgment of the Apex Court in A.Ayyasamy vs. A. Paramasivam (supra) the dispute/ complaint with regard to UI charges billing under the open access agreements dated 10-3-2005 having been legislatively set up for resolution through the exclusive redressal mechanism under clause 29 of Regulations 2004 could not have been referred to the sole arbitrator as neither an arbitration agreement therefor obtained nor were the preconditions of a statutory arbitration under the Act of 2003 satisfied. The dispute with regard to billing of UI charges, referred to the sole arbitrator purportedly under Section 158 of the Act of 2003 by the Commission's order dated 12-2-2007 was thus not arbitrable. The dispute thus not being arbitrable the award dated 25-8-2007 thereon passed by the Sole Arbitrator is liable to be quashed and set aside on this count alone with reference to Section 34(2)(b)(i) of the Act of 1996. \nEven otherwise we are of the considered view that the award dated 25-8-2007 is wholly perverse in holding that conditions 2, 5, 8(c), 9, 11(d)(e) and 13(d) of the agreement dated 10-3-2005 were contrary to the Regulations and the Act of 2003. In fact the award aside of some broad brush observations does not specify as to which of the Regulation/s or order/s of the Commission or provisions of the Act of 2003 were/ was violated in drawing the said OA agreements dated 10.3.2005. Contrarily the orders dated 10-4-2006 and 22-5- 2006 passed by the Commission evidence otherwise. The Commission in its order dated 10-4-2006 in para 4 recorded that the open access agreements dated 10-3-2005 were by and large found to be in conformity with the provisions of OA Regulations 2004. The Commission further in para 6 of the said order noted that in its view as per open access agreements it was appropriate for the AVVNL to demand finalized schedule from HZL for levying UI charges. And in view of delays being occasioned for one reason or the other in finalizing the settlement mechanism it deserved to be expedited. AVVNL was directed to finalize UI settlement account vis- a-vis respondent HZL subsequent to receipt of requisite information from HZL taking into consideration its deviations from the agreed schedules in drawls of power. Thereafter in its final order dated 22- 5-2006 the Commission reiterated its earlier observations that as per clause 9(a)(i)(ii) and 9(c), (i) and (ii) deviation from scheduled generation and scheduled drawl not exceeding 5% of total schedule for open access and AVVNL supply is to be priced at the UI price specified by the Commission and shall be payable/ recoverable by the open access consumer. For the generation (i.e. injection) exceeding 5% of the schedule no amount shall be receivable by generating station and drawl exceeding 5% of total schedule shall be charge at the tariff for temporary supply. Thereafter noting the submission of AVVNL that UI settlement account could not be prepared for want of requisite software and that SLDC was required to compile schedules, the Commission observed that AVVNL was entitled to recover charges as per provisions of the agreements, albeit it could not indefinitely withhold payment of sums otherwise due in lieu of UI charges without preparing/ finalizing the UI account and billing. To obviate the obstruction in preparing the UI account and levy of charges the Commission therefore directed that the energy account software be developed for the purpose through Commission's staff. The Commission then affirmed that once the software was finalized, dispute regarding energy accounting and billing would be settled by the dispute redressal mechanism as provided under clause 29 of the Regulations 2004, whereunder the SLDC was the proper authority to be first approached for settlement of dispute. \nIt is thus apparent that the Commission had categorically upheld the legality and validity of the agreements dated 10-3-2005 and inter alia the levy of UI charges and other sums from the open access consumer for specified deviations in terms of the OA Regulations of 2004 framed under Section 42(2) read with Section 181 of the Act of 2003 and under Section 42(2) of the Act of 2003 open access could be made subject to various conditions, extent and manner of access defined. Clause 20 of the Regulations 2004 provides for unscheduled interchange pricing. Clause 21 for reactive energy charges, clause 22 for energy losses, clause 23 for other commercial conditions, clause 24 for compliance with grid discipline. The OA agreements dated 10-3-2005 were accordingly entered into between the AVVNL and HZL. And yet the sole Arbitrator has overlooked the aforesaid findings of the Commission and has perversely held that clauses 2, 5, 8(c), 9, 11(d) (e) and 13(d) of the agreements dated 10-3-2005 were unlawful. Therefore the impugned award dated 25-8-2007 is also liable to be quashed and set aside for clear non application of mind. \nWe may at this stage appropriate to observe that reliance by the respondent HZL on the Commission's order dated 23-6-2006 in petition No.RERC/57/2005 relatable to clause 20 of the OA Regulations 2004, is of little avail for the reason that the said order was passed in the course of the Commission specifying the pricing mechanism for payment of mismatch between the scheduled and actual drawal. The Commission did not issue any directions of modifying the pre-existing OA agreements dated 10.3.2005. It cannot therefore be anybody's case that the charges levied by AVVNL as per the conditions of the open access agreement/s dated 10-3- 2005 were unlawful and contrary to the extant OA Regulations of 2004 and till such time as they were amended effective 1.5.2006 as per the Commission's view. \nFurther, the arbitrator has also not recorded any reason founded in law to hold clauses 2, 5, 8(c), 9, 11(d)(e) and 13(d) of the agreement/s dated 10-3-2005 as null and void. In fact the award dated 25-8-2007 records that neither misrepresentation nor undue influence vitiated the open access agreements dated 10-3-2005. And that both the parties thereto had entered into the open access agreements with eyes open. The Arbitrator then however peremptorily held that neither AVVNL nor HZL were conscious of the operating law. We are of the considered view that in so holding the sole Arbitrator has not applied his mind and overlooked the Commission's orders dated 30-4-2004, 10-4-2006 and 22-5-2006 rendering his conclusions/ finding that the operating law was overlooked when the agreements dated 10-3-2005 were entered into wholly perverse. The Arbitrator has also overlooked Section 28(1)(a) of the Act of 1996 which mandates that in a domestic arbitration, the arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute referred to him in accordance with the substantive law for the time being in force in India and Section 28(3) of the Act of 1996. The substantive law in force in India at the time of passing of the impugned award dated 25-8-2007 indisputably would include the Contract Act, 1872 (hereafter `the Act of 1872'). Section 21 thereof inter alia provides that \"a contract is not voidable because it was caused by a mistake as to any law in force, even where there be one. Section 23 of the Act of 1872 provides that \"the consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless it is forbidden by law, is of such nature that if permitted it would defeat the provisions of any law or is fraudulent or involves or implies injury to the person or property of another or the court regards it as immoral or opposed to public policy. \nWe are for reason of Section 21 of the Act of 1872, of the considered view that the open access agreement/s dated 10-3-2005 and the clauses incorporated therein were, irrespective of any alleged mistake of law as found in the award dated 25-8-2007 (though we disagree for reasons recorded above) were not voidable. The Apex Court in the case of Dhanyalakshmi Rice Mills Vs. the Commissioner of Civil Supplies [(1976)4 SCC 723] held that a contract entered into under a mistake of law, by both the contracting parties falls under Section 21 of the Contract Act and cannot for that reason be voidable. \nThe respondent HZL from its pleadings before the sole arbitrator and evidence in support also failed to establish that any of the five situations set out under Section 23 of the Act of 1872 rendered the open access agreements dated 10-3-2005 unlawful. Yet the Arbitrator has in the absence of any valid legal ground under Section 23 of the Act of 1872 perversely concluded that clauses 2, 5, 8(c), 9, 11(d)(e) and 13(d) of the agreements dated 10-3-2005 were unlawful and unenforceable. The impugned award dated 25-8- 2007 as well as the judgment dated 25-2-2017 passed by the Commercial Court rejecting the Section 34 objections thereagainst are thus not sustainable in law. They are so held to be. \nFurther admittedly HZL has taken advantage of the open access facility under the agreement/s dated 10-3-2005 and admittedly the power generated at its CPP at Chanderiya transmitted to its three units at Aghucha, Debari and Dariba. Subsequent thereto in 2007, after the reference by the Commission on 12-2-2007 HZL could not seek to renege on its obligation under the OA agreements in issue and pray for declaring conditions thereof relating to AVVNL's right to levy UI and other charges and HZL's corresponding obligations void & unlawful. Such a claim as allowed by the impugned award dated 25-8-2007 renders the award itself unconscionable. The Apex Court in the case of Shin Satellite Public Co. Ltd. Vs. Jain Studios Ltd. [(2006)2 SCC 628] has recognised the equitable principle in the construction of contracts and held that where a party would not have agreed on certain terms of the agreement had it known the other terms agreed to its benefit would be held to be invalid or unlawful, the doctrine of severability would not apply for the reason that so to do would be wholly inequitable and contrary to justice. In the case of Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh Limited vs. Sai Renewable Power Private Limited [(2011)11 SCC 34] the Apex Court held that when benefit is taken under a contract on some of its conditions it is not possible to sustain the plea of invalidity qua other conditions of the contract by the beneficiary party under the said contract unless the party benefitting can compensate the other for the benefit taken. Severability of the contract in such situation even where otherwise possible, declaring invalid certain terms and conditions, would not be permissible. In the case of Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation vs. Diamond and Gem Development Corporation Limited [(2013)5 SCC 470] the Apex Court held that a party cannot play hot and cold, both approbate and reprobate and after gaining benefits of the contract cannot challenge its conditions with regard to its obligation. In such situations it would be estopped from denying the validity of any of the terms and conditions of the contract. \nSuch a situation obtains in the instant appeal. Having obtained open access to AVVNL's distribution lines and supplied power generated at its CPP Chanderiya (Chittorgarh) to its three units Aghucha, Debari and Dariba and at no time prior to laying of claim before the Sole Arbitrator in 2007 having even questioned its liabilities on principle towards UI charges and other levies/ charges under the OA agreements dated 10-3-2005 , HZL could not be permitted on receipt of the bill from AVVNL in January 2007 to question the conditions of the OA agreements dated 10-3-2005 in respect of its obligations to pay agreed charges under various heads. It could only, if so advised, question the bill's arithmetic alone before the appropriate forum. In overlooking this fact as also the Commission's orders dated 10-4-2006 and 22-5-2006 on UI charges being payable by HZL on mismatch between scheduled and actual drawls and scheduled versus actual injections of power, the sole Arbitrator acted wholly contrary to the terms of the contract, between the parties as mandated under Section 28(3) of the Act of 1996. The award is thus vitiated by \"patent illegality\" within the meaning ascribed to the term by the Apex Court in the case of Associate Builders Vs. Delhi Development Authority [(2015)3 SCC 49]. The award dated 25-8-2007 is liable to be set aside also on this ground. So is the Commercial Court's judgment dated 25-2-2017 rejecting the AVVNL's objections to the award. \nThe upshot of the aforesaid discussion is that neither the award dated 25-8-2007 nor the impugned judgment dated 25-2- 2017 passed by the Commercial Court dismissing appellant's objections under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 thereof are sustainable. Resultantly are quashed and set aside. \nAppeal is accordingly allowed. \n(Alok Sharma), J.

vide the said impugned order, the aforementioned applications under section 34 read with section 48 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the act of 1996') have been decided by the learned single judge while holding against the appellant-hindustan zinc limited (for short, 'hzl'), by giving a finding that the applications against the impugned arbitral awards dated 17.08.2017 passed by the arbitral tribunal appointed by london court of international arbitration, as having been not maintainable. 7. brief facts of the case, as noticed by this court, are that the parties had entered into an agreement that provided that the contract and the arbitration clause were to be governed by law of england and wales, and all the disputes were to be finally settled by the arbitration venue in london, united kingdom and in accordance with the rules of the london court of international arbitration (hereinafter referred to as 'the lcia rules'). the (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (4 of 46) [sac-3/2019] arbitration clause was invoked by the hzl and its request for arbitration was made to the registrar of london court of international arbitration (for short, 'lcia'), wherein the hzl indicated the seat of arbitration to be london, while taking specific plea in regard thereto. the arbitration awards dated 17.08.2017 were passed against hzl. 8. mr. sumeet lall, learned counsel for the respondent, at the threshold, has raised a preliminary objection with regard to maintainability of the appeals, by making the following submissions. 9. learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the instant appeals are not maintainable inter alia being contrary to the ratio laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in bgs sgs soma jv vs. nhpc ltd., reported in 2019 scc online sc 1585. learned counsel for the respondent also submitted that the appellant-hzl itself had averred that the seat of arbitration was london, united kingdom, thereby there was an express exclusion of part i of the act of 1996. 10. learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that an appeal under section 37 of the act of 1996 can only be preferred from the orders set out under clause a, b & c under section 37 and from no others. section 37(1) of the act of 1996 reads as under: \"37. appealable orders.(1) an appeal shall lie from the following orders (and from no others) to the court authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the court passing the order, namely:(a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8; (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (5 of 46) [sac-3/2019] (b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9; (c) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34.\" 11. learned counsel for the respondent also submitted that the impugned order has been passed by the learned single judge on the basis that since the seat of the arbitration was london, united kingdom, therefore, the arbitration applications under section 34 of the act of 1996 were not maintainable, which makes it all the more imperative that the jurisdiction of section 37 of the act of 1996 is not available to the present appellants. 12. learned counsel for the respondent has principally relied upon the judgment of bgs sgs soma jv (supra), to drive home the issue of maintainability as well as the question regarding seat of arbitration. relevant portion of the said judgment in bgs sgs soma jv (supra) reads as under: \"2. three appeals before us raise questions as to maintainability of appeals under section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the arbitration act, 1996\"), and, given the arbitration clause in these proceedings, whether the \"seat\" of the arbitration proceedings is new delhi or faridabad, consequent upon which a petition under section 34 of the arbitration act, 1996 may be filed dependent on where the seat of arbitration is located. 6. dr. abhishek manu singhvi, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner in slp (c) no. 25618 of 2018, has assailed the impugned high court judgment on both counts. according to him, on a combined reading of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 and section 37 of the arbitration act, 1996, it becomes clear that section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 only provides the forum for challenge, whereas section 37 of the (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (6 of 46) [sac-3/2019] arbitration act, 1996 which is expressly referred to in the proviso to section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, 2015 circumscribes the right of appeal. he contended that this when read with section 5 of the arbitration act, 1996, makes it clear that only certain judgments and orders are appealable, and no appeal lies under any provision outside section 37 of the arbitration act, 1996. he contended that the high court was manifestly wrong when it said that the present appeal was appealable under section 37(1)(c) of the arbitration act, 1996 as being an appeal against an order refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34 of the arbitration act, 1996. according to dr. singhvi, an order which allows an application under section 151 read with order vii rule 10 of the cpc can by no stretch of the imagination amount to an order refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34 of the arbitration act, 1996. for this proposition, he strongly relied upon on our judgment in kandla export corporation v. oci corporation, (2018) 14 scc 715. on the second point, he read out the impugned judgment in detail, and stated that the ultimate conclusion that new delhi was only a \"venue\" and not the \"seat\" of the arbitration was incorrect, as the parties have chosen to have sittings at new delhi, as a result of which it is clear that the arbitral tribunal considered that the award made at new delhi would be made at \"the seat\" of the arbitral proceedings between the parties. he further added that it was clear that even if both new delhi and faridabad had jurisdiction, new delhi being the choice of the parties, the principle contained in hakam singh v. gammon (india) ltd., (1971) 1 scc 286, would govern. he referred in copious detail to many judgments of this court, including the five judge bench in bharat aluminium co. (balco) v. kaiser aluminium technical service, inc., (2012) 9 scc 552, indus mobile distribution private limited v. datawind innovations private limited, (2017) 7 scc 678, and various other judgments to buttress his submissions. according to (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (7 of 46) [sac-3/2019] him, the recent judgment delivered in union of india v. hardy exploration and production (india) inc., 2018 scc online sc 1640 queers the pitch, in that it is directly contrary to the five judge bench decision in balco (supra). it is only as a result of the confusion caused by judgments such as hardy exploration and production (india) inc. (supra) that the impugned judgment has arrived at the wrong conclusion that new delhi is not the \"seat\", but only the \"venue\" of the present arbitral proceedings. he, therefore, in the course of his submissions argued that this confusion should be removed, and exhorted us to declare that hardy exploration and production (india) inc. (supra) was not correctly decided, being contrary to the larger bench in balco (supra). 13. the interplay between section 37 of the arbitration act, 1996 and section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, has been laid down in some detail in the judgment in kandla export corporation (supra). the precise question that arose in kandla export corporation (supra) was as to whether an appeal, which was not maintainable under section 50 of the arbitration act, 1996, is nonetheless maintainable under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, 2015. in this context, after setting out various provisions of the commercial courts act, 2015 and the arbitration act, 1996, this court held: \"13. section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, with which we are immediately concerned in these appeals, is in two parts. the main provision is, as has been correctly submitted by shri giri, a provision which provides for appeals from judgments, orders and decrees of the commercial division of the high court. to this main provision, an exception is carved out by the proviso.\" 14. the proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by the commercial division of the high court that are specifically enumerated under order 43 of the code of civil procedure code, (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (8 of 46) [sac-3/2019] 1908, and section 37 of the arbitration act. it will at once be noticed that orders that are not specifically enumerated under order 43 cpc would, therefore, not be appealable, and appeals that are mentioned in section 37 of the arbitration act alone are appeals that can be made to the commercial appellate division of a high court. 16. this provision is conspicuous by its absence in section 37 of the arbitration act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of filing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside awards under section 34. also, what is missed by the impugned judgment is the words \"under section 34\". thus, the refusal to set aside an arbitral award must be under section 34, i.e., after the grounds set out in section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question, and after the court has turned down such grounds. admittedly, on the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under section 34 of the arbitration act, 1996 all that was done was that the special commercial court at gurugram allowed an application filed under section 151 read with order vii rule 10 cpc, determining that the special commercial court at gurugram had no jurisdiction to proceed further with the section 34 application, and therefore, such application would have to be returned to the competent court situate at new delhi. 19. the reasoning in this judgment commends itself to us, as a distinction is made between judgments which either set aside, or refuse to set aside, an arbitral award after the court applies its mind to section 34 of the arbitration act, 1996, as against preliminary orders of condonation of delay, which do not in any way impact the arbitral award that has been assailed. 22. it is clear, therefore, that the appeals filed in the present case do not fall within section 37 of the arbitration act, 1996 and are not maintainable.\" 13. learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that it is settled position of law that an appeal is a creature of (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (9 of 46) [sac-3/2019] statute and must either be found within the four corners of the statute or it shall not be maintainable, and in this regard, he has relied upon rendered by division bench of the hon'ble delhi high court in south delhi municipal corporation vs. tech mahindra, reported in 2019 scc online del 11863, relevant portion of which reads as under: \"2. the respondent's threshold contention was that the appeal is per se not maintainable in view of the phraseology of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015. in answer, mr. sanjay poddar, learned senior counsel urges on behalf of sdmc that the impugned order in all intents and purposes amounts to an attachment before judgment, as the awarded amount is directed to be secured, and is therefore covered by provisions of order xxxviii rule 2 of code of civil procedure (c.p.c.). it is further submitted that such order is appealable by virtue of section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, 2015 (hereafter \"the cc act\") read with order xliii rule 1(q) of the cpc, given that the mandate of section 36 of the act, cpc applies to proceedings under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the arbitration act\"). 7. the judgment in kandla export corporation (supra) noticed the statement of objects and reasons, of the commercial courts act. the supreme court had to deal with an enforcement appeal before a commercial appellate court, in regard to a foreign award, and its maintainability. the supreme court noticed not only the statement of objects and reasons but also various other provisions, especially the embargo placed upon the courts, embodied in sections 8 and 11 and the overriding nature of the cc act, to conclude that once appeals were held to be barred, an appeal to the division bench appeal against a commercial court's order in an enforcement of a foreign award issue was (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (10 of 46) [sac-3/2019] not maintainable. the court took into account its previous rulings in fuerst day lawson limited v. jindal exports limited, (2011) 8 scc 333 and some other judgments. 8. the statement of objects and reasons for the commercial courts act, states that: \"the proposal to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes has been under consideration of the government for quite some time. the high value commercial disputes involve complex facts and questions of law. therefore, there is a need to provide for an independent mechanism for their early resolution. early resolution of commercial disputes shall create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive indian legal system. xxx 6. it is proposed to introduce the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts bill, 2015 to replace the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts ordinance, 2015 which inter alia, provides for the following namely:-(i) constitution of the commercial courts at district level except for the territory over which any high court is having ordinary original civil jurisdiction; (ii) constitution of the commercial divisions in those high courts which are already exercising ordinary civil jurisdiction and they shall have territorial jurisdiction over such areas on which it has original jurisdiction; (iii) constitution of the commercial appellate division in all the high courts to hear the appeals against the orders of the commercial courts and the orders of the commercial division of the high court; (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (11 of 46) [sac-3/2019] (iv) the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of such commercial courts and commercial division is proposed as one crore rupees; and (v) to amend the code of civil procedure, 1908 as applicable to the commercial courts and commercial divisions which shall prevail over the existing high courts rules and other provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. 7. the proposed bill shall accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the indian justice delivery system, and the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation.\" 9. it is quite evident that the legislative or parliamentary intent, was to confer upon the commercial appellate courts and commercial appellate division bench of a high court, extremely limited jurisdiction and circumscribe the appellate jurisdiction. thus, in interlocutory matters, as it were, commercial appellate division possesses jurisdiction in matters enumerated in the order xliii rule 1 no less no more. likewise, with respect to the appeals against orders made in the course of proceedings under the arbitration act, the court's power is delineated to what is enumerated in section 37 of cpc. 10. in kandla export corporation (supra), the court held as follows: \"14. section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, with which we are immediately concerned in these appeals, is in two parts. the main provision is, as has been correctly submitted by shri giri, a provision which provides for appeals from judgments, orders and decrees of the commercial division of the high court. to this main provision, an exception is carved out by the proviso. the primary purpose of a proviso is to qualify the generality of the main part by providing an exception, which has been set out with great felicity (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (12 of 46) [sac-3/2019] in cit v. indo mercantile bank ltd., 1959 supp (2) scr 256 at 266-267, thus: ******** ********* 15. the proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by the commercial division of the high court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure code, 1908, and section 37 section 37 of the arbitration act. it will at once be noticed that orders that are not specifically enumerated under order xliii of the cpc would, therefore, not be appealable, and appeals that are mentioned in section 37 of the arbitration act alone are appeals that can be made to the commercial appellate division of a high court. 16. thus, an order which refers parties to arbitration under section 8, not being appealable under section 37(1)(a), would not be appealable under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. similarly, an appeal rejecting a plea referred to in sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 16 of the arbitration act would equally not be appealable under section 37(2)(a) and, therefore, under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act.\" 11. the reference to order xliii rule 1 relied upon on behalf of sdmc in the context of this case, in the opinion of this court, is misplaced. order xliii rule 1(q), upon which considerable emphasis was placed to say that the appeals against directions to secure amounts during pendency of proceedings applies to suits and suits alone (as is evident from order xxxviii and all the attendant provisions), and not to proceedings in respect of an award. thus, reference to order xliii to \"draw in\" the jurisdiction of the division bench, is wholly unjustified. likewise, the court also rejects the appellant's arguments that section 36 of the arbitration act attracts the provisions of the code of civil procedure. in fact, section 36 refers to and directs courts to follow cpc in proceedings relating to enforcement of arbitral awards. the logical corollary is (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (13 of 46) [sac-3/2019] that the provisions of the cpc that deal with the proceeding for enforcement of decrees and orders (such as in execution like order xxi cpc), would be attracted. 12. in view of the above discussions, we conclude that the present appeal is not maintainable. the appellant's remedy clearly lies elsewhere. an attempt was made to urge that no litigant can be deprived of remedy if there is a grievance: ubi jus ibi remedium; however, that argument is wholly without substance because an appeal, it has been repeatedly emphasised, is a specific creation of statute and cannot be claimed as a matter of right. this was explained pithily in ganga bai v. vijay kumar, (1974) 2 scc 393, in the following terms: \"there is a basic distinction between the right of suit and the right of appeal. there is an inherent right in every person to bring suit of a civil nature and unless the suit is barred by statute one may, at one's peril, bring a suit of one's choice. it is no answer to a suit howsoever frivolous the claim, that the law confers no such right to sue. a suit for its maintainability requires no authority of law and it is enough that no statute bars the suit. but the position in regard to appeals is quite the opposite. the right of appeal inheres in no one and therefore an appeal for its maintainability must have the clear authority of law. that explains why the right of appeal is described as a creature of statute.\" 13. in view of the above discussion, it is held that the present appeal is plainly not maintainable by virtue of provisions of the commercial courts act, 2015; the appeal is therefore dismissed. no costs.\" 14. learned counsel for the respondent has further relied upon harmanprit singh sidhu vs. arcadia shares & stock brokers pvt. ltd., reported in 2016 scc online del 5383, whereby the division bench of hon'ble delhi high court has (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (14 of 46) [sac-3/2019] expressly recognized a distinction between the judgments which either set aside or refuse to set aside an arbitral award after the court applies its mind to section 37 of the act of 1996 as against the preliminary orders, including those deciding maintainability and condonation of delay, which do not in any way impact the arbitral award that has been assailed. relevant portion of said judgment reads as under: \"8. insofar as section 13 of the commercial courts act is concerned, while it is true that it speaks of appeals from a judgment or order, the proviso to section 13(1) makes it clear that the appeal would lie from such orders passed by, inter alia, a commercial division that are specifically enumerated under order 43 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (as amended by the commercial courts act) and section 37 of the a&c act. the use of the word 'and' in the proviso to section 13(1) is only to specify that an appeal would lie against any order passed by, inter alia, a commercial division, which finds mention in the list of orders specified in order 43, cpc and section 37 of the a&c act. it is an admitted position that the impugned order having been passed in proceedings arising out of an arbitral award would have to be governed by section 37 of the a&c act. 9. on a plain reading of section 13 of the commercial courts act, it is evident that it does not amplify the scope of appealable orders specified in section 37 of the a&c act. it actually reiterates that, in a matter of arbitration, an appeal shall lie only from the orders specified in section 37 of the a&c act. in fact, section 13(2) reinforces this by providing that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or the letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (15 of 46) [sac-3/2019] than in accordance with the provisions of the commercial courts act. 10. coming to section 37(1), it is evident that an appeal can lie from only the orders specified in clauses (a), (b) or (c). in other words, an appeal under section 37 would only be maintainable against (a) an order refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8 of the a&c act; (b) an order granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9 of the a&c act; or (c) an order setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34 of the a&c act. the impugned order is clearly not relatable to sections 8 or 9 of the a&c act. it was sought to be contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that the present appeal would fall within section 37(1)(c) which relates to an order \"setting aside\" or \"refusing to set aside\" an arbitral award under section 34. we are unable to accept this proposition. by virtue of the impugned order, the arbitral award dated 10.09.2013 has not been set aside. nor has the court, at this stage, refused to set aside the said arbitral award under section 34 of the a&c act. in fact, the appellant in whose favour the award has been made, would only be aggrieved if the award were to have been set aside in whole or in part. that has not happened. what the learned single judge has done is to have condoned the delay in re-filing of the petition under section 34. this has not, in any way, impacted the award. 13. in sum, the impugned order does not fall within the category of appealable orders specified in section 37(1) of the a&c act. therefore, even if the provisions of section 37(1) are read with section 13 of the commercial courts act, the present appeal is not maintainable. this, however, does not mean that the appellant cannot take up the ground that is sought to be urged before us if the decision in omp 294/2014 (under section 34 of the a&c act) goes against him. in other words, if the arbitral award is set aside in part or in whole and the appellant is aggrieved thereby, he (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (16 of 46) [sac-3/2019] may prefer an appeal under section 37 of the a&c act on merits as also on the ground that the delay in refiling ought not to have been condoned. this is in line with the scheme of the a&c act of not, in any way, stalling the proceedings thereunder. for example, under section 13(4) of the a&c act, if a challenge to an arbitrator is not successful, the arbitral tribunal is required to continue the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award and, in such an instance, as provided in section 13(5) of the a&c act, the party challenging the arbitrator may make an application for setting aside such an arbitral award in accordance with section 34. in other words, recourse to a remedy for an unsuccessful challenge to an arbitrator is deferred till the stage of the making of the award. similarly, under section 16, an arbitral tribunal may rule on its jurisdiction. in a case where the arbitral tribunal rejects a plea with regard to its jurisdiction, it is enjoined by section 16(5) of the a&c act to continue with the arbitral proceedings and to make the arbitral award. section 16(6) stipulates that a party aggrieved by such an arbitral award may make an application for setting aside the award in accordance with section 34. here, too, the unsuccessful party, who challenges the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal, is asked to wait till the award is made. the remedy of questioning the decision of the arbitral tribunal with regard to the arbitrator's jurisdiction in such a case is not extinguished but is merely deferred till the making of the arbitral award. in similar vein, in the present case, the remedy of challenging the decision of condoning the delay in re-filing is not extinguished but is deferred till the final decision of the court on the pending section 34 petition. 14. in view of the discussion above, the present appeal is not maintainable and is dismissed.\" 15. learned counsel for the respondent, while relying upon the precedent law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (17 of 46) [sac-3/2019] kandla export corporation & anr. vs. oci corporation & anr., reported in (2018) 14 scc 715, submitted that by the aforesaid judgment the hon'ble apex court clarified the position on forum selection and the interplay between section 37 of the act of 1996 and section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015. relevant portion of the said judgment reads as under:\"13. section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, with which we are immediately concerned in these appeals, is in two parts. the main provision is, as has been correctly submitted by shri giri, a provision which provides for appeals from judgments, orders and decrees of the commercial division of the high court. to this main provision, an exception is carved out by the proviso. the primary purpose of a proviso is to qualify the generality of the main part by providing an exception, which has been set out with great felicity in cit v. indo-mercantile bank ltd. [cit v. indomercantile bank ltd., 1959 supp (2) scr 256 : air 1959 sc 713] , thus: (scr pp. 266-67 : air pp. 71718, paras 9-10) \"9. . the proper function of a proviso is that it qualifies the generality of the main enactment by providing an exception and taking out as it were, from the main enactment, a portion which, but for the proviso would fall within the main enactment. ordinarily it is foreign to the proper function of a proviso to read it as providing something by way of an addendum or dealing with a subject which is foreign to the main enactment. '8. . it is a fundamental rule of construction that a proviso must be considered with relation to the principal matter to which it stands as a proviso.' therefore, it is to be construed harmoniously with the main enactment. (per das, c.j. in abdul jabar butt v. state of j&k [abdul jabar butt v. state of j&k, 1957 scr 51 : air 1957 sc 281 : 1957 cri lj 404] , (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (18 of 46) [sac-3/2019] scr p. 59 : air p. 284, para 8). bhagwati, j., in ram narain sons ltd. v. cst [ram narain sons ltd. v. cst, (1955) 2 scr 483 : air 1955 sc 765] , said: (scr p. 493 : air p. 769, para 10) '10. it is a cardinal rule of interpretation that a proviso to a particular provision of a statute only embraces the field which is covered by the main provision. it carves out an exception to the main provision to which it has been enacted as a proviso and to no other.' 10. lord macmillan in madras & southern mahratta railway co. ltd. v. bezwada municipality [madras & southern mahratta railway co. ltd. v. bezwada municipality, 1944 scc online pc 7 : (1943-44) 71 ia 113] laid down the sphere of a proviso as follows: (ia p. 122 : scc online pc) '. the proper function of a proviso is to except and deal with a case which would otherwise fall within the general language of the main enactment, and its effect is confined to that case. where, as in the present case, the language of the main enactment is clear and unambiguous, a proviso can have no repercussion on the interpretation of the main enactment, so as to exclude, from it by implication what clearly falls within its express terms.' the territory of a proviso therefore is to carve out an exception to the main enactment and exclude something which otherwise would have been within the section. it has to operate in the same field and if the language of the main enactment is clear it cannot be used for the purpose of interpreting the main enactment or to exclude by implication what the enactment clearly says unless the words of the proviso are such that that is its necessary effect. (vide also toronto corpn. v. attorney-general of canada [toronto corpn. v. attorney-general of canada, 1946 ac 32 (pc)] , ac p. 37.)\" 14. the proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by the commercial division of the high court that are specifically enumerated (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (19 of 46) [sac-3/2019] under order 43 of the code of civil procedure code, 1908, and section 37 of the arbitration act. it will at once be noticed that orders that are not specifically enumerated under order 43 cpc would, therefore, not be appealable, and appeals that are mentioned in section 37 of the arbitration act alone are appeals that can be made to the commercial appellate division of a high court. 15. thus, an order which refers parties to arbitration under section 8, not being appealable under section 37(1)(a), would not be appealable under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. similarly, an appeal rejecting a plea referred to in sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 16 of the arbitration act would equally not be appealable under section 37(2)(a) and, therefore, under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. 20. given the judgment of this court in fuerst day lawson [fuerst day lawson ltd. v. jindal exports ltd., (2011) 8 scc 333 : (2011) 4 scc (civ) 178] , which parliament is presumed to know when it enacted the arbitration amendment act, 2015, and given the fact that no change was made in section 50 of the arbitration act when the commercial courts act was brought into force, it is clear that section 50 is a provision contained in a self-contained code on matters pertaining to arbitration, and which is exhaustive in nature. it carries the negative import mentioned in para 89 of fuerst day lawson [fuerst day lawson ltd. v. jindal exports ltd., (2011) 8 scc 333 : (2011) 4 scc (civ) 178] that appeals which are not mentioned therein, are not permissible. this being the case, it is clear that section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, being a general provision vis-à-vis arbitration relating to appeals arising out of commercial disputes, would obviously not apply to cases covered by section 50 of the arbitration act. 21. however, the question still arises as to why section 37 of the arbitration act was expressly included in the proviso to section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, which is equally a special (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (20 of 46) [sac-3/2019] provision of appeal contained in a self-contained code, which in any case would be outside section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. one answer is that this was done ex abundanti cautela. another answer may be that as section 37 itself was amended by the arbitration amendment act, 2015, which came into force on the same day as the commercial courts act, parliament thought, in its wisdom, that it was necessary to emphasise that the amended section 37 would have precedence over the general provision contained in section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. incidentally, the amendment of 2015 introduced one more category into the category of appealable orders in the arbitration act, namely, a category where an order is made under section 8 refusing to refer parties to arbitration. parliament may have found it necessary to emphasise the fact that an order referring parties to arbitration under section 8 is not appealable under section 37(1)(a) and would, therefore, not be appealable under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. whatever may be the ultimate reason for including section 37 of the arbitration act in the proviso to section 13(1), the ratio decidendi of the judgment in fuerst day lawson [fuerst day lawson ltd. v. jindal exports ltd., (2011) 8 scc 333 : (2011) 4 scc (civ) 178] would apply, and this being so, appeals filed under section 50 of the arbitration act would have to follow the drill of section 50 alone. 22. this, in fact, follows from the language of section 50 itself. in all arbitration cases of enforcement of foreign awards, it is section 50 alone that provides an appeal. having provided for an appeal, the forum of appeal is left \"to the court authorised by law to hear appeals from such orders\". section 50 properly read would, therefore, mean that if an appeal lies under the said provision, then alone would section 13(1) of the commercial courts act be attracted as laying down the forum which will hear and decide such an appeal. 27. the matter can be looked at from a slightly different angle. given the objects of both the statutes, (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (21 of 46) [sac-3/2019] it is clear that arbitration itself is meant to be a speedy resolution of disputes between parties. equally, enforcement of foreign awards should take place as soon as possible if india is to remain as an equal partner, commercially speaking, in the international community. in point of fact, the raison d'être for the enactment of the commercial courts act is that commercial disputes involving high amounts of money should be speedily decided. given the objects of both the enactments, if we were to provide an additional appeal, when section 50 does away with an appeal so as to speedily enforce foreign awards, we would be turning the arbitration act and the commercial courts act on their heads. admittedly, if the amount contained in a foreign award to be enforced in india were less than rs 1 crore, and a single judge of a high court were to enforce such award, no appeal would lie, in keeping with the object of speedy enforcement of foreign awards. however, if, in the same fact circumstance, a foreign award were to be for rs 1 crore or more, if the appellants are correct, enforcement of such award would be further delayed by providing an appeal under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. any such interpretation would lead to absurdity, and would be directly contrary to the object sought to be achieved by the commercial courts act viz. speedy resolution of disputes of a commercial nature involving a sum of rs 1 crore and over. for this reason also, we feel that section 13(1) of the commercial courts act must be construed in accordance with the object sought to be achieved by the act. any construction of section 13 of the commercial courts act, which would lead to further delay, instead of an expeditious enforcement of a foreign award must, therefore, be eschewed. even on applying the doctrine of harmonious construction of both statutes, it is clear that they are best harmonised by giving effect to the special statute i.e. the arbitration act, vis-à-vis the more general statute, (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (22 of 46) [sac-3/2019] namely, the commercial courts act, being left to operate in spheres other than arbitration.\" learned counsel for the respondent also submitted that by the virtue of the judgment in kandla export corporation & anr. (supra), it is clear that a joint reading of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 and section 37 of the act of 1996 makes it amply clear that section 13 of the commercial courts act only provides the forum for challenge, whereas section 37 of the act of 1996 expressly referred to in the proviso to section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, circumscribes right of appeal, and thus, there can be no appeal under any provision outside section 37 of the act of 1996. 16. learned counsel for the respondent, regarding the exclusion of part i of the act of 1996 on account of seat of arbitration in london, united kingdom, referred to the judgment by this hon'ble court in r.k. industries vs. maximus international general trading & anr., reported in 2019(1) rlw 347 (raj.), relevant portion of which reads as under: \"46. the contention of the appellant that though the panel of arbitrator has kept a sitting in london and commenced the proceedings in london, it is only a venue of arbitration and the seat of arbitration remains in india, is equally flawed and fallacious. such argument of the appellant is contrary to the facts involved in the case and the same has no legal basis or support. mere use of the words \"the said rules in india\", does not shift the seat of arbitration to india, particularly when, the venue of arbitration has been in england. various factors are required to be reckoned to treat the venue to be a seat. until and unless the contract or the arbitration clause in express terms defines or provides that the seat of arbitration shall be (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (23 of 46) [sac-3/2019] india, the bare use of the words \"rules in india\", or the mere fact that the appellant operates from india, the seat of arbitration cannot be said to be situated in india. 47. as the seat of arbitration is in london and not in india, in our considered view, the jurisdiction of this court to hear an application under section 34 of the act is clearly barred, as a result of the provision contained in section 2 (2) of the act of 1996, which confines the applicability of part first of the act to the cases where the place of arbitration is in india. in the present case even the seat of arbitration, much less the venue of arbitration is in london, hence, the courts in india cease to have jurisdiction to proceed under the provisions of part i of the act of 1996, including the jurisdiction to entertain the application under section 34 of the act. 53. the learned single judge has relied upon the judgment of the supreme court in the case of roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma reported in (2017) 14 scc 722 and considered various relevant paragraphs of the said judgment, while holding that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain an application under section 34 of the act of 1996. a perusal of the judgment of roger shashoua (supra) reveals that hon'ble supreme court has referred to and dealt with all the judgments on the subject and in almost identical fact situation has held that the london has not been mentioned as the mere location, but it has been written that the courts in london will have jurisdiction. in the present facts also, if the arbitration clause is read in conjunction with rule 8 with the rules relating to arbitration of the refined sugar association, it leaves no room for ambiguity that in the present case also, the seat of arbitration is in london (england), hence all proceedings relating to challenge to the award shall take place in england. 54. as an upshot of the above discussion, we concur with and hence, confirm the view of learned single (downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:37 pm) (24 of 46) [sac-3/2019] judge that in the present case seat of arbitration is in england. 55. the appellant's grievance against the impugned award dated 17.3.2017 can not be heard or redressed by this court or any of the courts of india, as the jurisdiction of the courts of india is expressly barred.\" 17. learned counsel for the respondent has also referred to the request for arbitration dated 03.06.2014, and for ready reference, the material portion thereof, as reflected in the record, reads as under:\"4. the matters of the arbitration 4.1. in accordance with the arbitration agreement, the parties have agreed that : (a) the seat of the arbitration is london; . (d) the procedural law of the arbitration is english law; and (e) the substantive law of the arbitration is english law.\" 18. learned counsel for the respondent has also relied upon the precedent law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in eitzen bulk a/s vs. ashapura minechem limited & anr., reported in (2016) 11 scc 508, for demonstrating that in such cases, the english law can only apply for all purposes, once the same was applied for conduct of arbitration and grant of award, as it amounts to express exclusion of applicability of part i of the act of 1996. relevant portion of the said judgment reads as under: \"33. we are thus of the view that by clause 28, the parties chose to exclude the application of part i to the arbitration proceedings between them by choosing london as the venue for arbitration and by making english law applicable to arbitration, as observed earlier. it is too well settled by now that where the parties choose a juridical seat of arbitration outside (25 of 46) [sac-3/2019] india and provide that the law which governs arbitration will be a law other than indian law, part i of the act would not have any application and, therefore, the award debtor would not be entitled to challenge the award by raising objections under section 34 before a court in india. a court in india could not have jurisdiction to entertain such objections under section 34 in such a case. 34. as a matter of fact the mere choosing of the juridical seat of arbitration attracts the law applicable to such location. in other words, it would not be necessary to specify which law would apply to the arbitration proceedings, since the law of the particular country would apply ipso jure. the following passage from redfern and hunter on international arbitration contains the following explication of the issue: \"it is also sometimes said that parties have selected the procedural law that will govern their arbitration, by providing for arbitration in a particular country. this is too elliptical and, as an english court itself held more recently in breas of doune wind farm it does not always hold true. what the parties have done is to choose a place of arbitration in a particular country. that choice brings with it submission to the laws of that country, including any mandatory provisions of its law on arbitration. to say that the parties have \"chosen\" that particular law to govern the arbitration is rather like saying that an english woman who takes her car to france has \"chosen\" french traffic law, which will oblige her to drive on the right-hand side of the road, to give priority to vehicles approaching from the right, and generally to obey traffic laws to which she may not be accustomed. but it would be an odd use of language to say this notional motorist had opted for \"french traffic law\". what she has done is to choose to go to france. the applicability of french law then follows automatically. it is not a matter of choice. (26 of 46) [sac-3/2019] parties may well choose a particular place of arbitration precisely because its lex arbitri is one which they find attractive. nevertheless, once a place of arbitration has been chosen, it brings with it its own law. if that law contains provisions that are mandatory so far as arbitration are concerned, those provisions must be obeyed. it is not a matter of choice any more than the notional motorist is free to choose which local traffic laws to obey and which to disregard.\" 19. learned counsel for the respondent has also placed reliance on the precedent law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in union of india vs. reliance industries limited & ors, reported in (2015) 10 scc 213, whereby the hon'ble supreme court has held that the seat of arbitration, as specified in the relevant arbitration clause, shall be the criteria. relevant portion of the said judgment reads as under: \"20. it is interesting to note that even though the law governing the arbitration agreement was not specified, yet this court held, having regard to various circumstances, that the seat of arbitration would be london and therefore, by necessary implication, the ratio of bhatia international [bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a., (2002) 4 scc 105] would not apply. 21. the last paragraph of balco [balco v. kaiser aluminium technical services inc., (2012) 9 scc 552 : (2012) 4 scc (civ) 810] judgment has now to be read with two caveats, both emanating from para 32 of bhatia international [bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a., (2002) 4 scc 105] itself -that where the court comes to a determination that the juridical seat is outside india or where law other than indian law governs the arbitration agreement, part i of the arbitration act, 1996 would be excluded by necessary implication. therefore, even in the cases governed by the bhatia [bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a., (2002) 4 scc 105] principle, it is only those cases in which agreements (27 of 46) [sac-3/2019] stipulate that the seat of the arbitration is in india or on whose facts a judgment cannot be reached on the seat of the arbitration as being outside india that would continue to be governed by the bhatia [bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a., (2002) 4 scc 105] principle. also, it is only those agreements which stipulate or can be read to stipulate that the law governing the arbitration agreement is indian law which would continue to be governed by the bhatia [bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a., (2002) 4 scc 105] rule. 22. on the facts in the present case, it is clear that this court has already determined both that the juridical seat of the arbitration is at london and that the arbitration agreement is governed by english law. this being the case, it is not open to the union of india to argue that part i of the arbitration act, 1996 would be applicable. a section 14 application made under part i would consequently not be maintainable. it needs to be mentioned that shri ranjit kumar's valiant attempt to reopen a question settled twice over, that is, by dismissal of both a review petition [union of india v. reliance industries ltd., review petition (c) no. 1378 of 2014 in civil appeal no. 5765 of 2014, order dated 31-7-2014 (sc), wherein it was directed:\"order(before jagdish singh khehar and dr a.k. sikri, jj.)the union of india

hence, the curative petition is dismissed.\"] on the very ground urged before us, must meet with the same fate. his argument citing mathura prasad bajoo jaiswal v. dossibai n.b. jeejeebhoy [(1970) 1 scc 613] that res judicata would not attach to questions relating to jurisdiction, would not apply in the present case as the effect of clause 34.2 of the psc raises at best a mixed question of fact and law and not a pure question of jurisdiction unrelated to facts. therefore, both on grounds of res judicata as well as the law laid down in the judgment dated 28-5-2014 [reliance industries ltd. v. union of india, (2014) 7 scc 603 : (2014) 3 scc (civ) 737] , this application under section 14 deserves to be dismissed. it is also an abuse of the process of the court as has rightly been argued by dr singhvi. it is only after moving under the uncitral arbitration rules and getting an adverse judgment from the permanent court of arbitration dated 10-6-2013 that the present application was filed under section 14 of the arbitration act two days later i.e. on 12-6-2013.\" 20. learned counsel for the respondent has also placed reliance on the precedent law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in bharat aluminium company vs. kaiser aluminium technical services inc., reported in (2016) 4 scc 126, relevant portion of which reads as under: \"14. it is clear that the law applicable to

[union of india v. reliance industries ltd., (2015) 10 scc 213 : (29 of 46) [sac-3/2019] (2016) 1 scc (civ) 102] reaffirms the same. in the words of r.f. nariman, j.: (scc pp. 228-29, para 21) \"21. the last paragraph of balco [balco v. kaiser aluminium technical services inc., (2012) 9 scc 552 : (2012) 4 scc (civ) 810] judgment has now to be read with two caveats, both emanating from para 32 of bhatia international [bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a., (2002) 4 scc 105] itself--that where the court comes to a determination that the juridical seat is outside india or where law other than indian law governs the arbitration agreement, part i of the arbitration act, 1996 would be excluded by necessary implication. therefore, even in the cases governed by the bhatia [bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a., (2002) 4 scc 105] principle, it is only those cases in which agreements stipulate that the seat of the arbitration is in india or on whose facts a judgment cannot be reached on the seat of the arbitration as being outside india that would continue to be governed by the bhatia [bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a., (2002) 4 scc 105] principle. also, it is only those agreements which stipulate or can be read to stipulate that the law governing the arbitration agreement is indian law which would continue to be governed by the bhatia [bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a., (2002) 4 scc 105] rule.\" 21. learned counsel for the respondent has further relied upon the precedent law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in roger shashoua & ors. vs. mukesh sharma & ors., reported in (2017) 14 scc 722, relevant portion of which reads as under: \"37. the learned judge further observed: \"33. whilst there is no material before me which would fully support an argument on estoppel, it is interesting to note that at an earlier stage of the history of this matter, the defendant had no difficulty in putting (30 of 46) [sac-3/2019] forward london as the seat of the arbitration. on 14-22006 the defendant's lawyers, when writing to the arbitral tribunal stated 'the seat of the arbitration is london and the first respondent submits that the curial law of the arbitration is english law. that means the arbitration is governed by the arbitration act, 1996'. further, when challenging the appointment of mr salve as an arbitrator, in its application to the icc, the defendant said that 'the fact that the present arbitration is an english seated icc arbitration is undisputed. accordingly the icc rules shall be paramount in adjudicating the present challenge. further, the curial seat of arbitration being london, settled propositions of english law shall also substantially impinge upon the matter. this position is taken without prejudice to the first respondent's declared contention that the law of the arbitration agreement is indian law, as also that the substantive law governing the dispute is indian law'. 34. \"london arbitration\" is a well-known phenomenon which is often chosen by foreign nationals with a different law, such as the law of new york, governing the substantive rights of the parties. this is because of the legislative framework and supervisory powers of the courts here which many parties are keen to adopt. when therefore there is an express designation of the arbitration venue as london and no designation of any alternative place as the seat, combined with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is, to my mind, that london is the juridical seat and english law the curial law. in my judgment it is clear that either london has been designated by the parties to the arbitration agreement as the seat of the arbitration or, having regard to the parties' agreement and all the relevant circumstances, it is the seat to be determined in accordance with the final fallback provision of section 3 of the arbitration act.\" and again: (31 of 46) [sac-3/2019] \"37. none of this has any application to the position as between england and india. the body of law which establishes that an agreement to the seat of an arbitration is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause remains good law. if the defendant is right, c v. d [c v. d, 2008 bus lr 843 : 2007 ewca civ 1282 (ca)] would now have to be decided differently. both the usa (with which c v. d [c v. d, 2008 bus lr 843 : 2007 ewca civ 1282 (ca)] was concerned) and india are parties to the new york convention, but the basis of the convention, as explained in c v. d [c v. d, 2008 bus lr 843 : 2007 ewca civ 1282 (ca)] , as applied in england in accordance with its own principles on the conflict of laws, is that the courts of the seat of arbitration are the only courts where the award can be challenged whilst, of course, under article v of the convention there are limited grounds upon which other contracting states can refuse to recognise or enforce the award once made. *** 39. in my judgment therefore there is nothing in the european court decision in front comor [west tankers inc. v. allianz spa, 2009 ac 1138 : (2009) 3 wlr 696 (ecj)] which impacts upon the law as developed in this country in relation to anti-suit injunctions which prevent parties from pursuing proceedings in the courts of a country which is not a member state of the european community, whether on the basis of an exclusive jurisdiction clause, or an agreement to arbitrate (in accordance with the decision in angelic grace [aggeliki charis compania maritima sa v. pagnan spa, (1995) 1 lloyd's rep 87 (ca)] or the agreement of the parties to the supervisory powers of this court by agreeing on london as the seat of the arbitration (in accordance with the decision in c v. d [c v. d, 2008 bus lr 843 : 2007 ewca civ 1282 (ca)] ).\" (32 of 46) [sac-3/2019] 54. we had earlier extracted extensively from the said judgment, as we find, the court after adverting to various aspects, has categorically held that the high court had not followed the shashoua [roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma, 2009 ewhc 957 (comm)] principle. the various decisions referred to in enercon (india) ltd. [enercon (india) ltd. v. enercon gmbh, (2014) 5 scc 1 : (2014) 3 scc (civ) 59] , the analysis made and the propositions deduced leads to an indubitable conclusion that shashoua [roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma, 2009 ewhc 957 (comm)] principle has been accepted by enercon (india) ltd. [enercon (india) ltd. v. enercon gmbh, (2014) 5 scc 1 : (2014) 3 scc (civ) 59] it is also to be noted that in balco [balco v. kaiser aluminium technical services inc., (2012) 9 scc 552 : (2012) 4 scc (civ) 810] , the constitution bench has not merely reproduced few paragraphs from shashoua [roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma, 2009 ewhc 957 (comm)] but has also referred to other decisions on which shashoua [roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma, 2009 ewhc 957 (comm)] has placed reliance upon. as we notice, there is analysis of earlier judgments, though it does not specifically state that \"propositions laid down in shashoua [roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma, 2009 ewhc 957 (comm)] are accepted\". on a clear reading, the ratio of the decision in balco [balco v. kaiser aluminium technical services inc., (2012) 9 scc 552 : (2012) 4 scc (civ) 810] , in the ultimate eventuate, reflects that the shashoua [roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma, 2009 ewhc 957 (comm)] principle has been accepted and the two-judge bench in enercon (india) ltd. [enercon (india) ltd. v. enercon gmbh, (2014) 5 scc 1 : (2014) 3 scc (civ) 59] , after succinctly analysing it, has stated that the said principles have been accepted by the constitution bench. therefore, we are unable to accept the submission of mr chidambaram that the finding recorded in enercon (33 of 46) [sac-3/2019] (india) ltd. [enercon (india) ltd. v. enercon gmbh, (2014) 5 scc 1 : (2014) 3 scc (civ) 59] that shashoua [roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma, 2009 ewhc 957 (comm)] principle has been accepted in balco [balco v. kaiser aluminium technical services inc., (2012) 9 scc 552 : (2012) 4 scc (civ) 810] should be declared as per incuriam. 60. tested on the aforesaid principle, we find that the question that arose in balco [balco v. kaiser aluminium technical services inc., (2012) 9 scc 552 : (2012) 4 scc (civ) 810] and the discussion that has been made by the larger bench relating to shashoua [roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma, 2009 ewhc 957 (comm)] and c v. d [c v. d, 2008 bus lr 843 : 2007 ewca civ 1282 (ca)] are squarely in the context of applicability of part i or part ii of the act. it will not be erroneous to say that the constitution bench has built the propositional pyramid on the basis or foundation of certain judgments and shashoua [roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma, 2009 ewhc 957 (comm)] and c v. d [c v. d, 2008 bus lr 843 : 2007 ewca civ 1282 (ca)] are two of them. it will be inappropriate to say that in enercon (india) ltd. [enercon (india) ltd. v. enercon gmbh, (2014) 5 scc 1 : (2014) 3 scc (civ) 59] the court has cryptically observed that observations made in shashoua [roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma, 2009 ewhc 957 (comm)] have been approvingly quoted by the court in balco [balco v. kaiser aluminium technical services inc., (2012) 9 scc 552 : (2012) 4 scc (civ) 810] in para 110. we are inclined to think, as we are obliged to, that the shashoua [roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma, 2009 ewhc 957 (comm)] principle has been accepted in balco [balco v. kaiser aluminium technical services inc., (2012) 9 scc 552 : (2012) 4 scc (civ) 810] as well as enercon (india) ltd. [enercon (india) ltd. v. enercon gmbh, (2014) 5 scc 1 : (2014) 3 scc (civ) 59] on proper ratiocination and, therefore, the submission advanced on this score by mr (34 of 46) [sac-3/2019] chidambaram, learned senior counsel for the respondent, is repelled. 72. it is worthy to note that the arbitration agreement is not silent as to what law and procedure is to be followed. on the contrary, clause 14.1. lays down that the arbitration proceedings shall be in accordance with the rules of conciliation and arbitration of icc. in enercon (india) ltd. [enercon (india) ltd. v. enercon gmbh, (2014) 5 scc 1 : (2014) 3 scc (civ) 59] , the two-judge bench referring to shashoua case [roger shashoua v. mukesh sharma, 2009 ewhc 957 (comm)] accepted the view of cooke, j. that the phrase \"venue of arbitration shall be in london, uk\" was accompanied by the provision in the arbitration clause or arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the rules of icc in paris. the two-judge bench accepted the rules of icc, paris which is supranational body of rules as has been noted by cooke, j. and that is how it has accepted that the parties have not simply provided for the location of hearings to be in london. to elaborate, the distinction between the venue and the seat remains. but when a court finds that there is prescription for venue and something else, it has to be adjudged on the facts of each case to determine the juridical seat. as in the instant case, the agreement in question has been interpreted and it has been held that london is not mentioned as the mere location but the courts in london will have the jurisdiction, another interpretative perception as projected by the learned senior counsel is unacceptable. 75. we respectfully concur with the said view, for there is no reason to differ. apart from that, we have already held that the agreement in question having been interpreted in a particular manner by the english courts and the said interpretation having gained acceptation by this court, the inescapable conclusion is that the courts in india have no jurisdiction.\" 22. reliance has also been placed by learned counsel for the respondent on the judgment rendered by high court of justice (35 of 46) [sac-3/2019] queen's bench division commercial court, royal courts of justice, strand, london in roger shashoua & ors. vs. mukesh sharma, reported (2009) ewhc 957 (comm), relevant portion of which reads as under: \"30. the two authorities relied on by the defendant, the dubai islamic bank decision of mr justice aikens and the braes of doune decision of mr justice akenhead do not take the defendant's argument any further. in the dubai islamic case, there was no designation of any seat or venue at all. having decided that there were no provisions indicating expressly or impliedly what law governed the arbitration agreement (in the governing visa regulations) or the arbitral procedure itself and that there was no specific reference to either the seat or the place of any arbitration under the visa regulations, the judge held that the seat had to be determined by the court at the date of commencement of the arbitration. he held that the location of the board meeting at which the appeal was heard was entirely adventitious, since it could have taken place in any number of places. having weighed the various factors that are ordinarily taken into account in determining the proper law of an agreement, in looking for the law with which the arbitration had its closest and most real connection, he concluded that this was california. the critical point was that the visa regulations which set up the dispute procedure appeared to contemplate that the appeal arbitral process would be handled through the visa offices in california, but additional factors also supported that conclusion. 31. in the braes of doune decision, the epc contract, under which the dispute arose, was governed by the laws of england and wales and, subject to the arbitration clause, the contract provided that the courts of england and wales were to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of or in connection with the contract. the arbitration clause provided for arbitration pursuant to (36 of 46) [sac-3/2019] the cima rules and then stated in terms that \"this arbitration agreement is subject to english law and the seat of the arbitration shall be glasgow, scotland\". the cima rules expressly referred to the arbitration act 1996 in many places. in looking therefore for the \"juridical seat\", the judge searched for the jurisdiction which the parties are taken to have chosen to supervise the arbitration. given the express references to english law as the law of the arbitration agreement itself and to the arbitration act, it is hardly surprising that the judge found that there was a conflict between that and the reference to glasgow as \"the seat of the arbitration\". as i pointed out at paragraph 26 in c v d and as the court of appeal accepted in paragraphs 22-26 in that case, it is rare for the law of the arbitration agreement to be different from the law of the seat of the arbitration. mr justice akenhead was therefore persuaded that the reference to the \"seat\" of the arbitration was merely a designation of the place where the arbitration was to be held, whereas all the other references showed that the parties were agreeing that the seat and the curial law or law which governed the arbitral proceedings was that of england and wales. 32. in dicey, morris and collins on the conflict of laws, the authors at paragraph 16-035 state that the seat \"is in most cases sufficiently indicated by the country chosen as the place of the arbitration. for such a choice of place not to be given effect as a choice of seat, there will need to be clear evidence that the parties.agreed to choose another seat for the arbitration and that such a choice will be effective to endow the courts of that country with jurisdiction to supervise and support the arbitration\". although the concept of the seat of the arbitration is a juridical concept and the legal seat must not be confused with the geographically convenient place chosen to conduct particular hearings, i can see no reason for not giving the express choice made in clause 14.4 full weight. 33. whilst there is no material before me which would fully support an argument on estoppel, it is interesting to note that at an earlier stage of the history of this matter, (37 of 46) [sac-3/2019] the defendant had no difficulty in putting forward london as the seat of the arbitration. on 14th february 2006 the defendant's lawyers, when writing to the arbitral tribunal stated \"the seat of the arbitration is london and the first respondent submits that the curial law of the arbitration is english law. that means the arbitration is governed by the arbitration act 1996\". further, when challenging the appointment of mr salve as an arbitrator, in its application to the icc, the defendant said that \"the fact that the present arbitration is an english seated icc arbitration is undisputed. accordingly icc rules shall be paramount in adjudicating the present challenge. further, the curial seat of arbitration being london, settled propositions of english law shall also substantially impinge upon the matter. this position is taken without prejudice to the first respondent's declared contention that the law of the arbitration agreement is indian law, as also that the substantive law governing the dispute is indian law\". 34. \"london arbitration\" is a well known phenomenon which is often chosen by foreign nationals with a different law, such as the law of new york, governing the substantive rights of the parties. this is because of the legislative framework and supervisory powers of the courts here which many parties are keen to adopt. when therefore there is an express designation of the arbitration venue as london and no designation of any alternative place as the seat, combined with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is, to my mind, that london is the juridical seat and english law the curial law. in my judgment it is clear that either london has been designated by the parties to the arbitration agreement as the seat of the arbitration or, having regard to the parties' agreement and all the relevant circumstances, it is the seat to be determined in accordance with the final fall back provision of section 3 of the arbitration act.\" (38 of 46) [sac-3/2019] 23. learned counsel for the respondent has also referred to the latest judgment of the hon'ble apex court in vijay karia & ors. vs. prysmian cavi e sistemi srl & ors. (civil appeal no.1544 of 2020 decided on 13.02.2020), also upholds the earlier position of the precedent laws already cited hereinabove, and is the latest judgment of the hon'ble supreme court on the same issue. relevant portion of the said judgment reads as under:\"23. as section 50 of the arbitration act does not provide an appeal when a foreign award is recognised and enforced by a judgment of a learned single judge of a high court, the appellants have appealed against the said judgment under article 136 of the constitution of india.\" 24. learned counsel for the respondent concluded his submissions by submitting that the bgs sgs soma jv (supra) proposition is a clear affirmation of the settled principle that the present appeal is not maintainable, as the venue of the seat for arbitration was london, united kingdom. 25. since at the threshold, learned counsel for the respondent was permitted to raise the objections regarding maintainability of the present appeals, therefore, at the outset, dr. sachin acharya with mr. manvendra krishan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants responded by submitting that the hon'ble apex court in the judgment rendered in bhatia international vs. bulk trading s.a. & ors., reported in air 2002 sc 1432, while dealing with the jurisdiction of courts in india in international commercial matters and applicability of part i to international commercial arbitration (ica), after a detailed deliberation, laid the controversy at rest and concluded that the (39 of 46) [sac-3/2019] laws and the rules chosen by the parties would prevail. relevant portion of the said judgment reads as under:\"32. to conclude, we hold that the provisions of part i would apply to all arbitrations and to all proceedings relating thereto. where such arbitration is held in india the provisions of part i would compulsorily apply and parties are free to deviate only to the extent permitted by the derogable provisions of part i. in cases of international commercial arbitrations held out of india provisions of part i would apply unless the parties by agreement, express or implied, exclude all or any of its provisions. in that case the laws or rules chosen by the parties would prevail. any provision, in part i, which is contrary to or excluded by that law or rules will not apply. \" 26. learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that where the parties have unless agreed contrary expressly or impliedly, part i of the act of 1996 will be applicable in international commercial arbitration (ica). he has also relied upon the position of the judgment in bharat aluminium company vs. kaiser aluminium technical services inc., reported in (2012) 9 scc 552, which had overruled the earlier judgment of bhatia international (supra). relevant portion of bharat aluminium company (supra) reads as under: \"197. the judgment in bhatia international [(2002) 4 scc 105] was rendered by this court on 13-3-2002. since then, the aforesaid judgment has been followed by all the high courts as well as by this court on numerous occasions. in fact, the judgment in venture global engg. [(2008) 4 scc 190] has been rendered on 10-12008 in terms of the ratio of the decision in bhatia international [(2002) 4 scc 105] . thus, in order to do complete justice, we hereby order, that the law now declared by this court shall apply prospectively, to all the arbitration agreements executed hereafter.\" 27. learned counsel for the appellants also submitted that in light of the decision rendered in bharat aluminium company (40 of 46) [sac-3/2019] (supra), a cut off date has been prescribed, i.e. agreements entered prior to 06.09.2012 and agreements entered into after 06.09.2012, and in the case in hand the agreements were entered acted upon in the year 2011. 28. learned counsel for the appellants has drawn the attention of this court towards the english arbitration act, 1996, particularly section 4(3) thereof, which allows the party to agree on arrangement of application of institutional rules, in the present case like lcia, and further, section 4(2) of the english arbitration act obligates applicability of those rules as far as non-mandatory provisions are concerned. 29. learned counsel for the appellants also submitted that except 21 provisions of schedule i, all provisions of english arbitration act, 1996 have become non-mandatory. 30. learned counsel for the appellants also submitted that section 26.8 of lcia rules clarify that parties waive their right to any form of appeal, review, recourse to any state court or other legal authority, in so far as such waiver shall not be prohibited under any applicable law. 31. learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that as there is no appeal provided under lcia rules, there shall not be any prohibition in any applicable law, which can be construed as law applicable to either parties to the arbitration. 32. learned counsel for the appellants also submitted that since the english arbitration act, by virtue of public policy in section 81, already releases from any restrictions under sections 4(2) and 4(3) of the english arbitration act, therefore, in a case of public policy issue, lcia waiver against an appeal or review is prohibited in light of section 81 of the english arbitration act, and (41 of 46) [sac-3/2019] award cannot be construed as final and binding as per rule 26.8 of the lcia rules. 33. learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that since lcia is clearly barring any remedy of appeal, therefore, the appellant has been rendered remediless, and as a consequence whereof, the case of the appellant has to be heard and decided on merits. 34. learned counsel for the appellants also tried to distinguish the applicability of bgs sgs soma jv (supra) on the ground that it deals with a situation of domestic arbitration, where the issue was not with respect to refusal to set aside an award under section 34 of the act of 1996, but the question was as to whether an order under order 7 rule 10 cpc directing the party to approach the commercial court can be challenged under section 37 of the act of 1996 or not. as per learned counsel for the appellants, the issue did not pertain to maintainability before deciding on the substantive rights under section 34 of the act of 1996. 35. learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that in bgs sgs soma jv (supra), applicability of section 34 of the act of 1996 was not adjudicated on merits, but was merely returned on a technicality, while in the instant case, the matter has been considered on merits by the learned single judge in the impugned order. learned counsel thus submitted that the present appeals are maintainable. 36. in support of his submissions, learned counsel for the appellants has also relied upon the precedent law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in venture global engineering vs. (42 of 46) [sac-3/2019] satyam computer services ltd. & ors., reported in air 2008 sc 1061, relevant portion of which reads as under:\"29. in terms of the decision in bhatia international [bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a., (2002) 4 scc 105] we hold that part i of the act is applicable to the award in question even though it is a foreign award. we have not expressed anything on the merits of claim of both the parties.\" 37. reliance has also been placed by learned counsel for the appellants on the precedent law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in bharat aluminium company vs. kaiser aluminium technical services inc., reported in (2016) 4 scc 126, relevant portion of which reads as under: \"1. the residue of the constitution bench judgment in balco v. kaiser aluminium technical services inc. [balco v. kaiser aluminium technical services inc., (2012) 9 scc 552 : (2012) 4 scc (civ) 810] is the subject-matter of the present appeal. at the instance of the appellant, the bench resolved the conflicting, if not, confusing views on the applicability of part i of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the arbitration act\") and held that: (scc p. 647, para 196) \"196. . part i of the arbitration act, 1996 is applicable only to all the arbitrations which take place within the territory of india.\" (emphasis in original) overruling a three-judge bench decision of this court in bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a. [bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a., (2002) 4 scc 105] exercising its power under article 142 of the constitution of india, the constitution bench however, held that the law declared by it would only operate prospectively. in other words, all agreements executed prior to 6-9-2012 were to be governed by the decision in bhatia international [bhatia international (supra).\" (43 of 46) [sac-3/2019] 38. learned counsel for the appellants has also relied upon the precedent law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in venture global engineering vs. satyam computer services ltd. & anr., reported in (2010) 8 scc 660, relevant portion of which reads as under:46. the concept of public policy in the a&c act, 1996 as given in the explanation has virtually adopted the aforesaid international standard, namely, if anything is found in excess of jurisdiction and depicts a lack of due process, it will be opposed to public policy of india. when an award is induced or affected by fraud or corruption, the same will fall within the aforesaid grounds of excess of jurisdiction and a lack of due process. therefore, if we may say so, the explanation to section 34 of the a&c act is like \"a stable man in the saddle\" on the unruly horse of public policy. 51. therefore, this court is unable to accept the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent that the expression \"fraud in the making of the award\" has to be narrowly construed. this court cannot do so primarily because fraud being of \"infinite variety\" may take many forms, and secondly, the expression \"the making of the award\" will have to be read in conjunction with whether the award \"was induced or affected by fraud\".\" 39. reliance has also been placed by learned counsel for the appellants on the precedent law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in roger shashoua & ors. vs. mukesh sharma & ors., reported in (2017) 14 scc 722, relevant portion of which reads as under: \"68. it is worthy to note that the arbitration agreement is not silent as to what law and procedure is to be followed. on the contrary, clause 14.1 lays down that the arbitration (44 of 46) [sac-3/2019] proceedings shall be in accordance with the rules of conciliation and arbitration of the icc. in enercon (india) ltd. (supra), the two-judge bench referring to shashoua case accepted the view of cooke, j. that the phrase \"venue of arbitration shall be in london, uk\" was accompanied by the provision in the arbitration clause or arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the rules of icc in paris. the two-judge bench accepted the rules of icc, paris which is supernational body of rules as has been noted by cooke, j. and that is how it has accepted that the parties have not simply provided for the location of hearings to be in london. to elaborate, the distinction between the venue and the seat remains. but when a court finds there is prescription for venue and something else, it has to be adjudged on the facts of each case to determine the juridical seat. as in the instant case, the agreement in question has been interpreted and it has been held that london is not mentioned as the mere location but the courts in london will have the jurisdiction, another interpretative perception as projected by the learned senior counsel is unacceptable.\" 40. learned counsel for the appellants has further placed reliance on the precedent law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in union of india vs. hardy exploration and production (india) inc (civil appeal no.4628 of 2018 decided on 25.09.2018), relevant portion of which reads as under: \"23. in view of the aforesaid development of law, there is no confusion with regard to what the seat of arbitration and venue of arbitration mean. there is no shadow of doubt that the arbitration clause has to be read in a holistic manner so as to determine the jurisdiction of the court. that apart, if there is mention of venue and something else is appended thereto, depending on the nature of the prescription, the court can come to a conclusion that there is implied exclusion of part i of the act. the principle laid down in (45 of 46) [sac-3/2019] sumitomo heavy industries ltd. (supra) has been referred to in reliance industries limited (ii) and distinguished. in any case, it has no applicability to a controversy under the act. the said controversy has to be governed by the balco principle or by the agreement or by the principle of implied exclusion as has been held in bhatia international.\" 41. after hearing learned counsel for the parties as well as perusing the record of the case, alongwith the precedent laws cited at the bar, this court is of the clear opinion that the present appeals are not maintainable, as the judgment of bgs sgs soma jv (supra), quoted hereinabove, wherein the hon'ble supreme court has clearly held that an appeal under section 37 of the act of 1996 is not maintainable, in absence of sanction of law, is clearly applicable in the present case on account of the fact that in this case, when the appellant made a request on 03.06.2014 to invoke arbitration, the appellant himself averred that the seat of arbitration to be london, united kingdom, and thus, expressly excluded part i of the act of 1996. 42. this court finds that the appellants have tried to assail the arbitral awards by filing arbitration applications under section 34 of the act of 1996, which remedy was not available to them, and thus, when such underlying remedy was not available to the appellants, then in those circumstances, an appeal under section 37 of the act of 1996 is not maintainable. furthermore, the judgments of harmanprit singh sidhu (supra) and kandla export corporation & anr. (supra) are also very clear in terms of the jurisdiction at the place of seat of the arbitration, particularly in regard to assailment of a foreign award. 43. this court, on a careful perusal, finds that the exclusion of part i of the act of 1996 has also been affirmed by the hon'ble (46 of 46) [sac-3/2019] apex court in r.k. industries (supra), eitzen bulk (supra) and union of india vs. reliance industries limited & ors. (supra). 44. this court further finds that the judgment of bhatia international (supra), which is the principal argument made on behalf of the appellants, cannot be relied upon, as the same has been clarified by the hon'ble apex court in the subsequent judgment rendered in union of india vs. reliance industries limited & ors, wherein it has been held that, \"it is interesting to note that even though the law governing the arbitration agreement was not specified, yet this court held, having regard to various circumstances, that the seat of arbitration would be london and therefore, by necessary implication, the ratio of bhatia international [bhatia international v. bulk trading s.a., (2002) 4 scc 105] would not apply\". 45. thus, while adhering to bgs sgs soma jv (supra) and all the precedent laws reiterated by the hon'ble supreme court in the latest judgment of vijay karia (supra), this court does not find any reason to make any interference in the impugned order passed by the learned single judge. 46. consequently, the present appeals are dismissed. all pending applications also stand dismissed.
