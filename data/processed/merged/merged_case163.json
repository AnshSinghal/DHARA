The facts leading to filing the aforesaid original suit being Original Suit No. 09 of 2019 which requires to be enumerated herein, reads as under:\nThe plaintiff (M/s. AT-Libra Bpl (Jv), respondent herein) has brought the suit being Original Suit No. 09 of 2019 for declaration, permanent injunction and recovery of money initially valued at Rs.19,33,71,635 and later by amendment it was enhanced to 2 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 Rs.46,86,08,851/- u/s 26 of Civil Procedure Code with Sections 6 & 12 of Commercial Court Act 2015. \nThe plaintiff is  a joint venture partnership firm and engaged in the business of mining and coal /Over Burden and transport excavation in various parts of the country. \nNotice Inviting Tender (NIT) being Tender No. BCCL/ GM (CMC)/F-HEMM-OS/2010/3844 was issued by the defendant no.3 (appellant herein) for hiring of HEMM and for removal of OB, extraction and transportation of coal from IV (TOP), IV (BOT), III (TOP) and III (BOT) seems of Golukdih NC Project (Northern Sector) of GOCP/KOCP of Bastacolla for and estimated cost of Rs. 282 crores. \nIn pursuance of said NIT the plaintiff/respondent had participated in the tender process and was declared successful bidder. On 07.11.2011, a Letter of Acceptance (LOA) was issued by the defendant no.1 for removal of 267 lakh cum OB, re-handling of 2.00 lakh cum loose OB and for extraction and transportation of 112.85 MT of coal from IV(Top), IV (Bot), III(Top) and III (Bot) seams of Golukdih NC project (Northern sector) of GOCP/KOCP of Bastacolla area with financial involvement of Rs. 252,01,39,290/- (Rs. Two Hundred Fifty-Two Crore One Lakh Thirty-Nine Thousand Two Hundred Ninety) only inclusive of all taxes and levies but exclusive of service tax at the diesel base price of Rs. 39.61 per liter. \nPursuant to such issuance of LOA on 07.11.2011, the plaintiff had duly furnished performance security/security Deposit of Rs.2,10,01,161/- from 28.11.2011 till 29.09.2018 which was a per- condition as mentioned in the LOA and on 08.02.2012 the work order was issued to the plaintiff by the defendant no. 4, which was for a value of Rs.252,01,39,290/- (Rs. Two Hundred Fifty-Two Crore One Lakh Thirty-Nine Thousand Two Hundred Ninety) inclusive of all taxes and levies but exclusive of service tax, at the diesel base price of Rs. 39.61/ Ltr., in accordance with the terms and conditions given in the notice inviting tender and in the bid documents.\n3 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 The plaintiff thereafter initiated execution of work as per the terms and conditions mentioned in the work order. The tender was for a period of 72 months and was to expire on January 31,2018. On 02.04.2014 an amended work order was issued for re- appropriation/reallocation of quantities of coal and total value of work was reduced. Further, the plaintiff has informed the defendants that hindrance hours till January 2018 was 16658 (equivalent to 694 days) and as such it was requested to grant extension of the period. The defendant no.5 replied to the said letter vide reply date 17.01.2018 and granted additional 625 days of work and as such the new completion dated of contract was fixed on 25.10.2019. \nThe plaintiff thereafter, vide letter dated 31.01.2018 requested for early reimbursement of service Tax amount to the tune of Rs.58,37,603/-. Although, such demand was raised earlier also but same was not paid to the plaintiff. By a letter dated 19.02.2018 request was made for acceptance of amendment in the quantity of over burden to change the scope of work. The quantity of OB was reduced by 73.09 lakh to match the near estimation of stripping ratio in the Balance period of the contract. The plaintiff vide letter dated 23.02.2018 accepted such proposed amendment. \nThereafter, the CBI registered a criminal case bearing no.RC1(A)/2019-D, against the plaintiff and also some of the defendants on basis of some complaint by unknown about over reporting and excess payment to the tune of Rs. 22 Crore to the contractor on count of removal of OB. However, after investigation the C.B.I found that contractor is not guilty and recorded the finding that the \"contractor was working at the rate much below the rate as prescribed in the contract. Thus, as per the NIT/ Contract, the contractor was not causing loss to the BCCL.\" \n3. The case of the plaintiff is that the demands raised by the plaintiff were never met. The demands were as follows: (i) Payment/Reimbursement of difference of payment due to GPC (ii) Payment/Reimbursement of 4 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 service tax (iii) Determination of coal density from competent institution authority etc.\n4. It is also the case of the plaintiff that for some ulterior motive and to obviate their liability some of the officials of the vigilance department of defendant no. 1 company in connivance with officials of CMPDIL and CBI caused to get the re-measurement of the excavated materials- coal, OB in utter violation of the contractual terms and condition. \nThe further case of the plaintiff is that another dispute arose in respect of conversion of coal quantity from tone to cubic meter and conversation factor from tone to cubic meter depends on specific gravity (Density) of coal. Regarding methodology of reserve calculation of coal by the CMPDIL, the project report was prepared on the basis of certain ash value to determine the specific gravity based on which Sp. gr. Should be 1.68 and thus conversion factor 1/1.68=0.59. It was therefore protested by the plaintiff. After about two years defendant changed Sp. gr. 1.33 to 1.55/1.56 this was again on the lower side, plaintiff protested again on the ground that correct volume of OB excavated cannot be arrived at unless Sp. gr. is correctly evaluated. \nThe further case of plaintiff is that against the actual production of coal as 95.23 Lte quantity of OB as per correct stripping ratio the work order should have been 95.23 x 2.38 = 226.65. The actual OB protection is 151,97,312 which is far less than the standard OB.\n5. On 30.03.2018, the defendant no.5 issued show cause notice to the plaintiff for termination of the work and the defendant no. 5 further threatened to forfeit the security deposit due to alleged default in work under clause 9.5 of the general terms and conditions of Tender Document for making default in proceeding with work. In the meantime, the plaintiff issued a letter to the HOS, Testing Cell, CIMFER, Dhanbad for testing of samples of coal collected from the patch. The plaintiff had repeatedly asked the office to conduct a density test of the coal, which, according to the plaintiff was of low density. \n5 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 But the defendant nos. 4 & 5 were never concerned with such issue. The report was received by the plaintiff on 04.05.2018. Seeing no other alternative, the plaintiff through its Advocate issued a demand for justice notice dated 12.10.2018 to the defendant no. 3 but same was also not responded. \n6. The further case of plaintiff is that the defendants issued a notice dated 30.03.2018/02.04.2018 alleging therein that work was stopped suddenly on 01.02.2018 after obtaining the provisional period extension of the contract and explanation was called for from the plaintiff. The plaintiff replied to the said notice vide its reply dated 10.04.2018 wherein it was stated that the coal production performance post hindrance was more than 100% before 31.01.2018 itself. In the said reply the plaintiff also lodged its protest on extension of period only for 625 days instead of 694 days. \nFurther, the plaintiff came to know that the defendant no.4 has awarded a similar nature of work to other company with super imposed boundary on the western side of the area allotted to the plaintiff as shown in the plan as attached to the NIT. The said work order dated 18.06.2018 has been awarded to a Hyderabad based company namely, M/s BGR Mining and Infra Limited. The defendant no. 4, without waiting for the plaintiff's tenure to end and without settling it's dues, a part of its area has been awarded to a new agency. \n7. The plaintiff made a representation before the General Manager of Bastacolla area of BCCL with copy to all concerned vide letter no. AT- LBL/517 dated 06.10.2018 and further another representation was made before the CMD BCCL vide ref.: AT-LBPL/519 dated 05.11.2018 giving previous reference but the defendant remained silent without giving any explanation. \n8. It is the case of the plaintiff that due to wrongful actions of the defendants, those machines and equipment remained idle for the period from April, 2018 to October, 2019 and the plaintiff also incurred 6 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 establishment cost of worth Rs.64,14,134/- as depreciation cost on building and structures, security personnel, and dismantling and other misc. cost incurred in winding up of the infrastructure setup. The NC Patch Kuiya as per the above NIT was completed by the plaintiff as per schedule on 31.01.2018 and BG was extended from time to time as per described by the defendant. The BG was extended on 18.05.2018 and the same was valid till 29.05.2019 but, the plaintiff found from his bank statement that the defendant illegally encashed the entire BG amount of Rs. 2,10,01,161/- without any justification. \n9. On the basis of aforesaid facts and premises, the plaintiff claimed following reliefs by way of filing Original Suit No.09 of 2019 in the Commercial Court which are as follows:\n(a) A decree of declaration that the present contract awarded to the plaintiff vide work order No. BCCL/IX/GM/PLNG/AT- LIBRA/H-HEMM/NC/WO/12/673, dated 08.02.2012 was terminated midway by the defendants illegally and unjustifiably.\n(b) A decree of further declaration that the notice of proposed action against the plaintiff communicated vide letter bearing ref. no. BCCL/BA-IX/KOCP/64, dated 30.03.2018 signed on 02.04.2018 is void, illegal and invalid. \n(d) A decree of direction to the defendants to pay a sum of Rs.\n4,20,02,320/- (Rs. Four Crore Teenty Lakh Two Thousand Three Hundred Twenty) Only as refund of performance security (BG No.19/188) and retention money to the plaintiff along with interest of Rs.66,31,541/- (Sixty-Six Lakhs Thirty-One Thousand Five Hundred Forty-One only) till March 2021 and thereafter till realization of the same. \n(e) A decree of direction to the defendants to pay a sum of Rs.\n1,80,40,014/- (Rs.

On notice, the defendants have appeared and filed their written statements. According to their written statement, the suit instituted on behalf of the plaintiff is misconceived and instituted with ulterior motive for unjust enrichment of amount as claimed. It has further been stated that the plaintiff has already been paid for all bills as raised by plaintiff and as such the suit has been instituted by plaintiff in contravention of the terms and conditions of contract. \n11. It is further stated by the defendants that the Plaintiff provided written consent for the deviation of re-appropriation/re-allocation of quantities of coal quantities and therein the defendants did not raise any objection and neither there was any mention of patch of area nor raised any objection and nor there was any mention of patch of area not being made available to plaintiff, on contrary first deviation for re- appropriation/re-allocation of quantities of coal quantities was done only to meet the demand of different consumers of defendants as the quantities of the coal was reappropriated/re-allocated by virtue of first deviation \"from face to CK siding\" to work element \"from face to surface dump\" . \n12. As such the plaintiff failed to discharge liabilities as per terms and conditions of contract between the plaintiff and defendant and on contrary it was plaintiff who stopped the work completely from 23.03.2018 and failed to execute work as per contractual obligation despite repeated reminders of defendants hence, any claim of plaintiff is an attempt to misconceive the facts before the court. \n9 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 13. Further, the statements made by the plaintiff that plaintiff paid a sum of Rs.13,46,06,556.43/- only to various financial companies which have been incurred by the contractor towards paying EMIs for machines and equipment and other expenses were not in knowledge of defendants, however, aforesaid averments must be put to the test of strict proof. Further, as per contract between the plaintiff and defendants the plaintiff cannot claim any such expense moreover when the plaintiff is guilty of abandoning work site and unable to complete work site and unable to complete work. \n14. The learned original court had decided the aforesaid issue by framing altogether thirteen issues on which the evidence has been laid on behalf of the parties and accordingly, the court has decided the said original suit in favour of the plaintiff/respondent with the aforesaid direction as mentioned above in the preceding paragraphs. The defendants/appellants being aggrieved with the same, has preferred the instant appeal. \n15. It is evident from factual aspect that for hiring of HEMM and for removal of OB extraction and transportation of coal from IV (TOP), IV (BOT), III (TOP) and III (BOT) sea, Golukdih NC Project (Northern Sector) of GOCP/KOCP of Bastacolla for an estimated cost of Rs. 282 crores, an NIT was issued by defendants/appellants. \nThe Plaintiff/respondent M/S AT Libra BPL (JV) participated and was declared successful bidder. Letter of Acceptance (LOA) dated 07.11.2011 was issued by Defendant no.1 in terms of Tender with financial involvement of Rs, 252,01,39,290/- (Rupees two hundred fifty-two crore one lakh thirty-nine thousand two hundred ninety) only inclusive of all taxes and levies but exclusive of service tax at the diesel base price of Rs. 39.61 per litre and on 08.02.2012, work order was issued to plaintiff. \nThe plaintiff thereafter initiated/commenced execution of work but the tender being for a period of 72 months and was therefore to expire on 31.01.2018, the amended work order dated 02.04.2014 was 10 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 issued whereby total value of work was reduced from Rs. 252,01,39,290/- only to Rs. 2,50,51,39,290/-.\n16. It is further evident that the plaintiff informed the defendants about 16658 hours hindrance till January 2018 (694 days) and requested to grant extension of the period of contract and defendant no. 5 vide letter dated 17.01.2018 granted additional 625 days of work and as such the new date for completion of contract was fixed on 25.10.2019. \nLater on, the quantity of OB was reduced by 73.09 lakh to match the near estimation of stripping ratio in the Balance period of the contract.

It is further evident as per the pleading in the plaint that the demands raised by the plaintiff were never met. The further case of the plaintiff is that another dispute arose in respect of conversion of coal quantity from tone to cubic meter. It is also evident that on 30.03.2018, the defendant no.5 issued show cause notice to the plaintiff for termination of the work and also intended to forfeit the security deposit due to alleged default in work under clause 9.5 of the General Terms and Conditions of Tender Document for making default in proceeding with work. \n18. The plaintiff replied to the said notice vide its reply dated 10.04.2018 wherein it was stated that the coal production performance post hindrance was more than 100% before 31.01.2018 itself. In the said reply the plaintiff also lodged its protest on extension of period only for 625 days instead of 694 days. It is evident that defendant no.4 has awarded a similar nature of work to a company namely, M/s BGR Mining and Infra Limited. \n11 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 19. It is alleged that the defendant authorities are acting in a manner which is contrary to the Terms and Conditions of the Notice Inviting Tender and also the General Conditions of the Contract and thus the plaintiff is being victimized by the defendant authorities and someone else has been favoured by the defendant authorities with the sole intention of depriving the plaintiff in total violation of contract subsisting between the defendant no.1 and the plaintiff. \n20. It is also alleged that due to wrongful actions of the defendants, machines and equipment remained idle for the period from April, 2018 to October, 2019.

On notice, the defendants have appeared and filed their written statements wherein it has been stated that the plaintiff has already been paid for all bills as raised by plaintiff and as such the suit has been instituted by plaintiff in contravention of the terms and conditions of contract. \n23.It is evident that the defendants in written statement stated that the Plaintiff provided written consent for the deviation of for re- appropriation/re-allocation of quantities of coal quantities and therein the defendants did not raise any objection and neither there was any 12 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 mention of patch of area nor raised any objection and nor there was any mention of patch of area not being made available to plaintiff, on contrary first deviation for re-appropriation/re-allocation of quantities of coal quantities was done only to meet the demand of different consumers of defendants as the quantities of the coal was reappropriated/re-allocated by virtue of first deviation \"from face to CK siding\" to work element \"from face to surface dump\" . \n24.It is further stated that the plaintiff failed to discharge liabilities as per terms and conditions of contract between the plaintiff and defendant and on contrary it was plaintiff who stopped the work completely from 23.03.2018 and failed to execute work as per contractual obligation despite repeated reminders of defendants hence, any claim of plaintiff is an attempt to misconceive facts. \n25. It is further evident that in the said written statement the defendants protested the statements made by the plaintiff that plaintiff paid a sum of Rs. 13,46,06,556.43/- only to various financial companies which have been incurred by the contractor towards paying EMIs for machines and equipment and other expenses, were not in knowledge of defendants however, aforesaid averments must be put to the test of strict proof. It is further stated that as per contract between the plaintiff and defendants the plaintiff cannot claim any such expense moreover when the plaintiff is guilty of abandoning work site and unable to complete work site and unable to complete work. \n26.The learned original court had decided the issue by framing altogether thirteen issues on which the evidence has been laid on behalf of the parties and accordingly, the court has decided the said original suit in favour of the plaintiff/respondent with the aforesaid direction as mentioned above in the preceding paragraphs. \n27.The defendant/ appellant being aggrieved with the same, has preferred the instant appeal. \nArgument on behalf of the defendants/Appellants:\n13 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 28. Learned counsel for the appellant has taken the following grounds:\n(i) Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant has submitted that the instant Commercial Appeal under Section 13 of Commercial Courts Act 2015 does not arise from an order passed under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,1996 against an arbitral award rather it is a regular first appeal as envisaged under the Code of Civil Procedure and as such the Court in exercise of the power under Section 13(1-A), can reappreciate the evidence and record its independent findings. To buttress this limb of argument the learned counsel put his reliance on the judgment rendered by the co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Deoraj Singh vs. CCL, 2023 SCC Online Jhar 1558. \n(ii) The further ground has been taken that the contract has been entered for execution and completion of work within 72 months, the work since has not been completed within the stipulated period, hence, the period was extended for the further period of 625 days. According to the appellant, even beyond the extended period of 625 days over and above 72 months, the work has not been completed, hence, the contract was terminated and even the bank guarantee was encashed. \n(iii) Further, there is no requirement under Clause 6 or anywhere in the NIT for providing a fresh revised work schedule for the balance remaining part of the work if the work had not been completed within the originally fixed time and additional time had been granted at the request of the contractor for executing the balance part of the work, the respondent has to execute the balance part of the work as per the existing work schedule. \n(iv) The plaintiff (respondent herein) to the suit although even after the extension of the period since has not submitted the transportation schedule, hence, the work schedule had not been 14 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 issued, as such, it is lapses on the part of the respondent in not completing the work but the learned original court without taking into consideration the aforesaid aspect of the matter of non- submission of the transportation schedule and consequence thereof, the work schedule has not been furnished even though the appellant has been held liable for damages and interest over there, therefore, the judgment suffers from patent illegality and as such, not sustainable in the eyes of law. \n(v) Since both the parties understood the contract clearly in its letter and spirit that for the remaining part of the work no revised work schedule is required during the extended period and the respondent has to execute the work accordingly as per the already existing work schedule and the respondent accordingly, executed the work during the extended period for 2 months i.e. February and March of 2018 and also raised the bills for the same (marked as EX 30 and 31). \n(vi) Further, there is no averment in the plaint that the contractor was entitled to a revised work schedule for the extended period of work nor any issue was framed in this regard. Since there is no specific averment in the plaint of the requirement of the revised work schedule, no question arises for any specific denial. To buttress this limb of argument the learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Kishor Kirtilal Mehta and Ors. v Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust and Ors, 2007 (10) SCC 21 and Bachhaj Nahar v Nilima Mandal and Anr. (2008) 17 SCC 491. \n(vii) There is no material on record as to the actual loss suffered by the respondent nor any material as to what remedial measures the respondent had taken to mitigate the loss, if any, as required in the explanation attached to Section 73 of the Contract Act, 1872, still the original court while decreeing an amount of 15 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 Rs.13,41,16,526/- did not apply its mind to any of the requirements for the applicability of Section 73. Further, \"sine qua non\" of the loss of profit is proof of loss and if the respondent fails to prove any loss, no compensation can be granted as it would amount to unjust profit. \n(viii) The grant of EMI/ Idling Cost of Rs. 13,46,06,556.43/- based on inadmissible third-party secondary evidence without any proof of actual payment, no such third-party documents had been admitted by the appellant, still the Original Court ignoring the provisions of Sections 34, 64, 65(g), and 102 of the Evidence Act allowed the claim equating such claims as equal to the proof. \n(ix) The learned original court allowed the refund of the Bank Guarantee amount against the contractual provisions of Clause 4.6 of the contract. \n(x) Original court ignoring the provisions of Sections 34, 64, 65(g), and 102 of the Evidence Act and allowed the claim equating such claims as equal to the proof. \n(xi) The learned original court further allowed the reimbursement of differential of wages without there being any proof of payment of wages as required under office circular dt. 12/13.05.2021. \n(xii) The Interest was allowed @10.5% contrary to the requirement of Section 2(b) and Section 3(b) of the Interest Act r/w Rule 2A of Order VII, CPC, 1908 as amended pursuant to the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n29. On the aforesaid ground it has been submitted that the instant appeal, therefore, needs to be considered in the light of the re-appreciation of the evidence for the purpose of considering legality and propriety of the impugned judgment. \nArgument on behalf of the Respondent:\n16 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 30. Learned counsel for the respondent has taken the following grounds in defending the impugned judgment:\n(i) The ground as has been taken on behalf of the appellant that the case is to be considered as a regular first appeal is not worth to be considered in view of the fact that if the said contention will be accepted then the very object and purpose of the Commercial Courts Act will be redundant. The scope of appeal under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 is summary in nature and the Court is not required to re-appreciate the evidence or return a finding on re-examination of the issues as it is done in a First Appeal Case under Section 96 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. \n(ii) It has been argued that the very purpose and purport of the Commercial Courts Act is of expeditious disposal of the commercial disputes and that is the reason that the appeal is to be filed before a forum carved out under the provision of Section 13(1) and 13(1-A) of the commercial court acts. \n(iii) It has been contended by making reference of the provision of Order VI rule 3-A of the Code (as amended in purview of Act 2015) wherein the strict rule of admission and denial of the pleading is required which would be evident from the amendment incorporated in the Order VII and VIII of the Code. \n(iv) It has been contended that by making reference of the provision of Order VIII (3-A) that the denial by the defendant in suits before the Commercial Division of the High Court or the Commercial Court shall be in the manner provided in sub-rules (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this Rule. \nAs per the provision of sub-rules (2), (3) and (4) and (5), if any of the condition has not been followed then the consequence would be that the said pleading made shall be taken to be admitted except as against a person under disability. For ready reference, the provision of Order VIII as appended to Rule, 3-A 17 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 as amended and made applicable in view of the provision of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act is being referred as under:\n\"...\n3A. Denial by the defendant in suits before the Commercial Division of the High Court or the Commercial Court-- (1) Denial shall be in the manner provided in sub-rules (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this Rule.\n(2) The defendant in his written statement shall state which of the allegations in the particulars of plaint he denies, which allegations he is unable to admit or deny, but which he requires the plaintiff to prove, and which allegations he admits . (3) Where the defendant denies an allegation of fact in a plaint, he must state his reasons for doing so and if he intends to put forward a different version of events from that given by the plaintiff, he must state his own version. \n(4) If the defendant disputes the jurisdiction of the Court he must state the reasons for doing so, and if he is able, give his own statement as to which Court ought to have jurisdiction. (5) If the defendant disputes the plaintiff's valuation of the suit, he must state his reasons for doing so, and if he is able, give his own statement of the value of the suit.\";\n(iii) in Rule 5, in sub-rule (1), after the first proviso, the following proviso shall be inserted, namely:--\n''Provided further that every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not denied in the manner provided under Rule 3A of this Order, shall be taken to be admitted except as against a person under disability.\";\n...\"\n(v) The reference of the provision Order XI (4)(3) has also been made as per which reasons for denying a document under any of the above grounds and bare and unsupported denials shall not be deemed to be denials of a document and proof of such documents may then be dispensed with at the discretion of the Court. For ready reference, the said provision is being referred as under:\n\"... \n(3) Each party shall set out reasons for denying a document under any of the above grounds and bare and unsupported denials shall not be deemed to be denials of a document and proof of such documents may then be dispensed with at the discretion of the Court. \n...\" \n(vi) Learned counsel for the respondents has referred these provisions in support of his argument that the specific pleading with respect to the work schedule which is to be provided by the appellant 18 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 without insisting upon the transportation schedule but such pleading has simply been denied without specifying any reason, hence, the requirement as stipulated in the law since has not been followed, hence, such denial has got no meaning in the eyes of law. \n(vii) The work schedule is a \"sine qua non\" for the execution of the contract. It also says that in other independent NITs/ Contracts, Ex-61 and 61/1 a revised work schedule was issued. Further DW-1, has admitted this fact that the work schedule is required for an extension period and finally it submits that since the Appellant did not provide the revised work schedule for the extended period, it has committed a fundamental breach of contract. According to the Respondent, the alleged fundamental breach of the reciprocal promises entitles the Respondent to be compensated u/s 51 and 52, 54, 67,70 and 73 of the Contract Act, 1872. \n(viii) It has been contended that initially the transportation schedule was provided under the contract, based upon the same, the work commenced by virtue of the work order issued by the appellant for its completion within 72 months. When the work has not been completed within the period of 72 months, the request for extension of the said period has been made which has been allowed by extending the period for a further period of 625 days. The respondent/plaintiff, however, bonafidely has commenced the work in the month of February and March, 2018 but no work schedule has been given. \nThe contention has been made that repeatedly the requests were made to provide work schedule so that the work be completed within the extended period of 625 days but the work schedule has not been provided. \n19 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 (ix) The plea has been taken that however, there is no such pleading with respect to the same that the work schedule can only be given subject to providing transportation schedule. \nThe contention has been made in that pretext that when the said pleading was not raised before the original court with respect to the condition precedent for providing work schedule subject to submission of the transportation schedule, hence, it cannot be allowed to be agitated in the appeal.\nFurther ground has been taken in this pretext that there is no requirement of any transportation schedule since the transportation schedule is to be given at the time entering into the contract initially.\n(x) So far as the ground of having work schedule is not required to be provided is concerned, argument has been advanced by making reference of the exhibit by way of tabular chart wherein work schedule has been given during the month of October 2012 till January 2018, end of the period of 72 months.\n(xi) The question of no relevance of work schedule during the extended period of contract cannot be said to be acceptable in view of the fact that in absence of work schedule which depends upon OB and stripping measurement there cannot be any measurement of coal to be entered into the measurement book for the dispute of payment in favour of the contractor.\n(xii) The learned counsel for the respondent has further submitted by making reference of the work contract, the work as per the contract and the schedule of the works as referred in the agreement that it cannot be said that the work schedule was not required to be provided. \n(xiii) The learned counsel has submitted that the appellants have taken the ground before the learned original court that there was no requirement to provide the work schedule but herein, the argument has been advanced that the work schedule was only to 20 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 be provided subject to providing the transportation schedule which itself suggest that the work schedule was mandatorily to be provided by the appellant but herein the stand is being taken subject to furnishing the transportation schedule.\n(xiv) This stand which has been made herein suggest that the work schedule is to be provided but only in order to deny the claim the argument is being advanced herein, although the same was not agitated before the original court, that the work schedule was only to be provided subject to providing transportation schedule.\n(xv) The contention has been raised by making reference of the contracts, but with respect to other transporter wherein in the similar facts and circumstances the work schedule was provided in their favour but in the case of the respondent the ground is being taken that the work schedule is not required to be provided rather as per the work schedule which was provided initially, the work was to be completed.\nBut, such argument cannot be said to be sustainable which itself is contradictory since on the identical nature of contract, the work schedule has been provided in favour of the other transporter by virtue of the contract and further on the ground that the work schedule is referred in the exhibit 4/1 which is a tabular chart and the same is for the purpose of measurement of the coal extracted and transported based upon the OB and stripping measurement so that the calculation of the amount which is to be paid in favour of the contractor is to be made.\n(xvi) The submission has been made that in absence of any work schedule how the money will be disbursed and that is the reason for the two months, i.e., for the month of February and March, 2018, although the respondent had carried out the work in absence of the work schedule but the money has not been paid and that is the reason the petition was filed under Order 31 Rule 21 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 1 and 2 for measurement but even then, no cooperation was extended for measurement.\n31. Learned counsel for the plaintiff/respondent has submitted on this argument that such non-cooperation is due to the obvious reason that the part of the mining area has been given on contract to the other contractor as would be evident from the map which has also been exhibited before the original court. \n32. Learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that this Court is dealing with the commercial appeal which is only to be interfered with if there is perversity of finding without re-appreciating the evidence as regular first appellate court. The original court, on appreciation of the contract and testimonies of the witnesses, has passed the judgment. \n33. Learned counsel has referred the testimony of D.W.1 who was the surveyor during the relevant time has been examined and has specifically stated that the work schedule is to be given even on the extended period. \n34. On the aforesaid ground it has been submitted that the impugned order requires no interference. \nAnalysis:\n35. Heard the learned counsel for the parties, considered the rival submissions of the parties along with the legal issues.\n36. Before entering into merit of the instant appeal, this Court thinks fit to answer the contention of the appellants that since, the instant Commercial Appeal under Section 13 of Commercial Courts Act 2015 does not arise from an order passed under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,1996 against an arbitral award therefore it should be treated as a regular first appeal as envisaged under the Code of Civil Procedure and therefore, the Court in the exercise of the power under Section 13(1-A), can reappreciate the evidence and record its independent findings. To buttress this limb of contention the learned counsel puts reliance upon the judgment rendered by the co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Deoraj Singh vs. CCL(supra). \n22 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 37. Per contra, learned senior counsel for the respondent/plaintiff has submitted that the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the case is to be considered as a regular first appeal is not worth to be considered in view of the fact that if the said contention will be accepted then the very object and purpose of the commercial court act will be redundant and since the scope of appeal under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 is summary in nature, as such, the Court is not required to re-appreciate the evidence or record a finding on re- examination of the issues as is done in a First Appeal Case u/s 96 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.\n38. In the light of aforesaid rival contentions, it requires to refer herein that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 has been enacted with the object to provide for the constitution of commercial courts mainly for the purpose to provide the forum for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes. The purpose to achieve the very object of the high-level commercial dispute was the paramount consideration for enactment of the Act, 2015 and therefore, the forum has been carved out under the aforesaid statute under Chapter IV i.e. Section 13. For ready reference Section 13 is being referred as under:\n\"13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions.--(1) Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court below the level of a District Judge may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order. \n(1A) Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order:\nProvided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996).] (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\" \n23 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 Sub-section (1) of section 13 confers a right to the aggrieved party if he is aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court below the level of a District Judge he may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Court while under sub-section (1A) a forum has been carved out to the person aggrieved if he is aggrieved by the judgment and order of the commercial court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of the High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within the stipulated period.\n39. Sub-section (2) of Section 13 starts from non-obstante clause by mandating therein that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Therefore, sub-section (2) of Section 13 is very explicit and clarifies the provision that what would be the forum to an aggrieved party as to whether it is the Letters Patent Appeal or the writ jurisdiction or any other remedy can be invoked but as per the aforesaid provision of sub-section (2) of Section 13 it has been provided that no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court, otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act, meaning thereby, the appeal is to be filed only in accordance to the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.\n40. The insertion of sub-section (2) of Section 13 is only for the purpose of achieving the object and intent of the Act, 2015, i.e., for achieving the speedy disposal of high-stake commercial matters. Therefore, this Court is of the view on the basis of aforesaid legal position that any dispute arising out which is commercial in nature, if passed at the level of District Judge in the capacity of commercial court then the appeal is to be filed only within the framework of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n24 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 41. It is evident from the preamble of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 which has been enacted only for the sole purpose of speedy disposal of the commercial disputes, which has also been taken into consideration by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Jaycee Housing Private Limited and Ors v. Registrar (general), Orissa High Court, Cuttack and Ors, (2023) 1 SCC 549 as also in the case of Kandla Export Corporation and Anr. v. OCI Corporation and Anr. (2018) 14 SCC 715.\n42. Now coming to the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant wherein it has been contended that the scope of Commercial Appeal for interference in the decree passed by Commercial Original Court has succinctly been observed, interalia, vide judgment dated 04.10.2023 by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Hon'ble Court in Commercial Appeal 02/2020 titled as M/s Deoraj Singh versus CCL. The learned counsel has put his reliance on the paragraph-13 of the aforesaid judgment which read as under:\n\"13.--- in exercise of the powers under Sub- Section (I-A) to Section 13, the High Court can reappreciate the evidence, record its independent findings, can affirm or interfere with the judgment under challenge. However, there is an implicit limitation on the exercise of the powers by the High Court under Section 13(I-A) that every error in law or of fact cannot be gone into and the High Court should not proceed in a manner as if it is on a mistake-finding mission in the judgment under challenge. After all, the Appellate Court shall also be guided by the same rule of preponderance of probability while assessing the evidences laid down by the parties.\" \n43. It has further been contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that the aforesaid view has been a consistent view of this Hon'ble Court which can be taken note from the judgment rendered by this Court in the case of Indicon Westfalia Ltd. vs Yogendra Nath Tiwary 2023 SCC Online Jhar 558.\n44. At this juncture, the question which arises herein is that whether the instant Appeal could be under CPC, as also appellants in written submission has submitted that the present appeal is under section 13 of Commercial Courts Act read with Section 96 of CPC which is in oblivion of section 13(2) of Commercial Courts Act, which provides 25 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise accordance with provisions of this Act. \nThe period of limitation is provided of sixty days unlike section 96 of CPC which does not provide any limitation, rather the same is governed by Limitation Act, 1963. Therefore, a distinction is there and the same has been clearly earmarked. \n45. Further, applying the principles of expression unius est exclusion alterius, it can be inferred that the provision of section 96 of CPC has not been incorporated in the Commercial Courts Act which is in line with the object and reasons of the Act, although many other provisions of the CPC have been kept applicable. It clearly provides, to amend the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as applicable to the Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions which shall prevail over the existing High Court Rules and other provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. \n46. Further, the principles of preponderance of probability which have wider and deeper application under the Commercial Courts Act established from the provisions of Order XIII-A which deals with summary judgments read with Rule 3-A of Order VIII which deals with specific denial in written statement, reasons for denial and his different version if he has and provisions of Order XI relating to production of documents by the defendants and strict procedure of admission/denial of documents. Non- denial or evasive denial of either the pleadings or the documents by the defendants will make the pleadings and documents admissible in evidence in the trial. \n47. It is alleged that the appellants in the present case did not specifically denied most of the contents of plaint and/or at maximum made evasive denial but did not give their version with relevant documents did not carry out admission/denial as prescribed amounting to 26 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 admission of documents, did not even deny any document of the plaintiff and just stated qua many documents of the plaintiff while being exhibited as \"with objections\" without disclosing what objections, objections to the mode or manner of proof or objection to the contents of the documents and no question in cross examination was put to the witnesses of the plaintiff on the mode/manner/veracity/existence/contents of any of the documents relied upon the plaintiff. \n48. It needs to refer herein that \"with objections\" has no meaning under the Commercial Courts Act and it is not even equivalent to \"evasive denial\" and therefore it amounts to admission of documents in terms of Order XI(4).Further, it appears that the appellants raising objections with respect to pleadings and documents at the appellate stage which they are not permitted to do so because as per mandate of the Commercial Courts Act or even under the Code, re-trial of the case at the appellate stage is not possible. \n49. Further, one of the significant provisions made applicable to commercial suit is provided under Order XI of CPC (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act) to allow both parties to file photocopies of documents and not the original documents as contemplated under ordinary suits. As a natural corollary, the mandate of Sections 62 and 63 of Evidence Act and their proofs by resorting to Sections 64 and 65 is not applicable unless and until there is a specific denial of the document's genuineness by the adversary in a suit. It appears that the appellants have obfuscated the law as applicable to the commercial suit while strenuously arguing on the point that documents were not proved in accordance with Section 65 of the Evidence Act. \n50. In the present case, it appears that there is clear consent given for those documents recorded by the learned Original Court in order dated 29.07 2022. Only objection was raised without there being any denial. \nTherefore, it is evident that the appellants are not only enlarging the scope of appeal in this Court but also, they are seeking to curtail the 27 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 procedural ambit brought by the Commercial Courts Act in the CPC vide Section 16 of the Act. Both, it may be said, is aimed to defeat the legislative intention. \n51. Now coming to the judgment as rendered by the Division Bench of this Court in Deoraj Singh (supra) upon which reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the appellant, wherein it has been observed that in exercise of the powers under sub-section (I-A) to Section 13, the High Court can reappreciate the evidence and record its independent findings, can affirm or interfere with the judgment under challenge. However, there is an implicit limitation in the exercise of the powers by the High Court under Section 13(I-A) that every error in law or of fact cannot be gone into and the High Court should not proceed in a manner as if it is on a mistake-finding mission in the judgment under challenge. After all, the Appellate Court shall also be guided by the same rule of preponderance of probability while assessing the evidences laid down by the parties. \n52. Thus, it is evident from the aforesaid judgment that the High Court can reappreciate the evidence and record its independent findings but at the same time the limitation/rider has been carved out by the learned Division Bench by observing that every error in law or of fact cannot be gone into by the Court and further the Court should not proceed in a manner as if it is on a mistake-finding mission in the judgment under challenge. \n53. Thus, from the aforesaid discussion it is evident that there is no quarrel on the issue that the main objective behind the enactment of Act 2015 is speedy disposal of the commercial dispute as per the mandate of Section 13 of the Act 2015 and therefore, at this stage the scope of appeal cannot be so enlarged, otherwise the purpose and legislative intent behind the enactment of the Act 2015 will be defeated. \n28 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 Further the Division Bench in Deoraj Singh (supra) has also put the rider in reappreciating the evidence which is indicative of the fact that the Court has sole discretion in reappreciating the evidence with rider/limitation as per the fact and circumstances of each case.\n54. Now adverting to the factual aspect of the instant case wherefrom it is evident that in the instant appeal, central to all issues is whether the non-issuance of work schedule (schedule of work) for the extended period of contract to the Respondent/Plaintiff by the Appellant/Defendants amounted to breach of the contract on the part of the Appellants. \n55. The learned counsel for the appellants while referring the clause of NIT has contended that there is no requirement for providing a fresh revised work schedule for the balance remaining part of the work, if the work had not been completed within the originally fixed time and additional time had been granted at the request of the contractor for executing the balance part of the work and the respondent contractor has to execute the balance part of the work as per the existing work schedule. \n56. It is further contended that since both the parties understood the contract clearly in its letter and spirit that for the remaining part of the work no revised work schedule is required during the extended period and the respondent has to execute the work accordingly as per the already existing work schedule and the Respondent accordingly, executed the work during the extended period for 2 months i.e. February and March of 2018 and also raised the bills for the same (marked as EX 30 and 31).\n57. It has further been contended that the respondent/plaintiff to the suit although even after the extension of the period since has not submitted the transportation schedule, hence, the work schedule had not been issued, as such, it is lapses on the part of the respondent in not completing the work but the learned original court without taking into 29 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 consideration the aforesaid aspect of the matter of non-submission of the transportation schedule and consequence thereof, the work schedule has not been furnished even though the appellant has been held liable for damages and interest over there, therefore, the judgment suffers from patent illegality and as such, not sustainable in the eyes of law. \n58. Further, it has been submitted that there is no averment in the plaint that the contractor was entitled to a revised work schedule for the extended period of work nor any issue was framed in this regard. Since there is no specific averment assertion in the plaint of the requirement of the revised work schedule, no question arises for any specific denial. To fortified his contention the learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Kishore Kirtilal Mehta (supra) and Bachhaj Nahar v Nilima Mandal (supra). \n59. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent vehemently opposed the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant and has submitted that the work schedule is a \"sine qua non\" for the execution of the contract and DW-1 has admitted this fact that the work schedule is required for an extension period and the appellant did not provide the revised work schedule for the extended period, even then the respondent/plaintiff, bonafidely has commenced the work in the month of February and March, 2018 but no work schedule has been given. \n60. Further ground has been taken that there is no requirement of any transportation schedule since the transportation schedule is to be given at the time of entering into the contract initially. \n61. The ground has also been taken that even accepting the aforesaid fact of submission of transportation schedule then when the request repeatedly has been made before the authority concern, no such order has been passed. The question of no relevance of work schedule 30 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 during the extended period of contract cannot be said to be acceptable in view of the fact that in absence of work schedule which depends upon OB and stripping measurement there cannot be any measurement of coal to be entered into the measurement book for the dispute of payment in favour of the contractor. \n62. The learned counsel for the respondent has further submitted, by making reference of the word 'contract', the work as per the contract and the schedule of the works as referred under the agreement, it cannot be said that the work schedule was not required to be provided. \n63. Thus, it is stated by the respondent that the 'work schedule' is a document of contract itself and Ext 4/1 is the work schedule that was prepared from the time of commencement to the time of completion of the contract. Work schedule is spirit of executory contract where performance of the contractor and his intermittent monthly payment vis--vis target achieved (running bill) is closely interlinked. \n64. Therefore, in the aforesaid rival contentions, it is most essential to understand as to what is the meaning, scope and relevance of work schedule in the contract in question. It is evident that terms and conditions of Contract defines \"contract\", \"work\" and \"contract documents\" as under which schedule of work is mentioned. \n65. As per the terms and condition the \"contract\" shall mean the notice inviting tender, the tender as accepted by the company and the formal agreement executed between the company and the contractor together with the documents referred to therein including general terms and conditions, special conditions, if any, schedule of quantities with rates and amounts, schedule of work. The \"Work\" shall mean the works required to be executed in accordance with the contract. \n66. Further the Clause 8 is also relevant to refer herein which reads as under:\n\"Except where any general or detailed descriptions of the work in quantities provides otherwise, measurements of work done shall be taken in accordance with the relevant standard method of 31 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 measurement as applicable to schedule of quantities/schedule of work/specifications to the contract...\n67. Further, the work schedule as given in the contract in question for 6 years (2012 to 2018) mentions the following headings: Month wise OB in Cumt., Month wise Re handled, Total Month wise OB + Re- handled, Progressive (OB+ Rehandled in current), Month wise Coal in to, progressive coal in te, Month wise Stripping Ratio etc. for Each of the contract Month from February 2012 to January 2018.\n68. It is evident from the contract that at the time of commencing of work by virtue of the work order, the work schedule was provided month wise based upon the OB and stripping which would be evident from exhibit 4/1.\n69. It would be evident from the tabular chart that the work has commenced based upon the work schedule as also the money was disbursed of measurement based upon the schedule of work on the basis of the work performed. It is evident from the condition stipulated which is the tabular chart of the contract that the submission has been made that the deduction is also to be made. \n70. The aforesaid deduction based upon the percentile itself suggest that the work schedule is based on making disbursement of an amount as also the deduction if the work has not been performed as per the work schedule otherwise there was no occasion or reason to have the quantum of deduction based upon the percentile.\n71. So far as the issue of transportation schedule is concerned, although the aforesaid ground has been taken for the first time before this Court which is evident from the pleading itself and also from the evidence of the witnesses.\n72. Further, it is evident that there is provision for penalty up to 10% of the total contract value in the failure on the part of the contractor to comply with the progress in terms of the agreed time and progress chart, under clause 6.2 the contractor is liable for penalties as enumerated therein. \n32 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 73. Thus, it appears that the importance of work schedule is all pervasive and goes to the root of the execution of the work under the contract.\n74. Further, the fact about providing work schedule has been supported by the witnesses produced on behalf of the appellant, i.e., DW-1-Arvind Kr. Mahto, Suryever, BCCL. For ready reference, relevant paragraph of the said testimony is being referred as under:\n\"43. Witness after going through Exhibit 07 stated that it is correct that BOQ etc. are not mentioned in the said document and it was provisional. \n\"44, Witness after going through work order attached to Exhibit 04 Stated that in this, work schedule is mentioned till 2018.\"\n45. I do not have information whether Defendant issued work Schedule with extension period or not.\" \n46. It is correct to say that if any extension is given to a project, then work schedule for the extension period is also issued by BCCL.\" \"47. Witness on being shown two documents dated 29-01-2020 and 29- 08-2020 issued by BCCL( with respect to work Schedule of extended period and for the further extended period in the already extended period) admitted the same and deposed that these are the work schedule of the extension period. Vol. On seeing the NIT of the said project-it can be said whether there was provision for work schedule for the extension period.\"\n(The documents dated 29-01-2020 and 29-08-2020 have been exhibited as Exhibit 61 and Exhibit 61/1 respectively vide order dated 29-7-2022 by the Ld Original Court.\n48. witness after going through page 21 of Exhibit 02 deposed that it in Correct that for doing any Work, BoQ and Finalized Work Programme are necessary and it is applicable on extension of Contract also 49. it is correct to say that work schedule is necessary for Progressive Payment and Target compliance.\" \n50. It is also correct that whatever work is done in extended period of Contract, in that also, Progressive Payment and Target Compliance are seen. Witness stated this after going through Clause 15 at page number 45 of Exhibit 02.\n75. It is thus evident that the witness of the appellant has supported the fact that the work schedule is to be given even for the extended period of contract. The admitted position herein is that the work schedule has not been provided. \n76. From all the above which includes provisions of contract in question, definition and meaning of the word\" contract\", \"work\", \" contract documents\" and \"work schedule\" for the contract duration, it is clear that work schedule is required for progressive payment and target 33 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 compliance and thus, it is sine qua non for the execution of the contracted work and the same has been substantiated by the witness DW.1 also and also gets established by work schedule for the extended period of similar other contract(exhibits 61 and 61/1) which has the same NIT (exhibit 62) as that of the present NIT.\n77. It is an admitted case that BCCL did not provide work schedule for the extended period of contract. It is evident that the Respondent/Plaintiff after demanding work schedule repeatedly and on the oral assurance of BCCL that it will be provided soon, contractor worked in the month of February 2018 and till 23 rd March, 2018. \n78. Further, the appellants during arguments took the objections with respect to work schedule and it is contended that the plaint lacks pleadings with respect to work schedule and therefore it was not a relevant issue or consideration before the original court. \n79. In the response of the aforesaid contention the respondent/plaintiff has submitted that the plaint mentions relevant clauses of the contract i.e. Clause 8 in which work schedule is mentioned. The term finalized work programme is nothing but 'work schedule\". \n80. It is further contended that all the letters/correspondences regarding demand of work schedule were filed along with the plaint and it is a settled connotation of law that all the documents which are attached to the plaint are part of the pleadings. Thus, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants is not worth to consider. \n81. In the light of aforesaid contention of the parties it is required to refer herein that it is settled connotation of law that the documents filed with the pleadings are considered part of the pleadings. Further, while deciding Order VII Rule 11 CPC application for rejection of plaint, it is the plaint along with the documents which are to be seen which further fortify the facts that documents with the plaint are always considered part of the plaint. Reference in this regard may be taken from the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Eldeco Housing and 34 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 Industries Limited vs. Ashok Vidyarthi and Ors, 2023 SCC Online SC 1612.\n82. Further from the record it appears that the plaintiff has filed the documents with the plaint which substantiate the fact that issue of work schedule was being raised by the plaintiff from time to time. It is evident from Letter dated 27.03.2018 (Ext 6) that the plaintiff has raised the issue of work schedule and even asked for confirmed extension as the extension granted was provisional. Further from Letter dated 10.04.2018 (Ext 24) which was response to the earlier correspondences of BCCL/appellant including show cause notice dated 30.03.2018 read with stoppage of work notice dated 02.04.2018, it is indicative that that plaintiff was waiting for competent approval for the extension and work schedule to resume the work. \n83. Further, it was the specific stand taken by the appellants that schedule of work was given in 2012 at the starting of the contract was sufficient and there is no provision in the NIT for giving a separate work schedule for the extension of work for 625 days. Therefore, appellants cannot take the plea that they were taken by surprise by this issue of work schedule and they cannot and have not pleaded any prejudice being caused on this account. \n84. Even if it is presumed for the sake of argument that there is no pleading to this effect, the judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court are very clear on this point if the parties knew the issue and that said issue is involved and evidences were led on the said issue, then in that case formal absence of pleadings is relaxed. Authority on this point is the judgment of Four Judges' Bench of Hon'ble Apex Court in Bhagwati Prasad versus Chandramaul (1966)2 SCR 286 and the relevant paras are as under:\n\"10. But in considering the application of this doctrine to the facts of the present case, it is necessary to bear in mind the other principle that considerations of form cannot over-ride the legitimate considerations of substance. If a plea is not specifically made and yet it is covered by an issue by implication, and the parties knew that the said plea was involved in the original, then the mere fact that the plea was not expressly taken in the pleadings would not necessarily 35 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 disentitle a party from relying upon it if it is satisfactorily proved by evidence. The general rule no doubt is that the relief should be founded on pleadings made by the parties. But where the substantial matters relating to the title of both parties to the suit are touched, though indirectly or even obscurely in the issue, and evidence has been led about them, then the argument that a particular matter was not expressly taken in the pleadings would be purely formal and technical and cannot succeed in every case. What the Court has to consider in dealing with such an objection is: did the parties know that the matter in question was involved in the original, and did they lead evidence about it? If it appears that the parties did not know that the matter was in issue at the original and one of them has had no opportunity to lead evidence in respect of it, that undoubtedly would be a different matter. To allow one party to rely upon a matter in respect of which the other party did not lead evidence and had had no opportunity to lead evidence, would introduce considerations of prejudice, and in doing justice to one party, the Court cannot do injustice to another.\" \n\"15. .....But cases may occur in which though a particular plea is not specifically included in the issues, parties might know that in substance, the said plea is being tried and might lead evidence about it. It is only in such a case where the Court is satisfied that the ground on which reliance is placed by one or the other of the parties, was in substance, at issue between them and that both of them have had opportunity to lead evidence about it at the original and the formal requirement of pleadings can be relaxed. In the present case, having regard to all the facts, we are unable to hold that the High Court erred in confirming the decree for ejectment passes by the original Court on the ground that the defendant was in possession of the suit premises as a licensee. In this case, the High Court was obviously impressed by the thought that once the defendant was shown to be in possession of the suit premises as a licensee, it would be built to require the plaintiff to file another suit against the defendant for ejectment on that basis. We are not prepared to hold that in adopting this approach in the circumstances of this case, the High Court can be said to have gone wrong in law.\" \n85. While relying upon the judgment rendered in Bhagwati Prasad (supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court in Ram Sarup Gupta versus Bishun Narain Inter College and Ors. 1987 2 SCC 555 held, interalia, as under:\n\"6. .....The object and purpose of pleading is to enable the adversary party to know the case it has to meet. In order to have a fair original it is that the party should state the essential material facts so that other party may not be taken by surprise. The pleadings however should receive a liberal construction, no pedantic approach should be adopted to defeat justice on hair splitting technicalities. Sometimes, pleadings are expressed in words which may not expressly make out a case in accordance with strict interpretation of law, in such a case it is the duty of the Court to ascertain the substance of the plead-ings to determine the question. It not desirable place undue emphasis on form, instead the substance of the plead-ings should be considered. Whenever the question about lack of pleading is raised the enquiry should not be so much the form of the pleadings, Instead; the court must find out whether in substance the parties knew the case and the 36 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 issues upon which they went to original. Once it is found that in spite of deficiency in the pleadings parties knew the case and they proceeded to original on those issues by producing evidence, in that event il would not be open to a party to raise the question of absence of pleadings in appeal. In Bhagwati Prasad v. Shri Chandramaul, [1956] 1 SCR 286 Constitution Bench of this Court considering this question observed.\" \n86. While referring to Ram Sarup Gupta versus Bishun Narain inter college(supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court in recent judgment Mohammed Abdul Wahid versus Nilofer (2024) 2 SCC 144 reiterated the same . \n87. However, it was argued by the appellant by taking aid of the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Bachhaj Nahar vs Nilima Mandal that judgment passed in Bhagwati Pd (supra) has been diluted. \n88. In the light of aforesaid contention this Court revisits the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Bhagwati Prasad (supra) and found that the judgment of Bhagwati Prasad (supra) is the judgment of Four Judges Bench and as such, it cannot be diluted/over ruled by Division Bench's judgment rendered in the case of Bachhaj Nahar (supra).\n89. It is not out of place to quote para-17 of even Bachhaj Nahar judgment which says that in exceptional cases where the Court is fully satisfied that the pleadings and issues generally cover the case subsequently put forward and the parties being conscious of the issues, had led evidence on such issue. The said judgment of Bachhaj Nahar further observed in para-17 as under:\n\"17. ....Another aspect to be noticed, is that the court can consider such a case not specifically pleaded, only when one of the parties raise the same at the time of arguments by contending that the pleadings and issues are sufficient sufficient to make out a particular case and that the parties proceeded on that basis and had led evidence on that case\"\n90. The appellants also contented referring to Clause 6 of the General Terms of the Contract that issuance of work schedule for the extension period was depended upon the transportation schedule to be given by the contractor and as there was no transportation schedule given by 37 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 the contractor Plaintiff therefore, there was no occasion for issuing work schedule for the extension period of contract.\n91. In the response of the aforesaid contention of the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned senior counsel for the respondent/plaintiff has contended that this new plea has been taken for the first time during the argument in appeal. It was not taken at any point of time before the original court and not even found in the memorandum of appeal. This is a blatant and brazen attempt to somehow deviate from the issues concerned and cover-up their lapses somehow. Had it really been the stand of the appellants/defendants, they would have written at the first instance in all the correspondences seeking transportation schedule or about alleged non-submission of transportation schedule by the plaintiff. \n92. Further it has been submitted that in the application under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 and its reply by appellant, the issue of work schedule has been discussed in detail and nowhere the appellant took the stand that appellant is not giving the work schedule because the respondent is not giving the transportation schedule. Further if they resort to transportation schedule, then they admit the relevance and necessity of work schedule being sine-quo non for the performance of the contract by the plaintiff contractor. \n93. In the context of aforesaid contention of the parties this Court has again proceeded to the material available on record wherein it appears that there is no pleading, no document, no evidence or even no argument before the original court that transportation schedule was not given by the respondent, or appellant awaited transportation schedule for giving the work schedule. \n94. Now coming to the meaning of transportation schedule which means programme of transportation and terms of the tender document and this clause 6 itself has to be given at the time of signing/conclusion of contract the work order issued and/or when site is handed over to the contractor. Therefore, as the work schedule was given on 27.04.2012, 38 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 so it is obvious that transportation schedule was given by the respondent. \n95. In fact, transportation schedule was not required at the time of signing of contract or at the time of giving work schedule by the appellant, it was required to be maintained by the respondent throughout the contractual tenure in terms of Tender Document minimum number of equipment and vehicles required in the contract with their capacities were already defined therein being mandatory conditions. \n96. Further, in terms of Special Terms and conditions for the contract as provided in the contract document the contractor was obliged to furnish the details of vehicles and equipment to BCCL before the start of the contract, those vehicles were not to be diverted for any other project without the approval of the General Manager, they were required to be deployed in adequate number for satisfactory execution of the work Transportation schedule (details of vehicles) was to be given by the respondent whenever asked by the Appellant on inspection or otherwise. \n97. Therefore, transportation schedule on a piece of paper was regularly submitted by the respondent throughout the contract whenever asked by the appellant. It was given even multiple times in a year. It is not understood as to how the appellant making out a case that respondent did not give the transportation schedule and therefore, they did not give the work schedule.\n98. From the aforesaid discussion it is evident that the transportation schedule is nothing but the details of vehicles including their numbers and capacities which were always available with the appellants given by the respondent. It was given thrice in 2017 and as late as in January, 2018, as such transportation schedule was never an issue and cannot be made an issue at this stage. \n99. Further it is pertinent to mention here that work order and work schedule, both are totally different concepts. Work order is given once subject to amendment which was done twice in the present case 39 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 whereas work schedule (time and progress chart) was given on 27.04.2012 for the period from February 2012 till January, 2018. It was required for the extended period of 625 days (01.02.2018 till 25.10.2019) which can be substantiated from the deposition of the DW-2 in para 5 wherein he deposed which reads as under.\n\"That against the hindrances in Contract, in the extended period of contract, no new or revised work order is issued of any kind and in that extended period work is done as per the said work order only.\" \n100. Thus, it is evident that the term \"work order\" and \"work schedule\"\n(time & progress chart) cannot be interchangeable and both being totally different concepts. Work schedule is the fundamental to the performance appraisal of the contractor in any work contract where payment is made regularly at the end of the month vis--vis target achieved in terms of extraction of coal (weight), removal of OB (volume), their interrelation (stripping ratio) which further depends on blasting operation and explosives use. Without work schedule neither measurement is possible nor efficiency of contractor would be appraised. \n101. Further, there is no doubt that time was of essence to the original contract so is the progress-in-work within time. If the argument of the appellants is taken to be correct, it would imply that they are seeking to dispense with the 'component of time and progress' from the contract during extended period of 625 days, which would amount to re-writing the contract. \n102. Thus, herein the moot question is that can the employer be allowed to rewrite the contract. The answer is 'no' because the valuation of work is intertwined to \"time\" as well as 'quantity and any attempt to take out any one shall be defeating the whole edifice of the contract.\n103. It is settled proposition of law that re-writing of the contract is not possible unilaterally. It means that in order to re-write the term of contract the consent of both of the parties is indispensable. Reference in this regard may be taken from the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in BSNL and Anr v. BPL Mobile Cellular Ltd.\n40 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 and Ors., (2008) 13 SCC 597. The relevant paragraph of the aforesaid judgments is being quoted as under:\n\"42. Recently in DDA case [(2008) 2 SCC 672] this Court held :\n\"66. The stand taken by DDA itself is that the relationship between the parties arises out of the contract. The terms and conditions therefor were, therefore, required to be complied with by both the parties. Terms and conditions of the contract can indisputably be altered or modified. They cannot, however, be done unilaterally unless there exists any provision either in contract itself or in law. Novation of contract in terms of Section 60 of the Contract Act must precede the contract-making process. The parties thereto must be ad idem so far as the terms and conditions are concerned. If DDA, a contracting party, intended to alter or modify the terms of contract, it was obligatory on its part to bring the same to the notice of the allottee. Having not done so, it, relying on or on the basis of the purported office orders which are not backed by any statute, new terms of contract could (sic not be) thrust upon the other party to the contract. The said purported policy is, therefore, not beyond the pale of judicial review. In fact, being in the realm of contract, it cannot be stated to be a policy decision as such. ***\n80. A definite price is an essential element of binding agreement. A definite price although need not be stated in the contract but it must be worked out on some premise as was laid down in the contract. A contract cannot be uncertain. It must not be vague. Section 29 of the Contract Act reads as under:\n'29. Agreements void for uncertainty.--Agreements, the meaning of which is not certain, or capable of being made certain, are void.' A contract, therefore, must be construed so as to lead to a conclusion that the parties understood the meaning thereof. The terms of agreement cannot be vague or indefinite. No mechanism has been provided for interpretation of the terms of the contract. When a contract has been worked out, a fresh liability cannot be thrust upon a contracting party.\" \n(See also New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadia [(2008) 3 SCC 279 : (2007) 14 Scale 556] .)\n44. If the parties were ad idem as regards terms of the contract, any change in the tariff could not have been made unilaterally. Any novation in the contract was required to be done on the same terms as are required for entering into a valid and concluded contract. Such an exercise having not been resorted to, we are of the opinion that no interference with the impugned judgment is called for. \n52. We will assume that the contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General that the internal circulars are issued for their application by the local officers. If they have committed a mistake, the same could be rectified. Indisputably, mistakes can be rectified. Mistake may occur in entering into a contract. In the latter case, the mistake must be made known. If by reason of a rectification of mistake, except in some exceptional cases, as for example, where it is apparent on the face of the record, mistake cannot be rectified unilaterally. The parties that would suffer civil consequences by reason of such act of rectification of mistake must be given due notice. Principles of natural justice are required to be complied 41 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 with. The fact that there was no mistake apparent on the face of the records is borne out by the fact that even the officers wanted clarification from higher officers. The mistake, if any, was sought to be rectified after a long period; at least after a period of three years. When a mistake is not rectified for a long period, the same, in law, may not be treated to be one.\"\n104. Thus, by denying the very necessity of the work schedule in the present case, the defendants/appellants denied the very process of certification which is the prime job of the engineer-in-charge as per the Clause 8 of General term of contract of NIT. It is due to this lack of certification for February and March 2018, that prevented the plaintiff/respondent from raising bill and presenting it to the BCCL. \n105. Since work schedule is linked to measurement (clause 8) of GTC penalty and (clause 6.2) of General Term of Contract. The contract did not provide any provision of one-time measurement or payment or penalty so it is incorrect to say that work schedule was not necessary for the extended period. Hence, on this count, the BCCL committed breach of the contract. \n106. The learned counsel for the appellants has further raised the various contentions which have already been taken note by this Court but in midst of the all the said issues the central issue is non-supply of work schedule and the learned original court has categorically held that non-supply of work schedule amounts to breach of the contract by the appellant and since the breach of contract was committed on behalf of the appellant/defendant therefore the plaintiff/respondent is eligible for damages. Accordingly, the learned court has allowed the claim with interest in favour of the plaintiff/respondent. \n107. Thus, it requires to refer herein that since the central issue has already been decided by this Court which is in conformity of the finding of the original court, therefore the other issues which have been raised by the learned counsel for the appellant can only be entertained herein if there is perversity and non-consideration of the facts or law by the original court while passing the order of damages in favour of the plaintiff/respondent. \n42 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 108. At this juncture this Court would like to discuss the meaning of perversity and active consideration which are very much relevant in addressing the issues as raised by the learned counsel for the appellants. \n109. The definition of perversity has been taken note of in the judgment rendered in Arulvelu and Another v. State represented by the Public Prosecutor and Another [(2009) 10 SCC 206] at paragraph 27, which is quoted hereunder :-\n27. The expression \"perverse\" has been defined by various dictionaries in the following manner:\n1. Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English, 6th Edn. \n\"Perverse.--Showing deliberate determination to behave in a way that most people think is wrong, unacceptable or unreasonable.\"\n2. Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, International Edn. Perverse.--Deliberately departing from what is normal and reasonable.\n3. The New Oxford Dictionary of English, 1998 Edn. Perverse.--Law (of a verdict) against the weight of evidence or the direction of the judge on a point of law.\n4. The New Lexicon Webster's Dictionary of the English Language (Deluxe Encyclopedic Edn.) Perverse.--Purposely deviating from accepted or expected behavior or opinion; wicked or wayward; stubborn; cross or petulant. \n5. Stroud's Judicial Dictionary of Words & Phrases, 4th Edn. \n\"Perverse.--A perverse verdict may probably be defined as one that is not only against the weight of evidence but is altogether against the evidence.\"\n110. Further, the Hon'ble Apex Court in yet another judgment rendered in Kuldeep Singh v. Commissioner of Police and Others [(1999) 2 SCC 10] has held under paragraph 10 which reads as under :-\n10. A broad distinction has, therefore, to be maintained between the decisions which are perverse and those which are not. If a decision is arrived at on no evidence or evidence which is thoroughly unreliable and no reasonable person would act upon it, the order would be perverse. But if there is some evidence on record which is acceptable and which could be relied upon, howsoever compendious it may be, the conclusions would not be treated as perverse and the findings would not be interfered with.\" \n111. Further, the meaning of \"perverse\" has been examined in H.B. Gandhi, Excise and Taxation Officer-cum Assessing Authority, Karnal and Others v. M/s Gopi Nath & Sons and Others [1992 Supp (2) SCC 312] wherein, at paragraph 7, the Honble Apex Court has observed as under :\n43 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 \"7. ------. It is, no doubt, true that if a finding of fact is arrived at by ignoring or excluding relevant material or by taking into consideration irrelevant material or if the finding so outrageously defies logic as to suffer from the vice of irrationality incurring the blame of being perverse, then, the finding is rendered infirm in law.\"\n112. Thus, it is evident that the perversity means if a decision is arrived at on no evidence or evidence which is thoroughly unreliable and no reasonable person would act upon it, the order would be perverse. But if there is some evidence on record which is acceptable and which could be relied upon, howsoever compendious it may be, the conclusions would not be treated as perverse and the findings would not be interfered with. \n113. Further, the meaning of 'consideration' is the active application of mind of the factual aspect, as per the definition of 'consideration' given by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Chairman, Life Insurance Corporation of India & Ors. Vs. A. Masilamani, (2013) 6 SCC 530, wherein, at paragraph-19, it has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court as under:-\n19. The word \"consider\" is of great significance. The dictionary meaning of the same is, to think over, to regard as, or deem to be. Hence, there is a clear connotation to the effect that there must be active application of mind. In other words, the term \"consider\" postulates consideration of all relevant aspects of a matter. Thus, formation of opinion by the statutory authority should reflect intense application of mind with reference to the material available on record. The order of the authority itself should reveal such application of mind. The appellate authority cannot simply adopt the language employed by the disciplinary authority and proceed to affirm its order. \n114. From the interpretation made by the Hon'ble Apex Court with respect to meaning of \"consideration\", it would be evident that consideration can only be said to be proper consideration if there is active application of mind. \n115. In the light of aforesaid settled legal proposition this Court has considered the finding recorded by the original court and found therefrom that the consideration has been given regarding casting accountability upon the appellant for non-supply of the work schedule for the extended period of the contract and that has led the learned 44 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 court to come to the conclusion and in passing the order dated 08.05.2023 in favour of the respondent/plaintiff. \n116. Now coming to the order impugned dated 08.05.2023 by which damages has been awarded to the plaintiff. It is evident that learned original court has taken note of each and every factual aspect of the case, which are evident from the various paragraphs of the order impugned. \n117. This Court thinks fit to take note of the paragraphs of the impugned order in coming to the conclusion as to whether the court has taken note of the entire evidence while deciding the issues involved in the case. \n118. It is evident from record that in order to decide the issues involved in the case, the original court has framed 13 issues for adjudication which are as under:\n\"1. Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form? \n2. Whether the suit is barred under Principals of estoppel, waiver, and acquiescence? \n3. Whether the suit is barred by limitation? \n4. Whether the suit is barred under the contract? \n5. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to damages? \n6. Whether defendant-employer failed to discharge its obligation to provide and specify specific gravity and stripping ratio for the suit mines and if yes? What figure can be taken thereof? \n7. Whether defendant-employer discharged its obligation to provide coal mines available for the work as stipulated in the contract free of impediments and obstacles? \n8. Whether the defendant is under obligation to reimburse the amount to plaintiff as per the Coal India Limited implemented special wages payment? \n9. Whether the termination of contract by the defendant in the middle of the contract is illegal and unjustified? \n10. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get refund bank guarantee? \n11. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to reimbursement for service tax paid? \n12. Whether plaintiff is entitled to relief claimed in the suit? \n13. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to interest or cost?\" \n119. From the perusal of impugned order it is evident that while deciding the issue of damages, the original court has taken note of various exhibits and categorically held that defendants did not give work schedule for the execution of contract of the extended contract period 45 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 and therefore, the breach of contract by the defendants stands proved, thus on the basis of available record and extension of work contract to be done, the plaintiff is entitled for the loss of profit to the tune of 15% (calculated/computed conservatively) totaling to Rs.134,116,526/- (Rupees Thirteen Crores Forty One lacs Sixteen Thousand Five Hundred and Twenty Six only). For ready reference the relevant paragraph of the impugned order is being quoted as under:\n\"Now from perusal of Exhibit 2 (NIT), Exhibit 4 (work order), Exhibit 6 (letter dated 27.03.2018), Exhibit 20 (notice dated 30.03.2018) Exhibit 26 and 26/1 (letter dated 06.10.2018 and 05.11.2018), Exhibit 24 (reply plaintiff dated 10.04.18 to the notice dated 30.03.18, I find that these documents clearly show that the plaintiff was ready and willing to resume work if the grievances of the plaintiff were addressed and work schedule was given to them by the defendants which was reciprocal promise to be performed by the defendants in terms of the contract) and Exhibits 45-58, 61, 61/1,62 and 63 as well as Schedule A to the plaint. \nI further find that it is an admitted position that contract was a concluded contract between the parties and both the parties were bound to perform their parts of the contract. In this connection I further find from the evidences adduced on behalf of plaintiff and relevant documents filed on his behalf that defendants did not give work schedule for the execution of contract of the extended contract period and therefore, the breach of contract by the defendants stand proved as it failed to perform its reciprocal part of the performance as per section 49-53 of the Indian Contract Act 1872, which have been discussed herein before in the foregoing paragraph. In view of the fact that breach of contract by the defendants stand proved, question arises about the compensation/damages in terms of section 73 of the Contract Act, discussed herein before. On this point I find that on the basis of available record and extension of work contract to be done, the plaintiff is entitled for the loss of profit to the tune of 15% (calculated/ computed conservatively) totaling to Rs. 134,116,526/-( Rupees Thirteen Crores Forty One lacs Sixteen Thousand Five Hundred and Twenty Six only)-----. \nI further find that various amount was paid by the plaintiff to various financial companies which have been incurred by the plaintiff towards payment of EMIs for machines and equipments which the plaintiff was supposed to use for the work to be done but could not be done because of non-performance of the reciprocal promise by the defendants by not providing work schedule to the plaintiff which was for resumption and conclusion of work. Due to breach of contract and wrongful actions done by the defendants, those machines and equipment's remained idle for the period April 2018 till October 2019( till the date of completion of extended contract) , which is crystal clear from exhibits 45 to 48, which are documents in the nature of EMI statement of the HDFC Bank for the relevant period, notice of appointment of arbitrator regarding outstanding loan with HDFC Bank and other financial institutions, legal notices, correspondences, EMI calculation chart, complaint cases etc. 46 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 Since as per contract performance security was obtained from contractor, the defendants were also under obligation to ensure utilization of the assets deputed on its mines. In this connection it is to say that if plaintiff was allowed to conclude the contract the aforesaid amount ought to have been adjusted to cost of work which the plaintiff ought to have received from the defendants. As such I find that plaintiff is also entitled for Rs. 13,46,06,546.43/- for the loss sustained on payment of equated monthly installment (EMI) towards loan taken from various financial institutions by the plaintiff for the period April 2018 till October 2019. \n---- it is admitted fact that the plaintiff sought extension of time for completion of contract in lieu of the hindrance of 694 days for which admittedly the defendants granted 625 days extension of contract though without fresh work schedule which made impossible for the plaintiff to resume/complete the work. In fact after granting 625 days of extension, they on record were willing to extend further but without performing reciprocal promise of providing work schedule which was sine quo non. Therefore, they are guilty of breach of contract and therefore damages as detailed above. I further find that the hindrances occurred not on account of any fault of the plaintiff otherwise there was no occasion for the defendants to grant the time extension of 625 days which is almost equivalent to One year and Nine months. This is not even force majure and therefore attributable to the Defendants. The plaintiff even would have finished the work in the extended period of 625 days provided the defendants would have provided the work schedule, plaintiff ought to have incurred profitability loss as the plaintiff ought to have earned profit of 625 days if would have completed the contract without the hindrances of 625/694 days. This loss of profitably has been incurred by the plaintiff in the present scenario also as the plaintiff in order to complete the contract in the extended period kept on waiting through out keeping all its equipments/ machineries idle and kept on paying EMIs for all till October 2019. As such this hindrances further show that the defendants were negligent in dealing with the plaintiff failed to handover the site to the plaintiff without hindrances etc. Accordingly this issue is decided in favour plaintiff against the defendants. \n----- Technically and formally the defendants never terminated the contract. However, they created a situation which was akin to termination as the plaintiff was put in a situation that it cannot execute the contract further. As late as 16-10-2019 (Exhibit 62), defendants informed and reminded the plaintiff that the contract will expire on 25-10-2019. Even in this letter, they allegedly reiterated that the plaintiff suspended the execution of the awarded work from 23-03- 2018 and did not resume the execution of the work despite several communications. Therefore, what is inferred from all the above that the defendants did not terminate the contract officially and kept on trying to impute upon the plaintiff that they abandoned the work from 23-03-2018 onwards. I further find that It was a cover up justification on the part of defendants who breached the contract in clear terms by not providing the work schedule of the extended period of contract and instead by action terminated the contract (by invoking bank guarantee) but formally never terminated the contract nor ever communicated to the plaintiff about any such alleged contract. \n120. The learned original court while deciding the issue of termination of contract has categorically held that it is crystal clear that work 47 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 schedule for extended period was to be provided by BCCL but was intentionally and malafidely not given in the present case and further the justification of not providing the work schedule for the extended contract by the defendants gets self-contradictory and contrary to their similarly executed NIT and thus the defendants had breached the contract by not performing their part of contract i.e., by not providing the work schedule of the extended period of contract till 29.10.2019. For ready reference the relevant paragraph is quoted as under:\n\"From the above discussion, it is crystal clear that work schedule for extended period are provided by BCCL but was intentionally and malafide not given in the present case for the extended period of contract and further the justification of not providing work schedule for the extended Contract by the defendants gets self- contradictory and Contrary to their similarly executed NIT. It also becomes crystal clear that the defendants have concealed more than what they have revealed in this case and it is not a case of abandonment of contract by the plaintiff but creation of such situation by the defendants wherein the plaintiff has no choice but not to resume work as the defendants started working contrary to terms of Contract and in contradiction of their stand in similarly situated projects. In fact it were the defendants who breached the contract by not performing their part of contract i.e. by not providing the work schedule of the extended period of contract till 29-10-2019. \nI further find that 'work schedule' as appears from the nomenclature is the month wise targets from the month when contract work commences till the same is completed. It was initially supplied by the defendant from month of February, 2012 till January, 2018 where the target is fixed for each month and also the cumulative target for each succeeding month (Exhibit 4). This work schedule is prepared jointly by the contractor and the employer. In the Contract Agreement (Ext.- 2) work schedule has been described as integral part of the contract. Practically, this is the planning of the contract work (removal of OB and extraction of coal) done before the beginning of the work. Hence, it is ridiculous and illogical to say that work schedule of the year 2012-18 could be followed in year 2018-19. Each progressive monthly target cannot become regressive. No one can travel back to past. Moreover, the extension in the case was provisional and defendants employer reserved right to impose penalty, so it is absurd on part of the employer to suggest that work could be performed without it, which is also clear from clause 14 of work (Ext. 4) which deals with penalty. In this clause it has been mentioned, \"you shall be liable for the penalties as defined in the terms and condition of NIT/Tender Documents due to failure on your part, if any during execution of work.\" As such in the event of the contractor's failure to comply with the required progress in terms of the agreed time and progress chart or to complete the work and clear the site on or before the contract or the extended date of completion, he shall without prejudice to any other right or remedy available under the 48 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 law to the company on account of such breach, shall become liable to pay for penalty-------. \nAs such in the light of aforesaid discussion I came to conclusion that the termination of contract by the defendants in the middle of contract is illegal and unjustified which has been proved by the plaintiff. Therefore, this issue has also been decided in favour of plaintiff and against the defendants. \n121. The learned original court while dealing with the issue of bank guarantee and the interest has taken note of statement of witnesses and has observed that the plaintiff was not doing the work after March 2018 due to defendants' failure to provide the work schedule which was the integral part of the contract and without which the extended contract period ought not have commenced and concluded. Hence, the act of defendants in enforcing performance guarantee is illegal and malafide and without giving opportunity the Bank guarantee was encashed secretly at the back of the plaintiff. For ready reference the relevant paragraph of impugned order is being quoted as under:\n\"Since relief with regard to bank guarantee and the interest on it, has been sought by the plaintiff, hence this issue has been casted on the pleading of plaintiff. As such the onus to prove this issue is upon the plaintiff. Before going to decide this issue I would like to mention some of the exhibits which are relevant for adjudication of this issue i.e. Exhibit 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and Exhibit 41. Exhibit 33 is photocopy of month wise retention money details, Exhibit 36 is photocopy of protest letter over BG encashment written by plaintiff to the defendant dated 15.04.2019, Exhibit 37 is photocopy of reply of BCCL dated 27.04.2019 to the letter of the plaintiff dated 15.04.2019, Exhibit 38 photocopy of letter of defendant to the SBI, SME Branch dated 02.04.2019 about encashment, Exhibit 39 photocopy of letter from SBI to the plaintiff dated 10.04.2019, Exhibit 40 is photocopy of letter dated 25.04.2019 of plaintiff to Branch Manager, SBI, Dhanbad regarding BG encashment and Exhibit 41 is certified copy of order sheet of R.C. Case No. 01(A)/2019 (D). \nFrom perusal of the aforesaid exhibits quoted under this issue and the relevant portion of NIT and other material available on the record I find that NC Patch Kuya was completed by the plaintiff on 31.01.2018. Meanwhile the Bank guarantee was extended from time to time. Lastly on 18.05.2018 which was valid till 29.05.2019. Plaintiff came to know that Bank guarantee amount of 2,10,01,161/- was encashed by the defendant without any justifiable reason. I further find that PW-1 Rahul Singh has also stated with respect to bank guarantee and retention money which would be clear from para 26 and 28 of his examination in chief and even during cross examination, the defendants put no question to either PW-1 and PW-2 whatsoever and therefore the deposition of the plaintiff's witnesses remains unrebutted. I further find that PW-2 has also stated in para 25 of his examination in chief that amount of Rs. 2,10,01,161/- as Bank guarantee as realization money along with interest @ 15% is payable 49 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 to the plaintiff. In his cross examination no question was put to this witness on behalf of thedefendants. When I go through the deposition of DW-1 and DW-2 I find that both the witnesses did not say even a single word about the Bank guarantee and the retention money. I further find that a guarantee is a contract to perform the promise or discharge the liability of the third person in case of default. There are three parties namely- the principal debtor, creditor, and Debtor here plaintiff is the principal debtor and defendant is the creditor. The bank guarantee is a contract of secondary liability which arise only on the default of the principal debtor. The performance guarantee in question was executed by SBI Bank bearing No. BG 19/188[0654118BG000306] dated 18.05.2018 Rs. 2,10,01,161/-. The plaintiff wrote a letter dated- 15.04.2019 to the defendants which was marked as Exhibit- 36 in which the plaintiff protested about encashment of the BG without any notice to the defendants. The defendant replied to the said notice vide their letter dated- 27-07-2019 (Exhibit-37) .Para- 3 of this letter (Exhibit 37) the defendants referred to the case pending before CBI vide FIR No. RC. 1 (A)/2019-D dated- 03.01.2019. It has been further stated in para 4 of the said letter (Exhibit- 37) that the plaintiff has not completed awarded work and suspended the work and hence breached the condition. It has also been alleged that BCCL is continuously incurring losses in financial year 2019-2020 due to plaintiff's action. It is submitted that the State Bank of India vide this letter dated- 10.04.2019 (Exhibit-39) has intimated the plaintiff that full Bank guarantee amount has been credited to BCCL Accounts. It is interesting to note that defendant has written a letter dated 02.04.2019 for encashment of BG (Exhibit-38). The plaintiff wrote back to the State Bank of India vide letter dated- 25.04.2019 intimating about the total ignorance of the plaintiff about the bilateral correspondence between the Bank and the defendant. The contention of the defendant about the pendency of criminal case before CBI subsequently proved to be false in view of final report submitted by the CBI before the special Court, Dhanbad (Exhibit-44). I further find that in the aforesaid final report CBI has mentioned that \"the contractor was working @ much below rate as prescribed in the contract. Thus as per the NIT/contract the contractor was not causing any loss to the BCCL\". Hence the allegation of defendant coupled with their reliance of lodgment of CBI case clearly favours the case of plaintiff inview of final outcome of the said case whereby the allegation of over payment/ loss of BCCL was totally disbelieved. The plaintiff was not doing the work after March 2018 due to defendants failure to provide the work schedule which was the integral part of the contract and without which the extended contract period ought not have commenced and concluded. Hence the act of defendants in enforcing performance guarantee is illegal and malafide. I also find that there is no opportunity given to the plaintiff either by the Bank or defendants to present its case and the Bank guarantee was encashed secretly at the back of the plaintiff . I further find that there is no occasion for the defendants to liquidate the bank guarantee amount as the plaintiff had performed and discharged its duty as record under the contract. \nAs such I find that plaintiff has been able to prove this issue in his favour. Accordingly this issue also decided in favour of plaintiff and against defendants.----------. \nI find that in this regard plaintiff has filed a letter detailing the total amount in the head of Service Tax. Although the said Exhibit 32 has been marked with objection there is no reason cited by the defendant 50 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 for such objection in the cross-examination. The defendants have put questions to this witness and all the replies were given by this witness which is crystal clear from para 60, 61 & 62 of this cross examination. I further find that defendants had not put any suggestion to the plaintiff in the cross examination. On the other hand, the defendant witness namely Arvind Kumar Mahato (D.W. 1) and Sanjiv Kashyap (D.W. 2) are totally silent in respect of service tax. I also find that no document has been filed by the defendants in support of their contention in as alleged in their written statement. I, therefore find that pleading of defendant was unsupported by the documentary and oral evidence and the pleadings unsupported by the documentary and oral evidence has no value in the eyes of law and plaintiff is entitled to claim of service Tax as put forth in Exhibit 32. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of plaintiff and against the defendants 122. It is evident that the learned original court has meticulously gone through the entire material available on record and the evidences adduced by both the parties, has found that the plaintiff has been able to establish its case successfully and proved its claim. \n123. So far as the issue of interest is concern the original court has taken note of the fact that the plaintiff has suffered huge monetary loss without having any fault of its own and due to the whims and fancies of the defendants and therefore held that, the plaintiff is entitled for the pendente lite and interest @ 10.5% p.a.\n124. Since, the rate of interest has emphatically been contended by the learned counsel for the defendants/appellants, therefore, this Court would like to revisit the issue of the interest. \n125. The learned counsel for the appellant has contended that the interest was allowed by the learned original Court at the rate of 10.5% p.a. which is contrary to the requirement of Section 2(b) and Section 3(b) of the Interest Act read with Rule 2A of Order VII, as amended pursuant to the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n126. It is evident that admittedly the suit has been adjudicated under the Commercial Courts Act as Commercial Suit. There is no contractual provision as to what would be the rate of interest in the contract. \n127. It is contended that the pleadings in the plaint is not in terms of Rule 2-A (3) of Order VII, however it is considered view of this Court that the same will not lead to rejection of interest as given in the Commercial Suit for commercial transaction as the said provisions are 51 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 directory and not mandatory and there is no consequence provided in the Commercial Court Act for not adhering to the provisions of Rule 2-A. Therefore, the Respondent is entitled for interest for the commercial transaction. \n128. The Hon'ble Apex Court has dealt with the issue that in which circumstances the provision of law will be directory and in which circumstances the same will be mandatory. Reference in this regard may be made to the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Dalchand vs., Municipal Corporation, Bhopal & Anr., (1984) 2 SCC 486, wherein, it has been held as under:-\n\".... .... ....There are no ready tests or invariable formulae to determine whether a provision is mandatory or directory. The broad purpose of the statute is important. The object of the particular provision must be considered. The link between the two is most important. The weighing of the consequence of holding a provision to be mandatory or directory is vital and, more often than not, determinative of the very question whether the provision is mandatory or directory. Where the design of the statute is the avoidance or prevention of public mischief, but the enforcement of a particular provision literally to its letter will tend to defeat that design, the provision must be held to be directory, so that proof of prejudice in addition to non-compliance of the provision is necessary to invalidate the act complained of. It is well to remember that quite often many rules, though couched in language which appears to be imperative, are no more than mere instructions to those entrusted with the task of discharging statutory duties for public benefit. The negligence of those to whom public duties are entrusted cannot by statutory interpretation be allowed to promote public mischief and cause public inconvenience and defeat the main object of the statute. It is as well to realise that every prescription of a period within which an act must be done, is not the prescription of a period of limitation with painful consequences if the act is not done within that period. Rule 9(j) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, as it then stood, merely instructed the Food Inspector to send by registered post copy of the Public Analyst's report to the person from whom the sample was taken within 10 days of the receipt of the report. Quite obviously the period of 10 days was not a period of limitation within which an action was to be initiated or on the expiry of which a vested right accrued. The period of 10 days was prescribed with a view to expedition and with the object of giving sufficient time to the person from whom the sample was taken to make such arrangements as he might like to challenge the report of the Public Analyst, for example, by making a request to the Magistrate to send the other sample to the Director of the Central Food Laboratory for analysis. Where the effect of non-compliance with the rule was such as to wholly deprive the right of the person to challenge the Public Analyst's report by obtaining the report of the Director of the Central 52 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 Food Laboratory, there might be just cause for complaint, as prejudice would then be writ large. .Where no prejudice was caused there could be no cause for complaint. I am clearly of the view that Rule 9(j) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules was directory and not mandatory. The decisions in Public Prosecutor v. Murlidhar [1977 Cr LJ 1634 (AP) : 1977 Andh LT 34 : 1977 MLJ (Cri) 205] and Bhola Nath v. State [1977 Cr LJ 154 (Cal) : (1977) 1 FAC 38] to the extent that they hold that Rule 9(j) was mandatory are not good law. The petition is dismissed. \n129. Likewise, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Patil Automation (P) Ltd. & Ors. vs. Rakheja Engineers (P) Ltd., (2022) 10 SCC 1, has held at paragraph-34, which reads as under:-\n\"34. In Bhikraj Jaipuria v. Union of India [Bhikraj Jaipuria v. Union of India, AIR 1962 SC 113] , a Bench of five learned Judges dealt with the question arising out of Section 175(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935. The Court, inter alia, had to deal with the question, whether enactment should be considered directory or obligatory : (AIR p. 119, para 17) \"17. The question still remains whether the purchase orders executed by the Divisional Superintendent but which were not expressed to be made by the Governor-General and were not executed on behalf of the Governor-General, were binding on the Government of India. Section 175(3) plainly requires that contracts on behalf of the Government of India shall be executed in the form prescribed thereby; the section however does not set out the consequences of non-compliance. Where a statute requires that a thing shall be done in the prescribed manner or form but does not set out the consequences of non-compliance, the question whether the provision was mandatory or directory has to be adjudged in the light of the intention of the legislature as disclosed by the object, purpose and scope of the statute. If the statute is mandatory, the thing done not in the manner or form prescribed can have no effect or validity : if it is directory, penalty may be incurred for non-compliance, but the act or thing done is regarded as good. As observed in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Edn., p. 376:\n'It has been said that no rule can be laid down for determining whether the command is to be considered as a mere direction or instruction involving no invalidating consequence in its disregard, or as imperative, with an implied nullification for disobedience, beyond the fundamental one that it depends on the scope and object of the enactment. It may perhaps be found generally correct to say that nullification is the natural and usual consequence of disobedience, but the question is in the main governed by considerations of convenience and justice, and when that result would involve general inconvenience or injustice to innocent persons, or advantage to those guilty of the neglect, without promoting the real aim and object of the enactment, such an intention is not to be attributed to the legislature. The whole scope and purpose of the statute under consideration must be regarded.' 53 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 Lord Campbell in Liverpool Borough Bank v. Turner [Liverpool Borough Bank v. Turner, (1860) 30 LJ Ch 379 : 45 ER 715] observed : (ER p. 718) '... No universal rule can be laid down ... as to whether mandatory enactments shall be considered directory only or obligatory with an implied nullification for disobedience. It is the duty of courts of justice to try to get at the real intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute to be construed.' \" \n130. Further, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Bhavnagar University vs. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd. and Others, (2003) 2 SCC 111, at paragraphs-42 and 43, has held as under:-\n\"42. We are not oblivious of the law that when a public functionary is required to do a certain thing within a specified time, the same is ordinarily directory but it is equally well settled that when consequence for inaction on the part of the statutory authorities within such specified time is expressly provided, it must be held to be imperative.\n43. In Sutherland's Statutory Construction, 3rd Edn., Vol. 3, at p. 102 the law is stated as follows:\n\"... unless the nature of the act to be performed, or the phraseology of the statute is such that the designation of time must be considered a limitation of the power of the officer\". \nAt p. 107 it is pointed out that a statutory direction to private individuals should generally be considered as mandatory and that the rule is just the opposite to that which obtains with respect to public officers. Again, at p. 109, it is pointed out that often the question as to whether a mandatory or directory construction should be given to a statutory provision may be determined by an expression in the statute itself of the result that shall follow noncompliance with the provision. At p. 111 it is stated as follows:\n\"As a corollary of the rule outlined above, the fact that no consequences of non-compliance are stated in the statute, has been considered as a factor tending towards a directory construction. But this is only an element to be considered, and is by no means conclusive.\"\n131. Thus, from aforesaid discussion it is apparent that the original court has meticulously examined each and every evidence as available on record in order to allow the various claim in favour of the plaintiff, therefore, the order of original court has not suffered with any perversity. Further the original court while answering all the issues has actively considered each and every aspect of the instant case. \n132. The learned original court, on consideration of the factual aspect, as has been answered hereinabove, based upon the testimony of the 54 Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2023 witnesses, has answered all the issues, particularly regarding the non- furnishing of the work schedule by the appellants which has been taken as one of the grounds to compensate the respondent/plaintiff by way of damages. \n133. Thus, the order impugned requires no interference by this Court. \n134. Accordingly, the instant appeal fails and is dismissed. \n135. Pending interlocutory application(s), if any, also stands disposed of. \n                     I agree,                     (Sujit Narayan Prasad, A.C.J.)\n\n\n              (Arun Kumar Rai, J.)

jagatramka issued a personal guarantee on 02.07.2013 on behalf of gujarat (nre) coke limited in favour of ultrabulk a/s for a sum of usd 4,259,395. the petitioner had agreed that if gujarat (nre) coke limited would not pay the liabilities by 31st december 2013, he would on first written demand, pay a sum equivalent to liability plus interest. ultrabulk a/s demanded the sum of usd 4,259,395 plus interest under the personal guarantee. mr. jagatramka has failed to pay any part of that sum. as a result thereof, ultrabulk a/s (the decree holder-respondent herein) instituted proceedings before the high court of justice, queens' bench, commercial court of london, u.k., neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined against the petitioner judgement debtor under the personal guarantee, by issuing a claim form. after exchange of pleadings, the english high court on 09.11.2017, passed a foreign decree directing the judgement debtor to make payment of the amount as aforesaid in addition to accrued interest to the decree holder. 4.2 the decree holder instituted execution proceedings under section 44a of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (for short 'the cpc'), in relation to the foreign decree. on 07.05.2018, the petitionerjudgment debtor filed application exh.11 resisting the execution of the foreign decree on the grounds that the foreign judgement was not conclusive since it had not been passed in consonance with section 13 of the code of civil procedure. on 28.01.2020, the judgement debtor filed an application exh.45 before the trial court indicating that since the court had accepted the judgement debtor's contention that neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined in absence of general or special permission of the reserve bank of india, the judgement debtor is prohibited from remitting any funds. the execution proceedings must be dismissed as the same cannot be executed in india. both these applications were decided by the order impugned in this petition. the trial court on 29.02.2020, rejected applications exh.11 and exh.45 regarding the objection of the enforceability as a foreign decree. 5. mr. percy kavina learned senior advocate appearing with mr. vivek gupta, learned advocate for the petitioner, in context of this petition, made the following submissions: 5.1 inviting the court's attention to the provisions of section 13(a) to (f) read with section 47 of the cpc, mr. kavina would submit that the foreign judgement is not conclusive as it has not been given on the merits of the case. he would submit that the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined judgement debtor is a resident of kolkata and the alleged personal guarantee has been executed in australia. the judgement debtor is neither a resident of england nor has any cause of action occurred in england to confer the territorial jurisdiction to the courts of england. 5.2 that the foreign judgement is not conclusive as the same has not been passed in consonance with section 13(b) of the cpc, inasmuch as, it has not been given on merits of the case. he would submit that it is an admitted position that gujarat (nre) coke limited has made a payment of usd 2,452,471 against the applicant's claim of usd 4,259,395. despite this fact, the impugned foreign judgement has been passed by failing to appropriate the said amount against the judgement debtor's personal guarantee. having received part of the amount, the court ought to have apportioned the said amount against the amount covered by the personal neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined guarantee. 5.3 that it was the judgement debtor's defense that the personal guarantee was drafted by the lawyer of the claimant and did not involve any lawyer from his side and therefore, the same cannot be executed. 5.4 that in accordance with section 13(c) of the cpc, the foreign judgment is not conclusive since it has been passed by refusing to recognize the law of india which is applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. it was very much apparent that the petitioner could not issue any such personal guarantee as per the relevant provisions of foreign exchange management (guarantees) (regulations), 2000 and foreign exchange management act (fema), 1999, without the specific approval / permission of the reserve bank of india. reading the relevant regulations, mr. kavina would submit that since no specific prior approval was neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined sought from or granted by the reserve bank of india before giving the guarantee, the respondent could not have enforced the personal guarantee. accordingly, since the impugned foreign judgement and decree has been passed by refusing to recognize the law of india where the provisions of fema act and the regulations are applicable, the judgement and decree are not conclusive. 5.5 assailing the foreign judgement in context of section 13(d) of the cpc, mr. kavina would submit that the judgement has been obtained in violation of principles of natural justice. he would submit that it is evident from record that the judgement debtorpetitioner had requested for appearing through video conferencing on 30.10.2017 which was rejected. hence, the judgement debtor was not given opportunity to defend himself and there was therefore violation of principles of natural justice. 5.6 inviting the court's attention to the provisions neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined of section 13(f) of the code, it was mr. kavina's submission that since the petitioner could not have executed the subject personal guarantee on 02.07.2013 without the prior permission of the reserve bank of india, the judgement was founded on the breach of the law enforced in india i.e. the fema act and the fema regulations. 5.7 mr. kavina would extensively read the judgement of the foreign court in context of the examination of an expert witness viz. mr. amitava majumdar who had opined that the relevant regulation does not require that permission be obtained prior to entering into the guarantee. he would submit that the english court completely ignored the fact that mr. amitava majumdar who had appeared as an expert witness on indian law before it, had prior to deposing before the court appeared on behalf of the respondent before the calcutta high court in a suit filed by the petitioner. neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined his opinion therefore, was in conflict of interest and not independent. an interested witness who had appeared for the defence could not have been examined. 5.8 mr.kavina therefore submitted that the order below exh.11 and exh.45 negating the contention raised by the petitioner is contrary to law and therefore the order dated 29.02.2020 of the principal senior civil judge, jamnagar, in such proceedings be quashed and set aside. 5.9 in support of his submissions, mr.kavina would rely on the following decisions: (i) in case of mannalal khaitan and others v. kedarnath khaitan and others reported in (1977) 2 scc 424 (ii) in case of algemene bank netherland nv v. satish dayalal choksi reported in 1989 scc neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined online bombay 282 (iii) in case of mrs shobha vishwanatha v. dp kingsley reported in (1996) 1 ctc 620 (iv) in case of noy vellesena engineering spa v. jindal drugs limited reported in 2006 scc online bombay 545 (v) full bench decision in case of a. pleader, madura in the context of the proprietary of mr.majumdar giving evidence as a witness when appearing as a counsel. (vi) in case of r.k.agarwal v. rana harishchandra ranjeetsingh and others reported in 1994 mh.l.j. 186 in context of the proprietary of an advocate appearing as a witness where he has been a counsel for a party. 6. mr. devang nanavati, learned senior advocate neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined appearing with mr. harsh parekh, learned advocate for the respondent would make the following submissions: 6.1 that the commercial court at jamnagar vide order dated 29.02.2020 rightly rejected the objections of the petitioner and held that the foreign decree is enforceable as a decree passed by the trial court under section 44a of the civil procedure code. 6.2 that the scope of examination of this court is limited to the issue whether the petitionerjudgement debtor makes out any case on any of the grounds mentioned in sub-sections (a) to (f) of section 13 of the cpc. he would submit that the decree has been obtained after following due judicial process and therefore the executing court cannot inquire into the validity, legality or otherwise of the judgement. neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined 6.3 it is not open for the petitioner to raise a contention regarding the alleged professional misconduct of the decree holder's expert witness. taking the court to the timeline, mr. nanavati would submit that in accordance with the provisions of the procedural laws, an ex-parte legal opinion was invited from the counsel of gujarat (nre) coke limited. on 03.03.2017, the english court had passed an interim order. thereafter, since the judgement debtor's expert witness wrote to the decree holder's witness that they had no instructions from the gujarat (nre) coke limited, the court in accordance with cpr 39.3 examined the expert witness and taking into consideration his opinion, passed the judgement and decree. he would invite the court's attention to the declaration of the expert witness of the decree holder disclosing the fact that he had appeared for the decree holder. after the disclosure, the petitioner never objected to the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined evidence and therefore the right was waived. the expert witness had prepared a report and as per rule 35.3(2) of the english cpr, it was the duty of the expert to help the court. therefore, there was no impropriety in a party being called for an evidence. 6.4 that english high court whilst passing the foreign decree correctly interpreted the provisions of fema and regulations thereunder. he would submit that by no stretch of imagination can a personal guarantee issued by an indian citizen on behalf of an indian company to a foreigner be equated with an illegal activity. fema unlike fera refers to the nation's policy of managing foreign exchange. in case of a particular act violating any provision of fema or the rules framed thereunder, permission of the reserve bank of india may be obtained post-facto and the violation can be condoned. neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined 6.5 mr. nanavati would submit that a defense of the kind which the petitioner has made would dissuade foreign commercial entities from relying on the guarantees given by the indian companies. no case has been made out by the judgement debtor that the foreign decree falls foul of the grounds under section 13 of the cpc. 6.6 mr. nanavati would submit that it is wrong for the petitioner to assume that the english court had held that the foreign decree cannot be enforced in india and be enforced in other countries. he would submit that the learned counsel for the petitioner had misinterpreted the observations when in fact, such observations merely meant that the decree holder had an option if it so wished to enforce the foreign decree in other countries. 6.7 mr. nanavati would submit that the english neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined court did not commit any error by failing to give credit for the sum of usd 2.3 million. the judgement debtor has wrongfully sought to couch its purported contention that the foreign decree wrongfully construed the personal guarantee as an on-demand bond. if, according to the petitioner, this was an erroneous application of law, there was a right to appeal and this was not a ground on which a foreign decree can be held to be inconclusive under section 13(b) of the cpc. reading section 13(b) of cpc, he would submit that it was not a judgement which was not given on merits because the court had applied its mind and considered the evidence available. he would invite the attention of the court to para 3 of the foreign decree wherein consideration of evidence has been considered. in support of his submissions, mr. nanavati would rely on the following decisions: (i) in case of vijay karia and others v. neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined prysmian cavi e sistemi srl and others reported in (2020) 11 scc 1 (ii) in case of srm exploration pvt. ltd. v. n & s & n consultants s.r.o. reported in 2012 (129) drj 113 (db) (iii) in case of videocon industries limited v. intesa sanpaolo s.p.a. reported in 2014 scc online bom 1276 sca no.18901 of 2022 7. the prayer in this petition is to quash and set aside an order dated 06.09.2022 passed below application exh. 147 in commercial execution petition no.161 of 2019 by the commercial court at jamnagar. the judgement debtor-petitioner had preferred an application exh.147 before the executing court submitting that during the pendency of the execution petition, on 08.09.2021, the state bank of india has filed an application under section 95(1) of neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined the insolvency and bankruptcy code, 2016 ('ibc' for short) before the nclt against the petitioner. the said proceedings have been registered as cp (ib) no.266 of 2021 on 14.09.2021. it was the case of the applicant-petitioner that in light of the provisions contained in section 95 and 96 of the ibc, an interim moratorium has commenced from 08.09.2021. it was further the case of the petitioner that since in light of section 238 of the ibc, the ibc had an overriding effect. keeping both these provisions in mind, the execution proceedings cannot be continued in view of the interim moratorium and therefore the applicant petitioner prayed before the executing court that a formal order staying further proceedings of the execution petition be passed, pending admission of cp (ib) no.266 of 2021. by the impugned order, dated 06.09.2022, the executing court rejected such application. hence, the petition. neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined 8. mr. percy kavina learned senior advocate appearing with mr.vivek gupta for the petitioner in context of this petition made the following submissions: 8.1 he would submit that if the case status of the national company law tribunal in the screenshot of the website is seen, which is annexed to the petition, the state bank of india had filed application initiating insolvency proceedings under section 95 of the ibc against the petitioner on 08.09.2021. as per section 96(1)(a) of the ibc, an interim moratorium commences from the date of the application in relation to all the debts of the petitioner and it shall cease to effect on the date of admission of such application. he would therefore submit that the execution proceedings, during the pendency of ibc proceedings shall be deemed to be stayed by virtue of the mandate of the ibc. 8.2 mr. kavina would submit that on 08.09.2021 on neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined the date when the sbi filed an application, a specific bar by deeming fiction relating to continuation of any legal action commences. further, section 238 of the ibc provides that the provisions of this code shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith. 8.3 mr. kavina would submit that since the petitioner was contesting two applications under sections 10 and 7 of the ibc relating to gujarat (nre) coke limited and bharat (nre) coke limited, the petitioner was under the bona-fide impression that the moratorium relating to personal insolvency proceedings will commence after admission of cp by the nclt, kolkata. the petitioner was unaware that unlike as in the case of corporate insolvency resolution process, wherein a moratorium under section 14 of the ibc is declared only after the admission of the petition in case of personal insolvency resolution process an interim neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined moratorium automatically kicks in on filing of a petition under section 95 of the ibc. 8.4 mr. kavina would submit that the learned trial judge had reserved orders on application exhs. 90, 92 and 94 on 18.09.2021. since the order below exh.94 was challenged by filing sca no.17965 of 2021 and the modified order was challenged by slp which was dismissed from 07.03.2022, it was only thereafter that the present application was filed. 8.5 as far as challenge to the vires of the provisions relating to personal insolvency contained in ibc before the calcutta high court where the court has been pleased to stay further proceedings in the nclt is concerned, he submitted that, that itself cannot be a factor against the petitioner as the petitioner has a fundamental right to assail the validity of the provisions. neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined 8.6 mr. kavina would assail the findings arrived at in the order dated 06.09.2022 by relying on the following decisions: (i) in case of axis trustee services limited v. brij bhushan singal and another reported in 2022 scc online del 3634 (ii) in case of stichting doen-postcode loterij v. vin poly recyclers pvt. ltd. & ors. reported in 2010 (115) drj 708 (db) 9. mr. devang nanavati learned senior advocate appearing with mr.harsh parekh for the respondent would make the following submissions: 9.1 he would submit that the high court cannot take a judicial cognizance of the personal insolvency proceedings against the judgement debtor when they have been stayed at the instance of the petitioner by the calcutta high court. the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined petitioner after having elected to and obtained an order from the calcutta high court staying the personal insolvency proceedings against him, now cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate by taking benefit of such proceedings. 9.2 a coordinate bench of this court vide order dated 15.12.2022 in mca no.1 of 2022 in special civil application no.17965 of 2021 has not granted the judgment debtor / petitioner to reargue the same contentions which he had raised in the mca. 9.3 mr. nanavati would further submit that the doctrine of constructive resjudicata would bar the judgement debtor from taking a plea of section 96 of ibc. by his conduct, between 20.09.2021 and 10.03.2022 in proceedings before the trial court, this court and the supreme court, the petitioner has waived his statutory right under section 96 of the ibc. mr. nanavati would in this respect refer to a neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined brief chronology of dates and events necessary for the examination of the issue at hand. 9.4 elaborating on these contentions, mr. nanavati would submit that section 96(1)(a) of the ibc only provides for an interim moratorium. ibc talks of reorganization and insolvency resolution in a time bound manner. if the contention of the decree holder is accepted the same would lead to an absurd scenario wherein, there would be a stay on his personal insolvency proceedings as well as stay of execution proceedings. 9.5 mr. nanavati submits that the petitioner has obtained a stay order on 15.06.2022 from the calcutta high court. in these circumstances, the judgement cited by the learned advocate in the case of stichting doen-postcode loterij (supra) will not apply. 9.6 the act of having elected to obtain an order neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined from the calcutta high court amounts to blowing hot and cold. on the one hand, the petitioner is taking shelter under section 96 of the ibc for not complying with the order of furnishing bank guarantee and on the other itself challenging the validity of the code. 9.7 referring to paras 6 to 11 of mca no.1 of 2022, mr. nanavati would submit that the petitioner relinquished his challenge and therefore the petition so filed would be barred by constructive resjudicata. 9.8 mr. nanavati would submit that if the conduct of the petitioner between 20.09.2021 and 10.03.2022 is seen, it is apparent that the petitioner waived his right. the interest of the petitioner is diametrically opposite to that of his creditors. mr. nanavati would submit that the judgement debtor petitioner is guilty of abuse of process of court and is guilty of interference in the administration of neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined justice. this court in exercise of powers under article 227 of the constitution of india must not entertain this petition. mr. nanavati would distinguish the judgement cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner and submit that the petition deserves to be dismissed. 9.9 in support of his submissions, mr.nanavati would rely on the following decisions: (i) in case of vijay karia and others v. prysmian cavi e sistemi srl and others reported in (2020) 11 scc 1 (ii) in case of rahul s. shah v. jinendra kumar gandhi and others reported in (2021) 6 scc 418 (iii) in case of cauvery coffee traders, mangalore v.

industries and another reported in (1980) 3 scc 311 neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined analysis in special civil application no.5509 of 2021 10. at the cost of reiteration, what is under challenge in this petition is an order below exh.11 and exh.45 by which the petitioner's applications objecting to the conclusiveness of the foreign judgement and request for declaring that the judgement and decree as not enforceable in india have been dismissed. the case of the petitioner is that the judgement and decree fails the test of section 13(a) to (f) of the code of civil procedure. for the purposes of this judgement, section 13 of the cpc is reproduced as under: \"section 13. when foreign judgment not conclusive. a foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title except(a) where it has not been pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction; neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined (b) where it has not been given on the merits of the case; (c) where it appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognise the law of [india] in cases in which such law is applicable; (d) where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained are opposed to natural justice; (e) where it has been obtained by fraud; (f) where it sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in [india]. 11. the trial court in rejecting the application held thus: (a) to the contention that the judgement and decree are not pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction, the trial court held that it was argued as per the relevant clause of personal guarantee, that the guarantee shall be governed exclusively by english law and the english courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all or any disputes neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined arising out of or in relation to this guarantee. considering the provisions of section 44a of the cpc dealing with enforcement of decree passed by courts in reciprocating countries, the contention of the petitioner is unjustified. section 44a of the code of civil procedure, reads as under: 44a. execution of decrees passed by courts in reciprocating territory.--(1) where a certified copy of a decree of any of the superior courts of any reciprocating territory has been filed in a district court, the decree may be executed in 3 [india] as if it had been passed by the district court. (2) together with the certified copy of the decree shall be filed a certificate from such superior court stating the extent, if any, to which the decree has been satisfied or adjusted and such certificate shall, for the purposes of proceedings under this section, be conclusive proof of the extent of such satisfaction or adjustment. (3) the provisions of section 47 shall as from the filing of the certified copy of the decree apply to the proceedings of a district court executing a decree under this section, and the district court shall refuse execution of any such decree, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the decree falls within any of the exceptions specified in clauses (a) to (f) of section 13. neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined [explanation 1.-\"reciprocating territory\" means any country or territory outside india which the central government may, by notification in the official gazette, declare to be a reciprocating territory for the purposes of this section; and superior courts, with reference to any such territory, means such courts as may be specified in the said notification. explanation 2.-\"decree\" with reference to a superior court means any decree or judgment of such court under which a sum of money is payable, not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty, but shall in no case include an arbitration award, even if such an award is enforceable as a decree or judgment.]] at the outset, on the scope of inquiry and examination of the court, the supreme court in the case of alcon electronics private limited (supra) held as under: \"14. a plain reading of section 13 cpc would show that to be conclusive an order or decree must have been obtained after following the due judicial process by giving reasonable notice and opportunity to all the proper and necessary parties to put forth their case. when once these requirements are fulfilled, the executing court cannot enquire into the validity, legality or otherwise of the judgment. 15. a glance on the enforcement on the foreign neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined judgment, the position in common law is very clear that a foreign judgment which has become final and conclusive between the parties is not impeachable either on facts or law except on the limited grounds enumerated under section 13 cpc. in construing section 13 cpc we have to look at the plain meaning of the words and expressions used therein and need not look at any other factors.\" (b) on the conclusion that the judgement failed to appropriate the amount already paid by the gujarat nre coke ltd and that the personal guarantee was defeated by the claimant's lawyer, the trial court based on the reasonings of the foreign judgement held that the personal guarantee of the petitioner was not coextensive with that of gujarat nre but an independent one which was therefore a primary responsibility of the judgment debtor. the foreign judgement on the question of this issue considered the personal guarantee and the relevant clauses thereof and held as under: \"15. it is necessary to set out the terms of the personal guarantee. they are as follows: \"to: ultrabulk a/s (hereinafter referred to as 'beneficiary') neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined whereas i, mr arun kumar jagatramka (hereinafter referred to as the 'guarantor') . am aware of the joint venture agreement between the beneficiary and gujarat nre coke limited ('gujarat') dated 6 june 2007 and 5 july 2007 ('the agreements') i am also aware of the liability due on date, i.e. usd4,259,395/to the beneficiary by gujarat under the agreement (the 'gujarat liabilities'). now, therefore, i, the guarantor, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee that, if for any reason gujarat do not repay the gujarat liabilities latest by 31 december 2013 then i will on the beneficiary's first written demand from the beneficiary, pay a sum equivalent to the gujarat liabilities plus the interest based on annual libor plus 2% to the beneficiary. . this guarantee shall be governed exclusively by english law and the english courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all and any disputes arising out of or in relation to this guarantee. i irrevocably confirm that i will not contest and/or defend any application and/or proceedings to enforce this personal guarantee in england and wales or elsewhere including (but not limited to) india and australia and the beneficiary shall be entitled to immediate judgment should payment not neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined be made hereunder upon the beneficiaries first written demand. no issue shall be taken as to jurisdiction and/or enforceability of this personal guarantee.\" 16. there is no dispute that gujarat did not pay the gujarat liabilities, namely, us$4,259,395 by 31 december 2013. the question which arises is whether, in that event, on the true construction of the guarantee mr. jagatramka is obliged to pay a sum equivalent to us$4,259,395 or that sum, less us$1.95 million. that depends upon whether the guarantee provides for a primary liability arising upon demand or whether the guarantee is a true guarantee which provides for a secondary liability in the sense that the guarantor's liability mirrors the liability of the principal debtor. whilst there is authority for the proposition that there is a presumption against construing an instrument as an on demand bond where it is not given by a bank or other financial institution (see autoridad del canal de panama v sacyr sa [2017] ewhc 2228 at paragraph 81(4) per blair j.) there is no doubt, in my judgment, that the instrument signed by mr. jagatramka provided for an on demand bond and that if such demand was validly made mr. jagatramka was bound to pay \"a sum equal to us$4,259,395\", not such sum as gujarat was in fact liable to pay at that time. the following parts of the guarantee lead to that conclusion: i) mr. jagatramka agreed to pay \"a sum equivalent to\" the \"gujarat liabilities\" which were defined as being us$4,259,395. mr. jagatramka did not agree to pay a sum of money to be determined by reference to gujarat's neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined actual liability at the material time. ii) he \"unconditionally and irrevocably\" guaranteed that if gujarat did not pay the gujarat liabilities by 31 december 2013 he would, on demand, pay a sum equivalent to the gujarat liabilities. such language is indicative of a primary liability. iii) he \"irrevocably confirms that he will not contest and/or defend any application and/or proceedings to enforce\" the guarantee. again, such language is consistent with a primary liability and inconsistent with his liability being coextensive with that of gujarat. 17. mr. stevenson had two alternative arguments in the event that the court did not accept that mr. jagatramka was liable, pursuant to the guarantee, to pay a sum equal to the gujarat liabilities, namely, us$4,259,395. the first alternative argument was if mr. jagatramka's liability was coextensive with gujarat's liabilities then those liabilities were those which arose under the cooperation agreements which currently exceed us$20 million. if that were wrong and mr. jagatramka's liability was coextensive with gujarat's liability under the deed of agreement then the further alternative argument is that, having regard to the manner in which sums paid by gujarat were appropriated, both by ultrabulk and gujarat, the liability of mr. jagatramka is in fact us$3,259,492.43. this further alternative argument is explained in a supplementary skeleton argument which i asked mr. stevenson to provide. it is to be noted that mr. stevenson and those instructing neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined him very properly reviewed the documentation and concluded that the sums paid by gujarat in fact totalled us$2,452,471 (rather more than mr. jagatramka said had been paid) and further that by an email dated 9 july 2013 from mr. saigal some us$499,975 had been appropriated to the sums due under the deed of agreement.\" the reasoning of the foreign judgement would indicate that the court held that the instrument signed by the petitioner provided for an on demand bond and if such demand was validly made, the petitioner was bound to pay \"a sum equal to usd 4,259,395\". the court, as is evident from para 16 of the judgement, interprets the relevant clauses of the guarantee in coming to such conclusion. what is evident on examining this contention is the ground so raised can only be taken to assail the foreign judgement on merits in an appeal to the court of appeal in the uk. an erroneous application of law cannot be a ground so as to say that it was a failure to render the judgements on the merits of the case. this court cannot sit in appeal over a foreign neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined decree passed by the english court as the same as rightly contended by the respondent's counsel amounted to going behind the decree. once the court has applied its mind and considered the evidence made available, it cannot be said that there was no adjudication on merits. reading the foreign judgement indicates that it has considered the following evidence: \"16.1 oral evidence from mr. olesen, the executive vice president of the decree holder; 16.2 oral evidence from mr. clulow, a partner at reed smith, the decree holder's solicitors; 16.3 witness statement of mr. o'neil, a former partner at reed smith; the decree holder's solicitors; 16.4 expert evidence of indian law was adduced from mr. majumdar, an indian lawyer, who gave evidence by video link from india; 16.5 witness statement of mr. saigal, a broker, who attended the negotiations leading to the personal guarantee/ on-demand bond with the judgment debtor; 16.6 the opinion rendered on indian law by ms. batra on behalf of the judgment debtor; 17. it is pertinent to note that the foreign neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined decree lists out the 7 defences which the judgment debtor seeks to take in relation to his liability under the personal guarantee/ on-demand bond and thereafter provides coherent reasons for rejecting such a defence.\" (c) on the contention that the personal guarantee was drafted by the claimant's lawyer and therefore bad, the relevant paragraph of the foreign judgement, reads as under: \"5. it may be the case that mr. jagatramka did not employ lawyers to draft the guarantee but the correspondence makes clear that he was given the opportunity to do so. mr. saigal, the broker acting on behalf of mr. jagatramka, has stated that at a meeting at ultrabulk's lawyers, reed smith, on 20 june 2013 it was provisionally agreed that mr. jagatramka would provide a guarantee. following that meeting reed smith invited him to provide a draft. on 23 june 2013 reed smith said that unless a draft was received the next day they would draft the guarantee. mr. saigal wrote saying that mr. jagatramka \"has been discussing internally and with his legal people\". but no draft was provided and so reed smith provided a draft on 24 june 2013. 6. there then followed a period of negotiation at the end of which the guarantee was signed. 6. there is nothing which would give rise to a defence in the circumstance that mr. jagatramka did not employ lawyers and signed the guarantee which had been drafted by ultrabulk's lawyers as they had taken into neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined account points made on behalf of mr. jagatramka in the course of the negotiations. there is nothing which could vitiate his consent to the guarantee.\" (d) it is necessary to see the exercise undertaken by the parties preceding this final draft from the list of dates given by the learned counsel for the respondent. (e) we may also consider these dates and events while considering the challenge with regard to the deposition and credibility of evidence of the expert witness. we may therefore deal with the submissions in context of this challenge. reading the judgement of the foreign court, it was contended that the examination of an expert witness, mr.amitava majumdar could not have been taken into consideration as the court completely ignored the fact that shri majumdar had appeared for the respondent before the calcutta high court. several decisions were cited by the learned neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined counsels for the respective parties. let us first see the chronology as unfolding in this context. 1 1st mar. an ex parte legal opinion issued by by 2017 ms. rimali batra of dsk legal to gujarat nre (\"ex parte legal opinion\") had been filed by the judgment debtor in the proceedings before the english high court, uk. rd 2 3 mar. english high court, uk passes a 2017 directional order holding as follows: \"4. each party shall have permission to adduce expert evidence as follows: expertise: indian law issues to be covered: those aspects of indian law which are relied upon by the defendant in support of his case that the personal guarantee is void and/or invalid and/or unenforceable. 5. signed reports of experts of like disciplines shall be exchanged simultaneously by 4 pm on 27 march 2017. 6. experts of like disciplines shall hold discussions for the purpose of identifying the issues between them and shall prepare a joint written statement by 4 pm on 10 april 2017 identifying the issues (if any) on which they disagree and a brief summary of the reasons for their disagreement.\" th 3 27 mar. expert witness report on indian law 2017 prepared by one mr. amitava majumdar, partner of bose & mitra & co (\"decree holders expert witness\") in the form of letter dated 27th march 2017 placed by the decree holder before the english high court, uk which inter alia stated in paragraph neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined 6: \"6. at the outset, i would like to disclose the fact that i have appeared on behalf of ultrabulk shipping a/s and ultrabulk a/s in the proceedings filed by mr. arun kumar jagatramka before the calcutta high court. i understand that i am proffering evidence in the capacity of an expert and not as a witness for a party. furthermore, my attention has been drawn to part 35 of the civil procedure rules of england and wales, the practice directions framed thereunder and the 'guidance for the instruction of experts in civil claims' which i have read and understand. i further understand that i have an overriding duty to held the english high court impartially and independently on matters relevant to my area of expertise. to the best of my knowledge, i have discharged this paramount duty towards the english high court.\" th 4 12 apr. decree holders expert witness writes 2017 to ms. rimali batra of dsk legal the individual who issued the ex parte legal opinion on the modalities of complying with the directional order dated 3rd march 2017 passed by the english high court, uk wherein the expert witness of both parties would have to prepare a joint report identifying the issues on which they disagree on and a summary of the reasons for their disagreement. th 5 27 apr. decree holders expert witness writes 2017 to ms. rimali batra of dsk legal the individual who issued the ex parte legal opinion on seeking a reply his neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined earlier email message dated 12th apr. 2017. th 6 28 apr. ms. rimali batra of dsk legal the 2017 individual who issued the ex parte legal opinion writes to the decree holders expert witness inter alia stating: \"we acknowledge receipt of your emails dated 12.04.2017 and 27.04.2017. please note that we have no instructions from gujarat nre on the subject issue. we have, in a timely manner, appraised gujarat nre about both your e-mails. we will write to you, as soon as we have any intimation from gujarat nre.\" th 7 9 oct. the decree holder's lawyers had 2017 written to the judgment debtor in relation to the pre-trial formalities and inter alia stated as follows: \"we repeat that it is important that you cooperate and reply to us urgently: (a) letting us know whether you will be calling witnesses of fact and/or expert witnesses to give oral evidence at the trial and, if so, confirm their identity; and (b) confirming whether you will have legal representation at the trial or whether you will attend the hearing as a litigant in person.\" th 8 30 oct hearing before the english high court, 2017 uk during which the examination in chief of the decree holder's expert witness on indian law, mr. amitava majumdar had taken place by video conference wherein the judgment of the bombay high court in the case of pol india projects limited v. aurelia reederi eugern friederich, arbitration neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined petition no. 76 of 2012 was discussed, the examination in chief of the decree holder's witness of fact mr. hans christian olesen had taken place, the examination in chief of the solicitor of the decree holder mr. jeb anthony clulow also took place. (f) the civil procedure rules, 1998 of supreme court of england and wales county courts, particularly rule 35 (rule 35.1 to 35.7 and 35.10 to 35.11 and 35.13) read as under: \"duty to restrict expert evidence 35.1 expert evidence shall be restricted to that which is reasonably required to resolve the proceedings. interpretation 35.2 a reference to an \"expert\" in this part is a reference to an expert who has been instructed to give or prepare evidence for the purpose of court proceedings. experts--overriding duty to the court 35.3-(1) it is the duty of an expert to help the court on the matters within his expertise.

(h) on the contention that the english court while passing the foreign decree failed to interpret the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined provisions of the foreign exchange management act (fema) and the regulations and hence the findings were on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view, the foreign court on interpretation of the regulations held as under: \"issue ii (d) would the guarantee be invalid if both sides were aware that the guarantor did not have approvals? 31. as stated earlier the requisite approvals can be obtained from by the guarantor from the rbi even after the guarantee has been issued per life insurance corporation of india vs. escorts ltd. (1986) 1 scc 264 as followed in vitol s.a. v. bhatia international limited (2015) 1 bom cr 100 and texmaco ltd.v. deputy director, enforcement directorate, 1997 company cases vol. 88 pg. 228. it follows that a guarantee will not be invalid even if both sides are aware that the guarantor does not have the requisite approvals when it is executed. issue iii what would be the ramifications of a personal guarantee being issued by an indian entity / citizen in favor of a foreign company for and on behalf of and indian company if the same has been executed in australia as opposed to india ? 32. i do not believe that the location of execution of the personal guarantee is relevant as long as the guarantor is a person resident in india. i am, however, of the opinion that the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined fema regime would not be triggered in an event there is no outflow of foreign exchange out of india or foreign exchange is not being repatriated out of india. in light of the same, in an event the indian citizen has a bank account in australia and makes payment to the foreign entity from the bank account in australia the fema regime would not be triggered in the first place. that said, section 8 of the fema act provides as follows: 8. realisation and repatriation of foreign exchange.--save as otherwise provided in this act, where any amount of foreign exchange is due or has accrued to any person resident in india, such person shall take all reasonable steps to realise and repatriate to india such foreign exchange within such period and in such manner as may be specified by the reserve bank. -save as otherwise provided in this act, where any amount of foreign exchange is due or has accrued to any person resident in india, such person shall take all reasonable steps to realise and repatriate to india such foreign exchange within such period and in such manner as may be specified by the reserve bank.\" 33. in exercise of its powers under the section 8 of the fema act, the rbi issued notification no.fema 9/2000-rb dated 3 may 2000 which provided as follows: 3. duty of persons to realise foreign exchange due : a person resident in india to whom any amount of foreign exchange is due or has accrued shall, save as otherwise provided neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined under the provisions of the act, or the rules and regulations made thereunder, or with the general or special permission of the reserve bank, take all reasonable steps to realise and repatriate to india such foreign exchange, and shall in no case do or refrain from doing anything, or take or refrain from taking any action, which has the effect of securing (a) that the receipt by him of the whole or part of that foreign exchange is delayed; or (b) that the foreign exchange ceases in whole or in part to be receivable by him. 34. i am of the opinion that the aforesaid provisions may perhaps have extremely limited application in situations of a transaction entered into by an indian party with a foreign party outside india which although does not have the effect of repatriating foreign exchange out of india creates an impediment to foreign exchange being repatriated into india. that said, the bombay high court in the case of vitol s.a. v. bhatia international limited, (2015) 1 bom cr 100 in its interpretation of section 8 of fema act and notification no.fema 9/2000-rb dated 3 may 2000 expressed the opinion that these provisions would only be triggered when indian citizens/company stash funds out of india or secrete or divert foreign exchange payable to the indian citizen/ company.\" (i) reading the aforesaid extract indicates that in neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined the context of the opinion of the expert, it is evident that the fema regime was brought in to amend the foreign exchange regulation act, 1973 (fera). section 6 of the fema act reads as under: \"6(3) \"without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of sub-section (2), the reserve bank may, by regulations, prohibit, restrict or regulate the following (j) giving of a guarantee or surely in respect of any debt, obligation or other liability incurred (i) by a person resident in india and owned to a person resident outside india; or (j) regulation 3 of the guidelines and foreign exchange management (guarantees) regulation, 2000 reads as under: \"3. prohibition save as otherwise provided in these regulations or with the general or special permission of the reserve bank, no person resident in india shall give a guarantee or surely in respect of, or undertake a transaction, by whatever name called, which has the effect of guaranteeing, a debt, obligation or other liability owed by a neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined person resident in india to, or incurred by, a person resident outside india.\" (k) interpreting this provision, the court held that the permission need not be obtained in advance of the guarantee being given. providing of a personal guarantee without first obtaining permission is not itself a breach of fema. post-facto permission can be obtained. even otherwise as observed, and in our opinion rightly so, relying on a decision of the bombay high court in the case of noy vellesena engineering spa v. jindal drugs limited (supra), the court held that a party cannot take advantage of his own wrong. paras 22, 23 and 24 of the foreign judgement read as under: \"22. it is also important to note that fema does not invalidate a guarantee that has been provided without permission. the indian courts have come down heavily upon parties seeking to raise self-serving and dishonest pleas by taking advantage of their own wrongs in failing to obtain requisite rbi approvals as contemplated under the fema regime to wriggle out of liabilities arising out of contracts with foreign parties. the bombay high court in the case of noy neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined vallesina engineering spa a v. jindal drugs limited, notice of motion no. 826 of 2006 in arbitration petition no. 156 of 2005, 2006 (3) arb lr 510 (bom) (\"noy vallesina\") held that a party cannot take advantage of his own wrong by not applying for fema permission and thereafter allege that the foreign award is against the public policy of india as the necessary fema permission has not been obtained. in its judgment in that case the bombay high court made the below observation: \"13.it is clear from the above quoted paragraphs of the judgment of the supreme court that an award cannot be set aside because at the time of entering into the contract, permission of the reserve bank of india was not obtained. if such a permission is necessary, it can be obtained by the party concerned before he receives actual payment. the contention, therefore, has no force and is, therefore, rejected. i have not been pointed out any law which prevents the arbitral tribunal from making an award for payment of money to a foreigner pursuant to a contract, which has not been approved by the r.b.i. in the absence of any such provision, no fault can be found with the award on this count.\" 23. this point was also made by the high court at goa in the case of sjj marine pte ltd v. pisces exim (india) private limited, company petition no. 10 of 2013 and by the division bench (appeal court) of the bombay neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined high court in the case of videocon industries v. intesa sanpaolo spa (appeal (l) of 2012); 2014 scc online bom 1276 in which it rejected the contention that a guarantee given by an indian party was unenforceable and expressed the opinion that such an alibi if given judicial recognition would \"dissuade foreign commercial entities from relying upon guarantees given by indian companies which would ultimately undermine the role of india in the world of trade and commerce.\" 24. i have been personally involved in the case of pol india projects limited v. aurelia reederei eugen friederich gmbh schiffahrtsgesellschaft & company kg (2015) 7 bom cr 757 (\"pol india\") where the bombay high court held that a performance guarantee issued by an indian shipbroker to guarantee the obligations of a dubai based charter under a voyage charterparty was enforceable as a matter of indian law despite the fact that the indian shipbroker did not obtain permission from the rbi at any point of time. in that case, the bombay high court once again quoted with approval the propositions of law laid down by the aforesaid judgments. the bombay high court in pol india made the below observation: \"159. delhi high court in case of srm exploration pvt.ltd. has dealt with the provisions of fema, 1999 including section 3 and has held that there was no provision voiding the transaction in contravention thereof. delhi high neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined court has also referred to section 47 of fera 1973 which prohibited from entering into contract agreement directing or indirectly for operation of the said act or any provisions thereof. it is held by delhi high court that the legislature while reenacting the law on the subject has chosen to do away with such a provision which shows a legislative intent to not void the transaction even if in violation of the said act. i am in respectful agreement with the view expressed by delhi high court in case of srm exploration pvt.ltd. (supra). delhi high court in the said judgment has held that the world is a shrinking place today and commercial transactions spanning across borders abound. the court was of the opinion that if the court is dissuaded for the reason of the transaction for which the parties had stood surety/guarantee being between foreign companies, the court would be sending a wrong signal and dissuading foreign commercial entities from relying on the assurances/guarantees given by indian companies and which would ultimately restrict the role of india in such international commercial transactions. i am in respectful agreement with the views expressed by the delhi high court. in my view the petitioner not having raised any objection about the validity and neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined enforcement of such guarantee at any point of time before filing objection before the learned arbitrator and had acted upon such guarantee, if such objection is allowed to be raised at such belated stage, it will be contrary to the principles laid down by the supreme court and by delhi high court. i am thus not inclined to accept this submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner.\" (l) the division bench of the delhi high court in the case of srm exploration (supra) in para 12 observed as under: \"12. we have perused the provisions of fema, 1999 section 3 thereof prohibits dealing in or transferring of any foreign exchange save as otherwise provided therein or under the rules & regulations framed thereunder without general or special permission of rbi. we are unable to find any provision therein voiding the transactions in contravention thereof. we may mention that the predecessor legislation to fema namely fera 1973 vide section 47 prohibited entering into any contract or agreement directly or indirectly evading or avoiding any operation of the said act or any provision thereof. however sub section (3) thereof also provided that such prohibition shall not prevent legal proceedings being brought in india for recovery of a sum which apart from the provision of fera would be due. however the legislature while reenacting the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined law on the subject has chosen to do away with such a provision. we are of the view that the same shows a legislative intent to not void the transaction even if in violation of the said act. thus we are of the opinion that the plea of the appellant company in this regard is without any force.\" (m) even the bombay high court in the case of videocon industries limited (supra) has held that accepting such a dishonest plea of indian parties to avoid liabilities on the pretext of violation of fema would send a wrong signal to foreign investors. \"41. in any view of the matter, it is also necessary to know that videocon had never contended in any of its correspondence between 2007 till giving reply to the statutory notice that the patronage letter was issued in contravention of the provisions of fema or in breach of any other legal requirements. the defence is, therefore, raised for the first time only after receiving statutory notice i.e. after almost four years of issuance of the patronage letter. assuming that videocon have committed any wrong in issuing the patronage letter without obtaining permission of the reserve bank, as per the settled legal position, it is not open to a party to take advantage of its own wrong. in eurometal ltd. v. aluminium cables and conductors (u.p) pvt. ltd.), [(1983) 53 comp cas 744 cal and srm exploration pvt. ltd. v. n & s & n consultants s.r.o, [(2012) 4 comp lj 178 (del)], calcutta and neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined delhi high courts respectively have frowned upon company facing a winding up petition taking up such dishonest defence. in these decisions high courts have taken the view that in matters of commercial transactions involving crores of amount where the company facing winding up proceedings had stood a guarantor, if any such defence were to be accepted, we would be giving a wrong signal and dissuading foreign commercial entities from relying on the guarantees given by indian companies and which would ultimately undermine the role of india the world of trade and commerce. we could not agree less.\" (n) even the hon'ble supreme court in the case of vijay karia and others (supra) held that transactions in fera would render a transaction void in absence of following the provisions but such violation under the fema would not render the transaction void. \"87. before answering this question, it is important to first advert to the decision of the delhi high court in cruz (supra). the learned single judge was faced with a similar problem of a foreign award violating the provisions of fema. in an exhaustive analysis, the learned single judge referred to renusagar (supra) and then held: neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined 102. although, this contention appears attractive, however, fails to take into account that there has been a material change in the fundamental policy of exchange control as enacted under fera and as now contemplated under fema. fera was enacted at the time when the india's economy was a closed economy and the accent was to conserve foreign exchange by effectively prohibiting transactions in foreign exchange unless permitted. as pointed out by the supreme court in life insurance corporation of india v. escorts ltd. (supra), the object of fera was to ensure that the nation does not lose foreign exchange essential for economic survival of the nation. with the liberalization and opening of india's economy it was felt that fera must be repealed. fera was enacted to replace the foreign exchange regulation act, 1947 which was originally enacted as a temporary measure. the statement of objects and reasons of fera indicate that fera was enacted as the rbi had suggested and government had agreed on the need for regulating, among other matters, the entry of foreign capital in the form of branches and concerns with substantial nonresident interest in them, the employment of foreigners in india etc. 110. the contention that enforcement of the award against unitech must be refused on the ground that it violates any one or the other provision of fema, cannot be accepted; but, any remittance of the money neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined recovered from unitech in enforcement of the award would necessarily require compliance of regulatory provisions and/or permissions.\" 88. this reasoning commends itself to us. first and foremost, fema unlike fera refers to the nation's policy of managing foreign exchange instead of policing foreign exchange, the policeman being the reserve bank of india under fera. it is important to remember that section 47 of fera no longer exists in fema, so that transactions that violate fema cannot be held to be void. also, if a particular act violates any provision of fema or the rules framed thereunder, permission of the reserve bank of india may be obtained post-facto if such violation can be condoned. neither the award, nor the agreement being enforced by the award, can, therefore, be held to be of no effect in law. this being the case, a rectifiable breach under fema can never be held to be a violation of the fundamental policy of indian law. 89. the appellants, however, relied upon certain observations in dropti devi v. union of india (2012) 7 scc 499. in that case, a challenge was made to the constitutional validity of section 3 of conservation of foreign exchange and prevention of smuggling activities act, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as \"cofeposa\"), stating that by reason of the new legal regime articulated in fema, in replacement of fera, the said provision has become unconstitutional in the changed situation. this submission was repelled by this court stating: neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined 67. the importance of foreign exchange in the development of a country needs no emphasis. fema regulates the foreign exchange. the conservation and augmentation of foreign exchange continue to be its important theme. although contravention of its provisions is not regarded as a criminal offence, yet it is an illegal activity jeopardising the very economic fabric of the country. for violation of foreign exchange regulations, penalty can be levied and its noncompliance results in civil imprisonment of the defaulter. the whole intent and idea behind cofeposa is to prevent violation of foreign exchange regulations or smuggling activities which have serious and deleterious effect on national economy.\" it is important to note that this court recognized that fema, unlike fera, does not have any provision for prosecution and punishment like that contained in section 56 of fera. the observations as to conservation and/or augmentation of foreign exchange, so far as fema is concerned, were made in the context of preventive detention of persons who violate foreign exchange regulations. the court was careful to note that any illegal activity which jeopardises the economic fabric of the country, which includes smuggling activities relating to foreign exchange, are a serious menace to the nation and can be dealt with effectively, inter alia, through the mechanism of preventive detention. from this to contend that any violation of any fema rule would make such violation an illegal activity does not follow. in fact, even if the reasoning contained in this judgment is torn out of its specific context and applied to this case, there being no alleged smuggling activity which involves depletion of neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined foreign exchange, as against foreign exchange coming into the country as a result of sale of shares in an indian company to a foreign company, it does not follow that such violation, even if proved, would breach the fundamental policy of indian law. 12. having considered these provisions, what is evident is that transactions that violate fema cannot be held to be void. if any act violates the provisions of fema, permission of rbi may be obtained postfacto. therefore, it cannot be said that the foreign judgement is in breach of indian law or fails to recognise such breach and therefore is inconclusive. the reasonings of the learned executing court cannot be faulted. 13. as far as the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the foreign judgement has purportedly held that foreign decree cannot be enforced in india and ought to be enforced in other countries is concerned, it is clear that such an observation was only to suggest that the decree neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined holder had an option to enforce a foreign decree against the assets of judgement debtor in other countries. the judgements cited in the case of mrs shobha vishwanatha (supra), algemene bank netherland nv (supra) were in the context of fera regime and therefore reliance by the counsel for the petitioner on these are misplaced. 14. the judgement in the case of manna lal (supra) affirms the fact that a post facto permission can be obtained. 15. as far as the decision on interested witness in the case of r.k. agrawal (supra) is concerned, the advocate wanted to lead evidence as a witness of a fact in the same proceedings before the same court where he appeared as an advocate. 16. moreover in special civil application no. 8334 of 2019 filed by the petitioner wherein a challenge was neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined made to an order to exh.19 application, the division bench of this court observed that having participated in the proceedings before the english commercial court, having given a guarantee and the judgement of the english court having become final, only with a view to throw a spanner and delay the proceedings, execution petition is filed which is nothing but an abuse of the process of the court. para 14 of the order reads as under: \"14. the learned commercial court at rajkot, while dealing with application at exhibit 19, has threadbare considered the same and has correctly interpreted the provisions of the act as well as the provisions of section 126 of the indian contract act in particular. it would not be out of place to record that having participated in the proceedings before the english commercial court, having given a guarantee and the judgment of english court having become final, only with a view to throw spanner in the execution of such decree, the present petition is filed only with a view to create hurdle and delay the execution proceedings, which is nothing but an abuse of the process of the court. we confirm the findings of the court below and the commercial court having jurisdiction, has jurisdiction to entertain the execution petition filed by the respondent. the petition is devoid of any merits and the same is liable to be dismissed and is neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined hereby rejected in limine with cost of rs. 25,000/to be deposited by the petitioner within a period of one week with gujarat high court legal services committee.\" 17. for the aforesaid reasons, therefore, there is no merit in the petition i.e. special civil application no. 5509 of 2021 and the same is accordingly dismissed. interim relief stands vacated. civil application also stands disposed of. analysis of special civil application no. 18901 of 2022 18. to recapitulate, apart from the challenge to the foreign judgement as being not conclusive and enforceable for the reasons stated in the applications exs. 11 and 45 which order was a subject matter of challenge in special civil application no. 5509 of 2021, the judgement-debtor on 09.03.2022 two years after the orders in exs. 11 neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined & 45 applications filed application ex. 147 seeking a formal order staying further proceedings in the execution petition in view of deemed stay of further proceedings as per the provisions of the insolvency and bankruptcy code, 2016. 19. succinctly stated, it was the case of the petitioner that since personal insolvency proceedings were instituted by the state bank of india on 08.09.2021 by filing application under section 95(1) of the ibc, in light of section 96 thereof, an interim moratorium had commenced from 08.09.2021 i.e. the date of filing of cp(ib) no. 266 of 2021 before nclt. taking recourse to section 238 of ibc, no further proceedings in execution proceeding be conducted in view of statutory stay. the respondent decree holder raised several contentions that in view of the conduct of the petitioner himself in filing an application ia (ib) no. 872 before nclt seeking dismissal of the main ibc proceedings and having neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined challenged the vires of these very provisions, namely, sections 95 & 96 of ibc, the contradictory conduct disentitles the petitioner of such relief. 20. referring to various rounds of challenge before this court in various petitions, it was the submission of the decree holder from the dates of litigation's chequered history from 08.09.2021 to 10.03.2022 that based on the principle of constructive resjudicata, on principle of waiver, on the conduct of blowing hot and cold and being allowed to approbate and reprobate and interpreting the relevant provisions of ibc, the trial court held that proceedings under ibc cannot be applied in perpetuity and therefore rejected the application. the relevant paras of the trial court's order dated 09.03.2022 read as under: \"28.1 attention is drawn to relevant dates in the proceedings and it is submitted that of its 08th september, 2021 the state bank of india instituted before personal bankruptcy proceedings against the judgment debtor before the nclt, kolkata bench under chapter neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav

(ibc) 872(kb) 2021 before the nclt, kolkatta seeking dismissal of the personal insolvency proceedings filed against him. 26. on 04.10.2021, in an application preferred by the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined respondent decree holder for security under order xxi, rule 40(b) of the code of civil procedure, the trial court allowed the application and held that pending the conclusion of the inquiry of whether the judgement debtor has or has had since the date of the decree the means to pay the amount of the decree or some substantial part thereof and refuses or neglects to pay the amount of the decree, the judgement debtor is directed to furnish security in the sum of rs.12,89,19,458/by way of cash deposit with the registry of the trial court within six weeks from the date of the order. prior thereto, the trial court, on 04.08.2021, on an application exh.65 of the judgement debtor with a prayer to hold that the executing court has no jurisdiction to entertain the application was rejected. against the order dated 04.08.2021, special civil application no. 17399 of 2021 was filed by the petitioner. this court, by an order dated 04.02.2022, dismissed the petition holding as under: neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined \"6.4 coming to the facts of the present case, it is the decree of english court, the reciprocating territory, is being executed under section 44a, cpc. this provision in the cpc, 1908, provides for execution of decrees passed by the courts in reciprocating territory. it provides that certified copy of a decree of any superior courts of any reciprocating territory is filed in the district court, the decree may be executed as if it has been passed by the district court. sub section (2) of section 44a provides for filing of certified copy regarding satisfaction of decree to the extent of such satisfaction or adjustments. sub section (3) says that as per the provisions of section 47 shall as from filing of the certified copy of the decree apply to the proceedings of a district court for executing a decree under this section. the execution can be refused if it is shown that the decree falls within any of the exception in section 13. 6.4.1 at this stage, it may be stated that section 13, cpc provides that foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties, therefore section 44a has a direct interaction with section 13, cpc. the provisions of section 13 and its clauses are incorporated to become applicable while exercising powers for execution under section 44a. section 13 as stated above relates to the conclusiveness of foreign judgment which can be executed under section 44a but for the exceptions contained in clauses (a) to (f) of section 13, cpc. 6.4.2 the decree of the foreign court is treated by way of deeming fiction as if it had been passed by the 'district court'. the parties will be producing the certified copy of the decree neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined from the court which has passed the decree for the purpose of execution and will comply with other requirements mentioned in the provisions. as per the sub section 3 of section 44athe provision of section 47 shall as from the filing of certified copy of the decree apply to the proceedings of district court executing a decree under this section. the word 'decree' is explained in explanation 2 and in explanation 1 'reciprocating territory' is referred to. 6.4.3 section 38 of the cpc deals with the aspect the court by which the decree may be executed. it provides that the decree may be executed either by the court which passed it or by the court to which it is sent for execution. the section provides for jurisdiction of execution to be the same court which passed the decree. 6.5 in the present case, it is the money decree passed by england commercial court upon adjudication of commercial dispute and now sought to be executed under section 44a which is deemed in law to be the decree as if it has been passed by district court. upon conjoint reading of section 44a and section 38 cpc, it could be certainly deduced that the decree passed by the english commercial court can be executed by the commercial court when presented under section 44a of the cpc. it becomes a decree as if it has been passed by district court. it would be only proper to read the word 'the commercial court' which had passed the decree in section 44a cpc in place of the word 'district court',when it is a decree passed by foreign court the reciprocating territory, and sought to be executed. 6.6 when the execution is filed from the decree neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined of commercial court, the 'commercial dispute' continues to exists. in the execution proceedings initiated to execute the decree of the commercial court, the characteristics of the 'commercial dispute' is not lost, rather the dispute continues in the same nature, that is the 'commercial dispute'. 6.7 the jurisdiction of the commercial court under section 6 of the commercial courts act extend to try all suits and applications relating to commercial dispute of specified value. the word 'specified value' has been defined under section 2(i) of the commercial courts act. the word 'applications' under section 6 would include execution applications and also proceedings relating to commercial dispute of specified value. the jurisdiction of the commercial court therefore necessarily extends to the execution application arising from the judgment and decree of the commercial court. 6.8 there remains hardly any substance in the submission that since the provisions relating to execution were not amended while amending certain provisions of cpc as per the section 16 of the commercial courts act, the commercial court does not have the jurisdiction to try and decide the execution petitions. merely because there is no amendment in relation to the execution provisions brought about and certain other provisions of cpc were amended to be applied to the commercial suits, it would not mean or imply that the commercial court does not have the power to execute. 6.9 in morlays (b'ham) limited. vs. roshanlal ramsahai and another [air 1961 bom 156], the bombay high court considered the words 'as if' used in sub-section (1) of section 44a, cpc to neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined observe that the words 'as if' are used to make the whole scheme of order xxi applicable in respect of the execution of decrees of foreign court mentioned in sub section 1. in other words, it can be said that when foreign decree is sought to be executed under section 44a, cpc, the provisions relating to execution in cpc shall have a play together to be applied. merely because while amending certain provisions of cpc as per the section 16 of the commercial courts act, the provisions regarding execution are not touched, it would not mean or imply that the commercial court does not have the power to execute. 7. for the foregoing reasons and discussion, a clear position of law emerges that commercial court does have the jurisdiction to try and decide the execution applications arising from the judgment and decree passed by the commercial court.\" 27. this order, therefore, even stares in the face of the petitioner in context of proceedings which are a subject matter of special civil application no. 17399 of 2021. no move at this stage was also made by the petitioner till 20.10.2021 i.e. one month after filing of cp(ib) no. 266/2023 to seek a stay of the proceedings invoking grounds under section 96 of the ibc. neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined 28. even when the order dated 04.10.2021 at exh.94 was passed whereby the debtor was directed to deposit a sum of rs.12,89,19,458/and on 29.10.2021 that order was challenged by filing special civil application no. 17965 of 2021, the judgement debtor raised no contention that he was not required to deposit the said amount in the court on the ground of section 96 of the ibc. on the very date, i.e. on 04.02.2022, when the judgement debtor's petition to challenge exh. 65 order was dismissed, this court also dismissed the petition modifying the order of the trial court by allowing the judgement debtor to furnish a bank guarantee in substitution of cash deposit. on the conduct of the petitioner, the court, in paras 5.6 to 7 observed as under: \"5.6 the court below observed about the conduct of the judgment-debtor, \"the extent to which the judgment-debtor has gone is also indicated by the fact that inspite of the knowledge of the orders of the court the judgment-debtor has not obeyed them. this makes it clear that the party who was absolutely no regard for the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined orders of the court must be made to bear the consequences of his own action. the judgment-debtor has chosen to wilfully and blatantly flout the orders passed against him in the present execution proceedings from the vey inception thereof.\" 5.7 the present decree is money decree. the court below has noticed the conduct of the judgment-debtor reflecting his unwillingness to satisfy the decree. on the basis of the factual material before it, the conclusion is drawn by the court below that though the judgment-debtor has means to satisfy the decree but has neglected in discharging his obligation. upon assessing the facts and conduct of the judgment-debtor the executing court has duly found that they are indicative of unwillingness and avoidance on part of the judgment-debtor to pay the decreetal amount despite availability of means with him to pay. the court has considered therefore that order for furnishing security deserved to be passed. the view taken by the court below is reasonable on facts and in law. 5.8 in view of all the above facts and background and when there are circumstances suggesting that despite possessing the means, the judgmentdebtor has neglected and refused to pay the decreetal amount, furnishing of security by judgment-debtor is warranted. the security is considered proper to be solicited by the judgment-debtor to ensure that the rights of the decreeholder are not defeated. neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined 5.9 it is in on such premise of facts and reasons, the impugned order, as above, in exercise of powers order xxi rule 40(b) of the code of the civil procedure, 1908, requires the judgmentdebtor to furnish security and sum of rs.12,89,19,458/which is the equivalent amount to the worth of the book value of shares in the four australian companies held by the judgment-debtor. the impugned order is proper and reasonable in law as such in directing the judgment-debtor in furnish security. 6. in view of the above discussion, while no ground exists to interfere with the said order requiring the judgment-debtor to furnish the security to the aforesaid extent, what becomes conspicuous in the impugned order that the said security is directed to be furnished by way of cash deposit with the registry of this court. the direction to furnish the security by way of cash deposit is in a way arbitrary in as much as requiring deposit of cash to the above extent would not be cumbersome but also unreasonable. the security to the aforesaid sum could be solicited by directing the judgment-debtor to furnish the bank guarantee of the equivalent amount. the impugned order is required to be interfered with to be modified to the said and such limited extent. 6.1 as a result, while maintaining the impugned order as well as the reasons supplied by the court in so far it requires the judgment-debtor to furnish security, the direction in the order is modified to neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined the limited extent that the judgmentdebtorpetitioner herein may furnish the security for the sum of rs.12,89,19,458/by way of bank guarantee equal to the said amount. 7. the present special civil application is dismissed subject to modification in the order to the above extent.\" 29. even in para 5.2 of the order in special civil application no. 17399 of 2021, the court observed that it is deprecable that despite the above findings of the division bench, the very ground is raised and re-raised in yet another proceedings. \"5.2 it could be well said therefore that the ground that the dispute is not 'commercial dispute' and consequentially the commercial court lacks inherent jurisdiction to execute the decree, falls flat. it is deprecable that despite the above findings of the division bench, the very ground is raised and re-raised in yet another present proceedings. be as it may. repeating the litigation on the same grounds under different pretext and different context tantamount to abuse of process of law.\" 30. reading the chronology of events, it further indicates that while making an application at exh.136, wherein the petitioner made allegations neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined against the presiding officer, which was also moved post 14.09.2021, on 31.10.2021, the petitioner did not seek a stay of the proceedings on the ground under section 96 of the ibc. then came the applications exh.111 and exh.45. one glaring aspect that stands out like an eye-sore is the conduct of the petitioner in filing wpa no. 20315 of 2021 before the calcutta high court, wherein, he challenged the constitutionality of section 96 of the ibc. that application was also dismissed on 27.12.2021. 31. when the petitioner challenged the order dated 04.02.2022 in special civil application no. 17965 of 2021 which directed the judgement debtor to furnish a bank guarantee of rs.12,89,19,458/-, the supreme court dismissed the slp making observations as under: \"we have heard shri shyam divan, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner and shri neeraj kishan kaul, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent. in the facts and circumstances of the case and having gone through the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined impugned judgment and order passed by the high court and more particularly when against the dues of rs.40,00,00,000/(rupees forty crores), the petitioner is directed to furnish the bank guarantee of approximately rs. 12,00,00,000/(rupees twelve crores) in exercise of power under order 21 rule 40 (2) of the cpc, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order passed by the high court. the special leave petition stands dismissed. pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.\" 32. immediately three days thereafter, on 09.03.2022, the application exh.147 was filed wherein the order under challenge was passed. more than one and a half year after 20.09.2021 did the petitioner move such an application. noteworthy too is that the petitioner on 15.06.2022 obtained a stay from calcutta high court staying personal insolvency proceedings. the conduct speaks volumes in the case i.e. how clearly after every attempt to stall the execution proceedings failed, did the petitioner, as an after thought, try to forestall the execution proceedings. the observations of the trial court, in an application filed at exh.136 for recusal of the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined learned presiding officer, are worth mentioning. \"26. . as discussed earlier, the history ofthe case as narrated hereinabove goes to suggest that the judgment debtor has been written submissions of the decree holder in insincere even in the proceedings before the english court. it appears that such tendencies and practices attempted by litigants to threaten and intermediate the court in order to dissuade the presiding officers of the courts from hearing the matters as in the present one are because of the illusion that they are going to miss some mundane pleasure and keep on hankering after it. the oath of the office which mandates to perform duties to the best of the ability without fear or favour, affection or illwill requires the presiding officer to go ahead with the hearing and not be overawed by such submissions. 27. in the light of the above conduct of the allegations in the present application are unfounded and appear to have been made with a malicious intention of threatening the presiding officer of this court and amounts to an obstruction in the administration of justice and the application is filed only with a view to create hurdle and delay the execution proceedings or in any other way frustrate or obstruct the course of justice and which is nothing but an abuse of the process of the court.\" 33. even in special civil application no. 8334 of 2019, where exh.19 application of the judgement debtor was dismissed, this court, in its order dated neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined 26.08.2019, in paras 13 and 14 observed as under: \"13. .on the contrary, the record indicates that having filed objections under section 13 of the cpc before the commercial court at rajkot, only with an aim and object to delay the execution proceedings, the petitioner filed the present application exhibit 19 and on its dismissal, the present writ petition under article 227 of the constitution of india. 14. it would not be out of place to record that having participated in the proceedings before the commercial court in london, uk, having given a guarantee and the judgment of english court having become final, only with a view to throw spanner in the execution of such decree, the present petition is filed only with a view to create hurdle and delay the execution proceedings, which is nothing but an abuse of the process of the court. we confirm the findings of the court below and the commercial court having jurisdiction, has jurisdiction to entertain the execution petition filed by the respondent. the petition is devoid of any merits and the same is liable to be dismissed and is hereby rejected in limine with cost of rs. 25,000/to be deposited by the petitioner within a period of one week with this hon'ble court legal services committee.\" 34. what is further important to note is that the petitioner on 27.09.2022 filed an mca being mca no. 1 of 2022 in sca no. 17965 of 2021 seeking neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined modification / review of the order dated 04.02.2022 which was confirmed by the supreme court on 07.03.2022. apart from waiver, therefore this is a case where the petitioner is clearly approbating and reprobating inasmuch as, once obtaining a stay of insolvency proceedings and then seeking to re-argue the grounds raised in mca no. 1 of 2022 which he withdrew. the grounds seeking modification of this court's order dated 04.02.2022 in special civil application no. 17965 of 2021 read as under:\"6. in view of the aforesaid provisions contained in section 95 and 96 of the ibc, an interim moratorium has commenced from 08-09-2021, i.e., the date of filing of cp (ib) 266/2021 before the nclt, kolkata by sbi and was operating on 04-10-2021 and 04-022022 when orders below exh. 94 and in sca no. 17965 of 2021 were passed by the trial court and this hon'ble court, respectively; since the aforesaid proceedings was pending for admission on that day and, accordingly, there was a specific bar by deeming fiction relating to continuation of any legal action or proceeding pending in respect of any debt of the application and initiation and/or continuation of any proceedings in respect of any debt was deemed to have been stayed.\" 7 in addition to the above, it is also submitted that section 238 of the ibc provides that the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined provisions of this code shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law. as such, the statutory bar contained in section 96 (1) (b)(i) has an overriding effect on any provision inconsistent therewith and accordingly, all proceedings between the parties were deemed to have been stayed. 8. as such, since the impugned execution of 2019 were deemed to have been stayed on and from 08-09-2021, in view of the interim moratorium imposed by virtue of section 96 (1)(a) pending admission of cp (ib) 266/2021 before the nclt, kolkata bench against the applicant, he had filed application exh. 147 praying for passing of a formal order staying further proceedings of execution petition no. 161 of 2019 pending admission of cp (ib) 266/2021 by the nclt, kolkata.\" 9 the applicant further submits that in view of language of section 96(1)(b)(i), the impugned execution petition is deemed to have been stayed; however, as stated above, the applicant preferred application exh. 147 being the fact of filing of cp (ib) 266/2021 before nclt, kolkata bench by sbi against him on record of execution petition no. 161 of 2021 so that no further proceedings in the said execution petition are conducted in breach of the said deemed statutory stay by virtue of operation of the aforesaid provision of law. 10. the aforesaid issue is no longer res-integra inasmuch as in its order dated 07-06-2022 passed in

which is pending adjudication, is be deemed to have been stayed as per section 96 (1)(b)(i) of the code, the nclt kolkata recalled its earlier order issuing notice in the petition filed by ifci ltd and stayed further proceedings of the subsequent petition filed by ifci ltd in view of pendency of the petition filed by sbi. 11. it is submitted that since the applicant has been pursuing/ contesting 2 applications under section 10 and 7 of the insolvency and bankruptcy code, 2016 relating to gujarat nre coke ltd and bharath nre coke ltd. respectively before the nclt, kolkata, relating to corporate insolvency resolution process, wherein as per section 14 of the ib code, 2016, a moratorium is declared by the adjudicating authority only after admission of a petition filed under the aforesaid sections., he was under a bonafide impression/ belief that a moratorium relating to personal insolvency proceedings would also come into force only after admission of cp (ib) no.266 of 2021 by the nclt, kolkata filed by sbi against him. as such, the applicant continued to contest various proceedings initiated by the respondent against him in execution petition no. 161 of 2019, being completely unaware of the interpretation of section 96 (1) (b)(i) of the ib code, 2016 which provides for an automatic moratorium over all legal actions or proceedings pending in respect of any debt due to the petitioner on filing of such neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined application under section 95(1) of the ib code. accordingly, the applicant was unaware unlike as in the case of a corporate insolvency resolution process wherein a moratorium under section 14 of the ib code is declared only after admission of a petition under section 7 or 9 or 10 of the ib code, in case of personal insolvency resolution process, an interim moratorium automatically kicks in on filing of a petition under section 95(1) of the code and accordingly, continued pursuing/ contesting the impugned execution petition and proceedings arising out of it. pertinently, the petition has not benefited in any manner whatsoever by pursing the impugned execution proceedings before the trial court or for that matter befor3e the hon'ble gujarat high court and the hon'ble supreme court of india. in view of specific bar contained in section 96 (1)(b) (i) of ibc 2016, whereby all proceedings relating to all debts owed by the applicant are deemed to have been stayed, the orders dated 04-2-2022 and 04-10-2021 passed by this hon'ble court and the trial court are hit by the aforesaid provision of ibc, 2016 and as such, required to be recalled.\" 35. that application was withdrawn on 15.12.2022 after the court in special civil application no. 18901 of 2022 i.e. the present special civil application granted interim order staying proceedings before trial court. on 15.12.2022, the mca was listed and the high court recorded the following: neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined \"5. learned senior advocate for the applicant stated on instructions of the petitioner that the petitioner has been giving up cause and wants to withdraw the present misc. civil application. 5.1 accordingly, the misc. civil application was not pressed and was permitted to be withdrawn. 6. as the petitioner is giving up its prayer and seeks to withdraw the present application, permission as prayed for is granted.\" 36. as far as the ibc is concerned and with regard to the correctness of the order with regard to the currency of the interim moratorium, the preamble provides to complete the resolution in a time bound manner. 37. in the case of rahul shah (supra), the hon'ble supreme court observed as under:\"41. having regard to the above background, wherein there is urgent need to reduce delays in the execution proceedings we deem it appropriate to issue few directions to do complete justice. these directions are in exercise of our jurisdiction under article 142 read with article 141 and article 144 of the constitution of india in larger public interest to subserve the process of justice so as to bring to an end the unnecessary ordeal of litigation faced by parties awaiting fruits of decree and in neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined larger perspective affecting the faith of the litigants in the process of law. 42. all courts dealing with suits and execution proceedings shall mandatorily follow the belowmentioned directions: 1. in suits relating to delivery of possession, the court must examine the parties to the suit under order x in relation to third 2. party interest and further exercise the power under order xi rule 14 asking parties to disclose and produce documents, upon oath, which are in possession of the parties including declaration pertaining to third party interest in such properties. 3. in appropriate cases, where the possession is not in dispute and not a question of fact for adjudication before the court, the court may appoint commissioner to assess the accurate description and status of the property. 4. after examination of parties under order x or production of documents under order xi or receipt of commission report, the court must add all necessary or proper parties to the suit, so as to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and also make such joinder of cause of action in the same suit. 5. under order xl rule 1 of cpc, a court receiver can be appointed to monitor the status of the property in question as custodia legis for proper adjudication of the matter. 6. the court must, before passing the decree, pertaining to 7. delivery of possession of a property ensure that the decree is unambiguous so as to not only contain clear description of the property but also having regard to the status of the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined property. 8. in a money suit, the court must invariably resort to order xxi rule 11, ensuring immediate execution of decree for payment of money on oral application. 9. in a suit for payment of money, before settlement of issues, the defendant may be required to disclose his assets on oath, to the extent that he is being made liable in a suit. the court may further, at any stage, in appropriate cases during the pendency of suit, using powers under section 151 cpc, demand security to ensure satisfaction of any decree. 10.the court exercising jurisdiction under section 47 or under order xxi of cpc, must not issue notice on an application of third-party claiming rights in a mechanical manner. further, the court should refrain from entertaining any such application(s) that has already been considered by the court while adjudicating the suit or which raises any such issue which otherwise could have been raised and determined during adjudication of suit if due diligence was exercised by the applicant. 11. the court should allow taking of evidence during the execution proceedings only in exceptional and rare cases where the question of fact could not be decided by resorting to any other expeditious method like appointment of commissioner or calling for electronic materials including photographs or video with affidavits. 12. the court must in appropriate cases where it finds the objection or resistance or claim to be frivolous or mala fide, resort to sub-rule (2) of rule 98 of order xxi as well as grant compensatory costs in accordance with section 35a.\" neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined 38. therefore, in our opinion, as rightly observed in the order under challenge, the ibc must be disposed of expeditiously. even in the case of cauvery coffee traders (supra), the hon'ble supreme court has held that law does not permit a person to approbate and reprobate. the relevant paragraphs read as under: \"34. a party cannot be permitted to \"blow hot and cold\", \"fast and loose\" or \"approbate and reprobate\". where one knowingly accepts the benefits of a contract or conveyance or an order, is estopped to deny the validity or binding effect on him of such contract or conveyance or order. this rule is applied to do equity, however, it must not be applied in a number as to violate the principles of right and good conscience. (vide nagubhai ammal v. b. sharma rao, cit v. v.mr.p. firm muar, maharashtra srtc v. balwant regular motor service, p.r. deshpande v. maruti balaram haibatti, babu ram v. indra pal singh, ntpc ltd. v. reshmi constructions, builders & contractors, ramesh chandra sankla v. vikram cement and pradeep oil corpn. v. mcd.) 35. thus, it is evident that the doctrine of election is based on the rule of estoppel the principle that one cannot approbate and reprobate inheres in it. the doctrine of estoppel by election is one of the species of neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined estoppels in pais (or equitable estoppel), which is a rule in quity. by that law, a person may be precluded by his actions or conduct or silence when it is his duty to speak, from asserting a right which he otherwise would have had.\" 39. now coming to the question of constructive resjudicata as held in the case of sarguja transport services (supra), that though the principles of resjudicata is not strictly applicable to writ petitions under article 227 of the constitution of india, the legal principles underlying order xxiii, rule 1(4)(b) would as a matter of public policy be applicable to writ petitions. the same is reproduced hereinbelow: \"7. the code as it now stands thus makes a distinction between 'abandonment' of a suit and 'withdrawal' from a suit with permission to file a fresh suit. it provides that where the plaintiff abandons a suit or withdraws from a suit without the permission, referred to in sub-rule (3) of rule 1 of order xxiii of the code, he shall be precluded from instituting any fresh suit in respect of such subject-matter or such part of the claim. the principle underlying rule 1 of order xxiii of the code is that when a plaintiff once institutes a suit in a court and thereby avails of a remedy given to him under law, he cannot be permitted to institute a fresh suit in neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined respect of the same subject-matter again after abandoning the earlier suit or by withdrawing it without the permission of the court to file fresh suit. invito benificium non datur. the law confers upon a man no rights or benefits which he does not desire. whoever waives, abandons or disclaims a right will loose it. in order to prevent a litigant from abusing the process of the court by instituting suits again and again on the same cause of action without any good reason the code insists that he should obtain the permission of the court to file a fresh suit after establishing either of the two grounds mentioned in sub-rule (3) of rule 1 of order xxiii. the principle underlying the above rule is rounded on public policy, but it is not the same as the rule of res judicata contained in section 11 of the code which provides that no court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly or substantially in issue has been directly or substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such court. the rule of res judicata applies to a case where the suit or an issue has already been heard and finally decided by a court. in the case of abandonment or withdrawal of a suit without the permission of the court to file a fresh suit, there is no prior adjudication of a suit or an issue is involved, yet the code provides, as stated earlier, that a second suit will not lie in sub-rule (4) of rule 1 of order xxiii of the code when the first suit is withdrawn without the permission referred to in sub-rule (3) in order to prevent the abuse of the process of the court. neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined 8. the question for our consideration is whether it would or would not advance the cause of justice if the principle underlying rule 1 of order xxiii of the code is adopted in respect of writ petitions filed under articles 226/227 of the constitution of india also. it is common knowledge that very often after a writ petition is heard for some time when the petitioner or his counsel finds that the court is not likely to pass an order admitting the petition, request is made by the petitioner or by his counsel, to permit the petitioner to withdraw from the writ petition without seeking permission to institute a fresh writ petition. a court which is unwilling to admit the petition would not ordinarily grant liberty to file a fresh petition while it may just agree to permit the withdrawal of the petition. it is plain that when once a writ petition filed in a high court is withdrawn by the petitioner himself he is precluded from filing an appeal against the order passed in the writ petition because he cannot be considered as a party aggrieved by the order passed by the high court. he may as stated in daryao and ors. v. the state of u.p. and ors., [1962] 2 s.c.r. 575 in a case involving the question of enforcement of fundamental rights file a petition before the supreme court under article 32 of the constitution of india because in such a case there has been no decision on the merits by the high court. the relevant observation of this court in daryao's case (supra) is to be found at page 593 and it is as follows: \"if the petition is dismissed as withdrawn it cannot be a bar to a subsequent petition under art. 32, because in such a case there has been no decision on the merits neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined by the court. we wish to make it clear that the conclusions thus reached by us are confined only to the point of res judicata which has been argued as a preliminary issue in these writ petitions and no other.\" 9. the point for consideration is whether a petitioner after withdrawing a writ petition filed by him in the high court under article 226 of the constitution of india without the permission to institute a fresh petition can file a fresh writ petition in the high court under that article. on this point the decision in daryao's case (supra) is of no assistance. but we are of the view that the principle underlying rule 1 of order xxiii of the code should be extended in the interests of administration of justice to cases of withdrawal of writ petition also, not on the ground of res judicata but on the ground of public policy as explained above. it would also discourage the litigant from indulging in benchhunting tactics. in any event there is no justifiable reason in such a case to permit a petitioner to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of the high court under article 226 of the constitution once again. while the withdrawal of a writ petition filed in a high court without permission to file a fresh writ petition may not bar other remedies like a suit or a petition under article 32 of the constitution of india since such withdrawal does not amount to res judicata, the remedy under article 226 of the constitution of india should be deemed to have been abandoned by the petitioner in respect of the cause of action relied on in the writ petition when he withdraws it without such permission. in the instant case the high court was fight in holding that a fresh writ petition was not maintainable before it in respect of the same subject-matter neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined since the earlier writ petition had been withdrawn without permission to file a fresh petition. we, however. make it clear that whatever we have stated in this order may not be considered as being applicable to a writ petition involving the personal liberty of an individual in which the petitioner prays for the issue of a writ in the nature of habeas corpus or seeks to enforce the fundamental fight guaranteed under article 21 of the constitution since such a case stands on a different footing altogether. we however leave this question open.\" 40. in the case of forward construction (supra), the law as regard to constructive resjudicata was discussed as under: \"20. so far as the first reason is concerned, the high court in our opinion was not right in holding that the earlier judgment would not operate as res judicata as one of the grounds taken in the present petition was conspicuous by its absence in the earlier petition. explanation iv to section 11 cpc provides that any matter which might and ought to have been made ground of defence or attack in such former suit shall be deemed to have been a matter directly and substantially in issue in such suit. an adjudication is conclusive and final not only as to the actual matter determined but as to every other matter which the parties might and ought to have litigated and have had it decided as incidental to or essentially connected with the subject neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined matter of the litigation and every matter coming within the legitimate purview of the original action both in respect of the matters of claim or defence. the principle underlying explanation iv is that where the parties have had an opportunity of controverting a matter that should be taken to be the same thing as if the matter had been actually controverted and decided. it is true that where a matter has been constructively in issue it cannot be said to have been actually heard and decided. it could only be deemed to have been heard and decided. the first reason, therefore, has absolutely no force.\" 41. in the case of shiv chander more (supra), the hon'ble supreme court in paragraphs 22 to 24 held as under: \"22. the principles of constructive res judicata which are also a part of the very same doctrine have been held to be applicable to writ proceedings, by another constitution bench decision of this court in devilal modi v/s sto wherein this court observed: \"8. it may be conceded in favour of mr. trivedi that the rule of constructive res judicata which is pleaded against him in the present appeal is in a sense a somewhat technical or artificial rule prescribed by the code of civil procedure. this rule postulates that if a plea could have been taken by a party in a proceeding between him and his opponent, he would neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined not be permitted to take that plea against the same party in a subsequent proceeding which is based on the same cause of action; but basically even this view is founded on the same considerations of public policy, because if the doctrine of constructive res judicata is not applied to writ proceedings, it would be open to the party to take one proceeding after another and urge new grounds every time; and that plainly is inconsistent with considerations of public policy to which we have just referred.\" 23. reference may also be made to the constitution bench decision in direct recruit class ii engg. officers' assn. v/s state of maharashtra wherein this court once again reiterated that the principles of constructive res judicata apply not only to what is actually adjudicated or determined in a case but every other matter which the parties might and ought to have litigated or which was incidental to or essentially connected with the subject-matter of the litigation. this court observed; \"35. .an adjudication is conclusive and final not only as to the actual matter determined but as to every other matter which the parties might and ought to have litigated and have had decided as incidental to or essentially connected with the subject-matter of the litigation and every matter coming into the legitimate purview of the original action both in respect of the matters of claim and defence. thus, the principle of constructive res judicata underlying explanation iv of section 11 of the civil procedure code was applied to writ case. we, accordingly hold that the writ case is fit to be dismissed on the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined ground of res judicata. 24. it is in the light of the above authoritative decisions of this court no longer open to the appellants to contend that the principles of constructive res judicata would not debar them from raising the question which, as observed earlier, could and indeed ought to have been raised by them in the previous round of litigation. the high court was, in that view of the matter, perfectly justified in holding that the plea sought to be raised by the appellants in the purported exercise of liberty given to them by the orders of this court dated 09-042008 in lt. governor v/s shiv chander more was not legally open and should not be allowed to be urged.\" 42. what is apparent from these developments is that the petitioner knew of the personal insolvency proceedings right from 20.09.2021 but did not raise these issues. the defence of sec.14 proceedings is a feeble defence. the conduct of the petitioner also shows waiver of his statutory rights. the hon'ble supreme court in the case of arce polymers (supra), in paras 16 and 18 to 21 held as under: \"16. waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right. waiver applies when a party knows the material facts and is cognizant of the legal rights in the matter, and yet for some consideration consciously abandons the neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined existing legal right, advantage, benefit, claim or privilege. waiver can be contractual or by express conduct in consideration of some compromise. however, a statutory right may also be waived by implied conduct, like, by wanting to take a chance of a favourable decision. the fact that the other side has acted on it, is sufficient consideration. . 18. the question of waiver of mandatory requirement of a statute was considered by this court in depth in commr. of customs v/ s virgo steels, by referring to a catena of judgments beginning from the judgment of the privy council in vellayan chettiar v/s province of madras wherein it was held that though notice under section 80 of the civil procedure code, 1908 is mandatory, the suit would not be bad if the nonissuance of notice is waived by the party for whose benefit the provision has been enacted. 19. similarly, in s. raghbir singh gill v/s s. gurcharan singh tohra, the argument that the requirement of section 94 of the representation of the people act, 1951 cannot be waived was rejected observing that a privilege conferred or a right created by a statute, if it is solely for the benefit of a party, the said party can waive it. however, where a provision enacted is founded on public policy, the courts would be slow to apply the doctrine of waiver. the doctrine applies in the first situation as the right to waive inheres in the concept of personal privilege and right. 20. reference in this regard can be also made to the ratio in krishan lal v/s state neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined of j&k and martin & harris ltd. v/s addl. district judge. in bank of india v/s o.p. swarnakar and in lachoo mal v/s radhey shyam, this court elucidated the general principle that everyone has a right to waive and to agree to renounce an advantage of law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the person in private capacity. if a party gives up the advantage that could be taken of a particular position in law, it cannot later be permitted to change and turn around so as to avail of that advantage. however, this rule will not apply when there is a prohibition against contracting out of the statute, which prohibition would have its consequences or in case the waiver would be contrary to public policy. further, a person cannot waive a right of a third person. 21. this principle has been subsequently followed in pravesh kumar sachdeva v. state of uttar pradesh and others,11 to hold that waiver is abandonment of a right which normally everybody is at liberty to waive. waiver is nothing unless it amounts to release, albeit it can be adduced from acquiescence or may be implied. the essence of waiver is an estoppel and they are questions of conduct and, therefore, necessarily determined on the facts of each case. as a rule and judicial policy, the courts of law do not allow a litigant to take inconsistent position to gain advantage through the aid of judicial proceedings.\" 43. the judgement of axis trustee services limited (supra), and stichting doen-postcode loterij (supra), are in context of sec.96 proceedings vis-aneutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined vis co-guarantors and would therefore clearly stand distinguished. 44. for all these aforesaid reasons, special civil application no. 18901 of 2022 shall also stand dismissed. interim relief granted earlier, stands vacated forthwith. sca no.17793 of 2021 45. the captioned petition has been filed challenging the order dated 04.10.2021 passed below exh.90 by the court of the principal senior civil judge, jamnagar, in execution petition no.161 of 2019. by that application, the decree holder has prayed for the prohibitory order under order 21 rule 54 of the code of civil procedure with respect to the immovable property in the ownership of the judgement debtor. below the application so filed, the principal senior civil judge, jamnagar, by an order dated 04.10.2021 ordered to attach the house neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined property of the judgement debtor at nre house at 45a, saru section road, jamnagar. sca no.18079 of 2021 46. the captioned petition has been filed by the petitioner praying to quash and set aside order below exh.92 dated 04.10.2021 in the aforesaid proceedings. the respondent herein had filed an application under order xxi, rule 41(1a) with regard to the examination of the judgement debtor as to which source of funds of rs.50 crores which he intends to bring into gujarat nre coke limited pursuant to the composite scheme of compromise and arrangement between the judgement debtor and the creditors. by the order dated 04.10.2021, the trial court allowed the application directing the petitioner to disclose such source. 47. the learned counsel for the respective parties have restricted their arguments to special civil neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined application no. 5509 of 2021 and special civil application no.18901 of 2022. 48. in light of the orders passed in special civil application no. 5509 of 2021, whereby the order dated 29.02.2020 passed below application exh.11 and exh.45 in commercial execution petition no.161 of 2019 by the court of the principal senior civil judge, jamnagar, has been upheld and the petition is dismissed and also in light of the order passed in special civil application no. 18901 of 2022 wherein order dated 06.09.2022 passed below application exh.147 in commercial execution petition no.161 of 2019 by the commercial court at jamnagar, has been confirmed, and the petition is dismissed no separate reasons need to be assigned in light of the fact that the arguments of the learned counsel for the respective parties were restricted to the aforesaid two petitions only. no separate reasons be assigned. accordingly special civil neutral citation c/sca/5509/2021 cav judgment dated: 22/09/2023 undefined application no.17793 of 2021 and special civil application no.18079 of 2021 are also dismissed. 49. the executing court is directed to decide the execution proceedings within a period of three months from the date of receipt of the copy of the writ of the order of this court. further order after the pronouncement of judgement, mr. gupta, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner has prayed for stay and operation of the judgement and order. request is rejected.
