No.246/2021. \n1.1 In the aforesaid order, the Commercial Court, exercising powers under Order XXXIX Rule 2(A) of the Code, held that the appellants are guilty of disobedience of the order of temporary injunction, dated 21.02.2019. Consequently, appellant No.1 is sentenced to undergo civil imprisonment for three months and held liable to pay Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation to the plaintiffs. Further, appellants No.2 and 3 and respondent No.5 of this appeal, (respondent No.3 in Misc. No.246/2021) are sentenced to undergo civil imprisonment for one month and each of them is held liable to pay a compensation of Rs.50,000/-, to each of the plaintiffs. Further, the plaintiffs are permitted to apply to attach the movable and immovable properties of the contemnors to recover the compensation amount, if not paid by the appellants. \n2. Among other issues, the proportionality of punishment, power to award compensation for disobedience or breach of an interim order of the Court and the procedure to be followed under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ('Code' for short) before awarding compensation, do arise for consideration in this appeal.\n3. The applicants in the Commercial Misc. No.246/2021 are the plaintiffs. Respondents No.1 and 2 in the said Misc. No.246/2021 are defendants No.1 and 3 in the suit. Respondents No.3 to 5 in Misc. No.246/2021 are not parties to the suit. \nFacts in brief:\n4. O.S. No.1244/2019 is filed by the Manipal Academy of Higher Education (Trust) and the Manipal Academy of Higher Education (Deemed University) before the City Civil Court at Bengaluru, seeking the relief of permanent injunction, to restrain the defendants from using certain trade names/trademarks individually, or in conjunction with the trade name of defendant No.1. Initially, the suit is filed against three defendants viz., Manipal International School, Manipal E-commerce Limited and T. Sudhakar Pai. Later, on 04.11.2020, two more defendants were impleaded. \n- On 21.02.2019, the Court passed an ex parte order of temporary injunction against the three defendants in the suit. Said order reads as under:\n\"Defendants are hereby restrained by an order of ex parte injunction restraining them from infringing the plaintiffs registered trade mark by using identical trade mark like \"MAHE\"\nor \"Manipal groups\" in conjunction with any trademark, service mark and advertisement for their services or business papers\".\n5. Later, on 02.03.2019, the case is ordered to be registered as Commercial Suit. On 11.03.2019, the above- mentioned suit is registered as Commercial Suit in O.S. No.15/2019. Defendant No.3 appeared on 03.04.2019 and contested the suit by filing a written statement and filed an application under Order XXXIX Rule 4 to vacate the interim order dated 21.02.2019. \n6. On 05.04.2019, respondents No.1 and 2 of this appeal moved the Commercial Court under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code, alleging willful disobedience of the interim order dated 21.02.2019, by the appellants. Said application is registered as Com. Misc. No.9/2019.\n7. On 04.11.2020, the plaintiffs' application dated 7.6.2019, under Order I Rule 10 of the Code is allowed and Manipal Academy of Health and Education, (Defendant No.4) and Kurl-On Ltd. (Defendant No.5) are impleaded in the suit. \n8. By order dated 27.5.2021, the matter is transferred to Commercial Court, Bengaluru Rural and the suit is renumbered as O.S. No.960/2021. The application under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code which was earlier registered as Com. Misc. No.9/2019 is renumbered as Misc. Application No.246/2021. Appellants of this appeal filed a statement of objection in Misc. 246/2021, and contested the allegations of willful disobedience. \n9. After hearing the parties to the suit, vide order dated 22.4.2022, the application to vacate the interim order was rejected and the ex parte order of temporary injunction was made absolute. Later, in terms of the impugned order dated 28.9.2022, the Commercial Court held that appellant No.1 (defendant No.3 in the suit) and appellants No. 2 and 3 and respondent No.5 of this appeal (who are not parties to the suit but parties to Misc. No.246/2021) are guilty of willful disobedience of the ex parte interim order dated 21.02.2019. This appeal arises out of the said order dated 28.09.2022.\n10. It is relevant to state that, in the meantime, the Commercial Appeals No.267/2022 and 284/2022 challenging the order of temporary injunction were dismissed by this Court vide order dated 03.06.2022. The Special Leave Petitions No.1738 and 1749 of 2023 challenging the aforementioned order were not entertained and were dismissed vide order dated 12.01.2023. Submissions on behalf of the appellants 11. Sri Jayakumar S. Patil, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants assailing the order under appeal, urged the following contentions: \n(i) The order dated 21.2.2019 was passed by the City Civil Court in O.S. No.1244/2019. The e-portal reveals that on 11.03.2019 the case is disposed of. Later, the case was registered in the Commercial Court as Comm. O.S. No.15/2019. Thus, the ex parte order granted on 21.2.2019 by the City Civil Court spent its life on 11.03.2019 as the Civil Suit in O.S. No.1244/2019 is disposed of as closed. Therefore, appellants cannot be punished alleging disobedience of a non-existent order. \n(ii) The respondents No.1 and 2 sought a prohibitory injunction order from using several trade names/trademarks. However, the Court granting the ex parte order, restricted the ex parte order to only two trade names/trademarks viz., MAHE and MANIPAL GROUPS. And no prohibitory order is passed in respect of other alleged trade names/trademarks mentioned in the interim applications. Thus, the ex parte order cannot be made applicable to tradename/trademark other than MAHE and MANIPAL GROUPS. \n(iii) The Commercial Court while passing the impugned order erred in expanding the scope of the interim order to say that it restrains appellants from using all or any names/trademarks mentioned in association with Manipal. \n(iv) The suit is filed, deliberately omitting to implead MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HIGHER EDUCATION - a Company ('Company' for short) which holds registered trade mark MAHE and MANIPAL GROUP. Unless the prohibitory order is obtained against the Company, the prosecution under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code does not lie against the appellants, as appellant No.1 is the Chairman, and appellants No. 2 and 3, are the Chief Executive and the President of the Manipal International School respectively. \n(v) The use of trademarks/trade names viz. MAHE and MANIPAL GROUP post ex parte order by the Company cannot be construed as an act of violation of interim order against appellants. \n(vi) Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code, contemplates willful disobedience of the order and not just disobedience. The element of willful disobedience of the order by the appellants is not established, thus the order under challenge is liable to be set aside. Since appellant No.1 on the first date of appearance filed a written statement and an application to vacate the ex parte interim order and was diligently contesting the matter, it cannot be said that the disobedience, if any, is willful. \n(vii) The trademarks/tradenames viz. MAHE and MANIPAL GROUP were in use even before the ex parte order. The ex parte order dated 21.2.2019 does not mandate the removal of the trademarks/trade names viz. MAHE and MANIPAL GROUP. \n(viii) The appellants have complied with the order by removing the trademarks/tradenames viz. MAHE and MANIPAL GROUP and have submitted the compliance affidavit on 17.04.2023. \n(ix) Considering the language employed in Order XXXIX Rule 2A, the Court should be slow in imposing civil imprisonment, when the provision provides a discretion to attach the properties of the contemnor. \n12. In support of his contentions, the learned Senior Counsel has relied upon the following judgments:\n(i) ANEETA HADA vs GODFATHER TRAVELS AND TOURS PRIVATE LIMITED ((2012)5 SCC 661)\n(ii) U.C.SURENDRANATH vs MAMBALLY'S BAKERY ((2019) 20 SCC 666).\n(iii) HIMANSHU vs B SHIVAMURTHY AND ANOTHER ((2019)3 SCC 797). \n(iv) MAWAZZAM ALI KAN AND ORS. vs SHEBASH CHANDRA PAKRASHI AND ORS. (MANU/WB/0212/1927)\n(v) HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED vs STATE OF MANDHYA PRADESH ((2020)10 SCC 751). \n(vi) STATE OF BIHAR vs RANI SONABATI KUMARI ((1961)1 SCR 728) Submissions on behalf of respondent No.1 13. Sri. A.N.S. Nadkarni, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for respondent No.1 urged that;\n(a) Appellants were served with a copy of the interim order and were aware of the interim order. Despite the interim prohibitory order granted by the Court, the appellants willfully disobeyed the order by using the above said trademark/trade name. \n(b) In view of the interim order passed by the Court, appellants were required to take immediate steps for the removal of the aforesaid trademark/trade name wherever it was used before passing the interim order. However, such action is not taken till the order was confirmed by the Hon'ble Apex Court. And the disobedience continues even today though the appellants claim compliance with the order in the month of April 2023, after the dismissal of the Special Leave Petitions. \n(c) The application for breach of an interim order under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code is maintainable against all the appellants as the interim order is passed against appellant No.1 and other appellants being aware of the order, aided and abetted the disobedience by appellant No.1. \n(d) The ex parte order is not just confined to the use of expressions 'MAHE' and 'MANIPAL'. It prohibits the use of the words 'MAHE' and 'MANIPAL GROUPS' in conjunction with other words. \n(e) The ex parte order granted must be understood in the context of 9 registered trademarks described in the plaint, in the name of plaintiff No.2, and in the light of the definition of \"trade mark\" found in Sub Section (2) of Section 2 of The Trade Marks Act, 1999.\n(f) The ex parte order granted by the Court does not entertain two or more interpretations. The order is clear and unambiguous and the Commercial Court has not expanded the scope and meaning of the order. \n(g) Assuming that the order is passed by the Court without jurisdiction, unless and until that order is set aside, it binds the party against whom the order is passed and in case of a breach, the party cannot raise a defence that the Court which passed the order had no jurisdiction. \n14. Learned Senior counsel in support of his contentions has relied upon the following judgments:\n(i) TAYABBHAI M.BAGASARWALLA AND ANOTHER VS. HIND RUBBER INDUSTRIES PVT. LTD AND OTHERS REPORTED IN (1997) 3 SCC 443 (ii)PATEL RAJNIKANT DHULABHAI AND ANOTHER VS. PATEL CHANDRAKANT DHULABHAI AND OTHERS REPORTED IN (2008) 14 SCC 561 Submissions on behalf of respondent No.2:\n15. Learned Senior Counsel Sri Dhyan Chinappa appearing for respondent No.2, in addition, urged the following contentions: \n(i) The ex parte order of injunction extended to the use of the word MANIPAL in conjunction with any other words. Even assuming that the order of injunction was only confined to the use of the trade names/trademarks MAHE and MANIPAL GROUPS, and then also the appellants should be held for disobedience or breach of interim order as the appellants, willfully, in defiance of the interim order used the trade names/trademarks MAHE and MANIPAL GROUPS. \n(ii) The order was passed against appellant No.1 who is a party to the suit. Being a director of a Company and the Chairman of the Manipal International School, he has played the role in the use of the prohibited trade name/trademark, by the Company or its franchisee. \nHence appellant No.1 is guilty of breach and the remaining appellants are also guilty as abettors. \n(iii) Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code, uses the expression \"Person\" and not \"Party\" unlike Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code. Thus, any person who is made known of the Court order, though not a party to the suit, is bound to obey the same. \n(iv) If an order is passed against a person preventing him from doing certain acts, the same person against whom an order is passed, cannot do the restrained act in a different capacity or cannot cause it to be done by another person/entity/company, more so when the person against whom the order is passed is controlling another person/entity/company under whose name/ banner the prohibited act is done.\n(v) The order passed by the City Civil Court in the first instance was an order passed by the Court of competent jurisdiction as it was a designated Court for Trade mark related cases, and later, on the establishment of the Commercial Court, the case is transferred to the Commercial Court. Thus, the order throughout is the order passed by the Court of competent jurisdiction and must be obeyed. \n(vi) The order of injunction passed by the Court did not suffer from any ambiguity. Assuming that there was any ambiguity in the order, it was incumbent upon the persons against whom the order is passed to seek clarification from the Court. No such clarification is sought by the appellants and it is not open for them to interpret the order in a way that suits them. \n(vii) The statement of objection filed to the application under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code does not contain the defence relating to vagueness and ambiguity in the order. \n16. In support of his contentions, the learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.2 has relied on the following judgments:\n1. Krishna Gupta vs. Narendra Nath & Another, 2017 SCC ONLINE DELHI 10990 2. Mohd. Sharfuddin by LRs vs. Mohd.\nJamal & others 2003 SCC online AP 184 3. Vidya Charan Shukla vs. Tamil Nadu Olympic Association Represented by its General Secy & others, AIR 1991 Mad 4. Jiben Kumar Banerjee & Another vs. State of West Bengal, 1993 SCC Online 5. Sri.Badri Singh & Another vs. The State of Bihar & others, 1995 SCC online Pat Reply on behalf of the appellants:\n17. Learned Senior counsel appearing for the appellants by way of rejoinder urged that the suits were filed by the respondents in O.S.No.8203/2014 and in O.S.No.8204/2014 against the Company and no order of injunction was passed against the Company in the said proceedings. However, now an injunction is obtained in O.S. no. 960/2021 against one of the directors of the said Company (defendant No.3), in his individual capacity. \nSince they failed to obtain any order in the said suit, indirectly the plaintiffs tried to obtain an order against the Company by impleading defendant No.3, in his individual capacity. Thus he urged that the act committed by the Company against which there is no order should not be treated as an act of disobedience by the appellants. \n18. We have considered the contentions raised at the bar and perused the records and judgments cited. Points for consideration:\n(a) Whether the appellants establish that the acts complained do not amount to disobedience or breach of the interim order dated 21.02.2019, in the light of partial/limited ex parte interim relief granted by the Commercial Court?\n(b) Whether the appellants establish that the acts complained are the acts committed by the Company against which there was no ex parte order of injunction, as such, there is no disobedience or breach of the order of injunction by the appellants?\n(c) Whether the respondents prove that appellants have willfully disobeyed the interim order dated 21.02.2019?\n(d) Whether the Commercial Court justified in ordering civil imprisonment, payment of compensation and attachment of property if the compensation is not paid? Discussion regarding the scope of the interim order dated 21.02.2019:\n19. In light of the contentions raised to answer point (a) relating to alleged disobedience, the Court has to first consider the scope and ambit of the interim order. \n20. It is a settled principle of law that the order passed by the Court is to be understood in the context of pleading and prayer made. Hence it is necessary to refer to the prayer in the plaint. On a reading of the prayer, it is apparent that the suit is filed to restrain the use of trade names/marks, MANIPAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL, and/or MAHE and/or MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION and/or any other word(s) identical or deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs registered trademarks MAHE (DEEMED UNIVERSITY), MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HIGHER EDUCATION (DEEMED UNIVERSITY), MANIPAL UNIVERSITY, MIS.\n21. Restraint order is sought to restrain the defendants from using the above said trademarks singularly or in conjunction with any other words or monogram/logo as a trademark, service mark, trade name, trading style, corporate name and domain name, or in any other manner whatsoever or in relation to any goods and/or services whatsoever advertising business papers etc.\n22. From the written statement, it is apparent that the 3rd defendant contested the plaintiffs' claim. In substance, the defence is that the MANIPAL ACADEMY AND HEALTH EDUCATION which is later added as defendant No. 4 has the right to use the said words ''MAHE'' and ''MANIPAL''. It is also contended that ''MANIPAL'' is a geographical name and is being used by many including the defendants and the plaintiffs cannot claim exclusivity in its use. \n23. The interim ex parte order of injunction is sought in 6 different applications and the relief of temporary injunction sought can be summarized as under. \n23.1. In I.A. No.1, the plaintiffs sought a restraint order against the defendants from using:\nMANIPAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL and/or MAHE and/or MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION and/or in another word(s) identical or deceptively similar to the plaintiffs registered trade mark MAHE (DEEMED UNIVERSITY)/MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HIGHER EDUCATION (DEEMED UNIVERSITY)/MANIPAL UNIVERSITY; singularly or in conjunction with any other words or monogram/logo or as a trade mark, service mark, trade name, trading style, domain name or other manner what-so- ever; or in relation to or any good and/or services what-so-ever, advertising, business papers etc. until disposal of this application. 23.2. In I.A. No.2, the plaintiffs sought a restraint order against the defendants from using, MANIPAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL and/or MIS and/or MAHE and/or MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION and/or other marks comprising of MANIPAL or any other mark/name/words identical or deceptively like the plaintiff's trade mark/mark(s)/name. MIS/MAHE (DEEMED UNIVERSITY)/MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HIGHER EDUCATION (DEEMED UNIVERSITY)/MANIPAL UNIVERSITY/MANIPAL, singularly or in conjunction with any other words or monogram/logo or as a trade mark, service mark, trade name, trading style, domain name or other manner what-so-ever; or in relation to or any good and/or services what-so-ever, advertising, business papers etc. until disposal of this application. \n23.3. In I.A. No.3, the plaintiffs sought a restraint order against the defendants from using:\nMAHE (DEEMED UNIVERSITY)/MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HIGHER EDUCATION (DEEMED UNIVERSITY)/ MANIPAL UNIVERSITY AND/OR OTHER MARKS comprising of MANIPAL or any other mark/name or words identical or deceptively similar thereto, singularly or in conjunction with any other words or monogram/logo or as a trade mark, service mark, trade name, trading style, domain name or other manner what-so-ever; or in relation to or any good and/or services what-so-ever, advertising, business papers etc. until disposal of this application.\n23.4. In I.A. No.4, the plaintiffs sought a restraint order against the defendants from using \"MANIPAL GROUP\" singularly or in conjunction with any other words, in relation to any goods or services or business or in any manner whatsoever until disposal of this application. \n23.5. In I.A.No.5, the plaintiffs sought a restraint order against the defendants from using:\n\"MANIPAL GROUP\" (Logo displayed in I.A.) in relation to any other goods or services or business or in any manner whatsoever until disposal of this application. \n23.6. In I.A.No.6, the plaintiffs sought a restraint order from using the domain name \"manipalschool- ecity.com\" and pass an order/direction to defendant No.2 to transfer the domain name \"manipalschool-ecity.com\" in favour of plaintiff No.1 until disposal of this application. \n24. After considering the aforementioned applications, the Court on 21.02.2019, passed an order which reads as under. \n\"Defendants are hereby restrained by an order of ex parte injunction restraining them from infringing the plaintiffs registered trade mark by using identical trade mark like \"MAHE\" or \"Manipal groups\" in conjunction with any trademark, service mark and advertisement for their services or business papers\".\n(Emphasis added)\n25. It is forthcoming from Ex. P26 and P37 that the trade names/trademarks namely MAHE and MANIPAL GROUP were used by a company by the name MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION, the fourth defendant which was impleaded vide order dated 04.11.2020 (Hereinafter referred to as the 'Company' for short). The prayer in the plaint as well as the prayer in the application is to restrain the defendants from using several alleged trade names/trademarks either singularly or in conjunction with some other names. In paragraph No. 31, the plaintiffs claim to be the registered holder of 9 specific trade names/trademarks. Though the prayer is made in respect of several trade names/ trademarks, the ex parte order is confined to the use of \"MAHE\" or \"Manipal groups\" not only individually but also in conjunction with any trademark, service mark and advertisement for their services or business papers\".\n26. Considering the contentions in the pleading, and the ex parte order granted by the Court, it has to be concluded that the use of the trade name/trademarks \"MAHE\" or \"Manipal groups\" individually or in conjunction with any other business names amounts to disobedience or breach of the ex parte order of temporary injunction. \n27. Now the question is whether the appellants disobeyed or committed a breach of the interim order dated 21.02.2019 by the appellants? \n28. To answer the above question, the Court has to consider the following:\n(a) whether the appellants were aware of the ex parte interim order;\n(b) whether the appellants were bound by the ex parte interim order and;\nDiscussion on the question (a):\n29. So far as question (a) is concerned the appellants in their statement of objection before the Commercial Court did not raise a defence that they were not served with a copy of the interim order. The evidence on record (discussed infra) also reveals that the appellants were aware of the ex parte Court order. Hence the question (a) referred to above is answered in the affirmative. \nDiscussion on the question (b)\n30. \"Whether the appellants are bound by the order\"?\n31. The appellant No. 1 is arrayed as defendant No.3 in the suit. The ex parte order of injunction is passed against all three defendants. Thus, it binds appellant No.1/defendant No. 3 in the suit. \n32. As far as appellants No.2 and 3 are concerned , admittedly they are not parties to the suit. However, the prosecution under Order XXXIX Rule 2A is launched against them on the premise that appellants No.2 and 3 aided and abetted the disobedience or breach of the order by appellant No.1, despite being aware of the restraint order against appellant No.1. Thus, the question is whether the prosecution lies against the persons who are not parties to the proceeding, is to be answered by considering the provision, i.e., Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code, which reads as under:\nOrder 39 Rule 2-A. Consequence of disobedience or breach of the injunction.-- (1) In the case of disobedience to any injunction granted or other order made under Rule 1 or Rule 2 or breach of any of the terms on which the injunction was granted or the order made, the Court granting the injunction or making the order, or any Court to which the suit or proceeding is transferred, may order the property of the person guilty of such disobedience or breach to be attached, and may also order such person to be detained in the civil prison for a term not exceeding three months, unless in the meantime the Court directs his release.\n(2) No attachment made under this rule shall remain in force for more than one year, at the end of which time, if the disobedience or breach continues, the property attached may be sold and out of the proceeds, the Court may award such compensation as it thinks fit to the injured party and shall pay the balance, if any, to the party entitled thereto.] (Emphasis supplied) \n33. The word used in the provision is \"person'' and not \"party''. It is relevant to note that the expressions \"any party to the suit\" or \"defendant'' are used in Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code, which provides for interim prohibitory order. \n34. The wisdom of the parliament in using the expression \"person\" in Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code, instead of the words 'party' or 'parties' is obvious. The expression \"person guilty of such disobedience or breach\" will have a wider connotation than the expression \"party guilty of such disobedience or breach\". The intention is to ensure that the party to the proceeding does not circumvent the order of the Court, disobey or commit the breach of the order, through a person who is not a party to the proceeding. The provision also aims in ensuring that the Court order is obeyed or implemented both in its letter and spirit. Thus, Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code is wide enough in its scope and amplitude to punish the person who is guilty of disobedience or breach of a Court order though not a party to the suit. However, to prosecute and punish him, it must be established that;\n(a) he was aware of the Court order,\n(b) he willfully disobeyed the Court order.\n35. In the case of SITA RAM VS BALBIR (2017) 2 SCC 456 the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the Courts have the power to punish the person who willfully violates the Court order despite being aware of the court order, though such a person is not a party to the proceeding which passed the order. In the instant case, it is not the case of the appellants that they were not aware of the order of injunction. In the cross-examination (referred infra) the appellants admit that they were served with a copy of the order or were aware of the Court order at least. Hence this Court is of the view the order dated 21.02.2019 binds all the appellants and accordingly the question (b) referred to above is answered in the affirmative. \n36. Now the question is whether the appellants have disobeyed the interim order and if so whether disobedience or the breach is willful disobedience of the order. This question is to be considered in the light of the contention that the prohibited use of trade name/trade mark is said to be used by the Company or the franchisee, (as per the version of the appellants) which were not parties to the suit when the ex parte order was passed.\n37. To answer the question, the following points are required to be considered. \n(a) Whether appellant No.1 participated in the decision-making process of the Company which authorized the use of the trade mark/trade name covered by the interim order. \n(b) Whether appellants No. 2 and 3 aided and abetted appellant No.1 and the Company in using the trade mark/trade name covered by the interim order. \n38. Evidence reveals that the trade name/trade mark MAHE and MANIPAL and MANIPAL GROUP were used in several publications by the Company or its franchisees. The evidence of RW-3/appellant No.1 in unmistakable terms would lead to the conclusion that appellant No.1 has allowed the use of the trade name/trade mark covered by the interim order. From the tenor of the defence raised, it is evident that the appellants are not denying the publication of the trade name/trade mark MAHE and Manipal GROUP. However, it is urged that the use of the said trade mark/trade name by the Company does not amount to a breach of the interim order on the premise that there is no order against the Company. \n39. It may be noticed that the publications of the words 'MAHE' and 'MANIPAL GROUPS' either singularly or in conjunction with some other trade name/trade mark or business/service name by the Company are never in dispute. The appellants essentially contended that it was used by the Company which was not a party to the suit when the ex parte order was passed and such use of the trade name/trade mark by the Company cannot be termed as disobedience or breach to punish the appellants on the principle that agent is also liable for the act of master. Such being the position, it is not necessary for the Court to dwell deep to consider whether the prohibited trade names/trademarks are published post interim order. Admittedly they are published post interim order. \n40. It is to be noticed that defendant No.4 (impleaded after ex parte order) is a Company incorporated. It is a juristic person but not a real person but managed by real persons. Thus, the Company acts through real persons. Appellant No.1 is one of the d irectors of the Company and being the director, he has played a conscious role in allowing the publication of the trade name/trade mark by other persons/entities. \n41. There is nothing on record to show that appellant No.1 distanced himself from the decision-making process when the decisions are taken to allow the third parties/franchisees to use the trade name/trade mark covered by the interim order. It is his stand that he is arrayed in the suit in his individual capacity and not as a Director of the Company. It is contended that appellant No.1 is not prevented from participating in the proceedings of the Company as a director, and any decision taken by the Company where he has participated as a director should be treated as a decision/act of the Company, and not the decision/act of the appellant No 1. This contention does not merit elaborate consideration as it runs contrary to the underlying spirit and object of Order XXXIX Rule 2 A of the Code, discussed supra, which empowers the Court to proceed against any \"person\" who violates the order of the Court. If such a contention is accepted, it defeats the salutary object behind Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code. Hence appellant No.1 is guilty of disobedience or breach of the interim order of injunction. \n42. The learned Senior counsel appearing for the appellants placed reliance on the judgements of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of ANEETHA HADA, HIMANSU, and HINDUSTAN UNILEVER (supra). Referring to the decisions, it was urged that the Company was not a party to the proceeding when the ex parte order was passed and in effect, no order is passed against the Company. Thus the use of Trade name/Trade Mark by the Company does not amount to a breach and no prosecution lies against the appellants who are in some way connected to the Company. This Court is of the view that the ratio laid down in the aforementioned case is not applicable, as the law laid down in the case of ANEETHA HADA, HIMANSHU and HIMANSU (supra), is in the context of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. And the law laid down in the case of HINDUSTAN UNILEVER (supra), is in the context of Section 17 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the aforementioned cases has decided the question relating to the liability of a Director or Officer in charge of a Company in an entirely different factual and legal context. In ANNETHA HADA, and HIMANSU (supra), the Apex Court has taken a view that to hold the directors or officers in charge of the Company liable for the offence under Section 138, of N.I. Act, the liability of the Company is to be established and the Company is to be made a party. That principle has no application to the present case, where the Court is examining the culpability of the persons against whom an interim order of the Court is served and who are accused to have committed the breach. This Court is not examining the liability of the Company, but is examining the role/acts/omissions of the appellants said to have been committed, behind the shield of the Company. Hence, the ratio laid down in the aforementioned cases does not apply. \n43. The law laid down in the case of STATE OF BIHAR VS SONABATI and MAWAZZAM ALI KAN supra, interpreting Order 39 Rule 2(3) of the Code, is of little assistance to the appellants who are held guilty of disobedience under Order XXXIX Rule 2A, even assuming that the philosophy of both the provisions is the same, as facts obtained are entirely different. \n44. Hence the appellants are also guilty of disobedience of the interim order dated 21.02.2019. REGARDING WILFUL DISOBEDIENCE. \n45. Having dealt with the question of disobedience and having held that the appellants are guilty of disobedience, now this Court will consider whether the disobedience or breach is willful. This question has to be considered by analysing the evidence on record. \n46. Appellant No.2 is examined as RW1 in the miscellaneous proceedings. In his cross-examination, RW1 is stated as under:\n\"We started our first franchise school in the year 2018 as I remember. The said institution is running two franchise schools as of now, one in Bengaluru and the other one at Anantpur (AP). The school by name of Manipal of my affidavit situated at Chandapur is now closed. Since we have differences with the franchisee, we have closed the said school. Our Bengaluru franchise school by name Manipal International School is situated at Laxmisagara Road, Chandapur. It was established in May 2020. \n(Underlining by the Court) I was aware that, in May- 2020 there was an injunction order by the Court in respect of MAHE and Manipal Groups.\" Witness volunteers that, the injunction order is not against MAHE and Manipal Groups, but it was against Manipal International School as per my knowledge. I know that Mr Sudhakar Pai is a party to the said proceeding. \nMr Sudhakar Pai has established the said institution as per my knowledge\".\n(underlining by the Court)\n47. From the admission extracted above, it is evident that RW1 in his cross-examination, admits opening the school in May 2020 under the name of MANIPAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL. It is further evident that Mr Sudhakar Pai (appellant No.1) is the Chairman of the institution and he has taken a decision in approving the franchise school. \n48. The relevant portion of the evidence of RW2 (appellant No.3) in cross-examination reads as under:\nI came to know about the passing of injunction orders by the court in respect of Manipal International School in the year 2019. It was somewhere in June-2019. I have not received any notice from the advocate regarding the passing of the interim order of injunction by the court. I have not raised the issue of court proceedings/injunction order with respondent No.4 while starting Lakshmisagar Road School. Witness volunteers that, the management of the school told me that they will take care of it. There were several persons in the management. Respondent No.4 told me about it. \nI do not know the names of the trustees of the MEF trust. It is true to suggest that I report to Respondent No.4. Witness again says that she reports to the HR department and Finance department daily. It is false to suggest that Ex.P38 is the e-mail sent by Miss. Sowmya at my instructions. We recruited teachers for Suryanagar school in April-May of 2019. It is true to suggest that I am involved in day to day management of the Manipal Academy of Health and Education and I know all the proceedings of the case. Witness volunteers that, at present, she is involved in the management of the Manipal Academy of Health and Education and knowing about this case. It is true to suggest that the document now shown to me is the website printout of our school. The same is marked as Ex.P40.\n(underlining by the Court)\n49. From her evidence, it is apparent that appellant No.3 came to know about the ex parte interim order in June 2019. It is also evident that she has understood that the order is against MANIPAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL. It is forthcoming that appellant No.3/RW2 has stated that the management assured that it will take care of the interim order passed by the Court. \n50. The evidence of RW3 who is appellant No.1 in the cross-examination reads as under:\n\"We have started two schools under the company during the period from 2007 to 2018 one in Lucknow and the other one is in Bhopal. \n      The     said schools    are    not   owned     by   the       company.      Witness        volunteers   that      the company is the only service provider and schools are owned by the respective trusts in the said places. One M N Sudheer, Chartered Accountant of Delhi has decided that the company shall be in its present name. He was the founder and director of the company. I will allow any person to use Manipal as his corporate name if he does good work and for good purpose. There were 5-6 names before the Board of Directors of the company before the formation of the Manipal International School and the said name was selected among them. I do not remember how many directors were there on the Board when we selected the name for Manipal International School. It could be correct to say that there were only two directors in the company at any point of time including myself. I have allowed a person to form a trust in the name of Manipal after receiving the temporary injunction order by the court in Com.OS No.960/2021 (OS No.15/2019). I do not remember whether the said trust has established its office in one of my establishments\". \nWe started MANIPAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL at Chandapur in the year 2019 and it was stopped in the year 2020. It was shifted to Suryanagar in the year 2020. The school in Chandapur was a franchise school owned by Educrystal Trust. We have issued a licence to the said trust to use Manipal as the name of the Manipal International School. Manipal Education Foundation is the trust which took over the said school and started it in Suryanagar. We have executed a new franchise agreement in favour of the Manipal Education Foundation. We have issued a licence to Manipal Education Foundation to use the work of Manipal for their said school. As I remember there are 4 or 5 trustees in the said Manipal Education Foundation. I do not remember that Educrystal Trust has issued a notice to me stating that I have misrepresented them as being part of Manipal University and MAHE. Witness volunteers that in the first meeting with the Educrystal Trust, I told them that we are not part of Manipal University and MAHE. \nQ: Have you started any school in the name of Manipal in Dharbanga, Bihar and in Coimbatore?\nA: Our company might have started the schools in the name of Manipal in Dharbanga and in Coimbatore.\nQ: Have you permitted as a member of Board of Directors for the usage of the word Manipal, Manipal Group, MAHE by third parties after the passing of the interim order by this court? \nA: As a company, we have permitted for usage of the word Manipal, Manipal Group, MAHE by third parties after the passing of interim order by this court as there was no injunction order against the company. \n(underlining by the Court)\n51. Thus, from the evidence of RW-3/the appellant No.1, it is explicit that he was aware of the interim order passed against him in the year 2019. And RW-3 in his capacity as the director of the Company has consciously and deliberately allowed the franchisee to use the name MANIPAL GROUP and MAHE. Appellant No. 1 now seeks to take shelter under the banner of the Company in which he is one of the directors and played a decisive role to permit the use of the injuncted name/trade mark. It is urged that the Company has issued authorisation to the franchisee to use the name MANIPAL GROUP and he has not authorised in his capacity as defendant No.3. However, what is to be noticed is that the 4th defendant is only a Company and it is managed by the board of directors. The evidence also discloses the fact that the wife and two daughters of appellant No.1 are the remaining directors of the Company along with appellant No.1.\n52. The order of the Court is required to be obeyed not only in letter but also in its true spirit. The specious plea of the contemnor that he did the acts complained in a different capacity or role than the one described in the proceeding where the order is passed against him, is wholly misplaced. On the other hand, such an act of imposter speaks aloud about wilful disobedience. This Court is of the view that the act of appellant No. 1, in publishing the injuncted trade name/trademark in the name of the Company/franchisee amounts to wilful disobedience of the Court order dated 21.02.2019.\n53. It is also forthcoming from the records which are marked at Ex.P.23 and Ex.P.26 that the expression \"MANIPAL GROUP\" and \"MAHE\" are used by MANIPAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL even after service of ex parte order on the defendants. These documents are not disputed. These documents are publications by MANIPAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL. \n54. It is also evident from Exs.P.39 and 40 that trademarks MAHE and MANIPAL GROUP are used by appellant No.3. These are the publications by MANIPAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL and the publication of these documents which contain the expression MAHE and MANIPAL GROUP are not disputed by the appellants. \n55. Under these circumstances, there is no difficulty in holding that the MAHE and MANIPAL GROUP, the expressions which are covered in the interim order are used by the appellants even after service of notice of the interim order. \n56. The evidence placed on record and the stand taken by the appellants demonstrate that appellant No.1 wilfully used the expression \"MAHE\" as well as \"MANIPAL GROUP\" after being served with the notice of the interim order. Other appellants aided and abetted appellant No. 1.\n57. Again, this Court has to keep in mind that the suit is filed on the premise that the defendants are misusing the registered trade mark of the plaintiffs and in this context, being satisfied that prima facie case made out by the plaintiffs, the Court passed an interim order. The appellants are all well-educated, well-informed and occupying responsible positions. It can be safely concluded that they were certainly aware of the true import of the interim order passed by the Court. \n58. The contention of the appellants that no order is passed against the Company and use of injuncted expressions by the Company is not disobedience of the court order is untenable for the simple reason, the appellant being the director of the Company has not distanced himself from any of the decisions of the Company or MANIPAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL in allowing the franchisee/s to use the name MAHE and MANIPAL GROUP. It is not his case that the decision is taken by the Company without his knowledge or despite his objection to use such names. On the other hand appellant No.1 took part in selecting the franchisees and allowed the trade name to be used by them. This being the position, this Court has to take a view that appellant No.1 has wilfully participated in the decision- making process of the Company and permitted the use of the prohibited Trade name/Trade Mark, by the MANIPAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL and the franchisees. The conduct of appellant No.1 is nothing but an attempt to hoodwink the interim order passed by the Commercial Court. This being the position, in the considered opinion of this Court, the publications complained about are published in blatant violation of the interim order passed by the Court. \n59. The evidence of RW1, in unmistakable terms reveals that despite bringing to the notice of the management the order passed by the Court, the management (obviously comprising appellant No.1 as he is the Chairman of the Manipal International school) has gone to the extent of saying that it will take care of order passed by the Court. This statement by RW1 in the cross- examination is not disputed by appellant No.1. This again would establish the fact that appellant No.1 has wilfully disobeyed the interim order and has no respect for the Court order. \n60. The evidence on record if analysed carefully would lead to the inevitable conclusion that appellant No.1 has calculatedly misused the injuncted trade mark/trade name in the name of MANIPAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL to give an impression that the decision is taken by the Company and he is not a party to the said decision. However, his defence is demolished in his cross- examination. The evidence on record points towards the intention of appellant No.1, who tried to make a mockery of the Court order and intentionally disobeyed the order, hiding behind the veil of the Company. Under the circumstances, this Court is of the view that the violation is brazen, wilful and deliberate which has to be viewed seriously. \n61. So far as submissions that the ex parte order is passed by a Court without jurisdiction and the same came to an end as the case is closed, on transfer to the Commercial Court, are concerned, it is evident that there is no order in the order sheet to hold that the case is closed. Since the case is transferred to Commercial Court on the establishment of Commercial Court, vide notification dated 26.06.2008, and having regard to the fact that it was initially filed before the designated court dealing with intellectual property cases, this Court is of the view that the ex parte order was passed by the competent Court. Even otherwise, in terms of the law laid down in the case of TAYABBHAI M.BAGASARWALLA supra, even the order passed by the court having no jurisdiction, is to be obeyed, otherwise, consequences as prescribed under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code would ensue. Hence the appellants' contentions in this regard are rejected. ON PUNISHMENT IMPOSED AND ITS PROPORTIONALITY 62. As already noticed, the Commercial Court has passed an order for payment of compensation. The order also permitted the plaintiffs to apply for the sale of the attached property if compensation is not paid. In addition, civil imprisonment is also ordered. To decide the question on the punishment and its proportionality the Court has to consider Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code. The Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code is extracted in paragraph 32.\n63. On reading XXXIX Rule 2A (1) of the Code, it is evident that the Rule provides for;\n(a) attachment of the property of the wrongdoer,\n(b) civil imprisonment not exceeding three months. The sub-rule (2), referred to above provides for;\n(a) The attachment shall not remain in force for more than a year. \n(b) If disobedience continues at the end of the period for which the order of attachment is passed, the Court may sell the property attached and pay suitable compensation to the injured party. Balance amount if any has to be returned to the contemnor. \n64. As can be noticed, the provision does not empower the Court to award compensation by attachment and sale of the property, immediately after pronouncing the verdict of guilty. To sell the property attached, the Court has to wait till the expiry of the period of attachment, specified in the order which can be one year, at the maximum. The property attached can be sold if the disobedience or the breach complained of continues at the end of the period of attachment. It is again noticed, even if the breach continues, the Court is not bound to sell the property, but at its discretion may order the sale of the property attached and pay compensation to the injured. \n65. The provision enables to Court to provide an opportunity to the contemnor to mend his acts and omissions. Despite the completion of tenure of the attachment order, if the contemnor persists in disobedience, the Court may sell the attached property and pay compensation to compensate the wrongdoer. Before selling the property attached, there has to be a finding recorded that disobedience or breach continued even after the issuance of an order of attachment. This can be done only after hearing the contemnor. From the measured procedure contemplated in the provision, the carrot and stick policy is writ large in Order XXXIX Rule 2A(2) of the Code.\n66. In this case, payment of compensation is ordered on the day of pronouncing the verdict of guilty, which is impermissible under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code. The opportunity for the contemnors to make amends for their acts and omissions is denied. Instead of ordering attachment to secure possible order for payment of compensation, in the event of disobedience or breach continuing at the end of the tenure of the order of attachment, the Court straight away ordered payment of compensation and permitted the plaintiffs to apply for attaching the property of the contemnors if payment is not made. By doing so, the Commercial Court put the cart before the horse which is impermissible. Hence the order for payment of compensation has to be set aside as the same is in ultra vires the provision of Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code.\n67. Now we may advert to the question, whether the Commercial Court is justified in directing appellant No.1 to undergo civil imprisonment of 3 months and civil imprisonment of one month each to the appellants and respondent No.3 in Commercial Misc. No.246/2021.\n68. The underlying philosophy of the provision is curative and to enforce the compliance of the Court order rather than to punish the wrongdoer. The measured steps and procedures provided in Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code, discussed supra, support the view. At the same time, it is equally important that any party to the litigation should not carry the impression that one who violates the interim order is entitled to a long rope. The provision also has a very important role to play in upholding the rule of law, the majesty of the Court, and ensuring the credibility of the Court order.\n69. Needless to say, under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, liberty is a cherished fundamental right. While ordering civil imprisonment, the court should bear in mind the fundamental right guaranteed in Article 21 of the Constitution of India. However, it does not mean that the punishment by way of civil imprisonment is ruled out and can be ordered only after exhausting the option of attachment and sale of the property. \n70. In terms of the law laid down by the Apex Court in SAMEE KHAN vs. BINDU KHAN reported in (1999) 7 SCC 59 it is held that the Court has the power to order attachment as well as civil imprisonment simultaneously. From the very language employed in the provision, it is apparent that the discretion lies with the Court to impose either of the two punishments as well. However, the discretion is not absolute or unfettered. Every wide power conferred on the Courts has inherent limitations and inbuilt checks and balance mechanisms. Likewise, the discretion under Order XXXIX Rule 2A has its inherent limitations as the power to order civil imprisonment under Order XXXIX Rule 2A curtails an individual's fundamental right, albeit through a process of law. \n71. For the aforesaid reasons, considering the object of the provision, an order directing civil imprisonment should not be passed as a matter of course. To pass an order for civil imprisonment, the Court has to take into account one or more factors or circumstances namely;\n(a) the nature/gravity of the disobedience or breach, and the manner in which order is violated,\n(b) the loss caused to the party on account of disobedience or breach,\n(c) whether the damage caused can be restored in some way or the other or is something irreversible,\n(d) circumstances under which the breach or disobedience is committed,\n(e) whether the breach or disobedience complained is an isolated act or it is a continuous act,\n(f) previous history, if any, where the contemnor is held guilty of breach or disobedience of the Court order,\n(g) whether the case calls for a situation where the message is to be sent, by passing an order of civil imprisonment, that willful breach or disobedience of the Court order will be viewed seriously,\n(h) and more importantly, the Court has to consider whether civil imprisonment is an effective way to prevent a further breach,\n( i) the timing of the apology if any, tendered by the contemnor, the tenor and tone of the language used in the affidavit tendering the apology, \n(j) the compliance if any, made to undo the disobedience or breach complained,\n(k) to an extent, the educational qualifications/ positions of the contemnor and whether the acts committed by the contemnor make mockery of the Court order.\n72. This Court also makes it clear that the criteria mentioned above are not exhaustive but are illustrative and this Court is not saying that all the criteria have to be satisfied before ordering attachment of the property or civil imprisonment of the contemnor. \n73. After considering the aforementioned factors or circumstances, if the Court is of the view, that the evidence led before it warrants civil imprisonment, then the Court can impose civil imprisonment on the contemnor for such duration not exceeding three months. Again, the duration of civil imprisonment depends on the circumstances referred to above. \n74. Keeping in mind the above-said principles, this Court has examined the evidence and the proportionality of punishment imposed. \n74.1. Appellant No.1, holding a responsible position, used his position to induce other appellants to disobey the order. In the process, the appellant No.1 has shown utmost disrespect to the order of the Court and the disobedience committed is in the public domain as the injuncted tradename/trademark is published in electronic social media. As far as the contention based on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Surendranath is concerned, the same is an authority for the proposition that only in case of wilful disobedience; the Court will punish the wrongdoer. The materials placed on record demonstrate that the appellants wilfully disobeyed the order. Hence the judgment does not come to the aid of the appellants. \n74.2 In the case of PATEL RAJINIKANTH DHULABHAI supra, in paragraph number 77 it is held as under:\n77. We are also satisfied that the so-called apology is not an act of penitence, contrition or regret. It has been tendered as a \"tactful move\"\nwhen the contemnors are in the tight corner and with a view to ward off the Court. Acceptance of such apology in the case on hand would be allowing the contemnors to go away with impunity after committing gross contempt of Court. In our considered opinion, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the imposition of a fine in lieu of imprisonment will not meet the ends of justice. \n74.3. Now we may advert to the issue, whether appellants have complied with the order of injunction. The affidavit is filed on 17.04.2023 claiming compliance of the order dated 21.02.2019. However, the compliance of the order is disputed by the respondents. It is pointed out that one more application is filed under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code alleging further disobedience and the same is pending consideration before the Commercial Court. It is not necessary to express any opinion on the alleged continued disobedience of the order, as the same is required to be adjudicated by the Commercial Court. However, it is to be noticed that the alleged compliance dated 17.04.2023 has come too late in the day, four years after the interim order. Even the affidavit filed does not properly reflect remorse on the part of the contemnors. \n74.4. In the same judgment in PATEL RAJANIKANT DHULABHAI supra in paragraph No. 62, the Apex Court has extracted the observation of Lord Diplock in the celebrated decision of Attorney General v. Times Newspaper Ltd. [(1974) AC 273 : (1973) 3 All ER 54 : (1973) 3 WLR 298 (HL)] which reads as under. \n\"There is an element of public policy in punishing civil contempt since the administration of justice would be undermined if the order of any court of law could be disregarded with impunity.\"\n74.5. The public policy in punishing Civil Contempt is the same across all jurisdictions. None should carry the impression that the Court orders, even if disobeyed, will have no consequence. The binding Order of the Court must be obeyed not only with a sense of respect and duty but also with a sense of responsibility, and not just with a sense of subordination. \n74.6. This Court considering the parameters set out supra, has taken into account the nature of the violation, the manner in which the order is violated, repeated violation at multiple places, its wide publicity, and an element of deception found in the act, the high and responsible position of the appellant no.1, and his act in inducing the other appellants to flout the order of the Court. After considering these facts, though this Court is of the view that the Commercial Court is justified in ordering Civil imprisonment as far as appellant No.1, three months civil imprisonment ordered against appellant No.1 is unjustified. \n74.7. In the case of PATEL RAJNIKATH supra the Apex Court imposed civil imprisonment for 15 days. In the said case, the contemnor violated the interim order which prohibited him from alienating the property. In the instant case, the contemnors used the injuncted trade name/trade mark. Having due regard to the underlying philosophy of Order XXXIX Rule 2 A of the Code, discussed supra, and having regard to the age of appellant No.1, who is 63 years (as per the age mentioned in the affidavit dated 8.3.2022), this Court is of the view that three months civil imprisonment, imposed to appellant No.1, which is the maximum period allowed under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the Code is on the higher side. In the facts and circumstances of the case discussed above, this Court is of the view that the ends of justice would be met if appellant No.1 is directed to undergo civil imprisonment of 15 days. \n74.8. As far as appellants No.2 and 3 are concerned, it has to be noticed that their acts have to be analysed in a different yardstick given the fact that they were not parties to the proceeding when an interim order was passed. Appellant No.2 claims to be the Chief Executive Officer of the MAHE, and Appellant No.3 claims to be the Vice President of MAHE. Considering their positions in the institution it can be held that they are not part of the decision-making process of the Company. Nevertheless, they are very much aware that the order is passed against appellant No.1 restraining him from using the trade mark MAHE and MANIPAL GROUP and they were bound to respect the order of the Court. This being the position, the Court has to consider whether the act of appellants 2 and 3 in aiding and abetting the act of appellant no. 1 amounts to wilful disobedience of the Court Order. On analysis of evidence, it has to be held that appellants no. 2 and 3, though on their own accord did not disobey the order, certainly aided and abetted the appellant No.1, seemingly under the directions of appellant No. 1 who held a dominating position. \n74.9. However, taking into consideration the precarious position of appellants No.2 and 3, where appellant No.1 instructed them to continue to use the prohibited trade mark, and having regard to the parameters discussed in paragraph No.71, and keeping in mind that the primary underlying object of the provision preventive and curative, this Court is of the view that the order of civil imprisonment against the appellants No. 2 and 3 is disproportionate and unjustified and has to be set aside. \n74.10. Since the appellants are guilty of disobedience of the order passed by the Court, the Commercial Court, on securing the details of the properties of the appellants, shall attach the properties (to the extent required to realise the compensation) for a period of six months, and in case, the breach or disobedience continues at the expiry of six months, then the attached properties of the appellants, be sold and the compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- be paid to each of the plaintiffs from the sale of the properties of the appellant No.1, and Rs.50,000/- be paid to each of the plaintiffs from the sale of properties of each of the appellants No. 2 and 3.\n75. By way of a separate order, this Court has allowed the application at I.A.No.2/2023 seeking permission to raise additional grounds is allowed and those grounds are considered in this order. By way of a separate order, the application at I.A.No.3/2022 seeking the production of additional documents is rejected. \n76. Hence the following:\nORDER (a) The impugned order dated 28.09.2022 passed by X Additional District and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru Rural district, Bengaluru in Commercial Misc. No.246/2021 directing Civil imprisonment of appellants No.2, 3 is set aside. \n(b) The impugned order dated 28.09.2022 passed by X Additional District and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru Rural district, Bengaluru in Commercial Misc. No.246/2021 directing three months imprisonment of appellant No.1 is modified and appellant No.1 is ordered to undergo civil imprisonment of 15 days. \n(c) The properties of the appellants are to be attached for 6 months. \n(d) In case, the breach or disobedience continues at the expiry of six months, then the attached properties of the appellants be sold and compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- be paid to each of the plaintiffs from the sale of the properties of the appellant No.1, and Rs.50,000/- be paid to each of the plaintiffs from the sale of properties of each of the appellants No.2 and 3.\n(e) Since the details of the properties of the appellants are not furnished, the same shall be furnished to the Commercial Court to pass the necessary order as directed in clauses (c) and (d).\n(f) Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part as indicated above.\nSd/-\nJUDGE Sd/-\nJUDGE BRN/GVP",

(mel) was incorporated as coal based power project company initially promoted by the meenakshi engineering and infrastructure holdings ltd., subsequently a french company namely ng global development (bw) acquired 89 per cent of shares in mel and became the largest shareholders of the said company. several financial assistance by way of a loan, credits etc. were provided in different phases for development of the projects undertaken by the said company. subsequently, the french government decided to shift from generation of energy by any other mode to the renewable energy which led the said company which was a state based backed company to opt out from the said project which opened the path for the appellant to acquire the share held by the said french company at the cost of us $ 1. interestingly, the said french company further agreed to pay us $ 40 million to the appellant for completion of the transaction so that the same can be invested in the project with further infusion of usd $ 300 million before transfer of the shareholding of the appellant. after taking over all the majority shares, the appellant and the said mel approached the lenders who extended the financial assistance for approval of the transfer of shares held by the french company which was duly accorded on the condition that all the obligations held by the french company shall be taken over by the appellant by providing an undertaking and the corporate guarantee under the financial documents. pursuant to the said conditions imposed while according approval, the erstwhile director of the appellant submitted an affidavit dated september 23, 2016 certifying, declaring and confirming that the appellant is a distribution licensee in terms of the west bengal electricity regulatory commission (licensing and condition of license) regulations, 2019 and there is no necessity to obtain a prior permission or consent from the west bengal electricity regulatory commission for furnishing a corporate guarantee. simultaneously therewith a corporate guarantee was also executed which is the subject matter of the suit instituted by the appellant before the commercial court. even after such arrangements, the mel continued in defaulting the repayment of the debts which resulted into the classification of the account of mel as nonperforming assets. the respondent no. 1 in the capacity of an agent of the primary lender i.e., state bank of india recalled the loan so extended and demanded the payment within the stipulated time. since the entire shares were pledged, the invocation was made and the same were transmitted into a dematerialisation account of the agent. subsequently, the corporate guarantee was sought to be invoked, the appellant along with mel instituted a commercial suit being cos 266 of 2017 before the commercial court, city civil court, hyderabad seeking declaration that the deed of guarantee dated 23.9.2016 executed by the appellant be declared null and void having issued in contravention to the statutory provisions contained in the said regulation. however, the said suit was withdrawn without seeking any leave to file a fresh suit. the moment the lenders put an advertisement inviting the bid for change of the management of the mel, a writ application was filed before the high court of andhra pradesh being writ petition no. 26999 of 2018 wherein an interim order was passed that no coercive steps shall be taken by the lenders of the phase-i and ii against the appellant. interestingly, the said writ petition was subsequently withdrawn as it was dismissed as such. another writ petition was filed, simultaneously with the other writ petition which was subsequently withdrawn being wp 26977 of 2018, assailing the action of the respondents in transferring the equity shares without conducting the valuation thereof. initially an interim order was passed in the same tune and line that coercive step should not be taken but the same was later on vacated. in an another writ petition being no. 30048 of 2018 filed before the high court challenging the recall notice wherein an interim order was passed in the same tune that no coercive step shall be taken on the basis of such notice which was later on vacated on january 23, 2019. the order vacating an interim order was carried to an intra-court appeal before the said high court which was eventually dismissed. thereafter the proceeding under section 7 of the ibc code, 2016 was filed by the sbi against the mel before the national company law tribunal, hyderabad seeking a commencement of cirp which was duly admitted on november 7, 2009 with categorical finding that invocation of pledge did not amount to discharge of debt. the aforesaid fact was disclosed in the pending writ petitions before the high court of andhra pradesh and the interim order so passed therein was modified to the extent that the said interim order shall not put fetter in the way of the respondents from approaching the national company law tribunal for appropriate remedies taking recourse to law. amidst the pendency of the insolvency proceedings against the mel the appellant was served with a demand notice in respect of the aforesaid corporate guarantee and on failure thereof the sbi filed an application under section 7 of the ibc for initiation of cirp alleging that the default in respect of a corporate guarantee has been made. on the backdrop of the aforesaid facts, the appellant has filed the instant suit primarily for a decree of declaration that the contract of guarantee executed by the appellant company is null and void ab initio being in breach of regulation 5.13.2 of the west bengal electricity regulatory commission (licensing and condition of license) regulation, 2013 with further decree of declaration that the sale and transfer of the equity shares held by the appellant company in mel is not less than 4.406.50 crores and a mandatory injunction be passed to pay the said amount with interests to the plaintiff. though the commercial court passed ex-parte ad interim order of injunction at the initial stage, the tenet whereof has been succinctly narrated hereinbefore but on a contested hearing the commercial court rejected the application for temporary injunction which is a subject matter of appeal before us. at the very outset we must record the stand of the appellant so far as the allegation as to the transfer of shares into the de-mat account of the respondent no.1 is concerned, it is concededly submitted that in view of the judgments rendered by the supreme court in ptc india financial services ltd. vs. venkateswarlu kari & anr., reported in (2022) scc online sc 608 wherein it is held that resumption of shares into a demat account upon invocation of a contract of pledge does not tantamount to transfer, therefore, the aforesaid plea is not taken at this stage. the learned counsel for the appellant unequivocally submitted that the said plea has not been abandoned for all time to come but is not pressed for the present in view of the decision of the supreme court in the abovementioned judgment. we, therefore, do not delve to go into the aforesaid aspect and venture to decide the appeal on the other points urged before us. the learned advocate for the appellant is very much critical on the observation of the commercial court recorded in the impugned order that even after holding that the plaint clearly shows the cause of action and the dispute is required to be adjudicated on trial, it proceeds to hold that there is no prima facie case made out for the purpose of injunction. it is arduously contended that the cause of action is synonymous to a prima facie case and, therefore, there is an apparent inconsistency in the impugned order which needs interference. it is further contended that the moment the corporate guarantee is found to have been issued in violation of the statutory provisions such guarantee cannot be legally enforced being void ab initio and placed reliance upon a judgment of the apex court in case of mannalal khetan vs. kedar nath khetan, reported in air 1977 sc 536. it is further contended that the distinction is real between a prohibitary provisions and the restrictive provisions as in the former case any act forbidden by law is per se void and cannot be enforced before the court. it is further contended that there is no distinction, in law between a debt recovery proceedings and a proceeding for recovery of debt and, therefore, the proceeding under ibc may not be a typical debt recovery proceeding but have an avowed object of recovery of debt may be with an intent to keep the company alive by bringing back into a healthy financial state. it is further submitted that an application under order 7 rule 11 of the cpc filed by the respondent having dismissed by the trial court lead to an unequivocal conclusions that the proceeding is maintainable and, therefore, that the proceeding is otherwise barred under the law is not available at the stage of temporary injunction. according to the learned advocate for the appellant the trial court ought to have considered that the balance of convenience lies in passing a protective order as in the event the insolvency proceeding is allowed to continue the plaintiff would be non-suited because of the moratorium envisaged under section 14 of the ibc and the consequences to follow thereafter. it is further contended that there is a manifest perversity in the findings of the commercial court on the aspect of irreparable injury as it did not consider the consequence of the proceeding under ibc causing immense injury to the appellant without deciding all the issues involved in the suit. it is contended that when a serious question of fraud is pleaded in the plaint which unravels all the solemn act, protective order must be passed against the party as any act done during the pendency of the suit may invite an irreversible situation. in support of the same, the reliance is placed upon a judgment of the supreme court in case of agricultural produce marketing committee, bangalore vs. state of karnataka &ors. (civil appeal nos. 1345-1346 of 2022 decided on 22.3.2022) on the other hand, the contesting respondents while repelling the contention of the appellants submits that in view of the categorical statements made in paragraph 97 of the plaint the plaintiff themselves have indicated that do not want to forestall the hearing of a proceeding under section 7 of ibc but later on turned around and intended to seek the relief by way of preventive injunction which is impermissible in law. it is further contended that in view of the express embargo upon the civil court to entertain the suit, no injunction can be passed. it is further contended that the several proceedings initiated by the plaintiff could not yield the desired results and in fact, the identical suit filed before the commercial court, city civil court, hyderabad was later on withdrawn without seeking any leave to file a fresh on the self same cause of action or the reliefs. it is arduously submitted that the affidavit as well as the corporate guarantee issued by the appellant company through its erstwhile director categorically evinced that they were aware of a embargo under the aforesaid statutory rules but the said corporate guarantee was in relation to non regulated assets which according to the appellant does not come within the mischief of the said statutory provision. they cannot resile from their stand. according to the learned counsels there is a fallacy in the submission of the appellant that there is no apparent distinction between a cause of action and a prima facie case. even if the suit discloses the cause of action but for the purpose of granting a temporary injunction, there is no infirmity in the court to arrive at the findings that prima facie case for the purpose of passing the injunction has not been made out. it is emphatically submitted that the commercial court being not a superior court to nclt, cannot pass an order of injunction preventing a party from initiating a proceeding before nclt in view of the provisions contained under section 41(b) of the specific relief act and relied upon a judgment of the bombay high court in case of psl ltd., reported in 2018 scc online bombay 36. it is further contended that the ratio of the said bombay judgment has been reiterated and reinstated by the supreme court in forech (india) ltd. vs. edelweiss assets reconstruction co. ltd., reported in (2019) 18 scc 549. it is further submitted that there is a lack of pleadings in relation to a fraud, coercion or undue influence and, therefore, in absence thereof the court should not presume the existence of the same while granting a temporary injunction. the learned counsel submits that the reliance upon mannalal khetan (supra) is misplaced as the said decision is relatable to a situation concerning the transfer of shares and the interpretation of the provisions contained under section 108 of the companies act, 1956 and, therefore, has no application in the present context when the regulation simplicitor provides for a penalty. it is contended that a distinction has to be drawn between a prohibitary provision and a provision which requires an approval and invites the penalty without rendering the contract void or unenforceable. it is further submitted that the moment the appellant have taken a firm stand in the affidavit and the corporate guarantee as well as in the audited balance sheets that no permission is required for non-regulated asset, the appellant cannot be permitted to approbate and reprobate as the conduct of the parties seeking an injunction is also one of the relevant factors for granting injunction. on the conspectus of aforesaid submissions, let us decide whether the impugned order can be justified or needs interference. recently a trend is developed in the bar in interpreting the words used in common parlance in most different manner to inculcate a sense that the finding arrived by the court in judicial dispensation suffers from the several infirmities and reflects the mind of a judge in hind side which in our opinion does not reveal so. the words or expressions are segregated and projected in such a manner that the entire decision making process is vitiated and the order cannot stand on a well established principle of law. the words of insignificance is attempted to project the words or expression of vital importance in adjudicatory process with the rhetoric of reasoning which does not appear to be of any significant value. the words or the expressions divorced from the context should not be permitted to be agitated. every word so used have to be understood in juxtaposition with the context in which it is used and cannot be allowed to assign a different meaning treating the same as standalone words or expressions carrying a meaning which impinges the process of reasoning in the orders or judgments. every word is capable of more than one meaning given in the dictionary and it is an ardent duty of the court to find out its meaning in the perspective of the context in which it is used and not to assign a meaning perceived by the aggrieved litigant. the words or expressions which are commonly used having no bearing in adjudication of the dispute but merely an expression under the common parlance should not be permitted to interpret differently having no bearing on the core issue. in the instant case, the expression \"if any\" in relation to a reply filed by the party is critically examined by the learned counsel for the appellant in the sense that the learned judge in the court below was sceptical whether such reply are filed and taken on record. the aforesaid expression is sought to be interpreted as according to the counsel for the appellant gives an impression that the learned judge was not sure whether such reply is on record or even if such reply is on record may not have read it. the impugned order would reveal that the pleadings of the parties in relation to a temporary injunction, the opposition and the reply have been succinctly jotted down therein which by no stretch of imagination may inculcate a sense in the appellant that either the judge is not aware of such reply is on record nor the same has been read. the aforesaid expression cannot be permitted to be divorced from the context and/or the tenet of the order more particularly when it can be reasonably ascertained therefrom that the same has been taken note of and the crux of the pleading in reply is narrated extensively. the arguments should be restricted to a point involved in the proceeding emanating from the facts and law and it is not appreciated that the arguments are advanced using the interpretative process having no bearing thereupon. often the court faces a criticism from the bar that an ample opportunity to argue the matter has not been given yet, it is a corresponding duty of the bar to restrict the argument on the facts and law applicable in relation to a dispute and should not unnecessarily invest the time on an inconsequential and/or insignificant points, more particularly, on the words or expressions of common use as of seminal importance. it admits no ambiguity that language used in the judgments rendered by the court are not ordinarily read as a statute. the words or expressions used in the statute carries an intention of the legislature, its purpose and object and relevant in the subject for which it is enacted. the aforesaid observations have been made, though not relevant, but for the purpose of imparting a sense of responsibility amongst the members of the bar to restrict the argument on the issues involved in the proceeding and assist the court in arriving at the decision so that it can achieve the very object of avoiding the wastage of time in addressing such insignificant thing. the point which in essence involved in the instants appeal is whether the commercial court's order in rejecting an application for temporary injunction as a consequence whereupon the ad interim orders stood vacated, cannot be justified on the reasoning provided in the impugned order. the reliefs claimed in the plaint is essentially aimed against the contract of guarantee executed by the appellant no. 1 company in favour of the lenders as well as the security trustee being null and void ab initio and the price of the shares which are allegedly transferred in the record of the respondent no. 2 to the respondent no. 1 should be treated as a consideration due to the appellant no. 1 and a direction to pay the amount so determined along with an interest. it is thus a composite suit relating to a declaration in respect of a corporate guarantee and also recovery of sum with interest upon determining the reasonable price or the ascertained sum to the appellant no. 1. the substantive reliefs in relation to a corporate guarantee is basically founded on the assertion that the said guarantee being violative of regulation 5.13.2 of the west bengal electricity regulatory commission (licensing and condition of licence) regulations, 2013 is null and void ab initio and, therefore, any action or steps taken thereupon is impermissible in law. for the purpose of clarity, we must record that the other point relating to a transfer of shares and the price to be paid is not pressed, as indicated hereinbefore, by the appellant in view of the judgment of the apex court rendered in case of p.t.c (supra). it is a specific stand of the appellant that the appellant no. 1 being a distribution licensee engaged in a generation and/or distribution of the electricity are regulated by a statutory rules framed by the legislature and, therefore, any act or thing done in contravention thereto is per se illegal null and void ab initio. we have narrated the facts hereinbefore in relation to a several proceedings between the parties before the civil court, high court and nclt. it is manifest from the record that both the mel and the appellant no. 1 has been taken to the nclt for initiation of cirp under ibc and the matter is pending therein. a point has been taken by the respondents that for the self-same reliefs a suit was instituted in the commercial courts, the city civil court at hyderabad which was later on withdrawn without any leave to institute a suit for self-same reliefs debarred the appellants from instituting the instant suit under order 23 rule 1 of the code of civil procedure. a further plea is taken by the respondents that the nature of the temporary injunction sought in the instant proceeding is in effect impinges upon their right to take recourse to provisions of ibc before a proper form which is impermissible under section 41 (b) of the specific relief act. we are not oblivion of the proposition of law that the court while deciding the application for temporary injunction must travel within the parameters well accepted in the judicial parlance namely existence of prima facie case, balance of convenience and inconvenience and irreparable loss and injury. an argument is advanced by the appellant that the cause of action in a suit is synonymous to the existence of prima facie case and, therefore, in the event the court has found that the plaint discloses the cause of action it ipso facto lead to a presumption of existence of prima facie case. there is a fallacy in this regard as the cause of action and the existence of prima facie case are two distinct and separate aspects and cannot be blended or merged into one. the cause of action is neither defined in the statute nor in the constitutional provision but well understood to mean the bundle of facts pleaded by the party inviting the courts to determine the reliefs claimed therein. the disclosure of the cause of action cannot be read or construed in the perspective of the existence of a prima facie case being one of the important factors for granting an interim or temporary injunction pending final adjudication in the suit. the cause of action has to be understood in the perspective of a right to institute a suit and the reliefs claimed therein. though the cause of action may be an important factor at the time of considering the application for temporary injunction but cannot be equated with the existence of prima facie case. the object of passing a temporary injunction is to protect the right of the parties to the proceedings pending final adjudication upon a full-fledge trial and to prevent any mischief or dissipation of the property involved therein. any findings made in this regard do not necessarily mean that it would have a vital impact at the time of final disposal of the suit. technically, it somewhat partakes a character of a mini trial but that is not so as the findings are mere tentative and returned on the basis of the pleading and the documents produced by the respective parties which must stand on trial. the nature of finding made by the court at temporary injunction stage is prima facie in the sense that what appears from the existence of such document and the pleadings made therein if proved to be true but it does not dispense with proving such facts or the documents in trial. the cause of action, therefore, is important for the purpose of maintaining a proceeding and inviting the court to adjudicate the reliefs claimed therein; on the other hand, the temporary injunction is decided on an existence of prima facie case based upon such pleading and/or documents to be true and correct to stand on trial. because of the nature of the finding returned by the court in an application for temporary injunction, the legislature in their wisdom have provided the remedy by way of an appeal under section 104 and order 43 of the code of civil procedure. we, therefore, do not find any substance in the stand of the appellant that once the court has recorded that the plaint discloses the cause of action it leads to an inevitable conclusion that it discloses the existence of a prima facie case for the purpose of temporary injunction. admittedly, the appellant no. 1 gave corporate guarantee as the french company holding majority shares in mel decided to opt out from the project undertaken by the said outgoing concern. interestingly, after investing a substantial amount of money the french company agreed to forego all its right may be for the reason that the french government decided to invest on a renewable energy, upon payment of usd 1 with further stipulation that they would infuse further money and even pay 40 million usd to the appellant to be invested in the project of mel. though the counsels for the respondents are very much vocal on such issue as according to them even after receiving 40 million dollar from the french government, the same was not invested in mel but we do not intend to go into the aforesaid aspect as the explanation is also offered by the appellant in this regard. the facts remained that the french company while disassociating himself from the project of the mel offered to the appellant no. 1 to undertake such project which includes not only the assets belonging to said company but also to meet out the liability so that such project is not frustrated. the pleading would reveal that the lenders while considering such proposal of the french company and accepting the appellant no. 1 to acquire the entire shareholding of the said departed company indicated several conditions including the issuance of a corporate guarantee. it is not in dispute that the director of the appellant no. 1 gave a corporate guarantee to the lenders, conjointly or severally and continued to hold the management and the administration of the mel. an affidavit was also showrn by the director of the appellant no. 1 that there is no impediment in giving the corporate guarantee which is restricted to a nonregulated assets as the embargo created under aforesaid regulation is not applicable. it is contended by the appellant that the said corporate guarantee was obtained by inducing coercion, misrepresentation and/or commission of fraud as an opinion was sought by the lenders from the legal jurist which is unusual. according to him, the opinion has to be sought by the appellant company before it proceed to give a guarantee which appears to be reverse situation in this case. it is no doubt true that the fraud unravels all the solemn act and, therefore, is always viewed seriously when it is alleged in course of the proceedings. the person who alleges the fraud to have been committed by the other side must plead particulars of such fraud under the rule of pleading and procedures. mere using the word 'fraud' without any specification or particulars shown in the pleading may not be sufficient. the fraud has to be discerned in the transaction and the stand of the parties and the conduct in relation thereto. it cannot be applied abjunctly nor in abstract manner. two corporate entities who are well equipped to understand their commercial interests, entered into a transaction, the allegation as to fraud has to be understood keeping in mind the above aspect. it is quite improbable that the appellant no. 1 who acquired the majority shares in mel at usd 1 is induced to give a corporate guarantee. let us examine the implications and the effect of regulation 5.13.2 of the regulation 2013 which runs thus: \".5.13.2 the licensee shall obtain prior written consent from the commission in making any loans to, or issuing any guarantee for any obligation of any person which is beyond the normal area of business activities of the licensee in respect of its core activities. loan to the employees pursuant to the terms of services and advances to the suppliers etc. in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the requirement to seek such approval. if any affiliates of the licensee undertake any loan for which the licensee's business may be affected directly or indirectly then in such case licensee is required to obtain such written consent from the commission in a manner as already specified.\" it is manifest from the above quoted provision that the distribution of the licensee company are bound by the provisions contained under the said regulation which postulates that in making any loans or issuing any guarantee for any obligation beyond the normal area of business activities of the licensee in respect of its core activities is permissible after obtaining a prior written consent from the commission. the exception is also created therein relatable to the loans to the employees provided in the terms of the employment and services. a further mandate can be seen in the language used therein that in the event of any affiliates of the licensee undertake any loan which may affect directly or indirectly, its business then in such event the prior consent in writing from the commission is required . the appellant contends that in view of the embargo created under the aforesaid provision any guarantee given by the licensee or distribution company, be it corporate or otherwise, is per se null and void ab initio and does not create any enforceable right into a person in whose favour such guarantee was given. a distinction was sought to be made between a prohibition and restrictions attracting penalty without any consequence to follow otherwise. in case of an absolute prohibition the things done in derogation thereof may entail the act or the thing illegal and void. however, the situation would be different when the prohibition is not absolute but requires a prior consent in writing and the consequence by way of penalty is provided. the affidavit and the corporate guarantee if read harmoniously is explicit to the extent that the appellant no. 1 was conscious of such embargo having created and represented that a distinction in this regard is manifestly seen in the sense that there is no fetter in giving a corporate guarantee on a non-regulated assets as it has no impact on its business to be affected directly or indirectly. in fact there was no attempt made by the appellants unless it senses that lenders may invoke corporate guarantee because of the default having committed by the mel. the contents of the deed of guarantee dated 29th september, 2016 may be looked into in order to ascertain the stand of the appellant no. 1 in relation to the requirement under the aforesaid regulation. the nonregulated asset is defined to mean all assets of guarantor other than the regulated assets in the deed of guarantee. clause 2 thereof indicates that the guarantor furnished the said guarantee irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally to the phase i security trustees for the benefit of the phase i lenders with clear stipulation that the guarantor shall forthwith pay from non-regulated assets to phase i lenders without demur or protest or without the right of any set of, deductions or adjustment of any kind whatsoever. even clause 27 makes the obligation more clear that in order to perform the obligation of guarantee the non-regulated asset shall be utilized. clause 12 of the deed of guarantee which contained the broad head \"liability not affected\" manifestly indicate that it would not be so effected by any illegality, invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any part of the guarantee obligations. the appellant no. 1 further made representation and gave warrantees under clause 7 of the deed of guarantee that there is no contravention of the regulations or the laws in the following: \"(v) no contravention: the execution, delivery and performance of this guarantee and all instruments and agreements required hereunder do not and would not contravene, violate or constitute a default under (a) any applicable law; (b) any provision of any constitution document of the guarantor; (c) any corporate authorisations of the guarantor; (d) any provision of any agreement or other instrument to which the guarantor is a party or by which the guarantor or any of its assets is or may be bound; (e) any treaty, law or regulation applicable to the guarantor; or (f) any judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon the guarantor or any of its assets.\" the affidavit shown by the director of the appellant no. 1 would evince that the appellants were conscious that such guarantee would be regulated by the provisions contained therein but the same is not required as such guarantee is restricted to a non-regulated assets in the following: \"3. that in relation to change in shareholding of mepl and in accordance with the terms of common loan agreement, ipcl as the new promoter of mepl is required to furnish a corporate guarantee in favour of the phase i lenders (\"corporate guarantee\"). 4. that, i hereby certify, declare and confirm on behalf of ipcl that ipcl is a distribution licensee in terms of the west bengal electricity regulatory commission (licensing and conditions of licensee) regulation, 2013, and it is not required to obtain the prior consent of the west bengal electricity regulatory commission for issuing the corporate guarantee in accordance with terms thereof.\" the appellant vociferously contended that the contract of guarantee issued in violation of the statutory provisions has always been recognized as an illegal act and, therefore void as held in mannalal khetan (supra) in the following: \"7. therefore, in the present case, the contract of guarantee is squarely hit by section 23 of the contract act, being contrary to another statutory provision i.e. the wberc regulation. (reliance: mannala lkhetan vs. kedarnath khetan air 1977 sc 536), in which it was held as under: 19. where a contract, express or implied, is expressly or by implication forbidden by statute, no court will lend its assistance to give it effect. (see milliss v. shirley local board, (1885) 16 qbd 446). a contract is void if prohibited by a statute under a penalty, even without express declaration that the contract is void, because such a penalty implies a prohibition. the penalty may be imposed with intent merely to deter persons from entering into the contract or for the purposes of revenue or that the contract shall not be entered into so as to be valid at law. a distinction is sometimes made between contracts entered into with the object of committing an illegal act and contracts expressly or impliedly prohibited by statute. the distinction is that that in the former class one has only to look and see what acts the statute prohibits; it does not matter whether or not it prohibits a contract; if a contract is made to do a prohibited act, that contract will be unenforceable. in the latter class, one has to consider what act the statute prohibits, but what contracts it prohibits. one is not concerned at all with the intent of the parties, if the parties enter into a prohibited contract, that contract is enforceable. (see st. john shipping corporation v. joseph bank, (1957) 1 qb 267). (see also halsbury's laws of england third edition vol. 8, p. 141). 20. it is well established that a contract which involves in its fulfilment the doing of an act prohibited by statute is void. the legal maxim a pactisprivatorum public juri non derogatur means that private agreements cannot alter the general law. where a contract, express or implied, is expressly or by implication forbidden by statute, no court can lend its assistance to give it effect. (see melliss v. shirley local board, (1885) 16 qbd 446). what is done in contravention of the provisions of an act of the legislature cannot be made the subject of an action. 21. if anything is against w though it is not prohibited in the statute but only a penalty is annexed is void. in every case where a statute inflicts a penalty for doing an act, though the act be not prohibited, yet the thing is unlawful, because it is not intended that a statute would inflict a penalty for a lawful act. 22. penalties are imposed by statute for two distinct purposes (1) for the protection of the public against fraud, or for some other object of public policy; (2) for the purpose of securing certain sources of revenue either to the state or to certain public bodies. if it is clear that a penalty is imposed by statute for the purpose of preventing something from being done on some ground of public policy, the thing prohibited, if done, will be treated as void, even though the penalty is imposed is not enforceable. 23. the provisions contained in section 108 of the act are for the reasons indicated earlier mandatory. the high court erred in holding that the provisions are directory.\" the law expounded in the above noted report is explicit in the sense that where the contract is expressly or by necessary implication is prohibited by a statute, no effect shall be given to such a contract as what is forbidden in law cannot get a recognition in the court of law. the concept of imposition of the penalty with regard to an act prohibited by a statute would render such contract unenforceable and may be regarded as an unlawful act but in order to ascertain whether such contract is absolutely prohibited or prohibition can be seen from the act of the parties and a consequence to follow are essentially a question of fact requires an adjudication upon a fullfledged trial. for the purpose of ascertaining the implication of law laid down in mannalal khetan (supra) the subsequent judgment of the supreme court rendered in case of boi finance ltd. vs. custodian & ors. may be looked into. the apex court after analyzing the act of a party vis-à-vis the third party held that even if non-compliance may attract prosecution or levy of penalty under the substantive provision in this case section 142 of the electricity act, it may not render the contract with the third party invalid in the following: \"33. the aforesaid principles will clearly be applicable in the present case as well. the non-compliance of the directions issued by the reserve bank may result in prosecution/or levy of penalty under section 46, but it cannot result in invalidation of any contract by the bank with the third party. if the contention of the custodian is accepted it will result in invalidation of agreements by the banks, even where the third parties may not be aware of the directions which are being violated. to give an example if the reserve bank by confidential circulars fixes the limit in excess of which the banks cannot give any loan but, without informing the third party, the bank while exceeding its limit gives a loan which is then utilised by the bank's customer. it will be inequitable and improper to hold that as the directions of the reserve bank had not been complied with by the bank, the grant of loan cannot be regarded as valid and, as a consequence thereof, the customer must return the amount received even though he may have utilised the same in his business. yet another instance maybe where the bank advances loan by charging interest at a rate lower than the minimum which may have been fixed by the reserve bank, in a direction issued under section 36 (1)(a). as far as the customer is concerned, it may not be aware of the direction fixing the minimum rate of interest. can it be said, in such a case, that the advance of loan itself was illegal or that the bank would be entitled to receive the higher rate of interest? in our opinion it will be wholly unjust and inequitable to hold that such transactions entered into by the bank with a customer, which transactions are otherwise not invalid, can be regarded as void because the bank did not follow the directions or instructions issued by the reserve bank of india. 34. the instructions which were issued by the said circulars were meant to be complied with by the banking companies only and did not purport to, nor could they, be binding on the third parties. this being so, even if the appellant banks had been prohibited from entering into the buy-back arrangements in question, that by itself, would not invalidate the contracts though the infringement of the said directions may lead to action being taken under section 46 of the act.\" in view of the law expounded hereinabove mere non-compliance of the requirement under the statutory provisions attracting prosecution or levy of penalty does not render the contract void or invalid in relation to a third party. thus the stand of the appellant that the entire contract is vitiated having rendered null or void ab initio, is not acceptable. furthermore, in view of the specific stand taken by the appellant that the corporate guarantee in relation to a non-regulated assets are beyond the mischief of the said regulation is essentially a fact to be decided in the suit itself based upon the evidence to be adduced by the parties in this regard. the aforesaid observations are made for the simple reason that the appellant all along stood, before the issues are raised with the regulatory authorities, that the said prohibitory clause under the regulations in relation to a non-regulated assets which forms part of the corporate guarantee is kept outside the purview thereof. the appellant has construed the said provision while furnishing the corporate guarantee, that the nonregulated assets has no impact directly or indirectly on the licensees business and, therefore, it does not come under the mischief of the aforesaid provision. regulation 5.13.2 envisages that a prior written consent from the commission is to be obtained by the licensee in making any loan or issuing any guarantee for any obligation which is beyond the normal area of business activities in respect of its core activities. the appellant has interpreted the aforesaid provisions that the non-regulated assets as defined in the corporate guarantee shall mean all assets of the guarantor other than the regulated assets. the said corporate guarantee further defines the regulated assets to mean all the revenues and receivables of the business and operations of the dishargarh electrical license. it is essentially a question of fact whether the guarantee in respect of a non-regulated asset is beyond the core activities of the licensee or within the core activities of the licensee. the moment the promises are made to a third party by way of a corporate guarantee who acted thereupon is required to be viewed in this regard. the pleadings of the party and the stand taken therein are the factors to be taken into account as the party cannot make a departure therefrom as held in bacchaj nahar vs. nilima mandal & anr., reported in (2008) 17 scc 491 in the following: \"12. the object and purpose of pleadings and issues is to ensure that the litigants come to trial with all issues clearly defined and to prevent cases being expanded or grounds being shifted during trial. its object is also to ensure that each side is fully alive to the questions that are likely to be raised or considered so that they may have an opportunity of placing the relevant evidence appropriate to the issues before the court for its consideration. this court has repeatedly held that the pleadings are meant to give to each side intimation of the case of the other so that it may be met, to enable courts to determine what is really at issue between the parties, and to prevent any deviation from the course which litigation on particular causes must take. 13. the object of issues is to identify from the pleadings the questions or points required to be decided by the courts so as to enable parties to let in evidence thereon. when the facts necessary to make out a particular claim, or to seek a particular relief, are not found in the plaint, the court cannot focus the attention of the parties, or its own attention on that claim or relief, by framing an appropriate issue. as a result the defendant does not get an opportunity to place the facts and contentions necessary to repudiate or challenge such a claim or relief. therefore, the court cannot, on finding that the plaintiff has not made out the case put forth by him, grant some other relief. the question before a court is not whether there is some material on the basis of which some relief can be granted. the question is whether any relief can be granted, when the defendant had no opportunity to show that the relief proposed by the court could not be granted. when there is no prayer for a particular relief and no pleadings to support such a relief, and when the defendant has no opportunity to resist or oppose such a relief, if the court considers and grants such a relief, it will lead to miscarriage of justice. thus it is said that no amount of evidence, on a plea that is not put forward in the pleadings, can be looked into to grant any relief.\" even apart there was an unequivocal promise of the corporate guarantor and acts and things have been done thereupon in relation to a transaction with the third party, the estopple by such promise or representation has to be viewed in the perspective of the equitable principles which can be discerned from the decision of the supreme court in state of jharkand & ors. vs. brahmputra metallics ltd., reported in (2022) 7 scc 323 in the following: \"35. this court has given an expansive interpretation to the doctrine of promissory estoppel in order to remedy the injustice being done to a party who has relied on a promise. in motilal padampat (supra), this court viewed promissory estoppel as a principle in equity, which was not hampered by the doctrine of consideration as was the case under english law. this court, speaking through justice p.n.bhagabati (as he was then), held thus: \"12.having regard to the general opprobrium to which the doctrine of consideration has been subjected by eminent jurists, we need not be unduly anxious to project this doctrine against assault or erosion nor allow it to dwarf or stultify the full development of the equity of promissory estoppel or inhibit or curtail its operational efficacy as a justice device for preventing injustice. we do not see any valid reason why promissory estoppel should not be allowed to found a cause of action where, in order to satisfy the equity, it is necessary to do so.\" h.4 from estoppel to expectations 36. under english law, the doctrine of promissory estoppel has developed parallel to the doctrine of legitimate expectations. the doctrine of legitimate expectations is founded on the principles of fairness in government dealings. it comes into play if a public body leads an individual to believe that they will be a recipient of a substantive benefit. the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation has been explained in r v. north and east devon health authority, ex p coughlan in the following terms: \"55. but what was their legitimate expectation?\" where there is a dispute as to this, the dispute has to be determined by the court, as happened in in re findlay. this can involve a detailed examination of the precise terms of the promise or representations made, the circumstances in which the promise was made and the nature of the statutory or other discretion. . 56. where the court considers that a lawful promise or practice has induced a legitimate expectation of a benefit which is substantive, not simply procedural, authority now establishes that here too that court will in a proper case decide whether to frustrate the expectation is so unfair that to take a new and different course will amount to an abuse of power. here, once the legitimacy of the expectation is established, the court will have the task of weighing the requirements of fairness against any overriding interest relied upon for the change of policy.\" a further plea has been taken herein that what is intended by the appellant in the instant suit is to forestall the proceedings initiated before the nclt having a direct or indirect impact on the cirp and, therefore, hit by the provisions of 41(b) of the specific relief act. there is no quarrel to the proposition of law that the power or jurisdiction exercised by the nclt under ibc cannot be regarded as a forum subordinate or inferior to the civil court. such settled proposition of law need not be dealt with in extenso as we do not find any ambiguity in this regard. section 41(b) of the specific relief act contained a negative language that the injunction may be refused nor can be granted to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in court not subordinate to that forum for which the injunction is sought. it is manifest from the aforesaid provision containing a negative language that the court cannot pass an order of injunction restraining a party from instituting or prosecuting any proceedings pending in different fora which is not subordinate to that jurisdiction of the court. the court which does not have a supervisory or a superintendence as a court of superior jurisdiction is denuded of power to issue any injunction against a person from taking recourse to law in a different forum not inferior or subordinate to it as held by the division bench of this court in bhagwandas auto finance ltd. & ors. vs. citicorp finance (india) ltd., reported in air 2009 cal 231 held in: \"9. in the case before us, the learned judge, city civil court has granted an ad interim order of injunction restraining the appellants from giving effect to the notice dated january 7, 2009 issued by the appellants threatening prosecution of the respondent with both civil and criminal litigation for the alleged forgery committed by the plaintiff. in substance, by virtue of the order of injunction granted by the learned trial judge, the appellants are restrained from filing a civil suit before the city civil court or before the original side of this court for avoiding the alleged agreement between the parties and at the same time, are also restrained from initiating any criminal prosecution against the respondent. it may not be out of place to mention here that even according to the plaint case, the alleged agreements between the parties were executed in the office of the plaintiff within the territorial jurisdiction of the city civil court at calcutta or within the original side of this court, the plaintiff is also carrying on business within the said jurisdiction and at the same time, the notice dated january 7, 2009 was issued by a lawyer having office within the territorial limit of the above court. therefore, now if the appellants want to file any civil suit against the respondent for avoiding the alleged agreements, such civil litigation should be filed either in the city civil court or in the original side of this court depending upon the valuation of the proceedings. however, in such circumstances, the order impugned has really restrained the appellants from filing a civil suit either in a coordinate jurisdiction or in a superior jurisdiction clearly violating clause (d) of the said section by restraining the appellant from initiating a criminal proceedings.\" we do not find any substance in the stand of the appellant on an apparent distinction between money recovery proceedings and a proceeding for recovery of money. the coinage of the expression does not make any substantial distinction in relation to a proceedings initiated before the nclt under ibc. it has been categorically held by the supreme court in invent asset securitisation and reconstruction pvt. ltd. vs girnarfibres ltd., reported in 2022 scc online sc 808 that a proceeding before the nclt is not a money recovery proceeding as it intended to invoke the provisions of the code so as to enforce the recovery against the corporate debtor. though it sought to achieve a purpose of enforcing the recovery against the corporate debtor yet the various provisions of the ibc would indicate that it cannot be regarded as a money recovery proceedings nor a proceeding for recovery of money as the fall out on failure to honour the obligations may invite several consequences including insolvency, appointment of resolution professional, revival of the company and so on and so forth. it takes to another point that the appellant filed the suit before the commercial court, city civil court at hyderabad for the same reliefs which was subsequently withdrawn without any leave obtained from the court required under order 23 rule 1 of the cpc. the aforesaid provisions of the code postulate that in the event the appellant abandons any suit or a part of a claim without seeking any permission to institute a fresh suit in respect of a subject matter of such suit, he shall not only be liable to cost as a court may award but shall be precluded from instituting any fresh suit in respect of such subject matter or such part of the claim. but in order to attract the aforesaid embargo created under the aforesaid provision, it is to be ascertained whether the cause of action and the reliefs claimed therein are identical with those in the subsequent suit and in the event it is found that the cause of action has been similar and identical to the suit which was withdrawn without any leave or permission, the same would attract mischief under aforesaid provision relating to the maintainability of the said suit (see ballavh vs. madanlal air 1970 sc 987). in order to attract the aforesaid provision, the pleadings filed in the earlier litigations and the issues involved therein are required to be seen. since the application for rejection of the plaint has been dismissed by the court and the said order is still operative having not interfered by a higher forum, it would not be proper to make any observations thereupon at this stage. both the counsels are very much critical on the averments made in the paragraph made in the plaint wherein it has been categorically averred that the said suit is not intended to challenge any measure taken or intended to be taken by the lenders under the various acts for recovery of the money and is only restricted to the recovery of the proceeds of the sale and transfer of the shares of the appellant no. 1 in respondent no. 21 to the respondent no. 1 because of the malicious and fraudulent action of the respondent or each of them against the appellants. we have already discussed in the preceding paragraphs that the reliefs couched in such a fashion would indicate that not only the appellant seeks declaration in relation to a corporate guarantee being null and void ab initio but also a declaration that the transfer of the said share cannot be done without ascertaining the reasonable price or the ascertained sum. such being the pleading in essence does not manifestly appear to have forestalled the proceedings before the nclt nor the court was invited to pass an order of injunction in this regard. the moment the appellants have taken a specific stand, subsequent variation may operate as an obstacle in contending so as the parties are bound by their own pleadings and cannot be permitted to approbate and reprobate at the same time. though it has been vociferously contended by the appellant that the pleading has to be read in its entirety and it is not permissible to segregate or divorce some portion therefrom which suits the other side but upon reading the pleading so made in paragraph 97, it leaves no ambiguity that the appellants were of the view that they do not intend to forestall the ongoing proceeding under the ibc before the nclt. although we have made certain observations as the arguments are advanced by the respective counsels but that would be regarded as a mere prima facie observations as we have held that the injunction of such nature cannot be passed in view of the embargo created under section 41 (b) of the specific relief act. we, thus, do not find any infirmity and/or illegality in the order. the appeal is thus dismissed. no order as to costs. urgent photostat certified copies of this judgment, if applied for, be made available to the parties subject to compliance with requisite formalities. i agree.
