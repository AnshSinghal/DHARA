Singh\nPrathiba M. Singh, J. (Oral) \n1. This hearing has been done through hybrid mode. \n2. The present suit is one seeking permanent injunction restraining the Defendant from infringement of trademark, passing off, unfair competition, rendition of accounts of profits/damages, delivery up and other reliefs. The Plaintiff's case is that the defendant is infringing upon its registered trademark 'Letroz' by using the mark 'Letero' in respect of its medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations. \n3. Before the matter could be heard on merits, a query was put to the ld. counsel for the Plaintiff as to how the present suit would be maintainable in as much as for this very trademark, an earlier suit being Cs (Comm.) No. 300 of 2019 titled Sun Pharma Laboratories Ltd. v. Hetero Healthcare Ltd. & Anr., has already been filed by the Plaintiff against the same very Defendants before the ld. Adj-02, North West District, Rohini Courts, New This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 Delhi (hereinafter \"Trial Court\"), and the same is still pending. \n4. Mr. Sachin Gupta, ld. counsel for the Plaintiff, submits that though the said suit being Cs (Comm.) No. 300 of 2019 was filed in 2017, more than 5 years have passed and no orders have been passed in the interim injunction application in the said suit. He further submits that the judicial officers presiding over the Trial Court were being changed from time to time. He submits that orders on the injunction application were once reserved on 20th October, 2018, but the same was released vide order dated 7th January, 2019, upon the change of the Judicial Officer. The Plaintiff is also stated to have withdrawn its injunction application before the Trial Court and filed a fresh application, once, in 2019 due to the Defendant's objection that the prayer did not mention the word \"passing off\".\n5. Today, Mr. Gupta, ld. Counsel, submits that every sale by the Defendants constitutes a fresh cause of action and thus, despite the pendency of the first suit before the ld. Adj, the present suit before this Court would also be maintainable in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Bengal Waterproof Ltd. v. Bombay Waterproof Manufacturing Company, (1997) 1 Scc 99. Ld. Counsel refers to the cause of action in both suits and submits that since no interim injunction has been granted in the earlier suit, the continuous use of the infringing mark by the Defendants, constitutes a fresh cause of action for the Plaintiff. \n6. On the other hand, Mr. Ajay Sahni, ld. counsel appearing for the Defendants, submits that the judgment of the Supreme Court in Bengal Waterproof (supra) cannot be read in the manner it has been read by the Plaintiff. The cause of action in both suits is identical. The earlier suit is in fact part-heard before the District Court in the fresh injunction application, This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 as recorded in the order dated 30th March, 2021, and filing of the present suit in another Court is a gross abuse of process. He relies upon the following decisions:\n Prapti Fashions Private Limited and Ors. v. Manoj Kumar Gupta, 2013 (55) Ptc 234 (Cal).\n Hari Ram v. Lichmaniya & Ors., Air 2003 Raj. 319.  Ranbir Singh v. Dalbir Singh & Ors., Cs(Os) 802/2002, decision dated 19th December, 2008 (Delhi High Court).  Vijay Kumar Gupta v. State of West Bengal [Slp (Crl.) 10951 of 2019, decided on 22nd March, 2022]\n7. Heard. The Court has perused the two plaints and at the outset, notes the following:\n(i) In the first suit pending before the Commercial Court, the Plaintiff is Sun Pharma Laboratories Limited and the Defendants are Hetero Healthcare Limited and Hetero Labs Limited. The parties in the second suit before this Court are identical. \n(ii) The cause of action in the first suit reads as under:\n\"25. The cause of action for institution of the present suit arose on 30th November, 2017, when the Plaintiff's representative came across the Defendant's medicine under the impugned mark selling at a drug store falling within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. The said cause of action is a continuous one and continues to subsist till the Defendant is restrained by an order of injunction passed by this Hon'ble Court.\" \n(iii) The cause of action in the second suit reads as under:\n\"40. The cause of action first arose in the 4th week of November, 2017 when the impugned medicine under This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 the impugned mark Letero was found selling at Delhi. Immediately, thereafter on 02.12.2017, the Plaintiff filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining infringement of trade mark, passing off, etc. before the Rohini District Court (North West), New Delhi, which was numbered as Sun Pharma Laboratories Ltd. Vs Hetero Healthcare Ltd. & Anr., CS(Comm.) No.300 of 2019. The Defendants are continuing to use the impugned mark Letero and every act of Defendant is amounting to infringement, thereby giving a fresh cause of action. Therefore, the said cause of action if continuing. The said cause of action is a continuous one and continues to subsist till further manufacturing and marketing of the impugned medicine is injuncted by this Hon'ble Court.\" \n(iv) The relief prayed in the first suit is as under:\n\"28. It is therefore, most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to grant the following reliefs in favour of the Plaintiff and against the Defendants:\n(a) A decree for permanent injunction restraining the Defendants, their directors, assignees in business, distributors, dealers, stockists, retailers/chemists, servants and agents from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, directly or indirectly dealing in medicinal preparations under the impugned mark Letero or any other trade mark as may be deceptively similar to the Plaintiff's registered trade mark Letroz amounting to infringement of trade mark registered under No. 2037862 of the Plaintiff;\n(b) A decree for permanent injunction restraining the Defendants, their directors, their assignees in business, distributors, dealers, stockists, retailers/chemists, servants and agents from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, directly or indirectly dealing in medicinal preparations under the impugned trade mark This is a digitally signed Judgement.\nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 Letero or any other trade mark as may be deceptively similar with Plaintiff Letroz trade mark amounting to passing off of the Defendants' goods and business for those of the Plaintiff;\n(c) An order for delivery of the infringing goods of the Defendants including impugned packaging, promotional materials, stationery, dyes, blocks etc. bearing the impugned trade mark Letero to an authorised representative of the Plaintiff for destruction/erasure;\n(d) an order for rendition of accounts of profit illegally earned by the Defendants and a decree for an amount so found due;\n(e) An order for costs in the proceedings;\nAnd further orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper under the facts and circumstances of the present case.\"\n(v) The relief sought in the present suit is as under:\n\"45. It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to grant the following reliefs in favour of the Plaintiff and against the Defendants:\na. A decree for permanent injunction restraining the Defendants, their directors, assignees in business, distributors, dealers, stockists, retailers/ chemists, servants and agents from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, directly or indirectly dealing in medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations under the impugned mark Letero or any other trade mark as may be deceptively similar to the Plaintiff's registered trade mark Letroz amounting to infringement of Plaintiff's registered trade mark under no. 2037862;\nb. A decree for permanent injunction restraining the Defendants, their directors, their assignees in business, distributors, dealers, stockists, retailers/chemists, servants and agents from This is a digitally signed Judgement.\nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, directly or indirectly dealing in medicinal preparations under the impugned trade mark Letero or any other trade mark as may be deceptively similar to the Plaintiff's trade mark Letroz, amounting to passing off of the Defendant's goods and business for those of the Plaintiff's;\nc. An order for delivery of the infringing goods of the Defendants including impugned packaging, promotional materials, stationery, dyes, blocks etc. bearing the impugned mark Letero to an authorised representative of the Plaintiff for destruction/erasure;\nd. A decree for token damages to the tune of Inr 2,00,01,000/- or in the alternative, rendition of accounts of profits illegally earned by the Defendant and amount so found due;\ne. An order for cost of the proceedings; f. Any further orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper under the facts and circumstances of the present case.\"\n8. A perusal of the above two suits would show that:\n(i) the parties in both cases are identical;\n(ii) the trademarks are identical;\n(iii) the rights being asserted are identical i.e., infringement, passing off, etc.; and\n(iv) the cause of action is also identical. \n9. The only difference between the two suits is that in the first suit before the Commercial Court, an order for rendition of accounts of profit and a decree for the amount found due has been sought. However, in the suit before this Court, damages to the tune of Inr 2,00,01,000/- has been sought. Apart from this, there is no perceptible difference between the two suits. \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212\n10. The justification sought to be given by the Plaintiff for preferring the present suit is the delay being caused in the adjudication of even an interim application in the first suit filed by the Plaintiff before the Commercial Court in December, 2017. With regard to this submission, the Court has also perused the order sheet of the said suit before the Commercial Court. The same shows that:\n On 3rd January, 2018, summons was issued in the said suit.  By March, 2018, the pleadings were completed and certain technical objections were taken in the replication.  On 4th July, 2018, the matter was adjourned for hearing on the injunction application. \n On 20th October, 2018, arguments were heard on the injunction application and the matter was adjourned for orders by Mr. Siddharth Mathur, Ld. Adj-02 (North-West), Rohini Courts, Delhi. \n On 28th November, 2018, again the matter was adjourned for clarification and orders. No orders were pronounced.  On 7th January, 2019, the matter was listed for re-arguments.  Again, on 25th February, 2019, the matter was listed for re-\narguments on the injunction application.  On 30th July, 2019, another Judicial Officer listed the matter on 24th October, 2019 for hearing on the injunction application. Notably, by this time, the Judicial Officer, to whom this suit was assigned, had been changed. The matter was listed before various Judicial Officers after that. \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212  On subsequent dates being 24th October, 2019 and 16th December, 2019, the parties sought adjournments.  Thereafter, on 2nd December, 2020, a fresh application for interim injunction was filed by the Plaintiff and the old injunction application was withdrawn. \n The matter was partially heard on 3rd March, 2021 on the fresh interim injunction application. \n The matter was adjourned on the next few dates, upon counsels' requests or otherwise. An application for early hearing was also filed by the Plaintiff around February, 2022.  However, thereafter on 10th March, 2022, the Plaintiff sought an adjournment for filing of an application under Order Vi Rule 17 Cpc and the matter was adjourned to 12th April, 2022. \n11. In view of this fact situation and in view of the ratio of the decision of the Supreme Court in Bengal Waterproof (supra), the question is whether the delay in the adjudication of the interim injunction application in the first suit, would justify the filing of the present suit. \n12. The Plaintiff has relied upon the decision in Bengal Waterproof (supra), to support its submissions that this suit is maintainable as a new cause of action arises with every fresh sale of the infringing product. In Bengal Waterproof (supra), a suit was filed by the plaintiff in 1980, which was dismissed on 9th April, 1982. In 1982, after the dismissal of the first suit, a second suit was filed by the plaintiff on the ground that the defendant continued to use the trademark 'Dackback' thereby infringing the plaintiff's trademark 'Duckback' despite having been served with two legal notices. The Trial Court dismissed the second suit on the ground of res This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 judicata and Order Ii Rule 2 Cpc. The ld. Single Judge of the High Court agreed with the plaintiff on merits of their case for infringement, but held that the second suit was barred under Order Ii Rule 2 Cpc. The High Court held that the suit would not be barred under res judicata. The finding on merits was not challenged by the defendant before the Supreme Court. Therefore, the only question before the Supreme Court was whether the second suit was maintainable. The observations of the Supreme Court are set out below:\n\"12....Wherever and whenever fresh deceitful act is committed the person deceived would naturally have a fresh cause of action in his favour. Thus every time when a person passes off his goods as those of another he commits the act of such deceit. Similarly whenever and wherever a person commits breach of a registered trade mark of another he commits a recurring act of breach or infringement of such trade mark giving a recurring and fresh cause of action at each time of such infringement to the party aggrieved. It is difficult to agree how in such a case when in historical past earlier suit was disposed of as technically not maintainable in absence of proper reliefs, for all times to come in future defendant of such a suit should be armed with a licence to go on committing fresh acts of infringement and passing off with impunity without being subjected to any legal action against such future acts. We posed a question to the learned Counsel for the defendants as to whether after the disposal of the earlier suit if the defendants had suspended their business activities and after a few years had resumed the same and had started selling their goods under the trade mark 'Dackback' by passing them off , the plaintiff could have been prohibited and prevented by the bar of Order 2 Rule 2 Sub-rule (3) from filing a fresh suit in future when such future infringement or passing off took place. He rightly and fairly stated that such a suit would not be barred. But his only grievance This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 was that whatever was the infringement or passing off alleged against the defendants in 1980 had, according to the plaintiff, continued uninterrupted and, therefore, in substance the cause of action in both the suits was identical. It is difficult to agree. In cases of continuous causes of action or recurring causes of action bar of Order 2 Rule 2 Sub-rule (3) cannot be invoked. In this connection it is profitable to have a look at Section 22 of the Limitation Act, 1963. It lays down that 'in the case of a continuing breach of contract or in the case of a continuing tort, a fresh period of limitation begins to run at every moment of the time during which the branch or the tort, as the case may be, continues. As act of passing off is an act of deceit and tort every time when such tortious act or deceit is committed by the defendant the plaintiff gets a fresh cause of action to come to the court by appropriate proceedings. Similarly infringement of a registered trade mark would also be a continuing wrong so long as infringement continues. therefore, whether the earlier infringement has continued or a new infringement has taken place cause of action for filing a fresh suit would obviously arise in favour of the plaintiff who is aggrieved by such fresh infringements of trade mark or fresh passing off actions alleged against the defendant. Consequently, in our view even on merits the learned Trial Judge as well as the learned Single Judge were obviously in error in taking the view that the second suit of the plaintiff in the present case was barred by Order 2 Rule 2 Sub-rule (3), Cpc.\" \n13. A perusal of the above would show that the Supreme Court was persuaded by the fact that the earlier suit was disposed of as technically not maintainable in the absence of proper reliefs. Such a dismissal of a suit on technical grounds, as per the decision in Bengal Waterproof (supra), would not come in the way of a fresh suit being filed and being maintained for all times to come in the future. The dismissal of a suit cannot be treated by the defendant as a license to continue the infringement and passing off. Thus, This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 the present case is completely distinguishable from the facts in Bengal Waterproof (supra). Herein, the first suit filed by the plaintiff is still pending. The cause of action in the second suit relates to 2017 which is the same cause of action as in the first suit. Moreover, the adjudication on merits in the first suit is yet to take place. \n14. On the other hand, the Defendants have relied upon the following judgments:\n Hari Ram v. Lichmaniya & Ors., Air 2003 Raj. 319.  Ranbir Singh v. Dalbir Singh & Ors., Cs(Os) 802/2002, decision dated 19th December, 2008. \n Prapti Fashions Private Limited and Ors. v. Manoj Kumar Gupta, 2013 (55) Ptc 234 (Cal).\n Vijay Kumar Gupta v. State of West Bengal [Slp (Crl.) 10951 of 2019, decided on 22nd March, 2022]. \n15. The first two judgments relied upon by Mr. Sahni, ld. counsel, again relate to completely different fact situations. Both relate to immovable property and whether a subsequent suit would be barred due to Order Ii Rule 2 Cpc or res judicata. \n16. In Hari Ram (supra), the Court was considering a situation wherein the plaintiff had filed a suit for possession in respect of agricultural land in 1957. The same was successful in a second appeal and finally a decree for possession was granted in favour of the plaintiff. An execution petition was filed for execution of the decree which was finally dropped after the possession of the land was handed over to the legal representative of the plaintiff. The decree became final in 1960 and the right of Mr. Ram Chandra\n- plaintiff- to take possession from the defendant - Mr. Hari Ram became This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 final and crystalized. Execution proceedings and criminal proceedings were filed. However, the criminal proceedings were dropped on 13 th May, 1982. Mr. Hari Ram wished to seek declaration of his khatedaari tenancy rights for which he instituted a suit in 1983 for recovery of the possession. A second suit was filed by Mr. Hari Ram in 1990. During the pendency of the second suit, the first suit was withdrawn. The question was as to whether the second suit was maintainable. The High Court of Rajasthan, held that the second suit would not be maintainable in view of Order Xxiii Rule 1 Cpc. In respect of filing of the second suit, the Court observed as under:\n\"...25. It is immaterial whether plaintiff files another suit with respect to the subject- matter against the same party during the pendency of his earlier suit or after withdrawal of the earlier suit without leave of the Court to file fresh suit, consequence is the same and i.e., abandonment of his Claim with statutory restriction against second suit as provided in Sub-rule (4) of Rule 1 of Order 23, C.P.C. Even if, the principles of res judicata cannot be applied still the plaintiff cannot have any permission to walk in Court and go out of the Court after inflicting injury upon the defendant and even upon the Court of dragging in litigation and wasting precious time without having any consequence of coming into the Court and compelling other party to face the litigation may It be for long period or for shortest period. The complete scheme of the Civil Procedure Code makes it unambiguously clear that a party can have one opportunity to approach the Court for getting decision on all the issues raised and on all the issues which could have been raised by the plaintiff at the time of filing suit by the plaintiff and further even on the issues which arise on the pleas of the defendant taken in defence to destroy plaintiffs claim by establishing hollowness of the plaintiffs claim or by establishing his right, title or interest in the subject-matter necessary to destroy plaintiffs claim. If the plaintiff withdraws from the suit, This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 he is at liberty to do so only with consequence of losing all his claims with respect to the subject-matter of the suit. Once defendant is invited by the plaintiff and who is contesting the suit, not agreeing to satisfy the plaintiff for his claim and reliefs expressly in terms of Sub-rule (3) of Rule 1 of Order 23, C.P.C. to the satisfaction of the Court, the plaintiff unilaterally cannot walk out of the Court by saying that he himself feels satisfied about his claim and reliefs for which defendant never conceded and plaintiff cannot take away right of the defendant to get the decision on the issues involved in the suit on the basis of the pleading of both the parties to the suit irrespective of the burden of proving the issues. It is true that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant can be compelled to litigate, but after filing suit any of them may not contest or can withdraw from contest but only with by conceding other's claim or withdrawal of his claim for ever. Litigant after start of litigation cannot avoid its lawful and final decision nor have right to prevent Court from deciding the dispute as it is not convenient to them at this point of time and to keep the dispute alive for adjudication by the Court at the time which suits them or suits them by changing their capacity, plaintiff to defendant or vice versa. The proposition is in consonance with number of provisions of the Civil Procedure Code, which are enacted to avoid multiplicity of the proceedings by the parties in the Court.\"\n17. In Ranbir Singh (supra), relied upon by the defendant, again the suit related to immovable property. Permanent injunction was sought by both the parties against each other in two suits. The plaintiff then filed a third suit and the Court observed that mere addition of one prayer would not change the character of the earlier suit. The plaintiff did not wish to withdraw the first suit and hence the third suit was held to be not maintainable, since the foundation of both the suits was the same. The third suit was, therefore, dismissed by the ld. Single Judge . The ld. Single Judge of this Court This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 observed as under: \n\"25 . The first suit filed by the plaintiff herein before the District Judge is still pending. Plaintiff has not withdrawn the said suit under Order Xxiii, Rule 1 of the Code with liberty to file a fresh suit. plaintiff herein does not want to withdraw the said suit. There is no adjudication or decision by the Additional District Judge that the first suit filed by the plaintiff is not maintainable or requires amendment. This Court while examining whether the second suit is maintainable cannot decide the question and pass an order in the first suit holding that the same suffers from a technical defect and therefore should be dismissed as withdrawn under Order Xxiii, Rule 1 of the Code with liberty to file a fresh suit. No such prayer is made nor any such prayer can be entertained in the present suit. It may be noted that the plaintiff is not inclined to withdraw the first suit. Further even if there is a technical defect, the plaintiff herein can always amend the plaint. plaintiff, however, cannot file a second suit, ignoring provisions of Code and embroil the defendant No. 1 in a second litigation. The plaintiff does not have permission to file a second suit. If the plea of the plaintiff is accepted, a plaintiff can keep on filing repeated suits by making averments in the plaint that the earlier suit suffers from a technical defect but he need not withdraw the earlier suit. In the plaint filed in the present suit there is no averment that the suit filed before the District Judge is not maintainable due to a technical defect and therefore the plaintiff is filing the present suit with the intention and desire to withdraw the first suit pending before the learned Additional District Judge. \n26. The present Suit should not be allowed to continue as it amounts to abuse of the process of court. It should be disposed of at this stage itself, lest it creates further complications or conflicting decisions and further time and costs are incurred. The present suit is mere duplication of Suit No. 300/1997 filed. Both suits, the present Suit and the suit pending before the District Court being Suit No. 300/1997 is filed by the same This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 person, i.e. the plaintiff himself. Provisions of Order Ii, Rules 1 and 2 read with Sections 9 and 12 of the Code are therefore clearly applicable and the present suit is barred under the said provisions. The plaintiff cannot be permitted and allowed to file multiple litigations on the same cause of action. This amounts to sheer abuse of the process of court and harassment of defendant No. 1 who has been dragged to this Court and made to incur expenses\". \n18. This order was upheld by the Division Bench on 18th July, 2012 in Ranbir Singh v. Dalbir Singh & Ors., [Rfa(Os) 50/2009, decision dated 18th July, 2012]. \n19. Insofar as immovable property is concerned, therefore, it is clear that following Hari Ram (supra) and Ranbir Singh (supra), two suits relating to the same relief and the same immovable property, would not be maintainable. In matters concerning trademarks - which relate to intangible property, apart from Bengal Waterproof (supra), there are further decisions which discuss the issue of maintainability of multiple suits. \n20. In this regard, Mr. Sahni, ld. counsel had also relied upon Prapti Fashions Private Limited and Ors. v. Manoj Kumar Gupta, 2013 (55) Ptc 234(Cal), a decision of the ld. Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court . However, it has been thereafter mentioned by ld. Counsel for the Plaintiff that the said decision was overruled by the ld. Division Bench and later on the Slp was dismissed. Thus, this Court considers the view of the Division Bench in Prapti Fashions Private Limited and Ors. v. Manoj Kumar Gupta, 2014 (59) Ptc 667(Cal). In this case, the grievance of the Plaintiff was in respect of the use of the mark 'Prapti' by the Defendant. The first suit was filed in 2012, which was not pursued and was dismissed. At the This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 time of dismissal, a second suit was already filed in 2013 before the High Court, and was pending for similar reliefs. The ld. Single Judge held that the second suit was not maintainable as no liberty was sought while withdrawing the first suit. However, the ld. Division Bench held that since the second suit was already pending, no liberty was required to be sought. The observations of the ld. Division Bench are as under:\n\"14...Section 10, 11, Order Xxiii read together, would unequivocally suggest, legislature did not want any conflict of decision on the same issue as also wanted to stop multiplicity of proceeding. In the present case, the plaintiff filed two suits on the identical cause of action. His later suit could be stayed till the disposal of the earlier suit however, no suit could be dismissed because of pendency of the other suit. Once the former suit is decided the result would preclude the Court to hear the later suit. To avoid such situation, the plaintiff prayed for withdrawal of the earlier suit that could at best help the defendant/respondent to criticize the conduct of the plaintiff and pray for adequate damage for the harassment.\" \n21. Accordingly, in this judgement, the Calcutta High Court holds that a second suit can only be stayed under Section 10 Cpc but cannot be dismissed. \n22. In Indian Herbs Research & Supply Co. Ltd. and Ors. v. Lalji Mal & Ors., 95 (2002) Dlt 723, the plaintiff sought an injunction in respect of the trademark 'Himalayan Batisa'. The defendant was using 'Himalaya Batisa No. 777'. The plaintiff had served a notice in 1985 upon the defendant and had thereafter filed a suit in 1986, before the District Judge, Saharanpur. The suit was decreed in favour of the plaintiff in terms of a settlement which was entered into in March, 1987 stating that in the future This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 the defendant would not use the mark 'Himalaya Batisa No. 777'. The defendant had closed its firm thereafter. However, the defendant started a new firm and in 1995 started using the mark 'Himalayan Batisa'. Accordingly, an execution application was filed by the plaintiff. The said execution application was initially dismissed but the High Court reversed the said dismissal and remanded the execution matter back to the District Court in Bhiwani. In July, 2000, the defendant had continued to use the mark and a fresh suit was filed by the plaintiff in the Delhi High Court, as the plaintiff came to know that the defendant was using the said mark 'Himalayan Batisa' in Delhi also. The question was whether the new suit was maintainable in view of the previous suit which had been settled by a compromise decree and the pending execution proceedings in Bhiwani. In this context, the ld. Single Judge relied upon Bengal Waterproof (supra) and held as under:\n\"11. Learned counsel for the defendants has tried to distinguish this authority saying that in the said case, previous suit was dismissed whereas in the case in hand, previous suit was decreed in terms of compromise. The distinction drawn by learned counsel, to my mind, is of no avail. In a case of infringement of trade mark or copyright or passing off action, dismissal or decreeing of the earlier suit is immaterial as by each deceitful act of the defendant by way of committing breach of registered trade mark of another person, he commits a recurring act of breach and infringement of such trade mark which gives rise to a recurring and fresh cause of action each time.\" \n23. In the recent case of M/s Allied Blenders and Distillers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Amit Dahanukar & Anr. 261 (2019) Dlt 692, the plaintiffs sought protection of the marks 'Manson House' and 'Savoy Club' in This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 respect of alcohol. The defendants were ex-licensees of the plaintiffs. The plaintiff had filed a suit in 2009 in the Bombay High Court wherein the Bombay High Court had held in favour of the defendants by dismissing the plaintiffs' interim injunction application and the counter claim of the defendants had also been allowed. The Bombay High Court had also passed an interim order restraining the plaintiffs from introducing any products with the subject trademarks in the market without leave of the Bombay High Court. The defendants argued that the filing of the subsequent suit before the Delhi High Court by the plaintiffs, would be a case of forum shopping and owing to the principle of comity, the Delhi High Court ought not to adjudicate in favour of the plaintiffs. It was also observed by the Bombay High Court that the plaintiffs had filed the suit before the Delhi High Court while proceedings in Bombay were ongoing and injunction had been rejected already, and therefore the Bombay High Court restrained the plaintiffs from taking steps in the Delhi proceedings for some time. In view of all these facts, i.e., the parties being the same and the suits having commonality of interest, the ld. Single Judge of the Delhi High Court, held this to be a case of forum shopping and observed as under:\n\"29. The facts of the present case are glaring. The parties to the suit in Bombay and the present suit are virtually identical/have a commonality of interest. The said suit in Bombay was filed in 2009. Interim injunction application was dismissed on 22.02.2011 and a clear prima facie findings of fact were recorded in favour of the defendants and against the plaintiffs. It is thereafter that the present suit has been filed on 10.10.2014. The plaintiffs seek interim orders from this court despite being declined relief by the Bombay High Court. \n30. Keeping in view the legal position it is manifest that this court has to give due deference to the enunciation This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 made by another court especially when the litigants are the same. In my opinion, the above legal proposition squarely applies to the facts of the case. The plaintiff having filed suit based on identical facts before the Bombay High Court and having been declined an interim injunction cannot now try to overreach the said order of the Bombay High Court and file the present suit in Delhi High Court seeking an interim injunction. If this court were to agree with the contentions of the plaintiff and were to pass an interim order in favour of the plaintiff it would be passing an order wholly contrary to the order of the Bombay High Court.\" \n24. Therefore, the Court dismissed the defendants' application under Order Xxxix Rule 1 and 2 Cpc. Insofar as the application under Order Ii Rule 2 Cpc filed by the defendants was concerned, the Court dismissed the said application, relying upon Bengal Waterproof (supra), on the ground that in the suit before the Bombay High Court, relief relating to infringement of trademark had not been sought, but the same was sought in the suit before the Delhi High Court. \n25. A perusal of all these decisions shows that the decisions in Bengal Waterproof (supra), Prapti (supra), Indian Herbs (supra) and M/s Allied Blenders and Distillers Pvt. Ltd. (supra) are completely distinguishable from the facts of the present case. The judgment in Bengal Waterproof (supra) and the decisions following the said judgment have to be read in the context and the facts in those cases. In Bengal Waterproof (supra), the first suit was dismissed due to technical reasons. In Prapti Fashions (supra), the first suit had been withdrawn and there was no adjudication on merits, when the maintainability of the second suit was considered. In Indian Herbs (supra) a decree which was already granted in favour of the Defendant which was not being complied with. In M/s Allied Blenders and Distillers This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. (supra) , the issue of infringement of registered trademark was not raised before the Bombay High Court in the first suit. Thus, the second suit was held to be maintainable but the Delhi High Court still showed deference to the orders in the first suit and rejected the injunction application. \n26. As opposed to the facts in the above decisions, in the present case there are two suits based on the same cause of action, for the same time period. In this regard, the Plaintiff has also made a statement in the plaint that it would withdraw the first suit. The said plea reads as under:\n\"The Plaintiff in the year 2019, withdrew its injunction application filed in the year 2017 as the Defendant's took a technical objection that the interim injunction prayer does not mention the word passing off. Therefore, out of abundant caution, a fresh injunction application. It is pertinent to note that even after lapse of 5 years post the filing of the suit and despite the best efforts of the parties, the matter is still at the stage of interim injunction and the said application has not been decided till date. The Plaintiff shall be withdrawing the said suit.\" \n27. There can be no doubt to the legal proposition that whenever there is a fresh cause of action, a fresh suit would lie. However, the same has to be within the four corners of law. The plea of continuing cause of action cannot be stretched to an impermissible limit so as to permit multiple suits between the same parties relating to the same trademarks in different fora. This would constitute clear forum shopping, since if the Plaintiff's submission is accepted, a party would be permitted to file multiple suits in different Courts until it hits upon a forum where relief is granted in its favour. In the present case, as recorded earlier, the reliefs sought in both the suits in the present matter are identical, except for the relief of rendition of accounts which has This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 now been projected as a relief for damages. \n28. As for the reliefs of rendition of accounts and relief for damages, this Court also notes that in any suit for infringement of registered trademark and passing off, as per Section 135(1) of the Trademarks Act, 1999, the plaintiff can sue either for relief for damages or on accounts of profits. The said provision reads as under:\n\"(1) The relief which a court may grant in any suit for infringement or for passing off referred to in section 134 includes injunction (subject to such terms, if any, as the court thinks fit) and at the option of the plaintiff, either damages or an account of profits, together with or without any order for the delivery-up of the infringing labels and marks for destruction or erasure.\"\n29. This bar of seeking only either rendition of accounts Or damages cannot be circumvented by filing two separate suits. It would be impermissible for the Plaintiff to avoid the impact of this provision by seeking to distinguish the two suits, by claiming that one is a suit for rendition of accounts and the other is a suit for damages. Only one relief can be claimed for infringement of the same mark - either damages or rendition of accounts. \n30. Having discussed that changing one relief from rendition of accounts to damages is not permissible, the only other ground on which the Plaintiff seeks to justify the filing of the present suit is the non-grant of relief in the first suit in the form of interim injunction by the Commercial Court. Admittedly, the order sheets of the Commercial Court show that the matter has been adjourned sometimes unnecessarily. But can the Plaintiff rely on this fact as the sole ground to maintain the present suit? The answer is an emphatic No. A perusal of the order sheet of the Trial Court as recorded This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 above shows that the Commercial Court is seized of the matter and submissions have been partly heard on the injunction application. The entertaining of this suit before this Court, would in effect mean that the Plaintiff would be permitted to argue again on merits and seek an interim injunction here, while the same matter is part-heard before the Commercial Court. \n31. In view of all these reasons including identity of the cause of action, multiple reliefs being impermissible under Section 135 of the Trademarks Act and the present suit being filed during the pendency of the first suit, if the present suit is entertained by this Court, this would clearly encourage forum shopping by a litigant who has been unable to get relief in a particular forum and hence decides to knock the doors of this Court. The principle of forum shopping has been recently decried by the Supreme Court in Vijay Kumar Gupta (supra) where the Court has held as under:\n\"7. Predominantly, the Indian Judiciary has time and again reiterated that forum shopping take several hues and shades but the concept of 'forum shopping' has not been rendered an exclusive definition in any Indian statute. Forum shopping as per Merriam Webster dictionary is:\nThe practice of choosing the court in which to bring an action from among those courts that could properly exercise jurisdiction based on determination of which court is likely to provide the most favourable outcome. 8 . The Indian judiciary's observation and obiter dicta has aided in streamlining the concept of forum shopping in the Indian legal system. This Court has condemned the practice of forum shopping by litigants and termed it as an abuse of law and also deciphered different categories of forum shopping. \nxxx xxx xxx\n10. Forum shopping has been termed as disreputable This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 practice by the courts and has no sanction and paramountcy in law. In spite of this Court condemning the practice of forum shopping, Respondent No. 2 filed two complaints i.e., a complaint Under Section 156(3) Code of Criminal Procedure before the Tis Hazari Court, New Delhi o 06.06.2012 and a complaint which was eventually registered as Fir No. 168 Under Section 406, 420, 120B Indian Penal Code before Ps Bowbazar, Calcutta o 28.03.2013. i.e., one in Delhi and one complaint in Kolkata. The Complaint filed in Kolkata was a reproduction of the complaint filed in Delhi except with the change of place occurrence in order to create a jurisdiction. \n11. A two-Judge bench of this Court in Krishna Lal Chawla and Ors. v. State of U.P. and Anr.\nManu/Sc/0161/2021 : (2021) 5 Scc 435 observed that multiple complaints by the same party against the same Accused in respect of the same incident is impermissible. It held that Permitting multiple complaints by the same party in respect of the same incident, whether it involves a cognizable or private complaint offence, will lead to the Accused being entangled in numerous criminal proceedings. As such he would be forced to keep surrendering his liberty and precious time before the police and the courts, as and when required in each case.\" \n32. This Court is clearly of the view that the present case would be a classic case of forum shopping. It is a mis-adventure to say the least. \n33. In so far as the delay in adjudication in the Commercial Court is concerned, any grievance which the Plaintiff may have in respect of the delays caused in the first suit, the Plaintiff would be free to seek its remedies in accordance with law in respect of the said delays. \n34. Pertinent to note that such a situation was also not contemplated in the decision of Bengal Waterproof (supra). While there is no doubt that intangible property such as a trademark deserves to be protected from This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 misuse, owners of trademarks also cannot be permitted to misuse the Court's process. Principles such as res judicata, res subjudice, bar under Order Ii Rule 2 Cpc, forum shopping, which apply in general to civil and criminal proceedings would also be applicable to trademark suits as well. A trademark owner cannot drag a Defendant to multiple fora, being a higher court or before a court of coordinate jurisdiction, when the matter is pending before the first Court, especially when the matter is part heard before the first Court, until the plaintiff finds a forum where it is able to get relief. \n35. Therefore, this Court is clearly of the opinion that while the ld. Adj is seized of the same very matter between the same very parties, the present suit cannot be entertained on the basis of the plea that there is a fresh cause of action. This would be a gross abuse of the process and would in fact be contrary to public policy. If such a suit is entertained, it would encourage litigants to indulge in forum shopping which cannot be the objective of the provisions of Section 10 and 11 of the Cpc. This would also result in unnecessary burden on the Defendant who would be forced to incur repeated legal costs and undue harassment. Such a course of action cannot be condoned by the Court. \n36. Moreover, an analysis of the position in the first suit would show that the Plaintiff has sought interim injunction and permanent injunction coupled with rendition of accounts of profits till the date an injunction order is passed. Therefore, if the Plaintiff is successful in the first suit, the relief that would be granted by the Court would also cover the period for which the fresh cause of action is being sought to be portrayed in the present suit before the High Court. Additionally, if the Plaintiff is successful, rendition of accounts may also be granted by the Commercial Court which would This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 include the accounts for the period sought to be covered by the present suit. Thus, the cause of action by itself of the present suit would be subsumed in the first suit since the first suit is still pending. In none of the judgements cited by the parties or which the Court has come across, such a fact situation has arisen. \n37. As for the proceedings before the Commercial Court in the present matter, this Court notes with some consternation that this state of affairs has arisen because of the fact that the Presiding Officer who had heard the matter and had to pass orders chose to delay the decision in the interim injunction application indefinitely until he got transferred from the said posting. This Court has repeatedly emphasised on the need for Judicial Officers to pronounce orders after hearing arguments and not releasing matters. In fact, whenever transfer of a Judicial Officer is effected, if orders are pending to be passed in a matter that the said Judicial Officer is seized of, a note is issued to the effect that the order has to be pronounced. The Supreme Court has, repeatedly, in Anil Rai v. State of Bihar, (2001) 7 Scc 318 and Balaji Baliram Mupade & Anr. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. [Civil Appeal No. 3564/2020, decided on 29th October, 2020] emphasised the importance of timely pronouncement of judgments and orders once submissions are heard. The said judgements were also considered by this Court in Deepti Khera v. Siddharth Khera [Cm (M) 1637/2019, decided on 18th November, 2019], The observations in Deepti Khera (supra) where Anil Rai (supra) is also extracted are set out below:\n\"6. It is the settled position in law, as per the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Anil Rai v. State of Bihar, (2001) 7 Scc 318 that once matters are reserved for orders, usually, the same should be This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 pronounced within a time schedule. In Anil Rai (supra) it has been observed as under:\n\"8. The intention of the legislature regarding pronouncement of judgments can be inferred from the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Sub-section (1) of Section 353 of the Code provides that the judgment in every trial in any criminal court of original jurisdiction, shall be pronounced in open court immediately after the conclusion of the trial or on some subsequent time for which due notice shall be given to the parties or their pleaders. The words \"some subsequent time\" mentioned in Section 353 contemplate the passing of the judgment without undue delay, as delay in the pronouncement of judgment is opposed to the principle of law. Such subsequent time can at the most be stretched to a period of six weeks and not beyond that time in any case. The pronouncement of judgments in the civil case should not be permitted to go beyond two months.\" \n7. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Anil Rai (supra) has also passed certain guidelines regarding pronouncement of judgments. The same are reproduced below:\n( i) The Chief Justices of the High Courts may issue appropriate directions to the Registry that in a case where the judgment is reserved and is pronounced later, a column be added in the judgment where, on the first page, after the cause-title, date of reserving the judgment and date of pronouncing it be separately mentioned by the Court Officer concerned. \n(ii) That Chief Justices of the High Courts, on their administrative side, should direct the Court Officers/Readers of the various Benches in the High Courts to furnish every month the This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 list of cases in the matters where the judgments reserved are not pronounced within the period of that month. \n(iii) On noticing that after conclusion of the arguments the judgment is not pronounced within a period of two months, the Chief Justice concerned shall draw the attention of the Bench concerned to the pending matter. The Chief Justice may also see the desirability of circulating the statement of such cases in which the judgments have not been pronounced within a period of six weeks from the date of conclusion of the arguments amongst the Judges of the High Court for their information. \nSuch communication be conveyed as confidential and in a sealed cover. \n(iv) Where a judgment is not pronounced within three months from the date of reserving it, any of the parties in the case is permitted to file an application in the High Court with a prayer for early judgment. Such application, as and when filed, shall be listed before the Bench concerned within two days excluding the intervening holidays. \n(v) If the judgment, for any reason, is not pronounced within a period of six months, any of the parties of the said lis shall be entitled to move an application before the Chief Justice of the High Court with a prayer to withdraw the said case and to make it over to any other Bench for fresh arguments. It is open to the Chief Justice to grant the said prayer or to pass any other order as he deems fit in the circumstances. \n8. The Civil Procedure Code, 1908, prescribes thirty days as the time in which a judgment should be pronounced. Order Xx Rule 1 of the Cpc reads as This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNeutral Citation No: 2022/Dhc/001212 under:\n\"1. Judgment when pronounced. -- [(1) The Court, after the case has been heard, shall pronounce judgment in an open Court, either at once, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable and when the judgment is to be pronounced on some future day, the Court shall fix a day for that purpose, of which due notice shall be given to the parties or their pleaders: \nProvided that where the judgment is not pronounced at once, every endeavour shall be made by the Court to pronounce the judgment within thirty days from the date on which the hearing of the case was concluded but, where it is not practicable so to do on the ground of the exceptional and extraordinary circumstances of the case, the Court shall fix a future day for the pronouncement of the judgment, and such day shall not ordinarily be a day beyond sixty days from the date on which the hearing of the case was concluded, and due notice of the day so fixed shall be given to the parties or their pleaders.]\"\n9. While this Court is conscious of the fact that there are pressures on the Trial Courts, non-pronouncement of orders for more than a year cannot be held to be justified. It has been observed in several matters that trial courts keep matters `For Orders' for months together and sometimes orders are not pronounced for even 2-3 years. Thereafter the judicial officer is transferred or posted in some other jurisdiction and the matter has to be reargued . Such a practice puts enormous burden on the system and on litigants/lawyers. The usual practice ought to be to pronounce orders within the time schedule laid down in the CPC as also the various judgements of the Supreme Court. In civil cases maximum period of two months can be taken for This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/001212 pronouncing orders, unless there are exceptional cases or there are very complex issues that are involved. \n10. Accordingly, in respect of pronouncement of orders, the following directions are issued:\ni. When arguments are heard, the order sheet ought to reflect that the matter is part-heard;\nii. Upon conclusion of arguments, the order sheet ought to clearly reflect that the arguments have been heard and the matter is reserved for orders. If the court is comfortable in giving a specific date for pronouncing orders, specific date ought to be given;\niii. Orders ought to be pronounced in terms of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Anil Rai (supra);\niv. The order ought to specify the date when orders were reserved and the date of pronouncement of the order.\"\n38. This has been reiterated repeatedly, most recently in Sandhya Srivastava v. Dr. Neelam Mishra & Ors. [W.P.(C.) 2207/2021, decided on 18th February, 2021]. \n39. Accordingly, it is deemed appropriate to bring the present judgment to the notice of the Inspecting Committee of the concerned Judicial Officer by the worthy Registrar General of this Court. Copy of this order be sent to the concerned Inspecting Committee through the worthy Registrar General, as also for circulation to all judicial officers in the Trial Court. \n40. The present suit is dismissed as not maintainable. All pending applications are disposed of. \n41. It is made clear that this would, however, not affect the merits of the pending suit being CS (Comm.) No. 300 of 2019 before the Trial Court. \n42. Needless to add, any remedies which the Plaintiff may have in respect This is a digitally signed Judgement. \nNEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/001212 of proceedings qua the first suit being CS (Comm.) No. 300 of 2019, pending before the Ld. ADJ-2, Rohini Courts, Delhi, or the delay caused therein, are left open for the Plaintiff to avail in accordance with law. \n43. The order in this matter was dictated in open Court on 28th March, 2022. However, before the order was signed, certain further submissions and judgments were filed later by the ld. Counsels. Hence the said judgments and submissions have been considered while finalizing this order. \n44. The digitally signed copy of this order, duly uploaded on the official website of the Delhi High Court, www.delhihighcourt.nic.in, shall be treated as the certified copy of the order for the purpose of ensuring compliance. No physical copy of orders shall be insisted upon by any authority/entity or litigant. \nPRATHIBA M.

================================================================ date : 31/01/2020 oral order 1. present petition is preferred by the petitioner under article 227 of the constitution of india praying for quashing and setting aside impugned order dated 29.2.2019 passed by learned trial court on application exhibit 7 under order vii, rule 11 read with section 151 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 in special civil suit no.191 of 2018 whereby the application was dismissed. 2. the facts giving rise to the present petition are that the petitioner is the original defendant in the suit preferred by the respondent (original plaintiff) bearing special civil suit no. 191 of 2018 before the additional senior civil judge, surat, (hereinafter referred to as the \"trial court\") seeking damages for tortious act of unlawful interference with contracts and business relations worth rs. 5,00,00,000/and grant of permanent injunction against the petitioner herein restraining the petitioner from sending interfering letters/notices to the clients and potential clients of the respondent herein. for the sake of brevity and convenience the parties are referred to in this order as per their original status before the trial court as \"plaintiff\" and \"defendant\". 2.1 it is stated that in response to the aforesaid suit the petitioner herein filed an application under order vii rule 11 read with section 151 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 praying for rejection of the plaint filed by the respondent herein, inter alia, on, broadly speaking the following grounds: i. that the trial court does not have the jurisdiction, territorial or otherwise, to entertain the suit inasmuch as neither the defendant has its office within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court, nor the alleged cause of action, as stated or otherwise, qua the petitioner herein, arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court. ii. that there exists no cause of action in favour of the respondent herein against the petitioner herein to file the suit; iii. that the suit as filed by the plaintiff is manifestly barred by law. 2.2 however, vide order dated 29.01.2019, the trial court erroneously, incorrectly and in complete violation of the settled principles of law dismissed the said application by holding, albeit erroneously and without application of mind, that: a. the question of jurisdiction of the court is not covered under order vii rule 11 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. the trial court, therefore, in gross violation of the settled principle of law, failed to return any finding on the issue of lack of jurisdiction; b. upon perusal of para 41 of the plaint it appears that the respondent has mentioned \"cause of action\" and, hence, it cannot be said that order vii rule 11 (a) would be applicable in the present case; c. the suit is not barred by sections 41 (a) and 41 (b) of the specific relief act, 1963; d. the question of whether the respondent has even been able to make out a prima facie case of \"tortious interference\" against the petitioner cannot be examined at the present stage. 3. it is submitted that the impugned order is non-reasoned and discloses non-application of mind by the trial court. in fact, the impugned order is contrary to the settled principles of law and in utter disregard to the established principles of order vii, rule 11 of the cpc. further, the trial court has acted in the teeth of settled law that furnishing of reasons is the heartbeat of every conclusion as it introduces clarity in an order and that without the same the order becomes lifeless. hence, the petitioner is constrained to prefer the present petition under article 227 of the constitution of india. 4. the present suit has been filed by the plaintiff alleging that the defendant has caused tortious interference in the business of the plaintiff. the plaintiff has alleged that the said tortious interference has been caused by the petitioner on account of press releases made by the petitioner in singapore and the united states of america. admittedly, the said press releases have not been issued in india and the same solely contain the factum of the various litigations pending between the parties in india. the plaintiff has further alleged that the petitioner issued a letter to an entity, 'rogers & hollands jewelers' in the united states of america, after which 'rogers & hollands jewelers' issued letters to alleged customers/clients of the plaintiff in india. according to the plaintiff, as a result of the said press releases made outside india and the letter issued by 'rogers & hollands jewelers', the defendant has caused tortious interference with the business of the plaintiff in surat, india. 5. the present suit was initially filed by the plaintiff before the commercial court in vadodara being commercial civil suit no. 81 of 2017. however, since the said suit did not fall within the definition of a \"commercial dispute\" as provided under section 2 (1) (c) of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015, upon an application filed by the defendant under order vii rule 11 read with section 151 of the cpc, the said suit was returned by the commercial court, vadodara, vide order dated 11.04.2018 to be filed before the appropriate forum. thereafter, it was filed before the civil court, surat, wherein it is registered as special suit no.191 of 2018. the defendant has moved the application under order 7, rule 11 as stated in earlier part of this order, which came to be dismissed giving rise to present petition under article 227 of the constitution of india. 6. heard learned senior counsel mr.niraj malhotra with mr.jandeep grover with ms.vara gaur with pankhuri bhardwaj with mr.dilip rana for the petitioner-defendant and learned counsel, mr.vinod khurana with mr.rushabh nigam, hemang s. shah for plaintiff no.1. perused the material placed on record and the decisions cited at bar. 7. learned senior counsel, shri niraj malhotra for the defendant, while referring to the copy of the plaint has submitted that the plaintiff has filed the suit for damages for tortious act of unlawful interference of contract and business relations worth rs.5 crore and for grant of permanent injunction against the defendant, wherein the address of the defendant is shown to be in israel. learned counsel also referred to paragraph 10 of the plaint, wherein it is averred that the defendant is a company incorporated under the laws of israel, having its registered office at 4, haharash st., hodhasharon 4524075, israel. according to him, these facts itself show that the defendant is carrying on the business in israel and, therefore, the trial court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. 7.1 learned counsel, mr.niraj malhotra also contended that the plaintiff has clearly averred that copyright infringement and commercial suit have been filed before the concerned commercial court. while referring to paragraphs 19 and 20, learned counsel has submitted that even these averments does not confer any jurisdiction to the trial court. while referring to paragraph 20 of the plaint, he has submitted that no name of the customer of the plaintiff has been provided in said paragraph. according to him, whatever is stated by the plaintiff regarding communication put on defendant's web site is concerned, there is no particular of the plaintiff is reflected in such communication. according to him, whatever communications have been referred to in the plaint are not addressed to the plaintiff and nowhere it is mentioned that the plaintiff is indulging in such activity. according to him, the message reflected on the website of the defendant is issued either in usa or other country and there is no specific reference of the plaintiff in the said communication. according to him, whatever averments made in the plaint are vague in nature and there is no cause of action as averred in the plaint. it is also submitted by him that if there is no cause of action arisen then the suit itself is liable to be dismissed under order 7, rule 11 of cpc. 7.2 regarding jurisdiction of the trial court, it has been submitted by learned counsel, mr.niraj malhotra for the defendant that no cause of action has arisen in the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court and, accordingly, the defendant has moved an application for rejection of plaint in toto. he has also contended that whatever press release or message on website are concerned, they all are issued from israel and not a single press release was made in india. regarding letter of october 2017, at page 206 of the compilation, learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that this has been issued from american company and not by the defendant. according to him, whatever legal right is available to the plaintiff is against the rogers and hollands. by referring to the communication of october 2017, which is at page 206 of the compilation, he has also contended that no right of the plaintiff is infringed by the defendant. he has also contended that said letter cannot give any territorial jurisdiction to the trial court. 7.3 learned senior counsel, mr.niraj malhotra also submitted that merely because the defendant has filed two suits against the plaintiff, it is not sufficient to invest the trial court with the jurisdiction to entertain present suit. while referring to section 20 of cpc, learned senior counsel has also submitted that even under this provision the suit itself is not maintainable and the court has no territorial jurisdiction. he vehemently submitted that there is no territorial jurisdiction with the indian court. 7.4 learned senior counsel, mr.niraj malhotra for the petitioner submitted that the suit itself is barred in view of the provisions of section 41 (a) and (b) of the specific relief act, 1963. according to him, in terms of section 34 of the specific relief act, 1963 the suit itself is liable to be dismissed at the threshold. he has also contended that the plaint is not valued for sufficient court fees. 7.5 regarding page 263, learned counsel has submitted that the company sarin technologies india private limited is a subsidiary company of the defendant but that fact itself cannot invest the trial court with territorial jurisdiction. according to him, subsidiary company is different entity and the defendant is also different entity. he has further submitted that the plaintiff has only joined the company, which is in israel. he has also contended that the indian company i.e. the subsidiary company of the defendant has not been referred to in the plaint itself. 7.6 while referring to the reply at page 370, he has contended that it is a case of the plaintiff that cause of action has arosen partly in surat i.e. within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court. according to him, the reply of the plaintiff depicts that the plaintiff has moved an application under order 1, rule 10 of cpc for impleadment of india/subsidiary company of the defendant. according to him, this fact suggests that the plaintiff is knowing that no cause of action has arisen against the present defendant. mr.niraj malhotra, learned counsel for the petitioner has prayed to allow present petition and to set aside the impugned order and prayed that the application filed by the defendant for rejection of the plaint under order 7, rule 11 of cpc may be allowed. he has relied on the decision in the case of state of gujarat v. union of india delivered by this court in special civil application no.737 of 2018 decided on 7.5.2018, especially paragraphs 6.5, 8.4, 9 and 13, which read as under:\"6.5 making above submissions, and further relying upon the following decisions, it is vehemently submitted by shri kamal trivedi, learned advocate general, that section 8 of the commercial courts act does not affect the writ petitions under article 227 of the constitution of india and therefore, the bar contained in section 8 of the commercial courts act against the entertainability of the civil revision application or petition against the interlocutory order shall not be applicable to the writ petition/ petitions under article 227 of the constitution of india:(i) surya dev rai v. ram chander

1. 8.4 in the case of surya dev rai v. ram chander rai and others (supra), the hon'ble supreme court had an occasion to consider the effect of the amendment in section 115 of the cpc on the jurisdiction of the high court under articles 226 and 227 of the constitution of india and the hon'ble supreme court has observed and held that the amendment cannot and does not in any manner affect the jurisdiction under articles 226/227 of the constitution of india. in the aforesaid decision, it is held by the hon'ble supreme court that the decision of the subordinate court shall be subjected to the supervisory jurisdiction of the high courts under article 227 of the constitution. in the aforesaid decision, it is further observed that articles 226/227 of the constitution of india, being part of the basic structure, cannot be tampered, not even by constitutional amendment, much less by an act of legislature.it is observed and held that despite the amendment in section 115 of the cpc, the aggrieved party can seek such writ of certiorari or invoke powers of superintendence of the high court under articles 226/227 of the constitution of india. in paragraphs 29 to 39, the hon'ble supreme court in the case of surya dev rai v. ram chander rai and others (supra) has observed and held as under: \"29. the constitution bench in l. chandra kumar v. union of india and others, (1997) 3 scc 261, dealt with the nature of power of judicial review conferred by article 226 of the constitution and the power of superintendence conferred by article 227. it was held that the jurisdiction conferred on the supreme court under article 32 of the constitution and on the high courts under articles 226 and 227 of the constitution is part of the basic structure of the constitution, forming its integral and essential feature, which cannot be tampered with much less taken away even by constitutional amendment, not to speak of a parliamentary legislation. a recent division bench decision by delhi high court (dalveer bhandari and h. r. malhotra, jj.) in criminal writ petition nos. 758, 917 and 1295 of 2002, govind v. state (govt. of nct of delhi) decided on april 1, 2003 (reported as (2003) 6 ild 468) makes an in-depth survey of decided cases including almost all the leading decisions by this court and holds \"the power of the high court under article 226 cannot be whittled down, nullified, curtailed, abrogated, diluted or taken either by judicial pronouncement or by the legislative enactment or even by the amendment of the constitution. the power of judicial review is an inherent part of the basic structure and it cannot be abrogated without affecting the basic structure of the constitution.\" the essence of constitutional and legal principles, relevant to the issue at hand, has been correctly summed up by the division bench of the high court and we record our approval of the same. 30. it is interesting to recall two landmark decisions delivered by high courts and adorning the judicial archives. in balkrishna hari phansalkar v. emperor, air 1933 bombay 1 the question arose before a special bench whether the power of superintendence conferred on the high court by section 107 of government of india act 1915 can be controlled by the governor-general exercising its power to legislate. the occasion arose because of the resistance offered by the state government to the high court exercising its power of superintendence over the courts of magistrates established under emergency powers ordinance, 1932. chief justice beumont held that even if power of revision is taken away, the power of superintendence over the courts constituted by the ordinance was still available. the governor-general cannot control the powers conferred on the high court by an act of imperial parliament. however, speaking of the care and caution to be observed while exercising the power of superintendence though possessed by the high court, the learned chief justice held that the power of superintendence is not the same thing as the hearing of an appeal. an illegal conviction may be set aside under power of superintendence but \"we must exercise our discretion on judicial grounds, and only interfere if considerations of justice require us to do so.\" 31. in manmatha nath biswas v. emperor (1932-33) 37 cwn 201 a conviction based on no legal reason and unsustainble in law came up for the scrutiny of the high court under the power of superintendence in spite of right of appeal having been allowed to lapse. speaking of the nature of power of superintendence, the division bench, speaking through chief justice rankin, held that the power of superintendence vesting in the high court under section 107 of the government of india act, 1915 is not a limitless power available to be exercised for removing hardship of particular decisions. the power of superintendence is a power of known and well recognised character and should be exercised on those judicial principles which give it its character. the mere misconception on a point of law or a wrong decision on facts or a failure to mention by the courts in its judgment every element of the offence, would not allow the order of the magistrate being interfered with in exercise of the power of superintendence but the high court can and should see that no man is convicted without a legal reason. a defect or jurisdiction or fraud on the part of the prosecutor or error on the \"face of the proceedings\" as understood in indian practice, provides a ground for the exercise of the power of superintendence. the line between the two classes of case must be, however, kept clear and straight. in general words, the high court's power of superintendence is a power to keep subordinate courts within the bounds of their authority, to see that they do what their duty requires and that they do it in a legal manner. 32. the principles deducible, well-settled as they are, have been well summed up and stated by a twojudges bench of this court recently in state through special cell, new delhi v. navjot sandhu afshan guru and others, jt 2003 (4) sc 605, para 28. this court held : (i) the jurisdiction under article 227 cannot be limited or fettered by any act of the state legislature; (ii) the supervisory jurisdiction is wide and can be used to meet the ends of justice, also to interfere even with interlocutory order; (iii) the power must be exercised sparingly, only to move subordinate courts and tribunals within the bounds of their authority to see that they obey the law. the power is not available to be exercised to correct mere errors (whether on the facts or laws) and also cannot be exercised \"as the cloak of an appeal in disguise\". 33. in shiv shakti co-op. housing society, nagpur v. m/s.swaraj developers and others, (2003) 4 scale 241, another two-judges bench of this court dealt with section 115 of the c.p.c. the court at the end of its judgment noted the submission of the learned counsel for a party that even if the revisional applications are held to be not maintainable, there should not be a bar on a challenge being made under article 227 of the constitution for which an opportunity was prayed to be allowed. the court observed,\"if any remedy is available to a party, no liberty is necessary to be granted for availing the same.\" 34. we are of the opinion that the curtailment of revisional jurisdiction of the high court does not take away and could not have taken away the constitutional jurisdiction of the high court to issue a writ of certiorari to a civil court nor the power of superintendence conferred on the high court under article 227 of the constitution is taken away or whittled down. the power exists, untrammelled by the amendment in section 115 of the cpc, and is available to be exercised subject to rules of self discipline and practice which are well settled. 35. we have carefully perused the full bench decision of the allahabad high court in ganga saran's case relied on by the learned counsel for respondent and referred to in the impugned order of the high court. we do not think that the decision of the full bench has been correctly read. rather, vide para 11, the full bench has itself held that where the order of the civil court suffers from patent error of law and further causes manifest injustice to the party aggrieved then the same can be subjected to writ of certiorari. the full bench added that every interlocutory order passed in a civil suit is not subject to review under article 226 of the constitution but if it is found from the order impugned that fundamental principle of law has been violated and further such an order causes substantial injustice to the party aggrieved the jurisdiction of the high court to issue a writ of certiorari is not precluded. however, the following sentence occurs in the judgment of the full bench-:\"where an aggrieved party approaches the high court under article 226 of the constitution against an order passed in civil suit refusing to issue injunction to a private individual who is not under statutory duty to perform public duty or vacating an order of injunction, the main relief is for issue of a writ of mandamus to a private individual and such a writ petition under art. 226 of the constitution would not be maintainable.\" 36. it seems that the high court in its decision impugned herein formed an impression from the above-quoted passage that a prayer for issuance of injunction having been refused by trial court as well as the appellate court, both being subordinate to high court and the dispute being between two private parties, issuance of injunction by high court amounts to issuance of a mandamus against a private party which is not permissible in law. 37. the above quoted sentence from ganga saran's case cannot be read torn out of the context. all that the full bench has said is that while exercising certiorari jurisdiction over a decision of the court below refusing to issue an order of injunction, the high court would not, while issuing a writ of certiorari, also issue a mandamus against a private party. article 227 of the constitution has not been referred to by the full bench. earlier in this judgment we have already pointed out the distinction between article 226 and article 227 of the constitution and we need not reiterate the same. in this context, we may quote the constitution bench decision in t. c. basappa v. t. nagappa and another, (1955) 1 scr 250 and province of bombay v. khushaldas s. advani (dead) by lrs., 1950 scr 621, as also a three judge bench decision in dwarka nath v. income-tax officer, special circle, d ward, kanpur and another, (1965) 3 scr 536, which have held in no uncertain terms, as the law has always been, that a writ of certiorari is issued against the acts or proceedings of a judicial or quasi-judicial body conferred with power to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and obliged to act judicially. we are therefore of the opinion that the writ of certiorari is directed against the act, order of proceedings of the subordinate court, it can issue even if the lis is between two private parties. 38. such like matters frequently arise before the high courts. we sum up our conclusions in a nutshell, even at the risk of repetition and state the same as here-under-:(1) amendment by act no. 46 of 1999 with effect from 1-7-2002 in section 115 of the code of civil procedure cannot and does not affect in any manner the jurisdiction of the high court under articles 226 and 227 of the constitution. (2) interlocutory orders, passed by the courts subordinate to the high court, against which remedy of revision has been excluded by the cpc amendment act no. 46 of 1999 are nevertheless open to challenge in, and continue to be subject to, certiorari and supervisory jurisdiction of the high court. (3) certiorari, under article 226 of the constitution, is issued for correcting gross errors of jurisdiction, i.e., when a subordinate court is found to have acted (i) without jurisdiction by assuming jurisdiction where there exists none, or (ii) in excess of its jurisdiction by overstepping or crossing the limits of jurisdiction, or (iii) acting in flagrant disregard of law or the rules of procedure or acting in violation of principles of natural justice where there is no procedure specified, and thereby occasioning failure of justice. (4) supervisory jurisdiction under article 227 of the constitution is exercised for keeping the subordinate courts within the bounds of their jurisdiction. when the subordinate court has assumed a jurisdiction which it does not have or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction which it does have or the jurisdiction though available is being exercised by the court in a manner not permitted by law and failure of justice or grave injustice has occasioned thereby, the high court may step in to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction. (5) be it a writ of certiorari or the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction, none is available to correct mere errors of fact or of law unless the following requirements are satisfied : (i) the error is manifest and apparent on the face of the proceedings such as when it is based on clear ignorance or utter disregard of the provisions of law, and (iii) a grave injustice or gross failure of justice has occasioned thereby. (6) a patent error is an error which is self-evident, i.e., which can be perceived or demonstrated without involving into any lengthy or complicated argument or a long-drawn process of reasoning. where two inferences are reasonably possible and the subordinate court has chosen to take one view the error cannot be called gross or patent. (7) the power to issue a writ of certiorari and the supervisory jurisdiction are to be exercised sparingly and only in appropriate cases where the judicial conscience of the high court dictates it to act lest a gross failure of justice or grave injustice should occasion. care, caution and circumspection need to be exercised, when any of the abovesaid two jurisdictions is sought to be invoked during the pendency of any suit or proceedings in a subordinate court and error though calling for correction is yet capable of being corrected at the conclusion of the proceedings in an appeal or revision preferred there against and entertaining a petition invoking certiorari or supervisory jurisdiction of high court would obstruct the smooth flow and/or early disposal of the suit or proceedings. the high court may feel inclined to intervene where the error is such, as, if not corrected at that very moment, may become incapable of correction at a later stage and refusal to intervene would result in travesty of justice or where such refusal itself would result in prolonging of the lis. (8) the high court in exercise of certiorari or supervisory jurisdiction will not covert itself into a court of appeal and indulge in re-appreciation or evaluation of evidence or correct errors in drawing inferences or correct errors of mere formal or technical character . (9) in practice, the parameters for exercising jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari and those calling for exercise of supervisory jurisdiction are almost similar and the width of jurisdiction exercised by the high courts in india unlike english courts has almost obliterated the distinction between the two jurisdictions. while exercising jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari the high court may annul or set aside the act, order or proceedings of the subordinate courts but cannot substitute its own decision in place thereof. in exercise of supervisory jurisdiction the high court may not only give suitable directions so as to guide the subordinate court as to the manner in which it would act or proceed thereafter or afresh, the high court may in appropriate cases itself make an order in supersession or substitution of the order of the subordinate court as the court should have made in the facts and circumstances of the case . 9. considering the law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in the aforesaid decisions, we are of the opinion that bar contained under section 8 of the commercial courts act shall not affect the jurisdiction of the high court under article 227 of the constitution of india. if the contention on behalf of the respondents that considering section 8 of the commercial courts act, even the writ jurisdiction under article 227 of the constitution of india is barred, in that case, such a provision would suffer from the vice of unconstitutionality as observed by the hon'ble supreme court in the aforesaid decisions. the power vested in the high courts to exercise judicial superintendence over the decisions of the courts and tribunals within their respective jurisdictions is part of the basic structure of the constitution and no legislature can take away such power of superintendence conferred under article 227 of the constitution of india. it is required to be noted that therefore, even the legislature, while enacting section 8 of the commercial courts act, seems to have wisely not used the word \"maintainable\" but has used the word \"entertained\". at this stage, it is also required to be noted that where the statute specifically provided that against the decision of the tribunal, only an appeal under article 136 of the constitution before the hon'ble supreme court would be maintainable, the hon'ble supreme court in the case of l.chandra kumar v. union of india and others (supra) has specifically observed and held that the powers of the supervisory jurisdiction of the high court under article 227 of the constitution against the decision of the tribunals shall still be available and the aggrieved party can approach the high court under article 227 of the constitution. therefore, it is observed and held that section 8 of the commercial courts act shall not affect the powers of the high court under article 227 of the constitution of india against the order passed by the commercial court. however, at the same time, the powers under article 227 of the constitution of india must be exercised sparingly and in exceptional cases only, more particularly, looking to the object and purpose of section 8 of the commercial courts act, i.e. speedy disposal of commercial disputes. 13. in view of the above and for reasons stated above and considering the decisions of hon'ble supreme court referred to hereinabove, our conclusions in nutshell are as under:\"(1) the bar contained under section 8 of the commercial courts act against entertainability of \"civil revision application or petition\" against the interlocutory orders passed by the subordinate/ commercial courts, shall not be applicable to the writ petitions under article 227 of the constitution of india. (2) the bar contained in section 8 of the commercial courts act shall not affect the supervisory jurisdiction of the high courts under article 227 of the constitution of india in respect of the orders, including interlocutory orders, passed by the commercial court and writ petitions under article 227 of the constitution of india may be entertainable, however, subject to the following observations and restrictions:(a) supervisory jurisdiction under article 227 of the constitution is exercised for keeping the subordinate courts within the bounds of their jurisdiction. when the subordinate court has assumed a jurisdiction which it does not have or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction which it does have or the jurisdiction though available is being exercised by the court in a manner not permitted by law and failure of justice or grave injustice has occasioned thereby, the high court may step in to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction.\" 8. per contra, mr.khurana, learned counsel for the respondent-plaintiff has submitted that the defendant could have filed revision application unde section 115 of cpc. according to him, when there is specific provision provided in cpc, writ under article 227 of the constitution of india is not maintainable. he has also contended that litigation between the parties is going on since long. he has also contended that by the act of the defendant in publishing on its website, particulars regarding the plaintiff has damaged the reputation of the plaintiff. therefore, the plaintiff has filed the aforesaid suit earlier before the commercial court, however, learned commercial court has returned the plaint to the plaintiff to file in a competent court. therefore, the suit has been filed in surat, where subsidiary of the defendant is doing business. regarding provisions of order 7, rule 11, learned counsel, mr.khurana has submitted that the provisions contained therein cannot be applied on the point of jurisdiction as held by the trial court. according to him, order 7, rule 11 is not applicable but the provisions of order 10 would be applicable. while referring to various documentary evidence on record, which includes balance-sheet, page 201, he has submitted that that 70% business of the defendant is coming from india and its major business is in surat. he has also contended that the website of the defendant clearly shows that by its action, the reputation of the plaintiff is damaged and the website is also being shown in surat. he has also contended that cause of action has arisen in the territorial jurisdiction of surat court and the defendant has filed the suit of trademark against the plaintiff in india. while referring to the impugned order of the trial court, he has submitted that learned trial court has properly appreciated the facts and has rightly rejected the application of the defendant. according to him, there is no perversity in the impugned order of the trial court. 8.1 learned counsel, mr.khurana has also submitted that when the trial court has exercised the jurisdiction in judicious manner, this court may not disturb that finding under article 227 of the constitution of india. 8.2 while referring to the order of the commercial court, baroda, he has submitted that the commercial court has initially found that the suit is maintainable and it has only directed to return the plaint to the plaintiff as it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the commercial court. according to him, therefore, the plaintiff has filed the plaint and it was returned to file it in the court of surat. while referring to copyright suit no.2 of 2017 filed before principal district judge, surat, by the defendant herein, learned counsel has submitted that in paragraph 13, page 288, defendant itself has averred that the plaintiff has indian market, especially in surat, in connection with plaintiff's (defendant's) machines and products. according to him, this shows that the defendant knows very well that the plaintiff firm is dealing with diamond industry in india i.e. especially in surat. he has also contended that the plaintiff has already moved the trial court for joining subsidiary of the defendant as a party. while referring to various affidavits filed in the matter, he has submitted that all these facts shows that the plaintiff has its business in surat and the defendant has its subsidiary in surat and cause of action has arisen. he has submitted that the trial court has not committed any error in dismissing the application filed by the defendant. while relying on the following decisions, he has prayed to dismiss present petition. 8.3 in shalini shyam shetty v. ranejdra shankar patil reported in (2010) 8 scc 329, wherein it is observed as under:\"62. on an analysis of the aforesaid decisions of this court, the following principles on the exercise of high court's jurisdiction under article 227 of the constitution may be formulated:(a) a petition under article 226 of the constitution is different from a petition under article 227. the mode of exercise of power by high court under these two articles is also different. (b) in any event, a petition under article 227 cannot be called a writ petition. the history of the conferment of writ jurisdiction on high courts is substantially different from the history of conferment of the power of superintendence on the high courts under article 227 and have been discussed above. (c) high courts cannot, on the drop of a hat, in exercise of its power of superintendence under article 227 of the constitution, interfere with the orders of tribunals or courts inferior to it. nor can it, in exercise of this power, act as a court of appeal over the orders of court or tribunal subordinate to it. in cases where an alternative statutory mode of redressal has been provided, that would also operate as a restrain on the exercise of this power by the high court. (d) the parameters of interference by high courts in exercise of its power of superintendence have been repeatedly laid down by this court. in this regard the high court must be guided by the principles laid down by the constitution bench of this court in waryam singh (supra) and the principles in waryam singh (supra) have been repeatedly followed by subsequent constitution benches and various other decisions of this court. (e) according to the ratio in waryam singh (supra), followed in subsequent cases, the high court in exercise of its jurisdiction of superintendence can interfere in order only to keep the tribunals and courts subordinate to it, `within the bounds of their authority'. (f) in order to ensure that law is followed by such tribunals and courts by exercising jurisdiction which is vested in them and by not declining to exercise the jurisdiction which is vested in them. (g) apart from the situations pointed in (e) and (f), high court can interfere in exercise of its power of superintendence when there has been a patent perversity in the orders of tribunals and courts subordinate to it or where there has been a gross and manifest failure of justice or the basic principles of natural justice have been flouted. (h) in exercise of its power of superintendence high court cannot interfere to correct mere errors of law or fact or just because another view than the one taken by the tribunals or courts subordinate to it, is a possible view. in other words the jurisdiction has to be very sparingly exercised. (i) high court's power of superintendence under article 227 cannot be curtailed by any statute. it has been declared a part of the basic structure of the constitution by the constitution bench of this court in the case of l. chandra kumar vs. union of india & others, reported in (1997) 3 scc 261 and therefore abridgement by a constitutional amendment is also very doubtful. (j) it may be true that a statutory amendment of a rather cognate provision, like section 115 of the civil procedure code by the civil procedure code (amendment) act, 1999 does not and cannot cut down the ambit of high court's power under article 227. at the same time, it must be remembered that such statutory amendment does not correspondingly expand the high court's jurisdiction of superintendence under article 227. (k) the power is discretionary and has to be exercised on equitable principle. in an appropriate case, the power can be exercised suo motu. (l) on a proper appreciation of the wide and unfettered power of the high court under article 227, it transpires that the main object of this article is to keep strict administrative and judicial control by the high court on the administration of justice within its territory. (m) the object of superintendence, both administrative and judicial, is to maintain efficiency, smooth and orderly functioning of the entire machinery of justice in such a way as it does not bring it into any disrepute. the power of interference under this article is to be kept to the minimum to ensure that the wheel of justice does not come to a halt and the fountain of justice remains pure and unpolluted in order to maintain public confidence in the functioning of the tribunals and courts subordinate to high court. (n) this reserve and exceptional power of judicial intervention is not to be exercised just for grant of relief in individual cases but should be directed for promotion of public confidence in the administration of justice in the larger public interest whereas article 226 is meant for protection of individual grievance. therefore, the power under article 227 may be unfettered but its exercise is subject to high degree of judicial discipline pointed out above. (o) an improper and a frequent exercise of this power will be counter-productive and will divest this extraordinary power of its strength and vitality.\" 8.4 in the case of poonam manharlal bhagat v. dineshbhai bhuraji mali, reported in manu/gj/0543/2018 passed by this court in special civil application no.9192 of 2017 and allied matters on 10.7.2018, aforesaid decision of the supreme court in the case of shalini shyam shetty is followed. 8.5 in the case of hakam singh v. m/s.gammon (india) limited reported in air 1971 sc 740, the apex court observed as under:\"5. the argument of counsel for the appellant that the expression \"corporation\" in explanation ii includes only a statutory corporation and not a company registered under the indian companies act is, in our judgment, without substance. the code of civil procedure uses the expression \"corporation\" as meaning a legal person and includes a company registered under the indian companies act. order 29 of the code of civil procedure deals with suits by or against a corporation and there is nothing in the code of civil procedure that a corporation referred to under s.20 means only a statutory corporation and not a company registered under the indian companies act.\" 8.5 in the case of m/s.patel roadways limited, bombay v. m/s.prasad trading company reported in air 1992 sc 1514, the apex court observed as under:\"9. clauses (a) and (b) of s. 20 inter alia refer to a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the defendant inter alia \"carries on business\". clause(c) on the other hand refers to a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the cause of action wholly or in part arises. it has not been urged before us on behalf of the appellant that the cause of action wholly or in part arose in bombay. consequently cl. (c) is not attracted to the facts of these cases. what has been urged with the aid of the explanation to s. 20 of the code is that since the appellant has its principal office in bombay it shall be deemed to carry on business at bombay and consequently the courts at bombay will also have jurisdiction. on a plain reading of the explanation to s. 20 of the code we find an apparent fallacy in the aforesaid argument. the explanation is in two parts, one before the word \"or\" occurring between the words \"office in india\" and the words \"in respect of\" and the other thereafter. the explanation applies to a defendant which is a corporation which term, as seen above, would include even a company such as the appellant in the instant case. the first part of the explanation applies only to such a corporation which has its sole or principal office at a particular place. in that event the courts within whose jurisdiction the sole or principal office of the defendant is situate will also have jurisdiction inasmuch as even if the defendant may not be actually carrying on business at that place, it will \"be deemed to carry on business\" at that place because of the fiction created by the explanation. the latter part of the explanation takes care of a case where the defendant does not have a sole office but has a principal office at one place and has also a subordinate office at another place. the words \"at such place\" occurring at the end of the explanation and the word \"or\" referred to above which is disjunctive clearly suggest that if the case falls within the latter part of the explanation, it is not the court within whose jurisdiction the. principal office of the defendant is situate but the court within whose jurisdiction it has a subordinate office which alone shall have jurisdiction \"in respect of any cause of action arising at any place where it has also a subordinate office.\" 9. it is worth to refer to section 9 of the civil procedure code, which deals with the question of jurisdiction of the court, which reads as under:\"9. courts to try all civil suits unless barred. the courts shall (subject to the provisions herein contained) have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. [explanation i]a suit in which the right to property or to an office is contested is a suit of a civil nature, notwithstanding that such right may depend entirely on the decision of questions as to religious rites or ceremonies. [explanation-ii] for the purposes of this section, it is immaterial whether or not any fees are attached to the office referred to in explanation i or whether or not such office is attached to a particular place.]\" 10. considering the aforesaid provision, it is crystal clear that all litigants having a grievance of civil nature has, independently of any statute, a right to institute a suit in some court or other unless its cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. 11. it is a fundamental principle of law that where there is a right there is a remedy. accordingly, a litigant having a grievance of civil nature has, independently of any status, a right to institute a suit before some court or other unless its cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. it is well settled that every presumption should be made in favour of the jurisdiction of a civil court. 12. it is well settled that the jurisdiction of the civil court to which a right to decide a lis between the parties has been conferred can only be taken away by a statute in a specific terms and such execution of right, cannot be easily inferred because there is always a strong presumption that the civil courts have the jurisdiction to decide all questions of civil nature, therefore, if at all there has to be an inference the same should be in favour of the jurisdiction of the court rather than exclusion of such jurisdiction. it is also well settled that exclusion of jurisdiction of the civil courts is not to be readily inferred; such exclusion must be either explicitly expressed or clearly implied. the onus lies on the party seeking to oust the jurisdiction to establish his right to do so. the jurisdiction with reference to subject matter of a claim depends upon the allegations in the plaint and not upon the allegations in the written statement. the pith and substance of the plaint have to be kept in mind so also pith and substance of the relief sought for. the question of maintainability of a suit must be dealt with on the footing of the alllegations in the plaint being correct. if afterwards, allegations are found to be not correct, the suit is liable to be dismissed on its merits. admittedly, the suit has been filed for tortuous act of the defendant and for compensation thereof and, therefore, the impugned suit is clearly a civil suit. 13. now, so far as section 19 and section 20 of cpc are concerned, the same are as under:\"19. suits for compensation for wrongs to person or moveables where a suit is for compensation for wrong done to the person or to moveable property, if the wrong was done within the local limits of the jurisdiction of one court and the defendant resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, within the local limits of the jurisdiction of another court, the suit may be instituted at the option of the plaintiff in either of the said courts. 20. other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action arises subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction (a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the leave of the court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution; or (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises. [explanation] a corporation shall be deemed to carry on business at its sole or principal office in india or, in respect of any cause of action arising at any place where it has also a subordinate office, at such place.\" 14. in terms of section 19, suit for defamation could be filed at the place where the wrong is done or at the place where the author of the wrong resides or carries on business or personally works for gain. when the matter pertains to making defamatory statement, known to any person or persons other than the plaintiff himself then in that case, the court within whose territorial jurisdiction circulation of such defamatory statement is made has jurisdiction to try the suit for damages on the ground of defamation. however, if the torts are committed outside india then section 19 will not be applicable and the provisions of section 20 will apply. the provisions in section 20 deals with territorial jurisdiction of the court in respect of suits those relating to immovable property or for recovery of movable property under restraint or attachment. the court gets jurisdiction under this section if; (i) the defendant resides or carries on business or personally works for gain within local limits of its jurisdiction; or (ii) the cause of action arises, wholly or in part, within such local jurisdiction. it is well settled that in section 20, there are three sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c). each of the sub-clauses are connected by word \"or\". it is clear from the use of the word \"or\" in between different sub-clauses that each sub-clause is complete by itself and each gives a right to sue, subject to fulfillment of the conditions thereunder. if cause of action arise within the jurisdiction of a particular court, suit would be taken cognizance thereunder. the words \"at such place\" occurring at the end of the explanation to s.20 and the word \"or\" which is disjunctive clearly suggests that if the case falls within the later part of the explanation, i.e. where the defendant does not have a sole office but has a principal office at one place and has also a subordinate office at another place, it is not the court within whose jurisdiction the principal office of the defendant is situate but the court within whose jurisdiction it has subordinate office which alone shall have jurisdiction \"in respect of any cause of action arising at any place where it has also a subordinate office\". 15. further, under the explanation to section 20, a corporation is deemed to be carrying on business at its sole or principal office in india, or in respect of cause of action arising at any place where it has also a subordinate office at such a place. conversely, if no part of cause of action accrues at the place of branch office, the mere fact of the corporation having a branch office will not give the court of that place jurisdiction to entertain suit. a foreign company which got itself registered in india and carries on business there must be deemed to have had its principal office in india. it is well settled that the word \"corporation\" in the explanation includes not only statutory corporation but also company registered under the companies act. 16. the term \"cause of action\" which has been judicially defined as a bundle of facts is a comprehensive term not confined to only suits under the code of civil procedure stricto sensu but would also cover other proceedings as well. the explanation \"cause of action\" has been defined to mean every facts which it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of the court. it does not compromise every piece of evidence which is necessary to prove each fact, but every fact which is necessary to be proved. the cause of action does not depend upon the character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff but refers entirely to the grounds set forth in the plaint as a cause of action, upon which the plaintiff asks the court to arrive at a conclusion in his favour. it is well settled that entire plaint must be taken into consideration to ascertain the bundle of facts which gives rise to the cause of action and to determine whether any one or more of such facts occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. 17. the petitioner has also relied upon the provisions of section 34 of the specific relief act, which provides as under:\"34. discretion of court as to declaration of status or right.-any person entitled to any legal character, or to any right as to any property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or interested to deny, his title to such character or right, and the court may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is so entitled, and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any further relief: provided that no court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title, omits to do so. explanation.-a trustee of property is a \"person interested to deny\" a title adverse to the title of some one who is not inexistence, and for whom, if in existence, he would be a trustee.\" 18. in view of the above provision under section 34 of the special relief act, an action for declaration is the remedy to remove the cloud on the title to the property. any person entitled to any legal character or any right as to any property may institute suit against any person denying or interested to deny his title to such character or right. the court may in its discretion make a declaration that he is so entitled. the object of section 34 is to prevent further litigation. 19. further, section 34 of the specific relief act is pertaining to discretion, which lies with the court for declaration of status or right. section 34 is enough for civil courts to admit suits filed for a variety of declaratory reliefs, however, the proviso appended thereto clearly indicate that no court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff being able to seek further relief, than a mere declaration of title, omits to do so. now in the present case, the plaintiff has sought all the requisite reliefs in his suit and, therefore, there is no bar under section 34 of the specific relief act. 20. one of the contentions of the petitioner is regarding applicability of section 41 of the specific relief act, which provides as under:\"41. injunction when refused.-an injunction cannot be granted(a) to restrain any person from prosecuting a judicial proceeding pending at the institution of the suit in which the injunction is sought, unless such restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of proceedings; (b) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a court not sub-ordinate to that from which the injunction is sought; (c) to restrain any person from applying to any legislative body; (d) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a criminal matter; (e) to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced; (f) to prevent, on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is not reasonably clear that it will be a nuisance; (g) to prevent a continuing breach in which the plaintiff has acquiesced; (h) when equally efficacious relief can certainly be obtained by any other usual mode of proceeding except in case of breach of trust; (i) when the conduct of the plaintiff or his agents has been such as to disentitle him to be the assistance of the court; (j) when the plaintiff has no personal interest in the matter.\" 21. part iii of the special relief act deals with preventive relief. while the other sections in this part deal with grant of injunctions, section 41 specifies circumstances when injunction should not be granted. in effect, section 41 deals with the defences that may be set up in a suit for injunction, be it prohibitory or mandatory injunction. section 41 does not provide as to the point of jurisdiction of court to entertain suit, but it relates to circumstances when the injunction should be granted. 22. now, admittedly it is necessary for the plaintiff to state the facts, which gives rise to sue i.e. the cause of action. the entire plaint is required to be taken into consideration and not only the paragraph wherein in general terms the cause of action is narrated. in the present case, if we peruse the plaint, which is at page 44 to 66 of the paper book, it appears that at number of places the plaintiff has averred the facts which gives rise to filing of the present suit against the defendantpetitioner herein. certain important facts which emerge from the plaint are as under:\"post such inspection by the commissioners with expert, defendant launched their illegal campaign defaming plaintiff and published a note on all possible platforms including sarine's official website. some excerpts of the said notification/ press release dated 29th june 2017 as available on the defendant's website states: \"recent challenges by some in india who brazenly misappropriate sarine's technology and violate its intellectual property rights have compelled sarine to initiate lawsuits that take the battle against technology infringers to unprecedented levels. the lawsuits were filed in india where nearly 90% of the world's polished diamonds are produced. the legal actions are directed against a group of unscrupulous businessmen who infringe on sarine's patented technologies for internal inclusion mapping, and its copyrighted advisor tm software for rough diamond planning, in order to illicitly provide equipment and services to diamond manufacturers. based on sarine's claims, the courts in ahmedabad and surat have issued ex parte orders against these parties authorising immediate action by court-appointed commissioners to assertively investigate the matter. said court commissioners yesterday conducted concurrent raids on four known locations in which the infringing parties operate. the high court of gujarat at ahmedabad has also taken into consideration sarine's request that, immediately upon submission of the reports by the court commissioners, the infringers be restrained. david block, chief executive officer of sarine said, \"for the past twenty-plus years, sarine's innovative and ground-breaking technologies have assisted the diamond industry in india to achieve ever increasing levels of manufacturing sophistication, higher yields and better quality, all at a reduced level of risk, thereby enhancing its profitability and enabling it to effectively dominate world diamond production. it is unfortunate that a limited number of unscrupulous parties are tainting the entire indian diamond industry. we are encouraged by the courts' swift action, their understanding of the gravity of the situation, and their implementation of immediate steps to protect sarine's legal rights. we trust that the measures necessary to completely halt these blatantly illicit activities will be implemented not only to protect sarine, but also to safeguard integrity of india's diamond industry that relies so heavily on the public's trust, and to encourage sarine to continue introducing more advanced technologies for the india diamond market.\" 22. the contents, and the loaded tone and tenor of the said press release clearly show the lack of objectivity and merely establish the fact the defendant has selectively put forth the facts while concealing material facts. further, naming plaintiff as \"unscrupulous parties/ businessmen\" clearly manifests the nefarious motive of the defendant in publishing the notification. further it was grossly misrepresented that the court at ahmedabad and surat issued ex parte orders which is blantant lie. in fact, surat district court has rejected the application by defendant for the reason one gspn exim has already filed revocation petition aginst patent in'271425. being aggrieved by this order of surat district court, plaintiff appealed and high court of gujarat and on some purported false tall claims, defendant managed to get the orders. such act of publishing press release with gross misinterpretation is merely to damage the plaintiff's reputation in the industry. certain blatant statements such as calling plaintiff a \"unscrupulous parties\" is clear defamation of plaintiff and is liable for legal action which plaintiff reserve to initiate appropriate course of action. post inspection by commissioners, plaintiff did make their appearance in the matter to lead/defend their case and the matter was remanded back by the hon'ble court of gujarat vide order dated 18/07/2017 wherein learned senior advocates appearing for both parties state that instead of considering the question as to grant of ex-parte injunction, it will be appropriate if the trial court is directed to finally decide the injunction applications within time-bound period. 23. further, defendant through their ceo, david block made announcement vide press release dated 24th august, 2017 published on their official portal, addressing the customer and colleague, which is as follows: \"in line of those announcements, sarine filed lawsuits against diyora & bhanderi corporation and its related companies (\"dcb\") on june 5, 2017 for patent and copyright infringement, and asked the court for the immediate appointment of commissioners to investigate the matter and for an injunction against dcb to immediately halt all infringing activity. although initially denied at the district court, the high court of gujarat granted sarine's request for the urgent appointment of commissioners to investigate the dcb premises, which investigators were carried out without warning on numerous dcb premises on june 29th. the request for an injunction against dcb will be heard within a few weeks by the district court based on the extensive evidence found by the commissioners. unfortunately, dcb has issued numerous false statements in an attempt to mislead our customers and the industry at large claiming that no relief was granted to sarine in this matter and that the case is closed. in truth, significance relief was granted through the appointment of the commissioners, and the case is continuing rapidly towards the injunction hearing in the district court at the specific order of the high court. . sarine is intensifying its steps to protect its property and legal rights whatever appropriate, and will include actions to prevent the illegal manufacture, distribution, sale, purchase or use of galaxy clones and pirated software, whether it be by dcb or other perpetrators in india or elsewhere in the world.\" 41. the cause of action arose in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants on 24th august 2017 when the defendant published first misleading statement against plaintiff. a fresh cause of action arose in september-october 2017 when defendant issued letters to businesses in united states including rogers & holland against plaintiff and again arose in october 2017 when rogers & holland wrote to client of plaintiff urging to undertake not to deal or trade with plaintiff. the suit is, therefore, within limitation. 42. the hon'ble court has the territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate upon the present suit as a part of the cause of action has arisen within the territorial limits of this hon'ble court wherein other suits originated by the defendant are being pleaded and by virtue of letter being sent by rogers & holland on provocation of defendant to various clients of plaintiff based in surat urging not to trade with plaintiff or confirm that they are not trading with plaintiff.\" 23. in addition to it, from letter dated 24.8.2017 issued by sarin technologies (page 176), wherein filing of suit against the plaintiff-respondent herein has been narrated and it also appears from the press release issued by the petitioner wherein also the suits filed by petitioner herein has also been mentioned therein. it also reveals from page 206, that razors and holland-ashcroft and oak has issued letters to their valued partner, wherein also indirectly referred to the original plaintiffrespondent herein. 24. on perusal of all the material placed on record, it clearly appears that the press release was issued by the petitioner herein against the respondent-original plaintiff. it also reveals that press release and internal correspondence also, directly and indirectly, deals with the conduct of the present plaintiff. now, it is well settled that any communication or press release, though issued from outside, if it is published and it is likely to have effect on the public at large in a particular place, then the court of that last mentioned place has jurisdiction to entertain the dispute between the parties. in the present case, as alleged by the plaintiff, so-called internal communication by the defendant has been published in surat, which has effected to his business in surat. it also reveals from the plaint as well as the documentary evidence, as referred to above, that the plaintiff has placed on record, prima facie material showing that cause of action has arisen in the territorial jurisdiction of the surat court. therefore, the version of the petitioner that the civil court at surat has no jurisdiction, in the peculiar circumstances of the case, cannot be acceded to. 25. admittedly, present petition is filed under article 227 of the constitution of india, therefore, this is a supervisory jurisdiction whereunder the high court exercises powers of superintendence in respect of the orders, proceedings and all the courts and forums, which are subordinate to the high court. it is also well settled that this power of superintendence conferred by article 227 is to be exercised most sparingly and only in appropriate cases, in order to keep the subordinate courts within the bounds of their authority and not for correcting mere errors. in view of this and on perusal of the impugned order of the learned trial court, it is crystal clear that the trial court has not committed any serious error of facts and law in rejecting the application filed by present petitioner under order 7, rule11 of cpc. therefore, considering the aforesaid factual aspects and circumstances of the case, the order of learned trial court is sustainable in the eyes of law and the same does not warrant any interference. 26. in view of above, present petition is liable to be dismissed. accordingly, it is dismissed. considering the facts and circumstances of the case, learned trial court is hereby directed to see to it that special civil suit no.191 of 2018 is disposed of as expeditiously as possible preferably within six months from the date of receipt of this order. both the parties are directed to cooperate with learned trial court for disposal of the suit in the time bound manner. interim relief stands vacated. no order as to costs. 27. in view of above order, connected civil applications are disposed of.
