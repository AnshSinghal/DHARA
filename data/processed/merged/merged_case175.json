The factual matrix of the case in brief is that certain disputes  arose in a contract executed between the present respondent and the appellant No.2. The appellant No.1 was a nodal agency for execution of the said contract. Appellant No.1 - M.P. Road Development Corporation is a instrumentality of the State of M.P. and appellant No.2 is Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India. \n3. The dispute arising between the parties were referred to an Arbitration Tribunal consisting of three members. The arbitral award was passed on 14.01.2023 to the tune of Rs.294.00 crore (wrongly mentioned in impugned order passed by the Commercial Court as 3.88 crore). The said award was challenged by the present appellants before the Commercial Court, Bhopal in terms of Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The application under Section 34(1) was filed before the Commercial Court on 10.05.2023 and it was registered on 11.05.2023. Thus, it is admitted between the parties that the application was filed after a period of three months and 27 days from the date of receipt of copy of award by email on 14.01.2023. Thus, admittedly, the application under Section 34 (1) was filed by the present appellant before the Commercial Court with the delay of 27 days. \n4. As per Section 34 (3) of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short referred to as 'Act of 1996') special limitation is prescribed for submitting application for setting aside award, which is three months and as per proviso to Section 34(3), it has been provided that the Court may entertain the application within a further period of 30 days, but not thereafter. \n5 . T he present appellants had submitted an application under Section 34(3) for condonation of delay of 27 days, which was within the condonable period of 30 days as laid down under Section 34(3) of Act of 1996. \n6. The said application was contested by the present respondent and the Commercial Court vide impugned order dated 03.11.2023 has rejected the application under Section 34(3) on the ground that day to day explanation has not been offered for the delay and therefore, the delay cannot be condoned. Resultantly, the application under Section 34(1) seeking to challenge the award has also been rejected. \n7. Learned counsel for the appellant has stated that the monetary value of the award is Rs.294.00 crore and the delay was only 27 days, which was within the condonable period of 30 days. Therefore, the Commercial Court should not have scuttled the challenge made to award in such a manner and the appellants challenge to the said award was liable to be considered on merits. \n8. It is further submitted that due explanation was offered in application under Section 34 (3) of Act of 1996, but the Commercial Court has wrongly rejected the said application on irrelevant considerations. \n9. Learned counsel for the appellant by referring to the application under Section 34(3) filed before the Commercial Court has submitted that the contract was in the matter of concession agreement dated 25.01.2012 for development of four laning of Rewa to MP/UP Border Section of NH-7 Project on BOT basis in the State of M.P. The work was awarded by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India ('MoRTH' for short) and the appellant No.1, which is a instrumentality of State of M.P., was the executing nodal agency. \n10. It is further submitted that the award allowing the claims of present respondent to the tune of Rs.294.00 crore was passed by the Arbitral Tribunal on 14.01.2023, which was received by email on 14.01.2023. Thus, the limitation to challenge the award was till 13.04.2023, which is when the period of three months ended. It is submitted that delay was caused due to administrative exigencies, because there were many changes in the position of Managing Director of the appellant No.1, which was the main contestant in the case. Appellant No.1 being Nodal Agency of appellant No.2 for this contract, had sought administrative approval of MoRTH vide letter dated 27.01.2023 to file the application under Section 34 of Act of 1996 for setting aside the award dated 14.01.2023. Reminder was sent on 15.02.2023 for the same purpose and the MoRTH finally give their consent on 21.02.2023. Thereafter, the appellant No.1 vide its letter dated 24.03.2023 and 12.04.2023 also sought approval for appointment of Advocate and his fees schedule and got approval from MoRTH vide letter dated 26.04.2023.\n11. The case file was running in almost 3000 pages and some time was taken by the Advocate to study the huge set of documents and thereafter, the matter was forwarded to legal cell of the appellants for their study. After getting final approval and vetting the contents of application, the legal department of appellants had forwarded back the draft of application with instructions to the Advocate to file the same at the earliest. Therefore, the petition was made on 09.05.2023 and filed on 10.05.2023, which is with the delay of 27 days after expiry of three months from the date of receipt of copy of award. \n12. Learned counsel for the appellants further submits that the appellant No.1 is an instrumentality of the State and appellant No.2 is the Government of India itself. The manner of construing delay in cases of State are on different footings as compared to that of the private litigants. The State and its instrumentality functions through impersonal machinery, which usually takes some more time as compared to the time taken by a private litigant to take such type of decision. Learned counsel for the appellants further stated that the explanation offered by the appellants was not excuse, but it was in fact explanation. It is argued that it was thought appropriate that the appellant No.1 being Nodal Agency of the contract should challenge the award along with the appellant No.2, which would be in the best interest of the appellants. \n13. Getting approval of the same, getting approval of the Advocate and getting approval for payment of fees were three different events, which were to be settled between the appellant Nos.1 and 2 and this process took sometime. Thus, it is stated that the explanation offered by the present appellants duly narrated sufficient cause for such delay, which ought to have condoned. \n14. Learned for the appellants has relied on the following judgments in support of his contentions:-\ni. Chintnels India Limited vs. Bhayana Builders Private Limited (2021) 4 SCC 602.\nii. Union of India vs. Popular Construction Co. (2001) 8 SCC iii. Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Limited vs. Maheshbhai Tinabhai Rathod and others (2022) 4 SCC 162. iv. Collector, Land Acquisition Anantnag and another vs. Ms. Katiji and others (1987) 2 SCC 107.\nv. Ramlal, Motilal and Chhotelal vs. Rewa Coalfields Ltd., AIR 1962 SC 361.\nvi. State of Haryana vs. Chandra Mani and others (1996) 3 SCC vii. Haryana Urban Develpment Authority, Karnal vs. Mehta Construction Company and another (2022) 5 SCC 432.\n15. Lastly, it is contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the respondent should not be shy of contesting the matter on merits before the Commercial Court and as huge stakes of Government to the tune of Rs.294.00 crore are involved in the matter, it is in public interest that the delay should be condoned and the matter be contested on merits.\n16. Sounding a contrary note, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent has argued that the considerations available to condone delay under Section 5 of Limitation Act are not relevant for the purpose of condoning the delay under Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996. Highlighting the stricter language employed in Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996, it is argued by learned counsel for the respondents that the consideration under Section 5 of the Limitation Act is that the applicant should satisfy the Court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or application within the prescribed limitation period. On the contrary, the language employed in proviso to Section 34(3) is \"prevented by sufficient cause\". Thus, it is contended that by stronger language used by the legislature, which is in consonance with the purpose for which the Act of 1996 has been enacted, i.e. to ensure speedy disposal of commercial disputes. \n17. It is further submitted by learned Senior Counsel that the office of appellant No.1 is located at Bhopal while Regional Office of MoRTH is also located at Bhopal and both are in the same locality. Thus, the appellants cannot rely on red-tapism to seek condonation of delay of 27 days. \n18. It is further submitted by learned Senior Counsel for the respondent that delay is not required to be explained only from 13.04.2023 till 10.05.2023, but also from the very first date from 14.01.2023 when the award was passed. It is argued by learned Senior Counsel that diligency and seriousness of the appellants should flow from the very first date on which award was communicated. \n19. Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent further submits by referring to document Annexure A-8 that the Ministry had given concurrence to challenge the arbitration award by appellant No.1 on behalf of both the appellants on 21.02.2023 itself, but despite that the appellants did not take urgent steps to file application under Section 34(1). Thus, it is a sheer case of lethargy and no explanation has been offered by the appellants, rather it is an excuse. Learned Senior Counsel has argued at length that 'excuse' differs from an 'explanation' and the State instrumentality is not at liberty to create and project excuses. Rather they should be more vigilant and should come out with explanations. The present case, it is argued, is utterly devoid of any explanation. \n20. It is further argued by learned Senior Counsel that the latest judicial trend is that no special privilege should be granted to the State instrumentality in the matter of condonation of delay and they should be treated at par with a private litigant in the matter of condonation of delay. Learned Senior Counsel has relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of M.P. v. Bherulal, (2020) 10 SCC 654 and Sheo Raj Singh v. Union of India, (2023) 10 SCC 531.\n21. Learned Senior Counsel further argued at length that to demonstrate the meaning and import of stricter language employed in Section 34(3) by the using the word \"prevent\". Learned Senior Counsel has referred to various dictionaries and legal glossary to bring home his argument that the word prevent means some action that actually prevented someone from acting to do some act. Thus, it must be some act of hindering or impeding a process. Administrative delays, it is argued, is not an act of hindrance, but it is part of process. Thus, administrative correspondence and communications cannot be taken to be an act, which \"prevent\" a State instrumentality from seeking challenge to the award within the time limit of three months. \n22. It is further argued by learned Senior Counsel that days to day delay has to be explained and the present appellants have failed to explain day to day delay before the Commercial Court. Thus, the appellants cannot be given any premium for their own lethargy and inactions. \n23. Learned Senior Counsel has also argued that expiry of limitation period invests invaluable right in the party in whose favour of the decree or order is made. Thus, condonation of delay brings to life an extinguished right. Thus, the Court should be slow in condonation of delay, even if it is for a short period of 27 days. It is argued by learned Senior Counsel that the award has become enforceable upon expiry of three months and the appellants just want to deny the fruits of the award to the respondent by making a belated challenge to the award, which cannot be countenanced. \n24. Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent has relied on the following judgments in support of his submissions :-\n\"i. Ministry of Youth Affair and Sports, Department of Ports Government of India vs. Ernst and Young Pvt. Ltd. 2023 SCC OnLine Del 5182.\nii. P. Radha Bai and others vs. P.

Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.\n26. The question that arises for consideration in the present appeal is whether the appellant herein had made out a case for condonation of delay of 27 days and whether the Commercial Court was correct in taking the view that the delay of 27 days in filing application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 which was within the statutory limit of 30 days was not properly explained. \n27. Learned counsel for the appellant has argued at length to submit that time was spent in inter office correspondence and also due to the fact that appellant No. 1 was Nodal Agency of the project while the appellant No. 2 i.e. Union of India, MoRTH was the actual agency that has awarded the contract to the present respondent. The time was spent in arriving at consensus between the parties to make a common challenge to the award before the Commercial Court in terms of the Section 34 of the Act of 1996. \n28. Upon perusal of the application for condonation of delay filed before the Commercial Court as well as the documents that were brought on record before the Commercial Court and are on record before this Court also with the memo of appeal, following facts emerges:- \n( a ) The award was passed on 14.01.2023 which seems to have been communicated to the appellants on that date itself by email. The limitation was thus admittedly upto 13.04.2023. \n(b) The appellant No. 1 made a request to the appellant No. 2 to give its concurrence to file application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 vide letter dated 27.01.2023. By this letter it was pointed out to the MoRTH that appellant No. 1 is the authority acting for and on behalf of MoRTH as per the concession agreement and this permission is required for further necessary action. This letter is brought on record as Annexure A/6. \n(c) By letter dated 15.02.2023 (Annexure A/7), the appellant No. 1 submitted a reminder to the MoRTH. \n(d) Vide letter dated 21.02.2023 (Annexure P/8) the MoRTH informed the appellant No. 1 that the competent authority in the Ministry has given concurrence to challenge the award by appellant No. 1 on behalf of appellant No. 1 as well as MoRTH. \n(e) Thereafter, a letter dated 24.03.2023 was sent by the appellant No. 1 to the appellant No. 2 proposing the name of counsel to be appointed and also the fees being claimed by the said counsel and approval was sought from the MoRTH because the financial liability was to fall on MoRTH. This letter is Annexure A/9.\n(f) Vide letter dated 12.04.2023, a reminder was sent to MoRTH by the appellant No.1. \n(g) By letter dated 26.04.2023 the Regional Officer of MoRTH located at Bhopal, after obtaining approval of competent authority in the Ministry approved the fees payable to the Advocate as claimed by him. \n2 9 . It is the contention of the appellant that after the Ministry at New Delhi approved the fees schedule of the Advocate, the appellant No. 1 instructed the Advocate to file application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 and the Advocate was required to study the case papers running into 3000 pages which took time and thereafter the draft was vetted by the legal department and then application under Section 34 was filed on 10.05.2023 and the delay is natural and not something which can be said to be an excuse and not an explanation.\n30. Learned counsel for the appellants has also stated that the final approval letter issued by MoRTH clearly mentioned that it has been issued after obtaining approval of competent authority of the Ministry. It is contended that the Regional Officer had to obtain approval of competent authority of the Ministry located at New Delhi and then the Regional Officer communicated approval to the appellant No. 1 on 26.04.2023. The aforesaid facts clearly show that on the date, the limitation expired i.e. on 13.04.2023, a reminder was pending before the MoRTH to give approval to fee schedule which had been submitted to MoRTH on 24.03.2023. MoRTH approved the fee schedule and communicated the fact of approval vide letter dated 26.04.2023. Thus, after expiry of limitation period the delay can be divided into two spells i.e. from 13.04.2023 till 26.04.2023 which is period for which approval was pending before MoRTH and second spell from 26.04.2023 till 10.05.2023 which was the time spent in study of the case, preparation of application and filing of the same. \n31. It has been vehemently argued by the counsel for respondent that there was no legal requirement for both the appellants to arrive at a consensus to challenge the award together. The appellant No. 1 could have challenged the award on its own without waiting for consent of the Ministry. \n32. In the opinion of this Court, it is for the party or parties to the lis to decide to challenge the award by filing a joint application or filing separate application. The appellant no. 1 was only a nodal agency of the project which has been awarded by appellant No. 2. If the appellant No. 1 felt that in absence of challenge to award by appellant No. 2, its application would not be effective, such a logic and reasoning adopted by the appellant No. 1 cannot be said to be something which may dis-entitle the appellants from challenging the award as some time was spent in arriving at consensus. \n33. The facts of the case show that the time which was spent was the time spent in arriving at a consensus to challenge the award jointly and in approval of the professional fees claimed by Advocate which was submitted to the appellant No. 1 and then sent for approval to appellant no. 2. As discussed above, the challenge to award by the appellant No. 1 without there being challenge by appellant no. 2 would not have made the challenge by appellant no. 1 alone effective. Thus, if to make an effective challenge to award, some time was spent in arriving at an consensus, it cannot be said to be an excuse. It appears to be a sufficient cause in terms of proviso to Section 34 (3) of the Act of 1996. \n34. It has been argued at length that the language employed in Section 34(3) is \"prevent\" which is stricter language than the language employed in Section 5 of Limitation Act. Thus, it has been argued at length that the Commercial Court was justified in rejecting the application for condonation of delay because what has been shown by the appellants as sufficient cause, is not cause but excuse. It has been argued that the word \"prevent\" is stricter and it required stricter standard for condonation of delay. \n35. The learned senior counsel for the respondent has argued that the factum of approval etc. is not a event which \"prevented\" the appellants from challenging the award. In the opinion of this Court the word \"prevent\" does not mean only obstruction by physical force. \"Prevent\" may be something which may hinder or impede or stop happening of any event. As has already held above, the time spent at arriving at consensus was something which was bona fide and thus it can be said to be a sufficient cause which prevented the appellants from making an application within the prescribed limitation of three months. \n36. It has been argued that the appellant No. 1 could have appointed an Advocate even in anticipation of approval of the fees from the appellant No. 2. Upon perusal of the record, it is clearly evident that the appellant No. 1 had sent the same for approval to appellant No. 2 because MOU dated 30.09.2009, fees of the Advocate is to be borne and approved by MoRTH and this fact was being pointed out by appellant No.1 to appellant No. 2. The appellant No. 1 could not have incurred liability which was to be borne by the appellant No. 2 without its consent. Advocate cannot be expected to proceed ahead without settling the professional fee and thus, these facts also make out sufficient cause preventing filing of application to challenge the award. \n37. So far as the time spent after final approval dated 26.04.2023 is concerned, it is mentioned in the application for condonation of delay filed before the Commercial Court that the Advocate was supplied case papers running into 3000 pages and after studying the case file and other documents, the application was prepared on 08.05.2023 which was forwarded to the legal cell of the appellant for study. After the same was vetted and approved by legal cell of the appellants, the draft was forwarded to the concerning Advocate at the earliest and it was filed on 10.05.2023. Thus, the delay of 12 days is on account of the Advocate going through 3000 pages of case material and preparing the application. \n38. Stake in this case is very high to the extent of Rs. 294.00 crores. An Advocate is expected to apply the best of his professional wisdom in drafting a pleading and to take all possible grounds and narrate all relevant facts in drafting the pleading. If the Advocate took 12 days time to study the case papers running into 3000 pages, find out the relevant facts and to arrive at grounds to be taken by applying his professional wisdom and then drafting the application, 12 days time cannot be said to be a time spent which is excessive. \n39. It has been argued by learned senior counsel for respondent that no premium can be given to the instrumentality of the State for delay caused by red-tapism in legal matters. Learned counsel for the respondent has argued at length that Government Agencies and instrumentalities are not entitled for any special limitation and special treatment in the matter of limitation just to protect their red-tapism. \n40. Learned counsel has relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Simplex Infrastructure Ltd. Vs. Union of India reported in (2019) 2 SCC 455. In the said case it has been held that the Court could not have condoned the delay of 514 days on account of administrative correspondence and obtaining approval. However, upon perusal of the para 20 of this judgment, it is evident that the said case is one of condonation of 514 days which is certainly beyond 30 days period for which delay is condonable as per Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996. Thus, this judgment cannot be employed to hold that the delay caused within the cononable period of 30 days cannot be condoned in the present case. \n41. Learned Senior counsel for the respondent has further relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Uttar Prades & others Vs. Satish Chand Shivhare and Brothers 2022 SCC OnLine SC 2151. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said case has held that liberal approach does not mean that appeal should be allowed, even if the cause for delay shown is glimsy. It has been held that the Court should not waive limitation for all practical purposes by condoning inordinate delay caused by a tardy negligent manner of the functioning. However, the said case was condonation of delay of 337 days in filing appeal under Section 37 of Act of 1996. The delay was beyond the statutory limit of 120 days for filing appeal under Section 37 of the Act of 1996. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the petitioner therein failed to show sufficient cause for condonation of inordinate delay of 337 days. The considerations for condoning delay of 337 days cannot be strictly employed for condoning delay of 27 days, though it is true that the cause shown is relevant and not the length of delay. \n42. Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent has also relied on judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sheoraj Singh Vs. Union of India (2023) 10 SCC 531. Learned senior counsel has stated that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in the said case that 'explanation' is different from an 'excuse'. An 'explanation' is designed to give someone all the facts and lay out the cause for something. Thus, care must be taken to distinguish and 'explanation' from an 'excuse'. An 'excuse' is offered by a person to deny responsibility and consequences when under attack. It is sort of defensive action. It has further been held that it is only 'excuses' and not 'explanation' that is more often accepted for condonation of long delay and such condonation of long delay is often made to safeguard public interest from those hidden forces whose sole agenda is to ensure that a meritorious claim does not reach the higher court for adjudication. Thus, it has been argued that the Commercial Court was right in refusing to condone the delay of 27 days, even though it was within the condonable limit. \n43. In the aforesaid judgment the Hon'ble Supreme Court has in fact held that condonation of delay caused by Union of India to be just and proper. In the present case, admittedly the value of award is Rs. 294.00 crores and the delay is 27 days. As narrated above in this order the matter was continuously under correspondence between the appellant No. 1 and appellant No. 2. In the aforesaid judgment Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:-\n\"41. Having bestowed serious consideration to the rival contentions, we feel that the High Court's decision [Union of India v. Sheo Raj, 2011 SCC OnLine Del 5511] to condone the delay on account of the first respondent's inability to present the appeal within time, for the reasons assigned therein, does not suffer from any error warranting interference. A s the aforementioned judgments have shown, such an exercise of discretion does, at times, call for a liberal and justice-oriented approach by the courts, where certain leeway could be provided to the State. The hidden forces that are at work in preventing an appeal by the State being presented within the prescribed period of limitation so as not to allow a higher court to pronounce upon the legality and validity of an order of a lower court and thereby secure unholy gains, can hardly be ignored. Impediments in the working of the grand scheme of governmental functions have to be removed by taking a pragmatic view on balancing of the competing interests.\" \n(Emphasis Supplied) 4 4 . While arriving at the aforesaid conclusion the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the earlier judgment of the Supreme Court wherein the delay caused by the Government or its instrumentalities were condoned. The relevant is as under:-\n\"26. G. Ramegowda v. LAO [G. Ramegowda v. LAO, (1988) 2 SCC 142] , while summarising the position of law on \"sufficient cause\", had the occasion to observe that the contours of the area of discretion of the courts in the matter of condonation of delays in filing appeals have been set out in a number of pronouncements of this Court. It was observed to be true that there is no general principle saving the party from all mistakes of its the counsel. Noting that there is no reason why the opposite side should be exposed to a time-barred appeal if there was negligence, deliberate or gross inaction or lack of bona fides on the part of the party or its the counsel, it was further observed that each case will have to be considered on the particularities of its own special facts. However, this Court reiterated that the expression \"sufficient cause\" in Section 5 must receive a liberal construction so as to advance substantial justice and generally delays in preferring appeals are required to be condoned in the interest of justice where no gross negligence or deliberate inaction or lack of bona fides is imputable to the party seeking condonation of the delay. This was followed by these words : (SCC p. 148, paras 15 & 17) \"15. In litigations to which Government is a party there is yet another aspect which, perhaps, cannot be ignored. If appeals brought by Government are lost for such defaults, no person is individually affected; but what, in the ultimate analysis, suffers is public interest. The decisions of Government are collective and institutional decisions and do not share the characteristics of decisions of private individuals. \n*** \n17. Therefore, in assessing what, in a particular case, constitutes \"sufficient cause\" for purposes of Section 5, it might, perhaps, be somewhat unrealistic to exclude from the considerations that go into the judicial verdict, these factors which are peculiar to and characteristic of the functioning of the government. Governmental decisions are proverbially slow encumbered, as they are, by a considerable degree of procedural red tape in the process of their making. A certain amount of latitude is, therefore, not impermissible. It is rightly said that those who bear responsibility of Government must have \"a little play at the joints\". Due recognition of these limitations on governmental functioning -- of course, within reasonable limits -- is necessary if the judicial approach is not to be rendered unrealistic. It would, perhaps, be unfair and unrealistic to put government and private parties on the same footing in all respects in such matters. Implicit in the very nature of governmental functioning is procedural delay incidental to the decision-making process. \"\n27. Katiji [Collector (LA) v. Katiji, (1987) 2 SCC 107] was also noticed by a Bench of three Hon'ble Judges of this Court in State of Haryana v. Chandra Mani [State of Haryana v. Chandra Mani, (1996) 3 SCC 132] where we find the following discussion :\n(Chandra Mani case [State of Haryana v. Chandra Mani, (1996) 3 SCC 132] , SCC p. 138, para 11) \"11. ... When the State is an applicant, praying for condonation of delay, it is common knowledge that on account of impersonal machinery and the inherited bureaucratic methodology imbued with the note-making, file-pushing, and passing-on-the-buck ethos, delay on the part of the State is less difficult to understand though more difficult to approve, but the State represents collective cause of the community. It is axiomatic that decisions are taken by officers/agencies proverbially at slow pace and encumbered process of pushing the files from table to table and keeping it on table for considerable time causing delay -- intentional or otherwise -- is a routine. Considerable delay of procedural red-tape in the process of their making decision is a common feature. Therefore, certain amount of latitude is not impermissible. If the appeals brought by the State are lost for such default no person is individually affected but what in the ultimate analysis suffers, is public interest. The expression \"sufficient cause\" should, therefore, be considered with pragmatism in justice- oriented approach rather than the technical detection of sufficient cause for explaining every day's delay. The factors which are peculiar to and characteristic of the functioning of the governmental conditions would be cognizant to and requires adoption of pragmatic approach in justice-oriented process.\"\n28. This Court in Tehsildar (LA) v. K.V. Ayisumma [Tehsildar (LA) v. K.V. Ayisumma, (1996) 10 SCC 634] , had the occasion to observe that it would not be necessary for the State to provide a day-to-day explanation of delay while seeking condonation of the same. The relevant observations therein read as follows : (SCC p. 635, para 2) \" 2 . It is now settled law that when the delay was occasioned at the behest of the Government, it would be very difficult to explain the day-to-day delay. The transaction of the business of the Government was being d o n e leisurely by officers who had no or evince no personal interest at different levels . No one takes personal responsibility in processing the matters expeditiously. As a fact at several stages, they take their own time to reach a decision. Even in spite of pointing at the delay, they do not take expeditious action for ultimate decision in filing the appeal. This case is one of such instances. It is true that Section 5 of the Limitation Act envisages explanation of the delay to the satisfaction of the court and in matters of Limitation Act made no distinction between the State and the citizen. Nonetheless adoption of strict standard of proof leads to grave miscarriage of public justice. It would result in public mischief by skilful management of delay in the process of filing the appeal. The approach of the Court should be pragmatic but not pedantic. Under those circumstances, the Subordinate Judge has rightly adopted correct approach and had condoned the delay without insisting upon explaining every day's delay in filing the review application in the light of the law laid down by this Court. The High Court was not right in setting aside the order. Delay was rightly condoned.\"\n45. In the case of State of Nagaland Vs. Lipok A.O. & others (2005) 3 SCC 752 it has been held as under:-\n\"9. What constitutes sufficient cause cannot be laid down by hard- and-fast rules. In New India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Shanti Misra [(1975) 2 SCC 840] this Court held that discretion given by Section 5 should not be defined or crystallised so as to convert a discretionary matter into a rigid rule of law. The expression \"sufficient cause\" should receive a liberal construction. In Brij Indar Singh v. Kanshi Ram [ILR (1918) 45 Cal 94 : AIR 1917 PC 156] it was observed that true guide for a court to exercise the discretion under Section 5 is whether the appellant acted with reasonable diligence in prosecuting the appeal. In Shakuntala Devi Jain v. Kuntal Kumari [(1969) 1 SCR 1006 : AIR 1969 SC 575] a Bench of three Judges had held that unless want of bona fides of such inaction or negligence as would deprive a party of the protection of Section 5 is proved, the application must not be thrown out or any delay cannot be refused to be condoned. \n10. In Concord of India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Nirmala Devi [(1979) 4 SCC 365 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 996] which is a case of negligence of the counsel which misled a litigant into delayed pursuit of his remedy, the default in delay was condoned. In Lala Mata Din v. A. Narayanan [(1969) 2 SCC 770] this Court had held that there is no general proposition that mistake of counsel by itself is always sufficient cause for condonation of delay. It is always a question whether the mistake was bona fide or was merely a device to cover an ulterior purpose. In that case it was held that the mistake committed by the counsel was bona fide and it was not tainted by any mala fide motive. \n11. In State of Kerala v. E.K. Kuriyipe [1981 Supp SCC 72] it was held that whether or not there is sufficient cause for condonation of delay is a question of fact dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case. In Milavi Devi v. Dina Nath [(1982) 3 SCC 366] it was held that the appellant had sufficient cause for not filing the appeal within the period of limitation. This Court under Article 136 can reassess the ground and in appropriate case set aside the order made by the High Court or the Tribunal and remit the matter for hearing on merits. It was accordingly allowed, delay was condoned and the case was remitted for decision on merits. \n12. In O.P. Kathpalia v. Lakhmir Singh [(1984) 4 SCC 66] a Bench o f three Judges had held that if the refusal to condone the delay results in grave miscarriage of justice, it would be a ground to condone the delay. Delay was accordingly condoned. In Collector, Land Acquisition v. Katiji [(1987) 2 SCC 107] a Bench of two Judges considered the question of limitation in an appeal filed by the State and held that Section 5 was enacted in order to enable the court to do substantial justice to the parties by disposing of matters on merits. The expression \"sufficient cause\" is adequately elastic to enable the court to apply the law in a meaningful manner which subserves the ends of justice -- that being the life purpose for the existence of the institution of courts. It is common knowledge that this Court has been making a justifiably liberal approach in matters instituted in this Court. But the message does not appear to have percolated down to all the other courts in the hierarchy. This Court reiterated that the expression \"every day's delay must be explained\" does not mean that a pedantic approach should be made. The doctrine must be applied in a rational, common-sense, pragmatic manner. When substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay. There is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately, or on account of culpable negligence, or on account of mala fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit by resorting to delay. In fact he runs a serious risk. Judiciary is not respected on account of its power to legalise injustice on technical grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is expected to do so. Making a justice-oriented approach from this perspective, there was sufficient cause for condoning the delay in the institution of the appeal. The fact that it was the State which was seeking condonation and not a private party was altogether irrelevant. The doctrine of equality before law demands that all litigants, including the State as a litigant, are accorded the same treatment and the law is administered in an even-handed manner. There is no warrant for according a stepmotherly treatment when the State is the applicant. The delay was accordingly condoned. \n13. Experience shows that on account of an impersonal machinery (no one in charge of the matter is directly hit or hurt by the judgment sought to be subjected to appeal) and the inherited bureaucratic methodology imbued with the note-making, file- pushing, and passing-on-the-buck ethos, delay on its part is less difficult to understand though more difficult to approve. The State which represents collective cause of the community, does not deserve a litigant-non-grata status. The courts, therefore, have to be informed with the spirit and philosophy of the provision in the course of the interpretation of the expression of sufficient cause. Merit is preferred to scuttle a decision on merits in turning down the case on technicalities of delay in presenting the appeal. Delay as accordingly condoned, the order was set aside and the matter was remitted to the High Court for disposal on merits after affording opportunity of hearing to the parties. In Prabha v. Ram Parkash Kalra [1987 Supp SCC 339] this Court had held that the court should not adopt an injustice-oriented approach in rejecting the application for condonation of delay. The appeal was allowed, the delay was condoned and the matter was remitted for expeditious disposal in accordance with law\". \n46. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 16 of the aforesaid judgment has also held that the adoption of strict standard of proof sometime fails to protect public justice and it would be result in public mischief by local management of delay in the process of filing an appeal. In the case of Sheoraj Singh (Supra) it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that an exercise of discretion by the High Court has to be tested on the anvil of liberal and justice oriental approach as propounded in various decisions referred in the said judgment. It has also been held that the law of limitation is founded on public policy and some lapse on the part of the litigant by itself would not be sufficient to deny the condonation of delay as the same could cause miscarriage of justice.\n4 7 . It has been held in another recent judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Haryana Urban Development Authority, Karnal Vs. Mehta Construction Company and another 2022(5)SCC 432 as under:-\n\"8. In the present case, it is an accepted position that the application for setting aside of the award dated 20-12-2013 was made on 28-3-2014 accompanied by an application for condonation of delay. The Court, therefore, had the power to condone the eight days' delay, which was less than thirty days, in terms of the proviso to sub-section (3) to Section 34 of the Act. In the application seeking condonation of delay, it was inter alia stated that after receiving a copy of the award at about 6.50 p.m. on 20-3- 2014, the appellant had engaged an empanelled advocate and the records pertaining to the arbitration case were constructed and examined. The short delay had also occurred as sanctions and approvals were required from the higher/competent authority. \n9. Given the aforesaid background and the short condonable delay which had occurred, we do not think that the High Court and the Additional District Judge, Karnal were justified in refusing to condone the delay. The application for condonation of delay in filing of the objections should have been allowed. \n13. We have briefly noted the provisions of the Act only to highlight that the objections under Section 34 of the Act did require consideration and in-depth examination and should not have been dismissed without proper and full application of mind with reference to the provisions of the Limitation Act and the Act. \n14. In these circumstances, and for the reasons stated, we have no option but to allow the present appeal and set aside the impugned order dated 11-12-2019 [Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) v. Mehta Construction Co., 2019 SCC OnLine P&H 6257] passed by the High Court as well as the order dated 8-1- 2018 passed by the Additional District Judge, Karnal. \n15. We would remit the matter to the file of the Additional District Judge, Karnal, who would hear the objections afresh and on merits without being influenced by the earlier orders and also the present order. We clarify that the observations made in this order are for the disposal of the present appeal and would not be treated as observations that are binding on the Additional District Judge, Karnal, when he examines and decides the objections under Section 34 of the Act on merits. \n4 8 . T he aforesaid case was also a case of condonation of delay in preferring the application under Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 filed on behalf of an instrumentality of the State. \n49. The the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Collector Land Acquisition Anantnag and another Vs. Ms. Katiji and others (1987) 2 SCC 107, has held as under:-\n\"Making a justice-oriented approach from this perspective, there was sufficient cause for condoning the delay in the institution of the appeal. The fact that it was the \"State\" which was seeking condonation and not a private party was altogether irrelevant. The doctrine of equality before law demands that all litigants, including the State as a litigant, are accorded the same treatment and the law is administered in an even-handed manner. There is no warrant for according a step-motherly treatment when the \"State\" is the applicant praying for condonation of delay. In fact experience shows that on account of an impersonal machinery (no one in charge of the matter is directly hit or hurt by the judgment sought to be subjected to appeal) and the inherited bureaucratic methodology imbued with the note-making, file-pushing and passing-on-the-buck ethos, delay on its part is less difficult to understand though more difficult to approve. In any event, the State which represents the collective cause of the community, does not deserve a litigant-non-grata status. The courts therefore have to be informed with the spirit and philosophy of the provision in the course of the interpretation of the expression \"sufficient cause\". \nSo also the same approach has to be evidenced in its application to matters at hand with the end in view to do even-handed justice on merits in preference to the approach which scuttles a decision on merits. Turning to the facts of the matter giving rise to the present appeal, we are satisfied that sufficient cause exists for the delay. The order of the High Court dismissing the appeal before it as time-barred, is therefore, set aside. Delay is condoned. And the matter is remitted to the High Court. The High Court will now dispose of the appeal on merits after affording reasonable opportunity of hearing to both the sides.\" \n50. The commercial Court has held in the impugned order that the explanation for the delay after 13.04.2023 is not properly explained, thus, it refused to condone the delay of 27 days caused after 13.04.2023. As discussed by us in detail above, the delay of 27 days caused has been properly explained by the appellants. \n51. In view of the factual situation of this case and the law as applicable in the present factual situation of the case as discussed in detail above, we are of the opinion that the Commercial Court has erred in refusing to condone the delay of 27 days which was within the limit of condonable delay of 30 days.\n52. The appellants had no doubt offered sufficient cause for condonation of delay. The cause shown was an explanation and not excuse. Consequently, the order under appeal passed by the Commercial Court is set-aside. The application for condonation of delay filed by the appellant under Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996 stands allowed. The Commercial Court is directed to proceed with disposal of the application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 in accordance with law. No order as to costs. \n53. Appeal is allowed, in the above terms. \n                            ( SUJOY PAUL)                                                   (VIVEK JAIN) \n                               JUDGE                                                          JUDGE                           rj/mishra",

petitioners against the supply of goods, on 02.11.2017, i.e. rs. 12,27,977/along with the interest of rs. 4,90,019/from the said date. an fir was also registered at no. 59/2018 at police station, sumerpur, district pali, against the petitioner/defendant firm under section 420, 408, 120-b of the indian penal code, 1860 and subsequently the chargesheet was filed on 04.11.2018. 4. after the service of notice, the petitioner/defendant firm filed a reply (annexure-2) raising preliminary objections with regard to maintainability of the suit. furthermore, the petitioner/defendant firm firm filed an application under order vii rule 11 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'cpc') on account of non-disclosure of the 'cause of action' in the plaint. 5. the learned commercial court, vide order dated 11.08.2021 dismissed the application of the petitioner/defendant, against which the petitioner/defendant firm preferred a s.b.c.w.p no. 16350/2022 titled as triveni brokers v. hiraram and ors. which is pending consideration before this court. 6. during the course of trial, the plaintiff/respondent firm filed an application (annexure-3) under order xi rule 12 and 14 of cpc for taking on record the document/receipts. the petitioner/defendant firm filed a reply (annexure-4) to the said application, raising an objection with respect to the applicability of order

[cw-2222/2024] plaintiff/respondent firm. subsequently, the plaintiff/respondent firm filed an application (annexure-6) under section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872 for taking on record the document/receipts as secondary evidence, to which the petitioner/ defendant firm filed a reply (annexure-7). 8. thereafter, the learned commercial court vide order dated 09.01.2024 (annexure-8) allowed the application filed by the plaintiff/respondent. 9. thus, being aggrieved of the order dated 09.01.2024 (annexure-8), the petitioner/defendant firm has preferred this writ petition. 10. learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant firm submitted that the order passed by the learned commercial court is illegal, arbitrary and perverse as the learned commercial court has wrongly allowed the application filed by the plaintiff/respondent firm under section 65 since the plaintiff/respondent firm have failed to disclose the existence of the original receipt and there is no observation of the learned commercial court with regard to section 63 of the indian evidence act, 1872, and thus the document produced by the plaintiff/respondent firm is not covered under the scope of secondary evidence as stipulated by the said provision. he also submitted that the learned commercial court has not given any finding whether the photocopy documents have been made from the original document as per section 63(2) and (3) of the indian evidence act, 1872. [2024:rj-jd:12253] (5 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] 11. learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant firm further submitted that as per section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872, secondary evidence of the document may be given only where the original is shown or appears to be in possession or power of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved, or of any person, out of reach of the process of the court, or wherein the original has been destroyed or lost. he also submitted that in the present case, the plaintiff/respondent failed to prove any of the condition stipulated under section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872 and despite the same, learned commercial court has allowed the application filed by the plaintiff/respondent firm. 12. learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant firm submitted that the plaintiff/respondent cannot be allowed to bring the same application under section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872, as the application under order xi rule 12 and 14 of the cpc has already been dismissed. he further submitted that since the same application had been rejected by the learned commercial court vide order dated 18.08.2023 (annexure-5), learned commercial court does not have the power to review its own decision. 13. per contra, learned counsel for the respondent at the outset submitted that the application under section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872 has been filed to produce 27 receipts of the material sold by the petitioner/defendant, who is the broker for the plaintiff/respondent firm and thus the plaintiff/respondent firm is not able to produce the original receipts since these original [2024:rj-jd:12253] (6 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] receipts are in the power and possession of the petitioner/defendant firm. 14. learned counsel for the plaintiff/respondent firm further submitted that the purpose of application under order xi rule 12 of cpc and section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872 serve two completely different purposes, wherein she submitted that order xi rule 12 of cpc provides for the application for discovery of documents while section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872 provides for an application wherein the party seeks permission to give secondary evidence in cases where original documents cannot be produced. she further submitted that thus, the applications under order xi rule 12 and section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872 are two completely different stages. 15. learned counsel for the plaintiff/respondent firm further relied upon the judgment passed by the coordinate bench of this hon'ble court in the case of arun kumar v. special judge, ndps [s.b.c.w.p. no. 3322 of 2018 decided on 13.03.2018] wherein it was observed that section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872 has a wide scope and it permits the admission of secondary evidence, including photostat copies, in certain circumstances. the relevant paragraph of the judgment reads as under:\"9. after hearing learned counsel for the parties and perusing the record of the case as well as the precedent law cited by both the parties, this court is of the view that section 65 of the act of 1972 has a very wide scope and once the suit is for specific performance and the photostat copy of the agreement which was sought to be produced by the respondents through the petitioner, has been refused then it was ofcourse correct on the part of the learned court below to permit the respondents to take the photostat copy of the [2024:rj-jd:12253] (7 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] document on record. the taking of the document on record does not necessarily mean that the document has become final as the right of the petitioners to raise all the objections regarding the admissibility of the document shall always remain open and could be decided by the learned court below itself. the refuting of the documents was the domain of the petitioners but accepting the documents under section 65 of the act of 1972 was a very wide scope looking into the language of section 65 of the act of 1972 and hence, could not have been denied by the learned court below.\" 16. learned counsel for the plaintiff/respondent firm also submitted that at this stage, relevancy is not be seen and she placed reliance upon the judgment passed by the hon'ble high court of himachal pradesh at shimla in the case of mahboob hussan v. smt. vidya sharma and anr. [c.r. no. 74 of 2014 decided on 14.03.2017] wherein it was observed that the filing of application under order xi rule 12 and 14 of the cpc by the plaintiff/respondent firm was in the nature of the application under section 66 of the indian evidence act, 1872. the relevant paragraph of the judgment is reproduced as under:\"17. thus, the sum and substance of the application filed by the respondents under order xi, rule 14, c.p.c. was in the nature of the application under section 66 of the act and, therefore, non-service of the specific notice under section 66 of the evidence act upon the petitioner in the given facts and circumstances is of no avail as no prejudice would be caused to him. consequently, the decision relied upon by the petitioner are not at all applicable to the facts obtaining in the instant case. moreover, the proposition argued before this court is not even the defense taken up by the petitioner before the court below.\" 17. heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the material available on record and the judgments cited at the bar. 18. the petitioner/defendant firm in its reply dated 01.12.2023 (annexure-7), to the application under section 65 of the indian evidence act 1872, has clearly stated that the 27 receipts which the plaintiff/respondent no.1 sought to bring on record did not [2024:rj-jd:12253] (8 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] mention petitioner/defendant firm's name, nor do they relate to the transaction between the parties to the suit. meaning thereby the petitioner has admitted the existence of such payment receipts being issued by it. the relevant paragraph of the petitioner/defendant firm's reply to application under section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872 is reproduced as under:\"यह हैं कि पद सख्या 2 में लिखे गये तथ्य सरासर गलत हैं चूंकि प्रार्थना पत्र में वर्णित दस्तावेज के संबंध में न्यायालय द्वारा पूर्व में आदे श पारित कर दिया गया हैं साथ ही श्रीमान न्यायालय द्वारा ही श्रीमान न्यायालय द्वारा वादी द्वारा प्रस्तुत प्रार्थना पत्र अन्तर्गत आदे श 11 नियम 12 व 14 सीपीसी जो इन्ही दस्तावेजों के संबंध में प्रस्तत ु किया गया था, को खारिज फरमा दिया गया। परन्तु फिर भी वादी द्वारा जानबूझकर उक्त प्रार्थना पत्र प्रस्तुत किया गया जो काबिले खारिज करने योग्य हैं। वादी द्वारा जो रसीदे द्वितीय साक्ष्य के रूप में उपयोग में लेना चाहता है वो रसीदे उक्त वाद से संबंध नहीं रखती हैं। उक्त रसीदों को प्रथम दृष्टिया स्पष्ट प्रतित होता है कि उक्त रसीदों में वादी फर्म का न तो नाम अंकित हैं और न ही उनके माल का हवाला दिया गया है । इसलिए उक्त रसीदें विचाराधीन वाद से संबंध नही रखती हैं इसलिए इनकों द्वितीय साक्ष्य के रूप में कतई स्वीकार नहीं किया जा सकता।\" 19. the respondent has filed an additional affidavit while placing on record the application file under order xi rule 12 & 14 cpc and the reply filed by the petitioner. upon perusal of the application filed by the respondent, it is seen that the respondent has placed on record photostat copies of 27 receipts of the payment received by the petitioner/defendant of the payment received by the petitioner/defendant while submitting that the original is lying with the petitioner/defendant. it is also stated in the application filed by the respondent/plaintiff that the petitioner/defendant has collected money from the traders for which such payment receipts have been issued by the petitioner/defendants. the petitioner/ defendants has filed reply (annexure-r/2) to the said application in which he has admitted that such receipts have been issued by the petitioner firm while disputing that the name of the [2024:rj-jd:12253] (9 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] respondent firm is not present in the said receipts and it does not pertain to any transaction between the petitioner and the respondent. thus, when the original document is shown or appears to be in the possession or power of the petitioner/defendant against whom the document is sought to be proved, then 27 receipts have rightly been permitted to be admissible in evidence. 20. the petitioner/defendant has also accepted that it bought certain goods from the respondent/plaintiff on various occasions and worked as a broker for the respondent firm. thus, the petitioner firm has admitted that there were transactions between the petitioner firm and the respondent firm and thus, in order to prove its case, the plaintiff/respondent has placed on record about 27 photostat copies of the payment receipts and the issuance of which have duly been admitted by the petitioner firm. thus, the learned commercial court has rightly allowed the application by the respondent under section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872. the relevant paragraph of the reply to the application under order xi rule 12 and 14 of cpc is reproduced as under:\"यह है कि प्रार्थना पत्र के पद संख्या 03 में लिखे तथ्य गलत व झूठे अंकित है जिसका प्रत्युतर इस प्रकार है कि वादी द्वारा उक्त प्रार्थना पत्र के साथ जो रसीदें प्रस्तुत की गई है वो रसीदें प्रतिवादी फर्म की है जो प्रतिवादी द्वारा अपने डिस्ट्रीब्यटु र को माल दिया उसके एवज में है । उक्त रसीदों को प्रथम दृष्टतया दे खने से स्पष्ट प्रतीत होता है कि उक्त रसीदों में वादी फर्म का न तो नाम अंकित है और ना ही उनके माल का हवाला दिया हुआ है इसलिये यह कतई नहीं माना जा सकता कि प्रतिवादी द्वारा जारी की गई उक्त अलग अलग व्यक्तियों के नाम की रसीटें वादी फर्म के माल के सम्बन्ध में ही. हो। वादी एवं प्रतिवादी के मध्य हुए लेन-दे न के सम्बन्ध में जो रसीदें थी वा रसीदें प्रतिवादी द्वारा प्रस्तत ु कर दी गई है ।\" 21. order xi rule 12 of cpc deals with the discovery of documents and allows the court to order any party to a suit to [2024:rj-jd:12253] (10 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] make discovery on oaths of the document in their possession or power, which relates to any matter in question in the suit. the purpose is to ensure that relevant documents are made available to the parties and the court for the proper adjudication of the dispute. on the other hand, section 65 of the evidence act deals with the cases in which secondary evidence may be given and it also specifies the conditions wherein the secondary evidence is admissible. section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872 act reads as under: \"65. cases in which secondary evidence relating to documents may be given.--secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition, or contents of a document in the following cases: -(a) when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power -of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved, or of any person out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the court, or of any person legally bound to produce it, and when, after the notice mentioned in section 66, such person does not produce it; (b) when the existence, condition or contents of the original have been proved to be admitted in writing by the person against whom it is proved or by his representative in interest; (c) when the original has been destroyed or lost, or when the party offering evidence of its contents cannot, for any other reason not arising from his own default or neglect, produce it in reasonable time; (d) when the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable; (e) when the original is a public document within the meaning of section 74; (f) when the original is a document of which a certified copy is permitted by this act, or by any other law in force in 1 [india] to be given in evidence; (g) when the originals consist of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot conveniently be examined in court, and the fact to be proved is the general result of the whole collection. in cases (a), (c) and (d), any secondary evidence of the contents of the document is admissible. in case (b), the written admission is admissible. in case (e) or (f), a certified copy of the document, but no other kind of secondary evidence, is admissible. [2024:rj-jd:12253] (11 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] in case (g), evidence may be given as to the general result of the documents by any person who has examined them, and who is skilled in the examination of such documents.\" 22. furthermore, this court observes that contrary to the intent of order xi rule 12 of cpc, the purpose of section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872 is to provide an exception to the general rule that the best evidence must be produced, in situations where the original document is lost, destroyed, or otherwise unavailable. this court also finds that in the case of rajeev khanna urf raju s/o (late) shri azad khanna v. smt. anita tripathi d/0 (late) shri suraj prakash tripathi [s.b.c.w.p no. 22718 of 2017 decided on 03.01.2018], wherein it was held that even after dismissal of application under order xi rule 12 and 14, sufficient steps had been taken by the defendant-petitioner for calling for original documents to be placed on record as secondary evidence, and thus the coordinate bench of this hon'ble court had allowed the application filed under section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872. the relevant paragraph reads as under:\"10. having noted the submissions of learned counsel for both the parties and after going through the order impugned dated 18/08/2017 passed by the additional senior civil judge and additional chief judicial magistrate no.2, jaipur metropolitan, this court finds that the learned trial court has noted that the documents no. 4 to 7 were not allowed to be taken on record vide order dated 28/01/2017. it is also seen that the application moved under order 11 rule 12 & 14 cpc has been rejected solely on the ground that the proceedings against the defendant-respondent no.2 have been held to be ex-parte and therefore, the documents have been not called for from their possession. thus, this court finds that sufficient steps were taken by the defendant-petitioner for calling for the original documents which he wanted to place on record as secondary evidence. 11. the apex court in the case of rakesh mohindra vs. anita beri and others (supra) has held that the precondition for [2024:rj-jd:12253] (12 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] leading secondary evidence is that the court should be satisfied with appropriate steps have been taken by the concerned party for producing the original documents which are not in his possession and which are stated to be in possession of the other person. originality, such documents ought to have been directed to be produced from the concerned party. however, in the circumstances, as noted above, if the original documents could not be produced and the defendant-respondent no.2 himself has placed photo copies of the originals, it would be in the interest of justice that the application under section 65 of the act of 1872 is allowed and the same is treated as secondary evidence for the purpose of disposal of the suit. the submission of learned counsel for the plaintiff-respondent that the onus lies for proving the various issues framed is only on the plaintiffrespondent, would not be of any material change. 12. consequently, the writ petition is allowed. the order impugned dated 18/08/2017 passed by the learned trial court is set aside and the application moved by the defendantpetitioner under section 65 of the act of 1872 for calling for secondary evidence relating to the two documents i.e. revised list of allottees and revised map as published, is allowed. no costs.\" 23. thus, the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that after rejection of the application filed by the respondent under order xi rule 12 & 14 cpc, the application under section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872, is not maintainable, is having no merit, as the respondent/plaintiff had taken sufficient steps for calling the original documents by way of filing application under order xi rule 12 & 14 cpc. thereafter, when the application under order xi rule 12 & 14 cpc was rejected, the respondent/plaintiff placed on record the photostat copies of the original receipts, by way of filing application under section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872. 24. moreover, this court observes that the petitioner/defendant's submission that the mandatory requirement of notice has not been fulfilled by the plaintiff/respondent firm, is devoid of merit, since by virtue of filing the application under order xi rule 12 and [2024:rj-jd:12253] (13 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] 14, this fact has come to notice of the petitioner/defendant firm that the plaintiff/respondent firm has presented photostat copies of the original receipts of the transactions made by the petitioner/ defendant firm and thus, under proviso to section 66 of the indian evidence act, 1872, notice was not required. section 66 of the evidence act, 1872 reads as under:\"66. rules as to notice to produce.-secondary evidence of the contents of the documents referred to in section 65, clause (a), shall not be given unless the party proposing to give such secondary evidence has previously given to the party in whose possession or power the document is, [or to his attorney or pleader,] such notice to produce it as is prescribed by law; and if no notice is prescribed by law, then such notice as the court considers reasonable under the circumstances of the case: provided that such notice shall not be required in order to render secondary evidence admissible in any of the following cases, or in any other case in which the court thinks fit to dispense with it: -xxxx (2) when, from the nature of the case, the adverse party must know that he will be required to produce it; xxxx\" 25. this court finds that in the case of ashok dulichand v. madahavlal dube : (1975) 4 scc 664, the hon'ble apex court considering the provisions of section 65 of the evidence act, held as under: \"according to clause (a) of section 65 of the indian evidence act, secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition or contents of a document when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved, or of any person out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the court, or of any person legally bound to produce it, and when, after the notice mentioned in section 66, such person does not produce it. clauses (b) to (g) of section 65 specify some other contingencies wherein secondary evidence relating to a document may be given.\" [2024:rj-jd:12253] (14 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] 26. recently, this court in the case of virendra kumar v. neeraj garg : s.b. civil writ petition no.10391/2023 decided on 01.03.2024 while considering the identical controversy has held that pre-requisites of section 65 of the evidence act, 1872 have to be satisfied before leading secondary evidence. in the case of virendra kumar (supra), this court relied on the decision rendered by hon'ble apex court in the case of rakesh mohindra v. anita beri and ors. : (2016) 16 scc 483. in the case of rakesh mohindra (surpa), the hon'ble court has held that in order to lead secondary evidence, certain pre-conditions are required to be fulfilled, where such original document(s) could not have been produced by the party relying upon such documents in spite of best efforts, and it was unable to produce the same which is beyond his control. it has also been held by the hon'ble apex court that the party seeking to produce secondary evidence must establish for the non-production of primary evidence, unless, it is established that the original documents are lost or destroyed or are being deliberately withheld by the party in respect of that document sought to be used, secondary evidence in respect of that document cannot be accepted. the relevant para of the judgment passed in rakesh mohindra (supra) is reproduced as under:\"held, while allowing the appeal (1) the pre-conditions for leading secondary evidence are that such original documents could not be produced by the party relied upon such documents in spite of best efforts, unable to produce the same which is beyond their control. the party [2024:rj-jd:12253] (15 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] sought to produce secondary evidence must establish for the non-production of primary evidence. unless, it is established that the original documents is lost or destroyed or is being deliberately withheld by the party in respect of that document sought to be used, secondary evidence in respect of that document cannot accepted.\" 27. this court in the case of mukesh kumar v. prithvi raj : s.b. civil writ petition no.12845/2019 decided on 28.07.2023 while allowing the writ petition preferred by the petitioner/defendant challenging the order passed by the trial court whereby the trial court rejected the application preferred by the defendant seeking lead secondary evidence, has held as under: \"17. section 65 clause (a) of the evidence act lays down that secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition or contents of a document when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved. in the case in hand, the petitioner-defendant, in his written statement and in the application filed under order 11 rules 12 and 14 of the code of civil procedure has mentioned that the document in question is in possession of the respondent-defendant. 18. section 66 of the evidence act provides for notice to the party in whose possession the document is shown. this court finds that the purpose of notice is to provide information regarding showing the possession of the document. from the perusal of the material available on record, it reveals that the petitioner defendant filed an application under order 11 rules 12 and 14 of the code of civil procedure for production of the document in question to which he filed reply, though denied to have the possession of the same and thus, the respondent-plaintiff was having prior knowledge about the production of such documents. 19. further, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that if the document in question is allowed to be produced as secondary evidence, then no prejudice would be caused to the respondent-plaintiff as he will have an opportunity to testify the said document by examining such witnesses, particularly in light of the issue no.5 framed by the learned trial court. also, the learned trial court, vide order dated 04.01.2019, while deciding the application of the petitioner filed under order 11 rules 12 and 14 of the code of civil procedure, has observed that the document in question is necessary for deciding the suit and directed the petitioner-defendant to brought on record the same in [2024:rj-jd:12253] (16 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] accordance with law and hence, the petitioner-defendant has preferred the present application under section 65 of the evidence act. 20. this court, in the case of arun kumar (supra), this court observed as under:\"8. . . 32. . . . as held by this court that after taking the document on record, the party relying upon it, will have to prove its existence and execution so also its contents and conditions. needless to observe that the respondent/defendant shall be permitted to raise all just objections regarding admissibility of the document in the teeth of the provisions of registration act and stamp act. the objection as and when raised, shall be decided by the learned trial court, in accordance with law. any observation made by this court consciously or otherwise touching upon admissibility of the document shall not come in the way of learned trial court to decide the same.\" in the case of smt. mathura devi (supra), this court observed as under:\"(13) . . the proposition of the secondary evidence never automatically means that the evidence rendered is truthful, authentic or genuine as the same has to be established during the course of trial. thus, excluding the secondary evidence only with an apprehension of an improper evidence coming in at a preliminary stage is uncalled for.\" 21. in view of the above, this court finds that if the petitioner defendant is permitted to lead secondary evidence, then, it will not prejudice the case of the respondent-plaintiff as he will have full opportunity to examine the witnesses over the document so also he will be free to raise all his just objections. 22. the writ petition is allowed in the above terms and the impugned order dated 08.08.2019 is quashed and set aside.\" 28. in the case of mahboob hussain (supra), the high court of himachal pradesh observed that filing of application under order xi rule 12 & 14 cpc by the plaintiff therein, was in the nature of application under section 66 of the evidence act, 1872 and service of specific notice under section 66 upon the defendant was not required, as no prejudice as such would be caused to the defendant therein. [2024:rj-jd:12253] (17 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] 29. this court finds that the respondent/plaintiff has taken sufficient steps prior to filing application under section 65 of the indian evidence act, 1872 and has sufficiently shown that the original receipts are in possession or power of the petitioner/defendant. 30. thus, the order passed by the learned commercial court dated 09.01.2024 (annexure-8) does not require any interference and the writ petition is, therefore, dismissed. stay petition as well as all other pending applications, if any, also stand dismissed. [civil writ petition no. 16350/2022] 1. this writ petition has been filed under article 226 and 227 of the constitution of india with the following prayers:\"a. it is therefore most respectfully prayed that this writ petition may kindly be allowed:b. by an appropriate writ, order or direction order may kindly issued and quashed the impugned order dated 11.08.2021 (annexure5) passed by the learned commercial court no.1, jodhpur and allow the application (annexure-3) filed by the petitioner with regard to application under order 7 rule 11 cpc in commercial suit no.80/2019 (ncv no.80/2019) (m/s hira ram hansa ram vs. triveni brokers & others), the suit file by the plaintiff may kindly be dismissed according to the provision of order 7 rule 11(a) of the cpc c. any other appropriate writ, order or direction, which this hon'ble court may deem it just and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case, may kindly be issued. d. costs of this writ petition may kindly be may kindly be awarded in favour of the petitioner.\" [2024:rj-jd:12253] (18 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] 2. brief facts of the case are that the plaintiff/respondent no. 1 firm filed a commercial suit (annexure-1) for recovering rs. 17,86,774/which included the amount supposed to be deposited by the petitioners against the supply of goods, on 02.11.2017, i.e. rs. 12,27,977/along with the interest of rs. 4,90,019/from the said date. furthermore, an fir was registered at no. 59/2018 at police station, sumerpur, district pali, against the petitioner under section 420, 408, 120-b of the indian penal code, 1860 and subsequently the chargesheet was filed on 04.11.2018. 3. after the service of notice, the petitioner/defendant filed a reply (annexure-2) raising preliminary objections with regard to maintainability of the suit. furthermore, the petitioner/defendant filed an application (annexure-3) under order vii rule 11 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'cpc') on account of non-disclosure of the 'cause of action' in the plaint. furthermore the respondent-plaintiff filed reply (annexure-4) to the application filed by the petitioner-defendant under order vii rule 11. 4. the learned commercial court, vide order dated 11.08.2021 (annex-5) dismissed the application filed by the petitioner/defendant and thus, being aggrieved of the order dated 11.08.2021 (annexure-5), the petitioner has preferred this writ petition. 5. learned counsel for the petitioner-defendant submitted that the impugned order passed by learned commercial court rejecting the application filed by the petitioner-defendant under order vii [2024:rj-jd:12253] (19 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] rule 11 cpc is illegal, arbitrary and perverse, inasmuch as the respondent no1-plaintiff has failed to disclose the cause of action in the plaint, as provided under order vii rule 11 (a) cpc. he further submitted that the provision of order vii rule 11 cpc imposes an obligation on court to determine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action by scrutinising the averments in the plaint along with the documents relied upon by the plaintiff and also by perusing the material facts which are necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to entitle him to the reliefs claimed in the suit. 6. learned counsel for the petitioner-defendant also submitted that by perusal of the plaint filed by the plaintiff it is clear that the suit was filed by the plaintiff in the year 2019 and in the pleadings of the plaintiff there is no disclosure of cause of action and thereby the suit is barred by provisions of order vii rule 11(a) cpc as in the entire plaint the plaintiff has not disclosed any cause of action and mere claim regarding liability of some due amount from the petitioner-defendant cannot be treated as disclosure of cause of action in the plaint. 7. learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the joinder of proper party in the plaint is necessary for a trial against any person and the petitioner-defendant being a broker for the respondent no.1-plaintiff, inasmuch as the goods/material was not delivered to the petitioner-defendant and, therefore, the recovery cannot be made against the petitioner and the purchasers are also necessary parties in the suit, however, the learned trial court has [2024:rj-jd:12253] (20 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] not considered the same aspect. he also submitted in regard to the jurisdiction of high court against the order passed by the commercial court that as per rule 55 of the rajasthan high court rules the jurisdiction under article 226 and 227 of the constitution of india lies with the single bench and thus his writ petition is maintainable. 8. in support of his submissions the learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on the judgments passed by the hon'ble apex court in the case of t. arivandandam vs t. v. satyapal & another reported in 1977 (4) scc 467; sopan sukhdeo sable & ors vs assistant charity commissioner & ors reported in 2004(2) wlc(sc)cvl122; innovative textiles ltd versus nitin spinners ltd (d.b. cwp no.8119/2023); rajasthan state mines and minerals ltd vs ankur minmine product private limited (s.b.c.w.p 920/2019) 9. per contra, learned counsel for the respondent-plaintiff firm submitted that the writ petition filed by the petitioner is not maintainable, inasmuch as per section 8 of the commercial courts act, 2015 there is bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order of a commercial court and thus the writ petition of the petitioner be dismissed on the said ground. she further submitted that the petitioner has made false averments that the plaint does not disclose the cause of action as mentioned in order vii rule 11 (a) cpc, whereas, the respondentplaintiff has clearly mentioned in detail in its plaint regarding the cause of action and the non-payment of the amount by the [2024:rj-jd:12253] (21 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] petitioner-defendant due to the respondent-plaintiff and moreover, the case of the plaintiff is a mixed question of facts and law and thus the averments of the petitioner-defendant in its application under order vii rule 11 for rejection of plaint, do not sustain. 10. learned counsel for the respondent-plaintiff further submitted that the respondent-plaintiff cannot be compelled by the petitioner as to who should be made the necessary party in the suit filed by it, particularly when the petitioner committed fraud against the respondent while he was working as a broker for the respondent and was selling the goods/material for the respondent however, was not making the payment of the same to the respondent. the petitioner/defendant has not paid the due amount to respondent/plaintiff after selling the goods/material, though the goods were sold through the petitioner/defendant and thus the petitioner/defendant was the only necessary party and the other purchasers were not required to be arrayed as defendants in the suit. moreover, the petitioner has not even replied to the legal notice given to him by the respondent 11. learned counsel for the respondent-plaintiff also submitted that the fraudulent actions of the petitioner clearly discloses the cause of action which have been clearly mentioned in the suit and these are questions of facts and laws which will be decided after producing evidences and hearing the parties and therefore, the application filed by the petitioner order vii rule 11 for rejection of [2024:rj-jd:12253] (22 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] the plaint has rightly been dismissed as the averments in the plaint clearly describes and discloses the cause of action. 12. learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that while adjudicating regarding the cause of action under order vii rule 11 the plaint has to be read as a whole to find out whether the averments disclose the cause of action or whether the suit is barred by any law. in support of the same the respondent has placed reliance on the judgments passed by the coordinate bench of this court in the case of sardar khan khokhar versus shri devji patel and ors reported in 2011(3)dnj (raj) 1563 and late dhanpat kanwar and anr versus smt shanti and ors (sbcwp no. 9794/2017). 13. heard learned counsel for the parties; perused the material available on record and the judgments cited at the bar. 14. this court finds that the learned commercial court has observed in its order dated 11.08.2021 that any specific word or sentence cannot determine the cause of action, and the \"bundle of facts\" as a whole should be considered while determining if there is disclosure of cause of action or not. the learned commercial court further observed that the plaintiff-respondent has repeatedly stated in its plaint that the petitioner-defendant is liable to pay the amount due to the respondent-plaintiff which has not been paid by the petitioner-defendant and this relief of the respondent-plaintiff itself is the disclosure of the cause of action by the plaintiff-respondent. the learned commercial court also observed that on the basis of such technical grounds the [2024:rj-jd:12253] (23 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] respondent-plaintiff cannot be deprived of the relief claimed, as all the facts and the plaint should be considered as a whole to determine if \"cause of action\" arises or not. 15. the object of order vii rule 11 cpc is to provide a mechanism for rejecting a plaint at an early stage of the proceedings if it is found to be defective and does not disclose the cause of action or is barred by law. it is also important to note that provisions of order vii rule 11 cpc are mandatory in nature and not directory. the court may reject a plaint if it does not comply with the requirements specified in order vii rule 11 cpc, which includes providing sufficient details of the cause of action. the petitioner/defendant has preferred application under order vii rule 11 cpc on the ground that the respondent/plaintiff has failed to disclose a cause of action in the suit filed by it. this court further finds that the learned commercial court observed that the petitioner-defendant worked as a broker for the respondent and furthermore, the questions, firstly whether the purchasers who bought the goods from the petitioner be made necessary parties and secondly, whether the petitioner is a sole proprietorship or a partnership firm are mixed question of fact and law which do not attract the provisions of order vii rule 11 cpc, thus these contentions of the petitioner in the application under order vii rule 11 do not sustain. 16. this court finds that by perusal of the plaint, it clearly describes that the petitioner firm was a broker for the respondent firm and sold the grocery goods for the respondent and thereafter [2024:rj-jd:12253] (24 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] was supposed to pay the amount received by the petitioner firm to the respondent firm which seems was not paid by the petitioner. furthermore, it is clearly stated in the plaint that the petitioner firm after supplying the goods to the purchasers and after receiving the amount from the purchasers have not paid the due amount to the respondent and has defrauded the respondent and thus, this clearly discloses the cause of action in the suit filed by the respondent, therefore the contentions of the petitioner that there is no disclosure of the cause of action is unsustainable. relevant portion of the order vii rule 11(a) cpc is reproduced here as under:\"order viiplaint 11. rejection of plaint.-the plaint shall be rejected in the following cases:-(a) where it does not disclose a cause of action;\" 17. this court finds that in the case of azhar hussain v. rajiv gandhi : 1996 supp scc 315, the hon'ble apex court held that the whose purpose of conferment of powers under this provision is to ensure that a litigation which is meaningless and bound to prove abortive, should not be permitted to waste judicial time of the court. the relevant portion of the judgment reads as under: \"12. . the whole purpose of conferment of such powers is to ensure that a litigation which is meaningless, and bound to prove abortive should not be permitted to occupy the time of the court, and exercise the mind of the respondent. the sword of damocles need not be kept hanging over his head unnecessarily without point or purpose. even in an ordinary civil litigation, the court readily exercises the power to reject a plaint, if it does not disclose any cause of action.\" [2024:rj-jd:12253] (25 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] 18. this court finds that in the case of liverpool & london s.p. & i assn. ltd. v. m.v. sea success i : (2004) 9 scc 512, the hon'ble apex court held as under: \"139. whether a plaint discloses a cause of action or not is essentially a question of fact. but whether it does or does not must be found out from reading the plaint itself. for the said purpose, the averments made in the plaint in their entirety must be held to be correct. the test is as to whether if the averments made in the plaint are taken to be correct in their entirety, a decree would be passed.\" 19. further it is seen that in the case of church of christ charitable trust & educational charitable society v. ponniamman educational trust : (2012) 8 scc 706, the hon'ble apex court has held that the cause of action is a bundle of facts which gives the plaintiff the right to relief against the defendant and a cause of action must include the some act done by the defendant since in absence of such an act no cause of action can possibly accrue. 20. this court finds that in the case of abc laminart (p) ltd. v. a.p. agencies : (1989) 2 scc 163, the hon'ble apex court while explaining the meaning of 'cause of action' has held that a cause of action means every fact, which if traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to a judgment of the court and in other words, it is a bundle of facts. the relevant paragraph 12 of the said judgment reads as under: \"12. a cause of action means every fact, which if traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to a judgment of the court. in other words, it is a bundle of facts which taken with the l aw applicable to them gives the plaintiff a fight to relief against the defendant. it must include some act done by t he defendant since in the absence of such an act no cause of action can possibly accrue. it is not limited to the actual infringement of the fight sued on but includes all t he material facts on which it is founded. it does not comprise evidence necessary to prove such facts, but every fa ct necessary for the plaintiff to prove to enable him to obtain [2024:rj-jd:12253] (26 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] a decree. everything which if not proved would give t he defendant a fight to immediate judgment must be part of t he cause of action. but it has no relation whatever to the defence which may be set up by the defendant nor does it depend upon the character of the relief prayed for by t he plaintiff.\" 21. this court finds that in the case of itc ltd. vs. debts recovery appellate tribunal : (1998) 2 scc 70, the hon'ble apex court has held that the basic question to be decided while dealing with an application filed under order vii rule 11 cpc is whether a real cause of action has been set out in the plaint or something purely illusory has been stated with a view to get out of order vii rule 11 of cpc. 22. this court finds that in another case of madanuri sri rama chandra murthy v. syed jalal : (2017) 13 scc 174, the hon'ble apex court held that if on an entire and meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious and merit less in the sense of not disclosing any right to sue, the court should exercise power under order 7 rule 11 cpc. the relevant paragraph of the said judgment reads as under: \"7. the plaint can be rejected under order vii rule 11 if conditions enumerated in the said provision are fulfilled. it is needless to observe that the power under order vii rule 11, cpc can be exercised by the court at any stage of the suit. the relevant facts which need to be looked into for deciding the application are the averments of the plaint only. if on an entire and meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious and meritless in the sense of not disclosing any right to sue, the court should exercise power under order vii rule 11, cpc. since the power conferred on the court to terminate civil action at the threshold is drastic, the conditions enumerated under order vii rule 11 of cpc to the exercise of power of rejection of plaint have to be strictly adhered to. the averments of the plaint have to be read as a whole to find out whether the averments disclose a cause of action or whether the suit is barred by any law. it is needless to observe that the question as to whether the suit is barred by any law, would always depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. [2024:rj-jd:12253] (27 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] the averments in the written statement as well as the contentions of the defendant are wholly immaterial while considering the prayer of the defendant for rejection of the plaint. even when, the allegations made in the plaint are taken to be correct as a whole on their face value, if they show that the suit is barred by any law, or do not disclose cause of action, the application for rejection of plaint can be entertained and the power under order vii rule 11 of cpc can be exercised. if clever drafting of the plaint has created the illusion of a cause of action, the court will nip it in the bud at the earliest so that bogus litigation will end at the earlier stage.\" 23. in a recent judgment in rajendra bijoria & ors. v. hemant kumar jalan & anr. : (2022) 12 scc 641, the hon'ble apex court while elucidating on the underline object of order vii rule 11 cpc held as under: \"20. it could thus be seen that this court has held that the power conferred on the court to terminate a civil action is a drastic one, and the conditions enumerated under order vii rule 11 of cpc are required to be strictly adhered to. however, under order vii rule 11 of cpc, the duty is cast upon the court to determine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action, by scrutinizing the averments in the plaint, read in conjunction with the documents relied upon, or whether the suit is barred by any law. this court has held that the underlying object of order vii rule 11 of cpc is that when a plaint does not disclose a cause of action, the court would not permit the plaintiff to unnecessarily protract the proceedings. it has been held that in such a case, it will be necessary to put an end to the sham litigation so that further judicial time is not wasted.\" 24. a bare perusal of the pleadings of the plaint would reveal that the respondent/plaintiff has very specifically mentioned in the plaint that the goods were sold through the petitioner/defendant, who is in fact a commission agent/broker to various traders, however, the sale consideration was not paid to the plaintiff. it is seen from the pleadings of the plaint that the respondent/plaintiff has mentioned the date of transaction as well as the name of the traders and the amount due from the petitioner/defendant for such transactions. the pleadings of the plaint further states that [2024:rj-jd:12253] (28 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] the total amount outstanding to the defendant is rs.12,27,977/alongwith interest total rs.17,86,774/as also the period during which the transactions took place between the petitioner/defendant and the respondent/plaintiff i.e. from 01.04.2017 to 02.11.2017. the respondent/plaintiff in the plaint has also contended that for recovering the amount from the petitioner/defendant, a legal notice dated 18.02.2019 was also served upon the defendant and copy of said legal notice and postal ad receipt have also been exhibited. the relevant paragraphs no.5, 6 and 7 of the suit filed by the respondentplaintiff are reproduced hereinbelow:\"5. ;g gs fd izfroknhx.k }kjk fofhkuu o;kikfjs;ksa dks nh xbz fdjk.kk lkeku dh jkf\"k izfroknhx.k ds }kjk oknh qez dks nh tkrh fkh] ijurq uhps fueu of.kzr o;kikfj;ksa ls izfroknhx.k us lkeku ds isvs jkf\"k izkir dha ijurq oknh qez dks vnk ugha dh xbz] tks fueu izdkj gs %& ø-lafnukad o;kikfj;ksa dk uke :i;s@jkf'k 118-03-2017 jh gfjflag lksuk.kk 5803@& 218-03-2017 os'.ko fdjk.kk lvksj 275@& 318-03-2017 pkjhkqtk fdjk.kk lvksj 2]171@& lkjaxokl 420-03-2017 lksuk.kk [ksrykth 27]560@& hkkstu'kkyk 520-03-2017 [ksrykth fdjk.kk lvksj 11]575@& twuk 620-03-2017 pkjhkqtk fdjk.kk lvksj 17]00@& dwjuk 720-03-2017 _frd fdjk.kk lvksj 2300@& lknm+k 827-07-2017 os'.ko fdjk.kk lvksj vkuk 5]892@& 927-03-2017 ckcwyky hkknztwu 5]892@& 1027-03-2017 gfjvkse gksvy nslwjh 35]00@& 1127-03-2017 v'kksd fdjk.kk lvksj 1]080@& lsokm+h 1227-03-2017 pquuhyky nslwjh 850@& fnukad 01-04-2017 ls fnukad 02-11-2017, rd dqy :i;s 12]27]977@& [2024:rj-jd:12253] (29 of 30) [cw-2222/2024] 6. ;g gs fd mdr lkeku izfroknhx.k }kjk oknh qez ls [kjhnk x;k rfkk fnukad 01-07-2017 ls 02-11-2017 rd izfroknhx.k ds }kjk o vu;
