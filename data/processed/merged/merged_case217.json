Mohta, J.): \n-\nThis Commercial Appeal is filed by the Appellant-Original Defendant against the Judgment and order dated 6 June 2016, passed by the learned Single Judge of the Commercial Division in Summons for Judgment whereby, refused an unconditional leave to defend and has granted a leave to defend, but conditional. \nPreliminary objection to the maintainability of Commercial Appeal. \n2 To decide the preliminary objection of the maintainability of Commercial Appeal as filed, as raised by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Respondents, though the parties have consented to hear the Appeal on merits, we have re-listed the matter for hearing on ssm/dgm 3 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw the maintainability as it goes to the root of the matter in view of the confusion prevailing in the Office/Registry after the transfer of such pending summary suits because of the provisions of The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (for short, \"The Commercial Courts Act\"). \nBackground of proceedings-\n3 The following are the background dates of the proceedings as per the Respondent-Plaintiff (Idbi) to decide the maintainability of the Commercial Appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, apart from decision on merits. \nOn 11/09/14, Summary Suit No.776 of 2014 was filed by the Respondent (Plaintiff) (Idbi) on 11 September 2014, seeking a decree in the sum of over Rs.33 crores. \nDuring the pendency of the Summary Suit, the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division, Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Ordinance, 2015 (the Ordinance) was promulgated on 23 October 2015 with immediate effect. The Ordinance inter alia provided for the constitution of Commercial ssm/dgm 4 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Divisions in High Courts having ordinary original civil jurisdiction. \nAn order/notice dated 17 November, 2015 was issued by the then Hon'ble the Acting Chief Justice constituting the Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division under Sections 4 and 5 of the Ordinance. \nThe then Hon'ble Acting Chief Justice also issued an Assignment Order dated 22 December, 2015 of the Original Side of this Court to take effect from 4 January 2016, constituting the Commercial Division and the Commercial Appellate Division of this High Court and nominating Judges for the same. Mr. Justice S.C. Gupte was nominated as the \"Commercial Division\" of this Court and assigned all summary suits, i.e. including the present Summary Suit. \nAssignment Order dated 22 December 2015, was the order constituting the Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division. The Commercial Courts Act does not prescribe any particular form of the order to constitute such Divisions. The Chief Justice is required to pass only an administrative order, not a judicial order. \nOn 1 January, 2016, the Commercial Courts Act came to be notified in the Official Gazette with effect from 23 October 2015. \nssm/dgm 5 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw On 4 January 2016, the Commercial Divisions and the Commercial Appellate Divisions as constituted, have commenced functioning accordingly. On 7 January 2016, and from time to time thereafter, the Assignment Orders were varied as under :\na) Notice dated 7 January 2016 in partial modification of the Assignment order dated 22 December 2015.\nb) Assignment order dated 3 March 2016 with effect from 7 March 2016.\nc) Assignment order dated 15 March 2016 with effect from 21 March 2016.\nd) Assignment order dated 19 August 2016 with effect from 22 August 2016. \nAt all relevant times, the learned Judge continued to be nominated as the \"Commercial Division\" of this Court assigned to hear all summary suits, including the present summary suit. \n4 The Summons for Judgment in the Summary Suit was argued finally on merits by the counsel for the parties before the Commercial Division on 12 and 14 January 2016 and was reserved for orders on 14 January 2016. \nOn 13 May 2016, pending the final order in the Summons for Judgment, the captioned Summary Suit was formally transferred by a notice issued by the High Court (along with several other suits and proceedings) to the Commercial Divisions of this Court. The ssm/dgm 6 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw impugned order dated 6 June 2016 granting the conditional leave to defend the suit was passed by the learned Single Judge. \n5 On 12 July 2016, this Appeal was filed as a Commercial Appeal before this assigned Commercial Appellate Division of this Court. On 29 August 2016, this Appeal by consent, was heard finally on merits at the admission stage and the matter was closed for orders. \nThe time to deposit has been extended till this date. \nOn 1 September 2016 and 16 September 2016 , this Appeal was listed for directions and submissions on the question of the maintainability of this Appeal. \n6 Admittedly, for the Letters Patent Appeals under the Letters Patent Act, another Division Bench has been assigned to deal with the same. Apart from above, the submission is made that they have already moved a praecipe for passing final order even on merits, in either situation, by this Bench as we have already heard the matter on merits also. The Hon'ble the Chief Justice has passed order on 14 ssm/dgm 7 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw October 2016, accordingly. \nThe Commercial Courts Act-\n7 To provide for the constitution of Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts for adjudicating commercial disputes of specified value and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. \nIt is relevant to note that Law Commission of India in its 253 Report has recommended the establishment of Commercial Courts, the Commercial Division and the Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts for disposal of commercial disputes of specified value. \n9 On 23 December 2015, the Commercial Courts Act, having retrospective effect from 23 October 2015 by repealing the ordinance with the following rider has been promulgated-\n\"Section 23 -

In the decisions in Shah Babulal Khimji v. Jayaben D. Kania & Anr.1 and Midnapore Peoples' Co-op. Bank Ltd v. Chunilal Nanda,2 the Supreme Court observed as under :\n\"82. We now proceed to deal with the main controversy as to what is the true scope, meaning and purport of the word 'judgment' used in Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. Numerous authorities on both sides were cited before us in the course of the very able arguments advanced by counsels for the parties and it appears that there are three leading judgments which have spelt out certain tests to determine as to when an order passed by a Trial Judge can be said to be a 'judgment' within the meaning of. clause 15 of the Letters Patent. A very narrow view on this point was taken by a Division Bench Of the Calcutta High Court in the case of The Justice of the Peace for Calcutta (supra) where Sir Couch, C.J. On an interpretation of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent observed thus:-\nWe think that \"judgment\" in clause 15 means a decision which affects the merits of the question between the parties by determining some right or liability. It may be either final, or preliminary, or interlocutory, the difference between them being that a final judgment determines the whole cause or suit, and a preliminary or interlocutory judgment determines only a part of it, leaving other matters to be determined.\n\"113 ..........(3) Intermediary or Interlocutory judgment-Most of the interlocutory orders which contain the quality of finality are clearly specified in clauses (a) to (w) of Order 43 Rule 1 and have already been held by us to be judgments within the meaning of the Letters Patent and, therefore, appealable. There may also be interlocutory orders which are not covered by Order 43 Rule 1 but which also possess the characteristics and trappings of finality in that, the orders may adversely affect a valuable right of the party or decide an important aspect of the trial in an ancillary proceeding. 1 (1981) 4 Scc 8 2 Air 2006 Sc 2190 ssm/dgm 17 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Before such an order can be a judgment the adverse effect on the party concerned must be direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote. For instance, where the Trial Judge in a suit under Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure refuses the defendant leave to defend the suit, the order directly affects the defendant because he loses a valuable right to defend the suit and his remedy is confined only to contest the plaintiff's case on his own evidence without being given a chance to rebut that evidence. As such an order vitally affects a valuable right of the defendant it will undoubtedly be treated as a judgment within the meaning of the Letters Patent so as to be appealable to a larger Bench.\"....... \nThe Supreme Court in Midnapore Peoples' Co.op Bank Ltd.\n(Supra) has observed in para 16 as under:-\n\"16. Interim orders/interlocutory orders passed during the pendency of a case, fall under one or the other of the following categories:\n(i) Orders which finally decide a question or issue in controversy in the main case.\n(ii) Orders which finally decide an issue which materially and directly affects the final decision in the main case. \n(iii) Orders which finally decide a collateral issue or question which is not the subject matter of the main case. \n(iv) Routine orders which are passed to facilitate the progress of the case till its culmination in the final judgment. \n(v) Orders which may cause some inconvenience or some prejudice to a party, but which do not finally determine the rights and obligations of the parties. \nThe term 'judgment' occurring in Clause 15 of the Letters Patent will take into its fold not only the judgments as defined in Section 2(9) Cpc and orders enumerated in Order 43 Rule 1 of Cpc, but also other orders which, though may not finally ssm/dgm 18 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw and conclusively determine the rights of parties with regard to all or any matters in controversy, may have finality in regard to some collateral matter, which will affect the vital and valuable rights and obligations of the parties. Interlocutory orders which fall under categories (i) to (iii) above, are, therefore, 'judgments' for the purpose of filing appeals under the Letters Patent. On the other hand, orders falling under categories (iv) and (v) are not 'judgments' for purpose of filing appeals provided under the Letters Patent.\" \n(Emphasis added) The scheme of Commercial Courts Act-\n15 The terms \"Commercial Court\", \"Commercial Division\" and \"Commercial Appellate Division\" have been defined under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Commercial Courts Act. The constitution of the Commercial Courts is by the State Government which are at district level in territories other than the territories where the High Court has ordinary original civil jurisdiction. The constitution by the State Government is subject to the condition of consultation with the concerned High Court by publishing a notification in the Official Gazette specifying the local limits of jurisdiction of the Commercial Courts. It is also subject to nomination of one or more persons having experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be a Judge or Judges of Commercial Courts. \nssm/dgm 19 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 16 The constitution of Commercial Division of High Court is also subject to the order of Chief Justice of High Court consisting of Commercial Division, having one or more Branches consisting of a Hon'ble Judge/Judges. The Chief Justice of High Court, by the nomination, has appointed the Judges of High Court who have experience in dealing with the commercial disputes. The constitution of Commercial Appellate Division by the nomination, is also by the order of Chief Justice of the High Court, keeping in mind to nominate such Judges of High Court, who have experience in dealing with the commercial disputes. \n17 Chapter Ii of the Commercial Courts Act deals with the constitution of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions at various levels/courts. There is no issue that Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions are required to be constituted as per the prescribed provisions so referred above. The order/nomination by the Chief Justice in case of Commercial Division and the Commercial ssm/dgm 20 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Appellate Division is thus sufficient so far as the constitution of such Divisions under the Commercial Courts Act. The requirement of notification/ order by the State Government in consultation with the Chief Justice is also the requirement of the Act for the constitution of Commercial Courts in the district area/territories. So far as the Government of Maharashtra is concerned, a notification dated 13 June 2016 was issued under Section 3(1) constituting a Commercial Court in each district and in some places, Judges have been appointed to preside over the Commercial Court by appointment order dated 21 July 2016. As noted, the Commercial Divisions of the Bombay High Court have been constituted from time to time by nomination and so also the Commercial Appellate Divisions of High Court as contemplated under Sections 4 and 5 of The Commercial Courts Act. \n18 In view of Section 2(1)(c) of Commercial Courts Act, in view of definition of \"commercial dispute\" and \"specified value\" and as the summary suits fall within the definition of \"commercial dispute\" and the valuation of the ssm/dgm 21 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw subject matter exceeds one crore, the provisions of Commercial Courts Act would apply to such Suits, Petitions and Applications and the Appeal in question. There is no issue on this. \n19 Section 6 empowers the Commercial Court to try and hear all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute based upon the valuation so recorded above which is subject to territorial jurisdiction. All suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute where the subject matter exceeds Rupees one crore and which are pending in any Civil Court in any District shall be transferred to the Commercial Courts so constituted is the mandate of Section 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act. \nSection 7 empowers \"Commercial Division\" of High Court to hear \"All suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of the stated value of the subject matter which are filed in High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction\". \nThis includes all suits/applications filed before the commencement of the Commercial Courts Act/Ordinance and ssm/dgm 22 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw even the constitution of Commercial Division. This also includes all fresh suits, applications filed after the commencement of the Act and/or constitution of the Commercial Division provided it should be 'commercial disputes', having the valuation of the subject matter exceeding one crore. The mandate of Section 15(1) of the Commercial Courts Act is applicable even for all suits and applications pending in the High Court where commercial Division has been constituted - It shall be transferred to the Commercial Division of the High Court. It is, therefore, clear that Commercial Courts Act, in view of above provisions so reproduced is made applicable retrospectively and would take into its ambit all pending suits, petitions and applications relating to commercial dispute of the specified value and specified disputes. \nTherefore, all such suits, petitions and applications pending or fresh, will be governed by the Commercial Courts Act with effect from 23.10.2015. This is also clear, therefore, that all the rights in regard to pending suits, petitions and applications shall be governed by the Commercial Courts Act, once transferred. \nThe Commercial Court Appeal against Decision/Judgment/order/decree-\nssm/dgm 23 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 20 The jurisdiction of the Commercial Appellate Division as provided in Chapter Ii and specifically Section 13 provides that the Commercial Appellate Division of a High Court has jurisdiction to hear Appeals from decisions, judgments, orders or decrees passed by the Commercial Division of that High Court or by Commercial Courts within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the High Court. \n21 After giving due consideration to the provisions of Section 13(1) read with Section 13(2) it is apparent that it provides that Appeals will lie to the Commercial Appellate Division against the decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division. The words \"decision\", \"Judgment\", \"Order\" \"decree\" as such are not defined. It is defined and elaborated under the Cpc. From Section 13(1) it follows that it includes \"judgment\" or \"order\" and read with Sections 8, 13(2) it includes \"decree\" of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division.\nHowever, it is specifically mentioned in proviso to Section 13(1) that such orders as enumerated in Order Xliii of Cpc should be the order against which an Appeal against order is maintainable under Section\n13. Further the proviso contemplates that an Appeal would lie against appealable order under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation ssm/dgm 24 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Act, 1996. Section 13(2) has restricted the Appeals even for Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act by rider that \"no Appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court other than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\". This is also with \"notwithstanding\" clause under Section 13(2) whereby, it is mandated that \"notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of High Court\".\nTherefore, taking into consideration the overall provisions and intent of Section 13(1)and (2) which provides the specific orders against which an Appeal can be filed in such commercial matters. The Appeal under Section 13 is maintainable, once the Suits, Petitions Applications and Appeals are transferred and treated as commercial disputes having specified value, where the learned Commercial Division Judge has taken the decision and/or passed the \"judgment\"\nand/or \"order\" or \"decree\". It is relevant to note that under Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act, it is mandated and reinforced that the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act will prevail over the provisions of other Act. Therefore, an Appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act is maintainable against the decision/ judgment/ order or decree, if it falls within the ambit of the provisions ssm/dgm 25 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw of the Commercial Courts Act. This includes that the subject matter must be commercial dispute having valuation of more than one crore and falls within the territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction of the respective Court and/or Division and/or subject to the specific provisions like the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, read with the special statutes and the provisions so required, referred under umbrella of \"commercial dispute\" so defined. \nAppeal against any final decision include the judgment so passed by the Commercial Court and/or Commercial Division, the proviso to Section 13(1) will not be applicable to such decision/judgment, as the proviso refers to \"orders\". The reference to \"orders\" in the opening portion of Section 13(1) would relate to the application of the proviso to sub-section (1). However, the opening portion of sub-section (1) (words prior to the proviso) clearly use the words \"decision\", \"judgment\" and \"order\". Therefore, the ambit of this part of sub-section (1) is quite broader when it comes to appeals arising out of orders other than the category of orders falling under order Xliii of the Cpc. Therefore, an Appeal under Section 13(1), even if there is an order, but which has a tinge or colour of judgment ssm/dgm 26 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw as laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji v. Jayaben D. Kania & anr3 and Midnapore Peoples' Co-op. \nBank Ltd. (supra) , the Appeal under Section 13 against such order being a \"judgment\" within the meaning of Cpc, is maintainable. The provisions of Cpc (amended and unamended) are applicable to the Commercial Courts Act's proceedings. The term \"Judgment\" was not even defined under the Letters Patent Act. \nIn the summary suit, though it is an interlocutory order of granting Defendants conditional leave to defend such summary suit, as it directly affects and loses the valuable rights of the Defendant without giving full opportunity and as transferred and as heard by the learned Commercial Division Bench/Judge, the Commercial Appeal against such \"Judgment\" is maintainable. Therefore, we are of the view that there is no reason to hold that the Commercial Appeal as filed is not maintainable. \n\"Summary Suit\" and \"Summary Judgment\"-\n24 The conceptual position of \"summary suit\" as contemplated under Order Xxxvii of Cpc and its specific 3 (1981) 4 Scc 8 ssm/dgm 27 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw provisions are governed as per the original provisions of Cpc. \nThe amended Cpc, in view of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act inserted the provision for a \"summary judgment\", through Order Xiii-A which is made applicable to the classes of Suits (commercial suits) which required to be decided by the Commercial Division/Court. It prescribes the procedure and stages for application for summary judgment. This also includes and provides the powers of a Commercial Judge to pass conditional order including for evidence for hearing of summary judgment. We are concerned with Order Xiii-A, Rule 1(3) of Cpc, whereby it is specifically provided \"notwithstanding anything to the contrary, \"an application\" for summary judgment under this Order shall not be made in a Suit in respect of any commercial disputes that is originally filed as a summary suit under Order Xxxvii.\". Therefore, once the summary suit as originally filed, prior to the commencement of the and as now transferred, being commercial dispute matter, the original procedure as provided under Order Xxxvii shall be applicable to such summary suits. The parties are not entitled to prayer for summary judgment under Xiii-A in view of the specific ssm/dgm 28 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw provision so referred above. This also means that the judgments and the issues so decided in summary suit shall for all purposes be governed by the Cpc, even after such suits are transferred as commercial suits. The Commercial Division Judge is required to follow the original C.P.C. and is required to keep in mind the position in law revolving around all the facets of summary suits. The provisions of Section 13, therefore, is required to be interpreted and/or considered accordingly, when any decision is given by the Commercial Division/Court in such summary suit. The proviso to Section 13(1), will not affect the maintainability of such Appeal so filed against such order/judgment passed by the Commercial Division/Court in such summary suit. \n25 The submission that Section 13 proviso has extinguished, expressly and/or by necessary intentment the Appeal against the order passed by the Commercial Judge in summary suit granting the Defendant conditional leave to defend a summary suit is unacceptable. Section 13 itself contemplates that an Appeal is maintainable against the ssm/dgm 29 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw decision/judgment or order which has effect of \"judgment\", though it falls outside the purview of Order Xliii as observed above. \nThe right of appeal is creation of statute-\n26 It is settled that a right of Appeal is not a matter of procedure, but it is a matter of a substantive right which accrues to the litigant and as exists on the date of suit being instituted (see The Constitutional Bench decision in Garikapati Veeraya Vs. N. Subbiah Choudhry & Ors 4., para 23) Such right of Appeal is governed by the law prevailing at the date of the institution of the suit or proceedings and not by the law that prevails at the date of its decision or at the date of filing of the Appeal. It is equally settled that a vested right of Appeal is not absolute; and that it can in fact be abrogated either explicitly or by implicit intendment. [Kamal Kumar Dutta vs. Ruby General Hospital5]. The Commercial Courts Act provides for an Appeal against the decision, judgment and order so referred above. An Appeal is available if the commercial 4 Air 1957 Sc 540 5 (2006) 7 Scc 613 ssm/dgm 30 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw suit/dispute is dealt with by the Commercial Division/Commercial Court and passes order/judgment and/or take decision. This statutory Appeal as provided, therefore, cannot be taken away notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court [Section 13(2)]. The Commercial Courts Act or special Statute, if empowers, the Appellate Division Court to deal with the Appeal against the Judgment/order passed by the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court, the bar so submitted of proviso to Section 13(1) is not applicable in each and every matter specifically when the subject matters are commercial disputes as defined under the Commercial Courts Act and are also governed by the Special Act/Statute other than the Cpc. The specific provisions/ Statute/ Act will prevail as substantial rights, if are created over the provisions of Order Xliii Cpc, as provided in proviso to Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. \nFiling of Appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, cannot be occluded-\nssm/dgm 31 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 27 Section 13 Scheme itself provides Appeal against decision which includes judgment/order passed by the Commercial Division/Court. There is no provision of revision against the interlocutory order in view of bar of Section 8. Section 8 further clarifies that only Appeal against such order is available subject to Section 13 proviso. Even the issue of jurisdiction or such challenge will be subject to Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. Therefore, the aggrieved parties have no option but to file Appeal against the decision/order. The Appellate Court, however, may or may not entertain appeal against the order or interlocutory order, in view of proviso to Section 13(1). But filing of Appeal under Section 13, in our view, cannot be occluded. The Appeal against any decision of any Commercial Division/Court is maintainable. To entertain or not is the Appellate Court's power and the jurisdiction depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case. \nThe effect of not permitting to file the Commercial Appeal, in such matters-\n28 Another factor is, if such Appeals are not permitted, the aggrieved parties shall have no option but to invoke ordinary jurisdiction of the High Court or Court to challenge the interlocutory ssm/dgm 32 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw order or order though the decision is by the Commercial Division/Court, as commercial disputes are transferred and governed by the Commercial Courts Act for all the purposes. Such dichotomy, in our view, is surely not the intention of the legislature as followed from a cumulative reading of the various provisions as noted by us. \nThe filing of such Commercial Appeal by the party in the ordinary Court, except where suit/application, valuation is less than one crore, therefore, is not what is contemplated. It will frustrate the ambit and object of the Commercial Courts Act. \nThe commercial disputes of specified valued shall be governed by the Commercial Act only-\n29 There is no scope to any authority, not to transfer the commercial suits, having one crore and above valuation, for the purpose of pecuniary jurisdiction under the Commercial Courts Act, in case of a commercial dispute. The State Government needs to take steps as contemplated under Sections 19 and 20 of the Commercial Courts Act. All and every concerned authority are bound to aid and assist to give effect to these provisions to all the pending Suits/Applications, to achieve the object of the Commercial Courts Act. All are bound by the provisions, including amended Cpc to ssm/dgm 33 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw expedite the pending Suits filed prior or post the Commercial Courts Act. The Appeals are also expedited by the provisions so also pending Arbitration Petitions/Appeals as specified, though filed prior to the enforcement of the Commercial Courts Act. Sections 10, 13 and 15 deal with the pending Arbitration matters, including Appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The Supreme Court in a recent decision in Arun Dev Upadhyaya Vs. Integrated Sales Service Ltd. & Anr.6, now has expanded and included even the Appeal under Section 50 of the Arbitral Act in the facts of the case. It needs to be subject to valuation of the Suit/Appeal. \n30 We are also inclined to observe that the vested right of Appeal is not taken away by the Commercial Courts Act. However, it is subject to Section 13 so recorded above and/or Section 13 in no manner takes away and/or extinguishes right of Appeal in pending summary suits which are transferred and dealt with by the Commercial Division/Court. \n31 Having once observed that the Appeal under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act is maintainable, we are dealing with the 6 2016(9) Scale 427 ssm/dgm 34 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw merits of the matters on the facts and in the background already reflected/mentioned in the initial paras. \n32 The background of the litigations between the parties is relevant for consideration of this Appeal on merits. \nThe Respondent (Plaintiff) is a Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and is a Debenture Trustee of the debentures issued to Vinca Developer Private Limited (\"Vinca\") by Amazia Developers Private Limited (\"Amazia\") and Rubix Trading Private Limited (\"Rubix\"). Amazia and Rubix are wholly owned subsidiaries of Vinca. The Appellant (Defendant) and its individual promoters collectively own 90 per cent shareholding in Vinca. \nNederlandse Financierings - Maatschappiji Voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (\"Fmo\") is a Corporation constituted under the Laws of Netherlands. Fmo holds 10 per cent shareholding in Vinca. Fmo also holds 3 Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (CCDs) issued by Vinca.\nThe said three CCDs were convertible within a period of 60 months from December 2009. Upon such conversion, Fmo would hold 90% shareholding in Vinca. The investment made by Fmo in Vinca in the form of three CCDs was used by Vinca to purchase Optionally ssm/dgm 35 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Convertible Debentures (\"OPCDs\") issued by Amazia and Rubix. In respect of the OPCDs, a Debenture Subscription and Debenture Trust cum Mortgage Deed was executed on 1 December 2009 between Amazia, the Defendant and the Plaintiff. Similarly in respect of the OPCDs issued by Rubix, a Debenture Subscription and Debenture Trust cum Mortgage Deed dated 1 December 2009 was executed between Rubix, the Defendant and the Plaintiff as amended by Opcd Amendment Agreement dated 8 September 2010. The aforesaid deeds shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as \"the Debenture Trust Deeds\" (DTDs). In respect of the liability arising under OPCDs, the Defendant executed a Deed of Corporate Guarantee dated 9 December 2009 in favour of the Plaintiff, (the Guarantee). \n33 For the purpose of the present Appeal, the case of the Respondent-Plaintiff is as under:-\nOn 1 December 2009, Facility Agreement was executed between inter alia Rubix Trading Private Limited (as Borrower), Deutsche Investments India Private Limited (as Lender), the Respondent (Plaintiff) (as Security Trustee) and the Appellant-Hubton (Defendant) (as Confirming Party), Diipl has provided Rubix with a ssm/dgm 36 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw loan facility of Rs.23,50,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Three Crores and Fifty Lakhs only). On 9 December 2009, the Defendant (as Guarantor/Surety) has executed a Deed of Guarantee cum Mortgage and under which the Defendant has inter alia agreed to stand surety/guarantor and provide guarantee on behalf of Rubix in favour of the Plaintiff for the benefit of Diipl on the terms and conditions more particularly set out therein. On 22 January 2010, the said facility was disbursed to Rubix by Diipl. On 22 April 2012, Rubix was liable to pay interest on the facility each quarter. However, Rubix defaulted in payment of interest on the facility since 22 April 2012. \nOn 5 March 2013, Rubix made part payment of Rs.42,54,745/-. \n34 The Respondent-IDBI (Plaintiff) filed Summary Suit No. 520/2013 on 16 May 2013 against the Defendant for recovery of dues under the said Guarantee. Prior to the filing of the Suit, the Respondent (Plaintiff) (Idbi) on 10 May 2013, filed Company Petition No. 644 of 2013 seeking winding up of the Defendant on the ground that the Defendant has failed to comply with the statutory notice to pay the amount under the guarantee. On 12 February 2014, the Respondent-IDBI (Plaintiff) filed Summary Suit No. 480 of 2014 for ssm/dgm 37 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw recovery of the back end coupon dues payable under the said guarantee which amount was not included in the above summary Suit. \nThe Defendant (Hubton) has filed its affidavit in the Summons for Judgment raising several contentions. The Plaintiff too has filed affidavits dealing with the contentions raised by the Defendant. An additional affidavit is filed on behalf of the Plaintiff dated 4 July 2014 in Company Petition No. 644 of 2013 bringing on record the various facts. \n35 In view of the aforesaid defaults on the part of Rubix and the Defendant, Diipl vide its letter dated 5 June 2013, cancelled the facility with immediate effect and declared that all of the facility, along with accrued interest thereon were immediately due and payable. On 8 June 2013, the Advocates for Rubix sent Diipl a holding reply. On 9 June 2013, in the meantime, considering that Rubix had not fulfilled its obligations under the facility Agreement and considering that Rubix failed and/or neglected to repay the amounts demanded under the Recall Notice, the Plaintiff was constrained to issue a Demand Certificate to the Defendant for the enforcement of the Guarantee, in terms of the Deed of Guarantee. \nssm/dgm 38 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 36 Rubix's aforesaid holding reply was followed by a further reply dated 18 July 2013, as stated, false, baseless and wholly untenable allegations in its defence. On 8 August 2013, Diipl vide their letter replied to Rubix's letter dated 18 July 2013. Despite repeated requests and reminders and post several meetings and discussions, the Defendant and/or Rubix have failed and/or neglected to repay the Facility along with all amounts due and/or accrued thereunder including interest and default interest since 23 April 2012. \nIn view thereof, on 14 August 2014, Diipl was constrained to issue a supplementary recall notice to Rubix. On 19 August 2014, the Plaintiff (Idbi) issued supplementary Demand Certificate to the Defendant (Hubton) for the enforcement of the Guarantee, in terms of the Deed of Guarantee. No reply has been received to the aforementioned supplementary recall notice and supplementary demand certificate. Hence the summary suit and summons for Judgment No.39/2013.\n37 The Single Judge (Coram:- S.J. Kathawalla, J.) on 8 May 2015 in Summons for Judgment No. 39 of 2013 in Summary Suit No. ssm/dgm 39 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 520 of 2013 has passed the following order:-\n\"42. In the circumstances I am of the view that the Defendant has raised triable issues which require adjudication on further evidence at the time of final disposal of the suit. Hence the following order:\n(i) Unconditional leave is granted to the Defendant to defend the above suit;\n(ii) The suit is transferred to the list of commercial causes and the Defendant is directed to file its written statement on or before 15th June, 2015;\n(iii) The hearing of the suit is expedited and the Court will endeavour to dispose of the suit within a period of one year from the date of this order. It is clarified that the Suit shall be decided without being influenced by any of the observations made in the present order;\n(iv) Place the suit for framing of issues on 29th June, 2015. \nThe Summons for Judgment is accordingly disposed of.\"\n38 The Respondent-IDBI's (plaintiff's) case in Summons for Judgment No.111 of 2014 in Summary Suit No.776 of 2014, is as under:-\nThe Respondent's (Plaintiff's) case is that the Deed of Guarantee executed by the Appellant (Defendant) relates to the following three separate and distinct transactions:-\nssm/dgm 40 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw\n(a) Repayment of the amount of Rs.23.50 Crores loaned by Diipl to Rubix under the Facility Agreement;\n(b) Due performance and repayment by Amazia, of its OPCDs of Rs.150 Crores issued to Vinca on terms and conditions mentioned in Amazia Opcd Subscription and Debenture Trust Deed of 1 December 2009; and\n(c) Due performance and repayment by Rubix of OPCDs totaling Rs.268 Crores issued and allotted to Vinca on terms and conditions mentioned in Rubix Opcd Subscription and Debenture Trust Deed of 1 December 2009. \nAmazia and Rubix transactions referred to in (b) and (c) above involved Vinca which was a 100% holding company of both Amazia and Rubix. There was a separate Summary Suit filed by the Plaintiff herein for enforcement of the guarantee given by the Defendant herein for those two transactions. It was the case of the Defendant in that suit that the OPCDs reflected investments made by Fmo (referred to above), though ostensibly in Vinca, actually meant for Amazia and Rubix operating in the housing sector and what the transaction really contemplated was Fdi with assured/fixed returns in housing sector, ssm/dgm 41 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw i.e. in Amazia and Rubix, through a nominal recipient, Vinca. On a Summons for Judgment taken out in that suit, a learned Single Judge came to the conclusion that the factual matrix and transaction documents prima facie established that the transaction of routing Fdi through the newly interposed Vinca was a colourable device and was structured to enable Fmo to secure repayment of Fdi at a fixed rate of return, thus contrary to the Fdi policy and statutory Fema regulations and thus, opposed to public policy and illegal. The learned Judge held that the Deed of Guarantee issued by Vinca being a part of this structure was also prima facie unenforceable. (The learned Judge (S.J. Kathawalla,J), accordingly, granted unconditional leave to defend on 8 May 2015). \n39 It is, however, the Respondent-IDBI (Plaintiff's) case in the present summary suit that the Deed of Guarantee insofar as it relates to the Dippl Loan (forming part of (a) above), which is the subject matter of the present suit, is on the basis of the Facility Agreement which is in fact a plain vanilla Indian Rupee loan provided by the Plaintiff, an Indian registered Non-Banking Finance Company to Rubix, an Indian Entity, to which no Fdi law or policy applies. It is ssm/dgm 42 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw submitted that though this guarantee is contained in the same document as the guarantee provided for Amazia and Rubix OPCDs, it has nothing to do with either of these two transactions. It is submitted that it is an altogether separate transaction and in any event, severable from the other transactions. \n40 The defence of the Appellant-Original Defendant (Hubtown) was noted in para 6 and 12 of the said Summons for Judgment, which reads thus:-\n\"The Defendant disputes this case. Mr. Chinoy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Defendant, relies on paras 8(iv), (x), (xiii), (xxi) and (xxiv), and paras 15 and 16 of the affidavit in reply and paras 4, 9, 14, 18, 20, 22, 24 and 25 of the affidavit in rejoinder and argues that the circumstances reflected therein show that these three transactions were related and formed part of one whole transaction.\nThe gist of his contentions is this : Deutsche Bank A.G. agreed to act as an arranger of funds to be invested in a group company/companies of the Defendant to the tune of Usd 60 million (with an option to increase it to Usd 90 to 100 million) at an Irr of upto 20% per annum. (The OPCDs of Rubix and Amazia were part of this ssm/dgm 43 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw investment.) The consideration payable to Deutsche Bank was a stipulated arranger fee. The foreign investor identified by Deutsche Bank (i.e. Fmo) was willing to invest around Usd 90 to 100 million at a lower Irr (i.e. 14.75 % p.a.). As a result, Deutsche Bank asked for an increased arranger fee. The Defendant and its group companies being in a desperate need of funds, had to give in to this demand and were constrained to pay revised arranger fee. Deutsche Bank, in turn, agreed to reroute a part of the revised arranger fee as a loan to the Defendant or any of its group companies. The loan of Rs.23.50 extended by Diipl, at a far higher rate of interest, was a part of that commitment and thus, a part and parcel of the illegal structuring undertaken by Deutsche Bank. The Defendant submits that it was at the instance of the foreign investor that the loan of Rs.23.50 Crores was extended as an \"Indian leg of the structured transaction of the Foreign Investor along with Deutsche Bank A.G..... inspite of the fact that Rubix was in no need of the additional secured loan of Rs.23,50,00,000/from Diipl\". Relying on these facts, namely, of increased arranger fees, proximity of the dates of the individual transactions and common security documents, Mr. Chinoy submits that the transaction is one whole and the Diipl loan and the Deed of ssm/dgm 44 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Guarantee insofar as it relates to that loan cannot be separated from Fdi brought into India in an illegal and impermissible manner.\" \n\"Learned Counsel for the Defendant relies on the analysis of the facts of the case in the Plaintiff's suit for enforcement of guarantees in respect of Amazia and Rubix Opcd transactions in Idbi Trusteeship Services Ltd. Vs. Hubtown Ltd . 7 by the Learned Judge (S.J. Kathawalla, J.), whilst dealing with the case of Videocon Industries Limited Vs. Intesa Sanpaolo S.P.A . 8 in support of his defence. In that case, the learned Judge was considering the severability of the routing of Fdi investment in Amazia and Rubix through the newly interposed Vinca (as the nominal recipient of Fdi) and the guarantee given by the Defendant to ensure repayment of the Fdi. The learned Judge held them to be prima facie inseverable. Here, we are considering the severability of the guarantee towards repayment of Fdi and towards repayment of the Indian loan, which is separate from the Fdi transaction. The observations dated 8 May 2015 of Kathawalla, J. in that case have no bearing on this severability.\" \n41 The operative part of the impugned order dated 6 June 7 Summons for Judgment No.39-13 in Summary Suit No.520-13 decided on 8 May 15. 8 2014 Scc OnLine Bom 1276 ssm/dgm 45 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw 2006 passed in Summons for Judgment No.111 of 2014 in summary suit, is as under:-\n\"14 Accordingly, the Summons for Judgment is disposed of in terms of the following order:-\n(i) The Defendant is granted leave to defend on and subject to the condition of depositing a sum of Rs.33,55,16,946.85 in this Court within a period of twelve weeks from today;\n(ii) Upon such deposit being made, the suit shall be transferred to the list of commercial causes;\n(iii) The Defendant to file its Written Statement in the suit within twelve weeks of making of the deposit;\n(iv) The amount of deposit, if any, shall be invested by the Prothonotary & Senior Master of this Court in a fixed deposit of a Nationalized Bank initially for a period of two years and thereafter, to be renewed from time to time and to abide by further orders that may be passed in the suit;\n(v) The suit to come up on board for directions after twenty four weeks from today.\"\n42 Hence, this Commercial Appeal filed on 12 July 2016. \nThe reasons for the reversal of the impugned order- Two views on construction of documents-question of law-triable issue-\n43 Admittedly, the findings given by the learned Single Judge on documents being severable or unseverable, goes to the root of the ssm/dgm 46 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw interpretation and the construction of the same documents and the related transactions. The contrary view so expressed by the learned Judge in the impugned order (para 40 and 41), in view of the earlier findings (para 39) itself require a consideration in the suit and more particularly when another learned Single Judge in Summary Suit No. 520 of 2013 (supra) has prima facie held the document/guarantee is inseverable. In this position we are not persuaded to accept that the ratio of the decision of the Supreme Court in B.O.I. Finance Ltd. Vs. Custodian & Ors. 9, and in Canbank Financial Services Ltd. Vs. The Custodian & Ors. 10 would be applicable to the facts in hand. Reasoning of the learned Single Judge, (S.J. Kathawalla, J.) in order dated 8 May 2015, in para 37.2, 37.3 read thus-\n\"37.2 In the case in hand, I am prima facie of the view that the structure/device of routing FMO's Fdi amount of Rs. 418 crores to Amazia and Rubix through the newly interposed Vinca (as the nominal recipient of the Fdi) was a colourable device structured only to enable Fmo to secure repayment (through Vinca) of its Fdi amount and interest thereon at 14.75%, contrary to the statutory Fema Regulations and the Fdi policy embodied therein, which only permit Fdi investment in townships/real estate development sector to be made in the form of equity (including Compulsorily Convertible Debentures) and preclude any assured return. I am also prima facie of the view that the Defendant's guarantee (which is the basis of the 9 (1997) 10 Scc 488 10 (2004) 8 Scc 355 ssm/dgm 47 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw Company Petition No. 644 of 2013) though ostensibly in favour of Vinca, an Indian Company, was part of the aforesaid illegal structure/scheme and was given to ensure that Fmo received back its Fdi amount with interest as aforesaid through Vinca. The Guarantee was therefore part of the aforesaid illegal structures/scheme and therefore prima facie illegal and unenforceable. \n37.3 Further the question of the Defendant not being allowed to plead its own wrong also does not arise in the facts of the present case. Through the present Petition, the Plaintiff (who is admittedly acting at the instance of FMO/FMO's nominees) is in effect seeking the assistance of this Court to enable/enforce recovery by Fmo of its Fdi amount and interest thereon (through Vinca), contrary to the provisions of the Fema Regulations and Fdi policy embodied therein. As has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Immami Appa Rao vs. G. Ramalingamurthi (supra), the Plaintiff who wants orders in his favour, is actually seeking the active assistance of the Court to achieve what the law prohibits/declares illegal and that is clearly and patently inconsistent with public interest. Moreover, as has been held by the Supreme Court in the above case, in such a case there can be no question of estoppel and the paramount consideration of public interest requires that the plea be allowed to be raised and tried.\" \nThe defence so raised itself being the question of law, as the interpretation of documents itself goes to the root of the transactions/contract and the claim based upon it. In the present case, B.O.I. Finance Ltd. (Supra), as relied is not applicable on facts and the laws. That was a case of ssm/dgm 48 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw ready forward contract. In the case in hand, three documents and the transactions, of which two views of the learned Judges unless decided finally in due trial, it is difficult to accept the case that the view taken by the one learned Judge that transactions are sham and bogus and unseverable and other Judge hold it to be severable, without trial and by overlooking the earlier opinion, this itself is a triable issue. The Appellate Bench also may not decide such issue on such question of law, considering the scope and purpose of law on order Xxxvii of the Cpc, at this stage of the Summary Suit. It should be after final Judgment. In the present case, the same documents are interlinked and interconnected as observed by the earlier learned Judge, therefore, unless these findings are set aside, the findings in the impugned order that those are severable just cannot be accepted, without the trial. The case of misconstruction or interpretation of all connected documents itself made out a case of good defence. It cannot be treated as sham or bogus defence. The misinterpretation itself affects the rights and the transaction/claim. Therefore, the construction of documents is always question of law so is the position in case in hand. The distinction, therefore, at this stage, in summary proceedings like this, itself will not sufficient to deny the order of unconditional leave as ssm/dgm 49 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw granted by one Judge on the basis of same documents. (Sir Chunilal V. Mehta and sons Ltd. Vs. Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. 11 and Hero Vinoth (Minor) Vs. Seshammal12) Interpretation of documents and the nature of transactions-triable issue-\n44 We have to consider the legal position in view of the contentions so raised by the learned counsel appearing for the parties. \nThe Apex Court in Smt. Krishnabai Bhritar Ganpatrao Deshmukh Vs. Appasaheb Tuljaramarao Nimbalkar13, while dealing with the aspects of interpretation of any deed or documents, has held as under:-\n\"27. Secondly, there is ample authority for the proposition that when there is a dispute in regard to the true character of a writing, evidence de hors the document can be led to show that the writing was not the real nature of the transaction, but was only an illusory, fictitious and colourable device which cloaked something else, and that the apparent state of affairs was not the real state of affairs. [See Chandi Prasad Singh v. Piari Bidi C.A. No. 75 of 1964, decided on 16-3-1966, and Bhagwan Dayal v. Mst. Reoti Devi (supra) ]. \n45 While dealing with the effect of various transactions, based upon the various documents, the Court required to deal with and take into consideration every connected transactions and the documents, to 11 Air 1962 Sc 1314 12 (2006) 5 Scc 545=Air 2006 Sc 2234 13 (1979) 4 Scc 60 ssm/dgm 50 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw give total effect to the transactions by treating them all as one document. The Apex Court in (S.Chattanatha Karayalar Vs. The Central Bank of India Ltd.)14 has observed as under:-\n3. .......... \"The principle is well established that if the transaction is contained in more than one document between the same parties they must be read and interpreted together and they have the same legal effect for all purposes as if they are one document. In Manks v.\nWhiteley 1912-1 Ch. 735 at p. 754 ,, Moulton, L.J. Stated:\n\"Where several deeds form part of one transaction and are contemporaneously executed they have the same effect for all purposes such as are relevant to this case as if they were one deed. Each is executed on the faith of all the others being executed also and is intended to speak only as part of the one transaction, and if one is seeking to make equities apply to the parties they must be equities arising out of the transaction as a whole.\" \nConditional or unconditional leave? \n46 The law with regard to Order Xxxvii, Rule 2 and 3 of Cpc to grant or not to grant conditional and/or unconditional leave is elaborated as under, by the Apex Court in M/s. Mechelec Engineers & Manufacturers Vs. M/s. Basic Equipment Corporation15-\n\"8. In Sm. Kiranmoyee Dassi v. Dr. J. Chatterjee (49Cwn246, 253 :Air 1949 Cal 479), Das.

The case before us certainly does not fall within the class (e) set out above. It is only in that class of case that an imposition of the condition to deposit an amount in Court before proceeding further is justifiable.\" \n47 The Apex Court in this regard has further reiterated above principle and on facts as case was made out granted an unconditional leave. This makes the position of law clear, which need to be kept in mind while granting and/or refusing leave to defend. The case in hand, in our opinion, falls within the ambit of clauses (a) and (b) as expressed in Mechelec Engineers & Manufacturers (supra). [Sunil Enterprises and Anr. Vs.

Therefore, taking note of the reasons so given and recorded, we see there is no case to discard these reasons by overlooking the above basic principles of law. We have to keep in mind the basic principles so laid down, while considering the present case/Appeal also. We have taken note of the facts and circumstances, as well as the reasons given by the learned Single Judge, S.G.Kathawalla, and the Supreme Court Judgments so referred above, interpreting the transactions and the documents between the same parties and we are inclined to observe that a sufficient case is made out by the Appellant that they have a good defence to claim on its merits. This itself means, in the trial, they may be able to establish the defence to the Plaintiff's claim therefore, the Appellant-Defendant, at this stage, is entitled for the unconditional leave. The discretion so exercised and order so passed by imposing condition while granting leave, is unsustainable in the facts and the law and is liable to be interfered with. \n49 Therefore, taking overall view of the matter, we are of the opinion that this is a case where on merit, unconditional leave required to be granted to the Appellant on similar line as granted by ssm/dgm 54 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw the learned Single Judge dated 8 May 2015. \n50 Therefore, considering the totality of the matter, we are inclined to pass the following order-\nOrder\na) Appeal filed under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, is maintainable against the order of grant of conditional leave directing the parties to furnish the security/depositing the money in Sum mary Suit; \nb) Impugned Judgment and order dated 6 June 2016 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Commercial Division in Summons for Judgment No. 111 of 2011, is quashed and set aside, as the Defendant has raised the triable issues, which required adjudication on further evidence at the time of final disposal of the Suit;\nc) Unconditional leave is granted to the Defendant to defend the above suit;\nd) The Suit is transferred to the list of commercial causes and the Defendant is directed to file its written statement on or before 28 November 2016;\nssm/dgm 55 comap-7-16-judgment-24-10-16-final.sxw e) The hearing of the Suit is expedited.

counsel for respondent :manu khare hon'ble j.j. munir,j. 1. heard mr. k.m. asthana, learned counsel for the appellant and mr. manu khare, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent. 2. this is an appeal from an order of the presiding officer, commercial court, moradabad dated 05.03.2020, refusing to condone the delay in making an application by the appellant under section 34(2) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 19961. 3. the facts leading to the present appeal are these: the moradabad development authority, moradabad, hereinafter referred to as 'the appellant', entered into an agreement with m/s. v.r. construction and engineering company for a civil works contract on 28.03.2009. the subject matter of the contract was construction of a 'sourcing hub and warehouse' in sector 4, naya moradabad yojna, delhi-moradabad road. the project subject matter of the contract is said to be worth rs.26,03,84,722.93 only. the project was to be completed within a period of two years w.e.f. 03.03.2009. the said period would end on 02.03.2011, but was extended from time to time, as the appellant say, on the request of m/s. v.r. construction and engineering company, hereinafter referred to as 'the respondent'. 4. it is the appellant's claim that the time for completion of the contracted project was last extended up to 31.03.2016 subject to a penalty of rs.7.20 lakhs. it is the appellant's case that the respondent submitted an affidavit, saying that they were a-category contractors and also submitted a certificate of experience dated 10.02.2009 issued by a certain m/s. arch add consultants, new delhi certifying them as a-class contractors. besides, other testimonials were also attached in response to the tender notice for the works contract in question that was published on 27.02.2009. it appears that on 02.03.2009, a letter was issued by the appellant to the respondent that the respondent's tender has been approved, with a specific condition that if the experience certificate submitted by the respondent is found to be false upon verification, the earnest money deposited shall be forfeited and appropriate proceedings drawn in accordance with law. 5. it is the appellant's further case that the contract, that was later on executed, carried an arbitration clause, being clause no.32. clause 32(b) provides that if the respondent is dissatisfied with the final decision of the engineer-in-charge taken under clause 32(a), the respondent may, within twenty-eight days of receipt of the decision, give notice in writing, requiring the matter to be submitted to arbitration, furnishing detailed particulars of the dispute or differences. the notice would clearly indicate the point(s) in issue. it was further a term in the contract that if the respondent failed to serve a notice of arbitration within the time stipulated, the decision of the engineer-in-charge of the appellant, shall be conclusive and binding on the respondent. the appellant say that upon inquiries made from m/s. arch add consultants, new delhi with regard to the letter dated 27.01.2016 issued by the managing director of a certain kashi vishwanath steel private limited, the appellant were informed that the experience certificate under reference was never issued by m/s. arch add consultants, new delhi. 6. it is also said that the respondent committed various irregularities of a serious nature in the execution of the works contract. the appellant issued a letter dated 09.02.2016 to the secretary, awas evam sahari niyojan, anubhag-3 of the state government, requesting him to institute an inquiry into the irregularities committed by the respondent in the construction of sourcing hub and warehouse complex in sector-4 of the moradabad residential scheme under the works contract. 7. on 10.05.2016, the state government constituted an inquiry committee to go into the allegations of irregularities committed by the respondent vis-à-vis the execution of the contracted work. the inquiry committee, after notice to the respondent and the appellant, as the appellant say, visited the site and held inquiry. the committee is said to have submitted a report to the secretary to the government in the appropriate department. the appellant say that the certificate of experience submitted by the respondent, upon verification, was found to be false and fabricated. this verification is said to have been made from the company that had issued the certificate of experience. 8. the committee are also claimed to have said that the respondent carried out work according to their whims, bereft of any directions by the engineering department of the appellant. the committee are also said to have found that though a sum of rs.26,01,55,764/has been spent on the project, it was still incomplete and not in a state where it could be put to use for the public purpose that it was meant for. the committee are also claimed to have made a report to debar the respondent from doing any further work from the appellant and also recommending that final payment be made for the work that the respondent had validly executed. 9. it was in this background that a dispute arose between the appellant and the respondent, stemming from execution of the works contract entered into between parties. 10. in consequence, the respondent served a notice of arbitration under section 11(5) of the act of 1996. thereafter, the vice-chairman of the appellant appointed a sole arbitrator on 22.04.2017. it is the appellant's case that on 10.07.2017, the commissioner of the moradabad division, taking cognizance of the irregularities committed by the respondent, directed the appellant to initiate proceedings against the respondent by lodging a first information report. the direction was issued in view of the fact that the respondent's testimonials, entitling them to the contract, were found by the appellant and the inquiry committee appointed by the state government to be forged. 11. on 19.07.2017, the appellant say they issued a show cause notice, calling upon the respondent to submit a reply why they may not be blacklisted from obtaining future contracts by the appellant. an fir was lodged on 21.07.2017 by the appellant against the respondent, giving rise to case crime no.769, under sections 420, 467, 471 ipc, police station civil lines, district moradabad. it is not in dispute that the fir aforesaid was challenged before this court vide criminal misc. writ petition no.1470 of 2017 and was quashed vide a judgment and order dated 02.02.2018. 12. on the 21st july, 2017, an order was passed by the vice-chairman of the appellant, cancelling the appointment of the sole arbitrator with a further stipulation that since the contract was obtained on the basis of a forged and fabricated document, the same is null and void, and that the respondent is not entitled to invoke proceedings for arbitration. it is the appellant's case that the order cancelling the appointment of the sole arbitrator dated 21.07.2017 was served upon the arbitrator, mr. bal kishan gupta on 22.07.2017 and upon his refusal to receive it, the order was affixed on the arbitrator's residential premises on 22.07.2017. it is also the appellant's case that the sole arbitrator was also delivered the order cancelling his appointment through registered post on 22.07.2017. further, the cancellation of appointment was published in the daily newspaper hindustan, published from moradabad on 22.07.2017. the appellant say that the order dated 21.07.2017 passed by the vice-chairman of the appellant cancelling the appointment of the sole arbitrator was not challenged before any court or competent authority and the same has attained finality. 13. on 31.07.2017, the sole arbitrator addressed a letter to the appellant's secretary, which says that the letter sent by the appellant cancelling the arbitrator's appointment was received by him on 24.07.2017. the arbitral proceedings, according to the arbitrator, were concluded on 22.07.2017 and opinion was reserved. it transpires from the record that the award was made on 23.07.2017, which carries a complete record of the proceedings. the award shows in paragraph no.9 that in all, six hearings were held between 05.05.2017 and 22.07.2017. it appears that in these proceedings, the appellant did not participate and the proceedings went ex-parte. the award too was pronounced ex parte. it is the appellant's case that the letter dated 31.07.2017 does not mention the fact that the award was pronounced on 23.07.2017, though, later on, it purports to have been pronounced on 23.07.2017. it is the appellant's contention that the award is ante-timed and one made after communication of the letter cancelling the arbitrator's appointment by the appellant. admittedly, the award was served upon the appellant on 03.08.2017. it appears that on 05.08.2017 and 14.08.2017, upon receipt of the arbitrator's award, the vice-chairman of the appellant addressed orders to the respondent and the sole arbitrator, saying that the award pronounced on 23.07.2017 was without jurisdiction and void, inasmuch as the arbitrator's appointment had been cancelled on 22.07.2017. 14. it is the appellant's case that they were bona fide under the impression that since the award has been delivered by the sole arbitrator after cancellation of his appointment, the award pronounced is without jurisdiction and a nullity. it is inexucatble. the respondent filed an execution case under section 36 of the act of 1996, that was registered as arbitration case no.41 of 2019 before the court of the district judge, moradabad. the application sought execution of the sole arbitrator's award dated 23.07.2017 against the appellant for a sum of rs.4,73,93,012/-. the appellant say that upon knowledge of the institution of execution proceedings, they filed objection supported by affidavit under section 47 cpc before the district judge, that were registered as misc. case no.2 of 2019. it was prayed that the award was inexecutable, as the sole arbitrator had acted without jurisdiction and made the award on 23.07.2017, after his appointment as arbitrator had been cancelled by the appellant on 21.07.2017. the award was assailed as ante-timed. 15. the appellant's objection stood transferred along with the execution case from the court of the district judge, moradabad to the commercial court, before whom it came up for determination on 31.08.2019. the commercial court rejected the objection vide order dated 31.08.2019, holding that the question about the arbitrator passing an award without jurisdiction was something that could be gone into on an application by the appellant under section 34(2) of the act of 1996, but not under section 47 cpc. the commercial court has remarked that the objection under section 47 cpc had been brought two years after the award was passed and the remedy of the appellant was under section 34(2) of the act of 1996. 16. aggrieved by the order passed by the commercial court, moradabad dated 31.08.2019 rejecting the appellant's objection under section 47 cpc, the appellant preferred misc. petition (civil) no.67 of 2020 before this court under article 227 of the constitution. the aforesaid petition was dismissed on 19.02.2020 on ground that the appellant had an alternative remedy of moving this court in revision under section 115 cpc. the appellant then moved civil revision no.18 of 2020 challenging the order of the commercial court dated 31.08.2019, rejecting the appellant's objection under section 47 cpc. in the said revision, the delay condonation application made has been allowed vide order dated 28.09.2020 and a regular number has been assigned to the revision, which is now pending before this court, questioning the order dated 31.08.2019. the appellant, notwithstanding the challenge laid to the order dated 31.08.2019 passed by the commercial court last mentioned, on legal advice received, also filed an application under section 34(2) of the act of 1996 on 05.02.2020, along with an application under section 5 of the indian limitation act, 1963 seeking to set aside the award. 17. this application was registered as arbitration petition no.1 of 2020 on the file of the commercial court. the commercial court, by the order impugned, has held that it has no jurisdiction to condone the delay in making the application under section 34(2) of the act of 1996, inasmuch as it was moved on 05.02.2022, whereas the impugned award was served upon the appellant on 03.08.2017. the commercial court was of opinion that the limitation to challenge an award of the arbitrator under section 34(2) of the act of 1996 was governed by sub-section (3) of section 34, where the limitation to make such an application was three months from the date on which the party making the application had received the award, and further that by the proviso to sub-section (3) of section 34, the court had jurisdiction to condone the delay in making such an application within a further period of 30 days, but no more. it was on the aforesaid reasoning that the commercial court declined to condone the delay holding that it had no jurisdiction to do so. 18. mr. k.m. asthana, learned counsel for the appellant submits that the commercial court has committed a manifest error of law, inasmuch as the appellant's application, though worded as one purely for condonation of delay invoking section 5 of the indian limitation act, was, in substance, an application seeking to exclude the period of time that the appellant spent in pursuing remedies bona fide. mr. asthana submits that the application ought to have been considered bereft of its label as one under section 14 of the limitation act that squarely applies to proceedings under the act of 1996. he submits that section 14 of the limitation act is applicable to the rights of parties, who move the court under section 34, in the event they have pursued in good faith another remedy, which the other court on account of lack of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature was unable to entertain. 19. the submission before this court on behalf of the appellant, therefore, proceeds on the basis that the application seeking to condone the delay must be construed as an application excluding the period of limitation spent in the bona fide pursuit of other remedies/ remedy against the arbitrator's award. the remedies, mr. asthana points out, that the appellant pursued against the impugned award, on the foot of which he wants a substantial period of limitation to be excluded, are an fir that was ultimately quashed by this court on 02.02.2018 by an order made in criminal misc. writ petition no.1470 of 2017 and the objection that was filed under section 47 cpc in the execution brought by the respondent in the year 2019. the objection under section 47 cpc being rejected, this court was approached in the first instance under article 227 of the constitution and that remedy being held to be barred in view of the remedy of a civil revision, a revision was preferred, which is pending. it is, thus, pointed out that the appellant have pursued remedies in good faith before the competent fora, which ultimately, on account of holding want of jurisdiction in themselves, declined relief. mr. asthana has placed reliance upon the decision of the supreme court in gulbarga university v. mallikarjun s. kodagali and another2 to submit that the provisions of section 14 of the limitation act would apply to arbitral proceedings under section 34 of the act of 1996. it is his case that unlike section 5 of the limitation act, that may be held excluded in view of the provisions of sub-section (3) of section 34, section 14 of the limitation act applies to proceedings under section 34 of the act of 1996 in the same manner as it does to suits. he has drawn the attention of the court to the following holding of their lordships in gulbarga university (supra): \"8. dr. m.p. raju, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would contend that the earlier decision of this court in union of india v. popular construction co. [(2001) 8 scc 470 : air 2001 sc 4010] whereupon reliance has been placed by the high court has since been revisited by this court in state of goa v. western builders [(2006) 6 scc 239] holding : (scc p. 246, paras 14-18) \"14. the question is whether section 14 of the limitation act has been excluded by this special enactment i.e. the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. section 43 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 clearly says that the limitation act, 1963 shall apply to arbitration as it applies to the proceedings in the court. 15. therefore, general proposition is by virtue of section 43 of the act of 1996 the limitation act, 1963 applies to the act of 1996 but by virtue of sub-section (2) of section 29 of the limitation act, if any other period has been prescribed under the special enactment for moving the application or otherwise then that period of limitation will govern the proceedings under that act, and not the provisions of the limitation act. in the present case under the act of 1996 for setting aside the award on any of the grounds mentioned in sub-section (2) of section 34 the period of limitation has been prescribed and that will govern. likewise, the period of condonation of delay i.e. 30 days in the proviso. 16. but there is no provision made in the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 that if any party has bona fide prosecuted its remedy before the other forum which had no jurisdiction then in that case whether the period spent in prosecuting the remedy bona fidely in that court can be excluded or not. as per the provision, sub-section (3) of section 34 which prescribes the period of limitation (3 months) for moving the application for setting aside the award before the court then that period of limitation will be applicable and not the period of limitation prescribed in the schedule under section 3 of the limitation act, 1963. thus, the provision of moving the application prescribed in the limitation act, shall stand excluded by virtue of sub-section (2) of section 29 as under this special enactment the period of limitation has already been prescribed. likewise the period of condonation of delay i.e. 30 days by virtue of the proviso. 17. therefore, by virtue of sub-section (2) of section 29 of the limitation act what is excluded is the applicability of section 5 of the limitation act and under section 3 read with the schedule which prescribes the period for moving application. 18. whenever two enactments are overlapping each other on the same area then the courts should be cautious in interpreting those provisions. it should not exceed the limit provided by the statute. the extent of exclusion is, however, really a question of construction of each particular statute and general principles applicable are subordinate to the actual words used by legislature.\" referring to popular construction [(2001) 8 scc 470 : air 2001 sc 4010] and national aluminium co. ltd. v. pressteel & fabrications (p) ltd. [(2004) 1 scc 540] it was held : (western builders case [(2006) 6 scc 239] , scc pp. 248-49, para 25) \"25. therefore, in the present context also it is very clear to us that there are no two opinions in the matter that the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 does not expressly exclude the applicability of section 14 of the limitation act. the prohibitory provision has to be construed strictly. it is true that the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 intended to expedite commercial issues expeditiously. it is also clear in the statement of objects and reasons that in order to recognise economic reforms the settlement of both domestic and international commercial disputes should be disposed of quickly so that the country's economic progress be expedited. the statement of objects and reasons also nowhere indicates that section 14 of the limitation act shall be excluded. but on the contrary, intendment of the legislature is apparent in the present case as section 43 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 applies the limitation act, 1963 as a whole. it is only by virtue of sub-section (2) of section 29 of the limitation act that its operation is excluded to that extent of the area which is covered under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. our attention was also invited to the various decisions of this court interpreting sub-section (2) of section 29 of the limitation act with reference to other acts like the representation of the people act or the provisions of the criminal procedure code where separate period of limitation has been prescribed. we need not overburden the judgment with reference to those cases because it is very clear to us by virtue of sub-section (2) of section 29 of the limitation act that the provisions of the limitation act shall stand excluded in the act of 1996 to the extent of area which is covered by the act of 1996. in the present case under section 34 by virtue of sub-section (3) only (sic for) the application for filing and setting aside the award a period has been prescribed as 3 months and delay can be condoned to the extent of 30 days. to this extent the applicability of section 5 of the limitation act will stand excluded but there is no provision in the act of 1996 which excludes operation of section 14 of the limitation act. if two acts can be read harmoniously without doing violation to the words used therein, then there is no prohibition in doing so.\" the ratio laid down in the said decision has since been reiterated in union of india v. bhavna engg. co. [(2008) 13 scc 546 : (2007) 5 raj 458] stating : (scc pp. 546-47, para 2) \"2. this court in a recent judgment rendered in state of goa v. western builders [(2006) 6 scc 239] held that section 14 of the limitation act, 1963 is applicable in the arbitration and conciliation proceedings. having gone through the various facts, we are of the view that the mistake committed by the appellant in approaching the madhya pradesh high court and the bombay high court is bona fide. we, therefore, condone the delay. in the facts of this case and in the interest of justice, we, however, think it proper that the section 34 application pending before the additional district judge, gwalior be transferred to the bombay high court. the application will be decided on merits expeditiously. parties are at liberty to urge all the contentions before that court.\" 9. there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that in terms of sub-section (2) of section 34 of the act, an arbitral award may be set aside only if one of the conditions specified therein is satisfied. sub-section (3) of section 34 provides for the period of limitation within which an application under section 34 of the act is to be filed. the proviso appended thereto empowers the court to entertain an application despite expiry of the period of limitation specified therein, namely, three months. no provision, however, exists as regards application of section 14 of the limitation act. this court, as noticed hereinbefore in western builders [(2006) 6 scc 239] opined that sub-section (2) of section 29 thereof would apply to an arbitration proceedings and consequently section 14 of the limitation act would also be applicable. we are bound by the said decision. once it is held that the provisions of section 14 of the limitation act, 1963 would apply, it must be held that the learned trial judge as also the high court had committed an error in not applying the said provisions.\" 20. mr. manu khare, learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, refuting the submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant, has submitted that the application made in aid of the substantive application under section 34 of the act of 1996 is, in substance, one that is under section 5 of the limitation act, seeking condonation of delay and not merely one that goes by that label. mr. khare submits that there is nothing said in the application to indicate that the appellant ever urged a case based on exclusion of the period spent in bona fide prosecution of a remedy before another court or forum that was ultimately found to be incompetent. he urges that so far as an application under section 5 of the limitation act is concerned, the said provision does not apply at all to proceedings under section 34 of the act of 1996, in view of the proviso to sub-section (3) of section 34 of the act of 1996. learned counsel for the respondent has placed reliance upon the guidance of the supreme court in union of india v. popular construction co.3, consolidated engineering enterprises v. principal secretary, irrigation department and others4, p. radha bai and others v. p. ashok kumar and another5 and national spot exchange limited v. anil kohli6. 21. in union of india v. popular construction co. (supra), it has been held: \"16. furthermore, section 34(1) itself provides that recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award \"in accordance with\" sub-section (2) and sub-section (3). sub-section (2) relates to grounds for setting aside an award and is not relevant for our purposes. but an application filed beyond the period mentioned in section 34, sub-section (3) would not be an application \"in accordance with\" that sub-section. consequently by virtue of section 34(1), recourse to the court against an arbitral award cannot be made beyond the period prescribed. the importance of the period fixed under section 34 is emphasised by the provisions of section 36 which provide that \"where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under section 34 has expired . the award shall be enforced under the code of civil procedure, 1908 in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court\". this is a significant departure from the provisions of the arbitration act, 1940. under the 1940 act, after the time to set aside the award expired, the court was required to \"proceed to pronounce judgment according to the award, and upon the judgment so pronounced a decree shall follow\" (section 17). now the consequence of the time expiring under section 34 of the 1996 act is that the award becomes immediately enforceable without any further act of the court. if there were any residual doubt on the interpretation of the language used in section 34, the scheme of the 1996 act would resolve the issue in favour of curtailment of the court's powers by the exclusion of the operation of section 5 of the limitation act.\" 22. so far as the decision in consolidated engg. enterprises v. irrigation deptt. (supra) is concerned, it brings out the distinction that while section 5 of the limitation act would not apply to an application under section 34(2) of the act of 1996, section 14 of the limitation act would still apply. in consolidated engg. enterprises v. irrigation deptt., it has been held: \"19. a bare reading of sub-section (3) of section 34 read with the proviso makes it abundantly clear that the application for setting aside the award on the grounds mentioned in sub-section (2) of section 34 will have to be made within three months. the period can further be extended, on sufficient cause being shown, by another period of 30 days but not thereafter. it means that as far as application for setting aside the award is concerned, the period of limitation prescribed is three months which can be extended by another period of 30 days, on sufficient cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court. 20. section 29(2) of the limitation act inter alia provides that where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period of limitation prescribed by the schedule, the provisions of section 3 shall apply as if such period was the period prescribed by the schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions contained in sections 4 to 24 shall apply only insofar as, and to the extent, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. when any special statute prescribes certain period of limitation as well as provision for extension up to specified time-limit, on sufficient cause being shown, then the period of limitation prescribed under the special law shall prevail and to that extent the provisions of the limitation act shall stand excluded. as the intention of the legislature in enacting sub-section (3) of section 34 of the act is that the application for setting aside the award should be made within three months and the period can be further extended on sufficient cause being shown by another period of 30 days but not thereafter, this court is of the opinion that the provisions of section 5 of the limitation act would not be applicable because the applicability of section 5 of the limitation act stands excluded because of the provisions of section 29(2) of the limitation act. however, merely because it is held that section 5 of the limitation act is not applicable to an application filed under section 34 of the act for setting aside an award, one need not conclude that provisions of section 14 of the limitation act would also not be applicable to an application submitted under section 34 of the act of 1996. 21. section 14 of the limitation act deals with exclusion of time of proceeding bona fide in a court without jurisdiction. on analysis of the said section, it becomes evident that the following conditions must be satisfied before section 14 can be pressed into service: (1) both the prior and subsequent proceedings are civil proceedings prosecuted by the same party; (2) the prior proceeding had been prosecuted with due diligence and in good faith; (3) the failure of the prior proceeding was due to defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature; (4) the earlier proceeding and the latter proceeding must relate to the same matter in issue and; (5) both the proceedings are in a court. 22. the policy of the section is to afford protection to a litigant against the bar of limitation when he institutes a proceeding which by reason of some technical defect cannot be decided on merits and is dismissed. while considering the provisions of section 14 of the limitation act, proper approach will have to be adopted and the provisions will have to be interpreted so as to advance the cause of justice rather than abort the proceedings. it will be well to bear in mind that an element of mistake is inherent in the invocation of section 14. in fact, the section is intended to provide relief against the bar of limitation in cases of mistaken remedy or selection of a wrong forum. on reading section 14 of the act it becomes clear that the legislature has enacted the said section to exempt a certain period covered by a bona fide litigious activity. upon the words used in the section, it is not possible to sustain the interpretation that the principle underlying the said section, namely, that the bar of limitation should not affect a person honestly doing his best to get his case tried on merits but failing because the court is unable to give him such a trial, would not be applicable to an application filed under section 34 of the act of 1996. the principle is clearly applicable not only to a case in which a litigant brings his application in the court, that is, a court having no jurisdiction to entertain it but also where he brings the suit or the application in the wrong court in consequence of bona fide mistake or (sic of) law or defect of procedure. having regard to the intention of the legislature this court is of the firm opinion that the equity underlying section 14 should be applied to its fullest extent and time taken diligently pursuing a remedy, in a wrong court, should be excluded. 27. the contention that in view of the decision of the division bench of this court in union of india v. popular construction co. [(2001) 8 scc 470] the court should hold that the provisions of section 14 of the limitation act would not apply to an application filed under section 34 of the act, is devoid of substance. in the said decision what is held is that section 5 of the limitation act is not applicable to an application challenging an award under section 34 of the act. section 29(2) of the limitation act inter alia provides that where any special or local law prescribes, for any application, a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the schedule, the provisions contained in sections 4 to 24 shall apply only insofar as, and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. on introspection, the division bench of this court held that the provisions of section 5 of the limitation act are not applicable to an application challenging an award. this decision cannot be construed to mean as ruling that the provisions of section 14 of the limitation act are also not applicable to an application challenging an award under section 34 of the act. as noticed earlier, in the act of 1996, there is no express provision excluding application of the provisions of section 14 of the limitation act to an application filed under section 34 of the act for challenging an award. 28. further, there is fundamental distinction between the discretion to be exercised under section 5 of the limitation act and exclusion of the time provided in section 14 of the said act. the power to excuse delay and grant an extension of time under section 5 is discretionary whereas under section 14, exclusion of time is mandatory, if the requisite conditions are satisfied. section 5 is broader in its sweep than section 14 in the sense that a number of widely different reasons can be advanced and established to show that there was sufficient cause in not filing the appeal or the application within time. the ingredients in respect of sections 5 and 14 are different. the effect of section 14 is that in order to ascertain what is the date of expiration of the \"prescribed period\", the days excluded from operating by way of limitation, have to be added to what is primarily the period of limitation prescribed. having regard to all these principles, it is difficult to hold that the decision in popular construction co. [(2001) 8 scc 470] rules that the provisions of section 14 of the limitation act would not apply to an application challenging an award under section 34 of the act. 31. to attract the provisions of section 14 of the limitation act, five conditions enumerated in the earlier part of this judgment have to co-exist [ed.: see para 21, above.] . there is no manner of doubt that the section deserves to be construed liberally. due diligence and caution are essential prerequisites for attracting section 14. due diligence cannot be measured by any absolute standards. due diligence is a measure of prudence or activity expected from and ordinarily exercised by a reasonable and prudent person under the particular circumstances. the time during which a court holds up a case while it is discovering that it ought to have been presented in another court, must be excluded, as the delay of the court cannot affect the due diligence of the party. section 14 requires that the prior proceeding should have been prosecuted in good faith and with due diligence. the definition of good faith as found in section 2(h) of the limitation act would indicate that nothing shall be deemed to be in good faith which is not done with due care and attention. it is true that section 14 will not help a party who is guilty of negligence, lapse or inaction. however, there can be no hard-and-fast rule as to what amounts to good faith. it is a matter to be decided on the facts of each case. it will, in almost every case be more or less a question of degree. the mere filing of an application in wrong court would not prima facie show want of good faith. there must be no pretended mistake intentionally made with a view to delaying the proceedings or harassing the opposite party. in the light of these principles, the question will have to be considered whether the appellant had prosecuted the matter in other courts with due diligence and in good faith.\" 23. there is little doubt, in view of consistent authority, that section 34(3) provides for a special rule of limitation and sections 4 to 24 of the limitation act, though applicable generally to an application under section 34 of the act of 1996, is governed by a special law, that is to say, the act, where the period of limitation for making such an application is differently prescribed. section 29(2) of the limitation act permits the application of sections 4 to 24 of the limitation act, applying it to a differently prescribed period of limitation at variance with that prescribed under the schedule to the limitation act, but only so far and to the extent that any particular provision or provisions of the limitation act are not expressly excluded. not only a particular period of limitation is prescribed under sub-section (3) of section 34 of the act of 1996, but the proviso further mandates that the court, upon being satisfied about the sufficiency of cause relating to the delay in making an application under section 34(2), may condone the delay beyond the prescribed period of three months and entertain the application, but that period of time, during which the delay can be condoned, has been limited to 30 days after expiry of the prescribed period of limitation, under sub-section (3) of section 34. after the period of three months prescribed under sub-section (3) of section 34 of the act of 1996 has expired, the court, on sufficient cause being shown by the applicant, may entertain an application within a further period of 30 days, but \"not thereafter\" to employ the precise words of the statute. it is this provision, which high authority has consistently held to exclude the application of section 5 of the limitation act with an open ended discretion to the court to condone, without reference to the period of delay involved. 24. the question here is: whether the delay that has been occasioned in making the application under section 34(2) of the act of 1996 can be regarded as one seeking benefit of section 14 of the limitation act, without expressly saying so or praying in those terms? the other is that: do the course of events, the proceedings taken and the conduct of the appellant entitle the appellant to claim exclusion of limitation under section 14 of the limitation act? 25. the answer to the first question is to be amply found in m.p. steel corporation v. commissioner of central excise7, where, in dealing with an objection by the other side that at no point of time the appellant in that case had taken up a plea based on section 14, it was held: \"8. shri a.k. sanghi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the department has stated that at no point of time has the appellant taken up a plea based on section 14. neither has the appellant met with any of the five conditions set out in para 21 of consolidated engg. enterprises v. irrigation deptt. [(2008) 7 scc 169] , which reads as follows : (scc p. 181) 21. \"section 14 of the limitation act deals with exclusion of time of proceeding bona fide in a court without jurisdiction. on analysis of the said section, it becomes evident that the following conditions must be satisfied before section 14 can be pressed into service: (1) both the prior and subsequent proceedings are civil proceedings prosecuted by the same party; (2) the prior proceeding had been prosecuted with due diligence and in good faith; (3) the failure of the prior proceeding was due to defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature; (4) the earlier proceeding and the latter proceeding must relate to the same matter in issue; and (5) both the proceedings are in a court.\" 9. technically speaking, shri a.k. sanghi, may be correct. however, in an application for condonation of delay the appellant pointed out that they were pursuing a remedy before another appellate forum which ought to be excluded. we deem this averment sufficient for the appellant to contend that section 14 of the limitation act or principles laid down under it would be attracted to the facts of this case. 26. elsewhere also, in the holding of their lordships in m.p. steel corporation (supra), what is emphasized is the substance of facts entitling a litigant to raise a plea under section 14 of the limitation act, subject to fulfillment of other conditions required by the aforesaid provision. section 14 has been regarded as a provision that embodies a principle meant to further the ends of justice. it is designed to come to the aid of a litigant, who bona fide in the quest of justice has treaded a wrong path. time spent in proceedings taken in error by a litigant before a wrong forum or hit by a similar technical flaw, that remain inconsequential or abortive, has to be added to the prescribed period of limitation. the principle embodied in section 5 of the limitation act, or for that matter, in the proviso to section 43(3) of the act of 1996, is generically and essentially different from that in section 14 of the limitation act. the former envisages condonation of delay with the period of limitation running its course, whereas the latter postulates an addition to the period of limitation. in determining the character of the application made to overcome the delay, it is the substance of the matter that is important, rather than the formality of the plea or the terms of the prayer, much less the label of the application. 27. it must, therefore, be held that that merely because the application made by the appellant does not formally invoke section 14 of the limitation act, the court below could not have turned its face away from considering the appellant's case, invoking benefit of the provisions of section 14 of the limitation act, if that is otherwise made out on the terms of the statute and the facts and evidence. it has been noticed while referring to the decision in consolidated engg. enterprises v. irrigation deptt. (supra) that five facts are to be established in order to invoke the provisions of section 14 that are enumerated in paragraph no.21 of the report. it postulates that both the prior and subsequent proceedings are civil proceedings prosecuted by the same party; the prior proceeding had been prosecuted with due diligence and in good faith; the failure of the earlier proceeding was due to defect of jurisdiction or other similar cause; the earlier and the later proceeding relate to the same matter in issue; and both the proceedings were in a court. these principles have been further explained with greater precision in m.p. steel corporation. but, for the purpose of the present case, that need not be dwelt upon. 28. the facts here indicate that the award was pronounced on 23.07.2017. it was communicated to the appellant on 03.08.2017. the appellant, no doubt, lodged an fir on 21.07.2017 against the respondent, that was quashed by this court on 02.02.2018. it was a step that was taken before communication of the award. in any case, lodging of an fir are not prior civil proceedings pursued by the appellant against the respondent, that ended with being quashed by this court. the lodging of the fir was an act setting the criminal law into motion, alleging fraud on the respondent's part and possibly, the fir cannot be regarded as civil proceedings by the appellant that could undo the award passed by the arbitrator without jurisdiction, as the appellants say. the belief of the appellant that since the appointment of the sole arbitrator had been cancelled by the vice-chairman of the appellant on 21.07.2017, the award rendered by him on 23.07.2017 was a nullity, also do not constitute prior civil proceedings prosecuted by the appellant in good faith and with due diligence, that would lead to the desired remedy. 29. the earliest that the appellant moved against the award was by way of an objection under section 47 cpc in the execution case brought by the respondent and that was on 08.05.2019. there is nothing tangible on record to show that anything was done prior to 08.05.2019 by the appellant through any kind of civil proceedings, may be before a wrong forum or before the right forum in the wrong frame. absolutely nothing was done by the appellant until 08.05.2019 by way of steps taken to set aside the award made by the sole arbitrator. it is true that after rejection of the objection under section 47 cpc, it may legitimately be said that the appellant has prosecuted with due diligence and in good faith their remedies by moving this court under article 227. further, upon dismissal of the petition under article 227 on the ground of alternative remedy, the appellant had moved this court under section 115 cpc, where they have been granted a condonation of delay in moving the civil revision. the challenge to the order refusing objections under section 47 cpc is still pending before this court. the inference is that after 08.05.2019, the appellant has pursued their remedy, may be before the wrong forum and subsequently brought this application correctly advised, under section 34(2) of the act of 1996. but, there is a gaping void in time and a continuously running limitation between the service of the impugned award on 03.08.2017 and 08.05.2019, when for the first time the appellant put in objections under section 47 cpc to the execution levied by the respondent for enforcement of the award. can the subsequent action, that is to say, after 08.05.2019, in prosecuting the remedies against the award under section 47 cpc, that may or may not be without jurisdiction or flawed for a similar defect, be regarded as a condition fulfilling the essential postulates that attract section 14 of the limitation act? in the opinion of this court, the proceedings taken after 08.05.2019 would not avail for the purpose of section 14 of the limitation act. in m.p. steel corporation, it has been held: \"52. as has been already noticed, sarathy case [(2000) 5 scc 355 : 2000 scc (l&s) 699] has also held that the court referred to in section 14 would include a quasi-judicial tribunal. there appears to be no reason for limiting the reach of the expression \"prosecuting with due diligence\" to institution of a proceeding alone and not to the date on which the cause of action for such proceeding might arise in the case of appellate or revisional proceedings from original proceedings which prove to be abortive. explanation (a) to section 14 was only meant to clarify that the day on which a proceeding is instituted and the day on which it ends are also to be counted for the purposes of section 14. this does not lead to the conclusion that the period from the cause of action to the institution of such proceeding should be left out. in fact, as has been noticed above, the explanation expands the scope of section 14 by liberalising it. thus, under explanation (b) a person resisting an appeal is also deemed to be prosecuting a proceeding. but for explanation (b), on a literal reading of section 14, if a person has won in the first round of litigation and an appeal is filed by his opponent, the period of such appeal would not be liable to be excluded under the section, leading to an absurd result. that is why a plaintiff or an applicant resisting an appeal filed by a defendant shall also be deemed to prosecute a proceeding so that the time taken in the appeal can also be the subject-matter of exclusion under section 14. equally, explanation (c) which deems misjoinder of parties or a cause of action to be a cause of a like nature with defect of jurisdiction, expands the scope of the section. we have already noticed that the india electric works ltd. [(1971) 1 scc 24] judgment has held that strictly speaking misjoinder of parties or of causes of action can hardly be regarded as a defect of jurisdiction or something similar to it. therefore properly construed, explanation (a) also confers a benefit and does not by a side wind seek to take away any other benefit that a purposive reading of section 14 might give. we, therefore, agree with the decision of the madhya pradesh high court that the period from the cause of action till the institution of appellate or revisional proceedings from original proceedings which prove to be abortive are also liable to exclusion under the section. the view of the andhra pradesh high court is too broadly stated. the period prior to institution of the initiation of any abortive proceeding cannot be excluded for the simple reason that section 14 does not enable a litigant to get a benefit beyond what is contemplated by the section--that is to put the litigant in the same position as if the abortive proceeding had never taken place.\" (emphasis by court) 30. the principle above indicated and the terms of section 14 of the limitation act show that section 14 would not come to the appellant's rescue. the prescribed period of limitation under section 34(3), together with its proviso, is three months and another 30 days of time, that may be condoned by the court. the commencement of this period of time is from the date of communication of the award, which in this case is 03.08.2017. the period of limitation would, therefore, expire on 02.11.2017. the further period of time that could have been condoned by the court under the proviso to section 34(3) of the act of 1996 is another thirty days, that would take it to 02.12.2017. admittedly, during this period of time, no civil proceedings were instituted or prosecuted by the appellant to set aside the award on the ground of fraud or lack of jurisdiction or on any other ground that they seek to impeach it. the earliest challenge, as already noted through competent proceedings, that would qualify for the purpose of section 14 is 08.05.2019, when objections under section 47 cpc were filed before the executing court. therefore, in the considered opinion of this court, this is not a case where the appellant is entitled to the benefit of addition of the period of limitation spent in pursuing in good faith and with due diligence, a remedy that failed because of defect of jurisdiction or other like cause. the application under section 5 of the limitation act is clearly incompetent because limitation is governed by section 34(3) of the act of 1996 and condonation by its proviso; not by section 5 of the limitation act, as rightly held by the commercial court. 31. in this view of the matter, this court does not find any merit in this appeal. the appeal fails and is hereby dismissed. 32. costs easy. order date :2.3.2022 anoop"
