Assailing the same, the petitioners herein initially filed an appeal under Section 13 (1) of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (for short the Commercial Courts Act) on 05.03.2018 after obtaining a certified copy of the Order. Though the appeal was numbered, but realizing that an appeal will not lie against the said order filed I.A.No.5 of 2018 under Section 151 of C.P.C., seeking conversion of the appeal into a Civil Revision Petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. It is pleaded that filing of an appeal is a bonafide mistake and that grave prejudice would be caused if the petitioners are not allowed to agitate their grievance by converting the appeal into revision. \n4) The same was opposed contending that in view of Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act, no revision shall be entertained against an interlocutory order of Commercial Court including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to provision of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the Commercial Court. \n5) Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act postulates that any person aggrieved by any of the decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division of High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of 60 days from the date of judgment or the order, as the case may be. Provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order 43 of C.P.C. as amended by the Commercial Courts Act and Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. It appears that the present application seeking conversion is filed on a premise that an appeal shall lie from the orders passed by the Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Section 43 C.P.C. or under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 only. \n6) After considering the law on the subject and also the power of the Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in L.Chandra Kumar v. Union of India held that the jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India and on the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, forming its integral and essential feature, which cannot be tampered with much less taken away even by constitutional amendment, not to speak of a parliamentary legislation. \n7) In State v. Navjot Sandhu the Apex Court held that the jurisdiction under Article 227 cannot be limited or fettered by any Act of the state Legislature; the supervisory jurisdiction is wide and can be used to meet the ends of justice, also to interfere even with an interlocutory order, but however expressed that the said power must be exercised sparingly, only to move subordinate courts and Tribunals within the bounds of their authority to see that they obey the law. The Apex Court further held that the power is not available to be exercised to correct mere errors (whether on the facts or laws) and also cannot be exercised \"as the cloak of an appeal in disguise\".\n8) In Suryadev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai and others the Apex Court reiterated the principle laid down in the judgments referred to above, and held as under:\nWe are of the opinion that the curtailment of revisional jurisdiction of the High Court does not take away and could not have taken away - the constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court to issue a writ of certiorari to a civil court nor the power of superintendence conferred on the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution is taken away or whittled down. The power exists, untrammelled by the amendment in Section 115 of the CPC, and is available to be exercised subject to rules of self discipline and practice which are well settled. \n9) In Shalini Shyam Shetty and another v. Rajendra Shankar Patil , after considering the history the power of superintendence under article 227 of the Constitution of India, held as under:\n62. On an analysis of the aforesaid decisions of this Court, the following principles on the exercise of High Court's jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution may be formulated:\n(a) A petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is different from a petition under Article 227. The mode of exercise of power by High Court under these two Articles is also different. \n(b) In any event, a petition under Article 227 cannot be called a writ petition. The history of the conferment of writ jurisdiction on High Courts is substantially different from the history of conferment of the power of Superintendence on the High Courts under Article 227 and have been discussed above. \n(c) High Courts cannot, on the drop of a hat, in exercise of its power of superintendence under Article 227 of the Constitution, interfere with the orders of tribunals or Courts inferior to it. Nor can it, in exercise of this power, act as a Court of appeal over the orders of Court or tribunal subordinate to it. \nIn cases where an alternative statutory mode of redressal has been provided, that would also operate as a restrain on the exercise of this power by the High Court. \n(d) The parameters of interference by High Courts in exercise of its power of superintendence have been repeatedly laid down by this Court. In this regard the High Court must be guided by the principles laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Waryam Singh (AIR 1954 SC 215) and the principles in Waryam Singh (supra) have been repeatedly followed by subsequent Constitution Benches and various other decisions of this Court. \n(e) According to the ratio in Waryam Singh (supra), followed in subsequent cases, the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction of superintendence can interfere in order only to keep the tribunals and Courts subordinate to it, `within the bounds of their authority'. \n(f) In order to ensure that law is followed by such tribunals and Courts by exercising jurisdiction which is vested in them and by not declining to exercise the jurisdiction which is vested in them. \n(g) Apart from the situations pointed in (e) and (f), High Court can interfere in exercise of its power of superintendence when there has been a patent perversity in the orders of tribunals and Courts subordinate to it or where there has been a gross and manifest failure of justice or the basic principles of natural justice have been flouted. \n(h) In exercise of its power of superintendence High Court cannot interfere to correct mere errors of law or fact or just because another view than the one taken by the tribunals or Courts subordinate to it, is a possible view. In other words the jurisdiction has to be very sparingly exercised. \n(i) High Court's power of superintendence under Article 227 cannot be curtailed by any statute. It has been declared a part of the basic structure of the Constitution by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of L. Chandra Kumar vs. Union of India & others reported in (1997) 3 SCC 261 and therefore abridgement by a Constitutional amendment is also very doubtful. \n(j) It may be true that a statutory amendment of a rather cognate provision, like Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code by the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1999 does not and cannot cut down the ambit of High Court's power under Article 227. At the same time, it must be remembered that such statutory amendment does not correspondingly expand the High Court's jurisdiction of superintendence under Article 227. \n(k) The power is discretionary and has to be exercised on equitable principle. In an appropriate case, the power can be exercised suo motu. \n(l) On a proper appreciation of the wide and unfettered power of the High Court under Article 227, it transpires that the main object of this Article is to keep strict administrative and judicial control by the High Court on the administration of justice within its territory. \n(m) The object of superintendence, both administrative and judicial, is to maintain efficiency, smooth and orderly functioning of the entire machinery of justice in such a way as it does not bring it into any disrepute. The power of interference under this Article is to be kept to the minimum to ensure that the wheel of justice does not come to a halt and the fountain of justice remains pure and unpolluted in order to maintain public confidence in the functioning of the tribunals and Courts subordinate to High Court. \n(n) This reserve and exceptional power of judicial intervention is not to be exercised just for grant of relief in individual cases but should be directed for promotion of public confidence in the administration of justice in the larger public interest whereas Article 226 is meant for protection of individual grievance. Therefore, the power under Article 227 may be unfettered but its exercise is subject to high degree of judicial discipline pointed out above. \n(o) An improper and a frequent exercise of this power will be counter-productive and will divest this extraordinary power of its strength and vitality. \n10) The issue raised in the instant case as to the maintainability of the Civil Revision Petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, vis--vis Section 8 and 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, came up for consideration recently before a Bench of Gujarath High Court in State of Gujarat v. Union of India (R/Special Civil Application No.737 of 2018). It was also a case where a preliminary objection was raised as to the power of High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India to entertain a Civil Revision Petition against an order passed by the Commercial Court. Referring to the judgments of the Apex Court on the issue, the Bench of Gujarat High Court held as under:\nConsidering the law laid down by the Apex Court, we are of the opinion that bar contained under Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act shall not affect the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. If the contention on behalf of the respondents that considering Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act, even the writ jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is barred, in that case, such a provision would suffer from the vice of unconstitutionality as observed by the Honble Supreme Court in the aforesaid decisions. The power vested in the High Courts to exercise judicial superintendence over the decision of the Courts and Tribunals within their respective jurisdictions is part of the basic structure of the Constitution and no legislature can take away such power of superintendence conferred under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. It is required to be noted that therefore, even the legislature, while enacting Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act, seems to have wisely not used the word maintainable but has used the word entertained. \nAt this stage, it is also required to be noted that where the statute specifically provided that against the decision of the Tribunal, only an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution before the Honble Supreme Court would be maintainable, the Honble Supreme Court in the case of L.Chandra Kumar v. Union of India and others (supra) has specifically observed and held that the powers of the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution against the decision of the Tribunals shall still be available and the aggrieved party can approach the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution. Therefore, it is observed and held that Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act shall not affect the powers of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India against the order passed by the Commercial Court. However, at the same time, the powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India must be exercised sparingly and in exceptional cases only, more particularly, looking to the object and purpose of Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act, ie., speedy disposal of commercial disputes.\n11) In view of the judgments referred to above the argument that the High Court cannot entertain a Civil Revision Petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India in view of Section 8 of the Act, cannot be accepted.\n12) One other objection, which came to be raised is that if revisions are sought to be entertained under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the purpose for which the Commercial Courts Act has been enacted would get defeated. In other words it is pleaded that floodgates would be opened permitting every order passed by the Commercial Court be challenged under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \n13) In Coal India Ltd. And others v. Saroj Kumar Mishra the Apex Court observed that merely because there is possibility of flood-gate litigation, a valuable right of a citizen cannot be taken away. In para No.19, the Apex Court observed as under:\n19. The floodgate argument also does not appeal to us. The same appears to be an argument of desperation. Only because, there is possibility of floodgate litigation, a valuable right of a citizen cannot be permitted to be taken away. This Court is bound to determine the respective rights of the parties. \n14) It is also to be noted that every application filed under Article 227 of Constitution of India shall not be entertained. In fact, the law does not contemplate that a Civil Revision Petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is a statutory right which should be entertained. As observed by us earlier, in Surya Dev Rai case (3 supra) the Honble Supreme Court has observed that care, caution and circumspection needs to be exercised when the supervisory jurisdiction is sought to be invoked, during the pendency of any suit or proceedings in a subordinate Court and the error though calling for correction is yet capable of being corrected and the conclusion of the proceedings in an appeal or revision preferred there against and entertaining a petition invoking supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court would obstruct the smooth flow and/or early disposal of the suit or proceedings. Therefore, the Court would interfere only where the error is such, that if not corrected at that very moment, may become incapable of correction at a later stage. \n15) Keeping in view the object and purpose of enactment of Commercial Courts Act, the Courts would exercise their power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, we hold that the supervisory power of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is not taken away by Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act and the same cannot be restricted on the ground that it would open flood-gates of litigation in the High Court. In view of the above, I.A.No.1 of 2018 is allowed permitting the petitioners to convert the appeal into a Civil Revision. \n16) Coming to the facts in issue. As stated by us earlier, the present C.R.P. came to be filed questioning the order of the Commercial Court terminating the mandate of the Arbitrator on the ground that arbitration proceedings were not completed within the time fixed by the High Court in the review petition. \n17) For the sake of convenience the parties will hereinafter referred to as arrayed in C.O.P.No.81 of 2017. \n18) An application under Section 14 (2) and Section 15 of the Arbitration Act, came to be filed by the petitioners therein and respondents herein seeking to terminate the mandate of the 6th respondent therein (8th respondent herein) on the ground that he has become de jure and de facto, unable to perform his functions and failed to act without un-due delay. Petitioners 6 and 7 are companies registered under the Companies Act, 1956, organized and controlled by the family of petitioner Nos.1 to 3. Petitioner No.5 is a partnership entity. Petitioner No.1 is the wife of petitioner No.3 and mother of petitioner No.4 and petitioner No.2 is the mother of petitioner No.3. During the years 2007-2010, the petitioners lent a sum of Rs.20.00 crores to the respondents. As the said amount was not returned, the petitioners filed suits for recovery of money and also a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable instrument Act. It is said that as a counter blast, the respondents got registered a Criminal Case vide Cr.No.59 of 2012, against the petitioners. In the said case, petitioners 3 and 4 were arrested by the Central Crime Station, Hyderabad and while in custody they were forced to agree to pay a sum of Rs.9.00 crores to the respondent. Under duress and force, the petitioners are alleged to have signed the settlement deed dated 30.04.2012, letter of guarantee dated 30.04.2012 and ratification deed dated 03.05.2012. It is said that the petitioners were not allowed to read the contents of the documents, which they signed and they were not aware about the contents, including the appointment of the arbitrator. It is said that only after their release on bail, they were able to read the contents of the documents signed by them, were shocked to learn about the appointment of an arbitrator. As such, an application under Section 11 (5) and (6) of the Arbitration Act, came to be filed questioning the appointment of arbitrator, which was dismissed by this Court on 15.03.2013. A Review application came to be filed, which was also dismissed on 13.09.2013. The learned arbitrator issued notices dated 25.07.2012 and passed orders on 15.03.2013 and 13.09.2013 initiating arbitration proceedings. On 23.02.2014, an application under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act came to be filed before the sole Arbitrator, to direct the Arbitrator to withdraw himself from the proceedings with immediate effect on the ground of bias. Pending application under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act , the petitioners filed S.L.P. (Civil) Nos, 14146 and 14147 of 2014 before the Honble Supreme Court against the orders passed in Arbitration Application No.54 of 2012 and Review Application No.493 of 2013. \n19) On 11.08.2014, the Apex Court dismissed the said S.L.P.s, directing the Arbitrator to dispose of the application in accordance with law, without being influenced by the observations of the High Court. Subsequent to the order passed by the Apex Court, the petitioners filed an application seeking to amend the grounds in Section 12 application. On 15.11.2014, the said application came to be dismissed. Challenging the same, Arbitration O.P.No.2889 of 2014 came to be filed before the City Civil Court, Hyderabad, seeking termination of the sole arbitrator on the ground of bias, and also to direct the arbitrator to terminate his mandate as per Sections 12 and 14 of the Arbitration Act. It was further pleaded that a retired judge may be appointed as an arbitrator, to resolve the dispute. \n20) On 25.03.2015 the proceedings before the Arbitrator were stayed by the civil Court and on 30.04.2015 the Arbitration O.P.No.2889 of 2014 was dismissed. Challenging the same, C.R.P.No.1861 of 2015 came to be filed before this Court. Since the plea of undue delay on the part of the arbitrator to act ie., to complete the arbitral proceedings within the stipulated time of five months was raised for the first time during the course of arguments before the Court below and a passing reference was made there to and referred to few judgments by the petitioners therein in that regard, held that the Court could not have recorded any finding on facts such as to whether the delay of the arbitrator to act was undue or not; and, if so, whether the petitioners therein had waived such a right. Observing so, and rejecting the plea of bias, the said C.R.P. was dismissed . The operative portion of the order is as under:\nViewed from any angle, the mandate of the 6th respondent-arbitrator cannot be terminated, on the basis of the contentions urged by the petitioner, in the petition filed by them before the Court below under Section 14 (2) of the Act. Suffice it to make it clear that the order now passed by us shall not preclude the petitioners herein from agitating their claim of undue delay on the part of the arbitrator, in concluding arbitration proceedings and in passing the award, in appropriate legal proceedings; or to raise all the contentions urged before this Court, on whether circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrators independence or impartiality, in proceedings under Section 34 of the Act, after an award is passed. Subject to the observations made hereinabove, the Civil Revision Petition fails and is, accordingly, dismissed. \n21) It is to be noted here that pending C.R.P. before this Court, there was stay of arbitration proceedings from 04.05.2015 till 16.03.2016. \n22) From the narration of events till now, it is very clear that the arbitration proceedings were stayed from 25.03.2015 to 30.04.2015 and again from 04.05.2015 till 16.03.2016. In view of the liberty given by this Court, the petitioners filed Arbitration O.P.No.752 of 2016 (renumbered as C.O.P.No.81 of 2017), as a result of which the arbitration proceedings were again stayed from 13.04.2016, till the said C.O.P. was disposed of by the impugned order on 29.12.2017. \n23) Learned counsel for the petitioners herein would submit that there was no undue delay on the part of the sole arbitrator in conducting the arbitral proceedings and on the other hand, it is the respondents/petitioners, who are responsible for the delay. In other words it is pleaded that though in the review application, this Honble Court fixed a time limit of five months for disposing of the arbitral proceedings, but the matter was being stayed by one forum or the other, at the instance of the petitioners. It is further pleaded that there was no justification for the petitioners to plead the said ground, since the time granted gets automatically extended, due to the conduct of the parties in participating in the arbitration proceedings even after expiry of the said period, by waiving their right to insist on the time period to be followed by the arbitrator. \n24) It is further pleaded that in the S.L.P., filed before the Honble Supreme Court, assailing the order passed in Review Application and in Arbitration Application No.54 of 2012, the petitioners have specifically pleaded in ground No.S, that the Honble High Court was not correct in directing the arbitrator to conclude the proceedings within a period of five months, as the issue is complicated and that the Arbitrator would require more time to adjudicate the dispute. That being so, whether it is permissible for the respondents herein now to contend that the proceedings before the Arbitrator stand terminated, as he failed to complete the proceedings within the time fixed. It is further urged that in the petition filed under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act, the petitioners never raised any objection with regard to undue delay. Their main plea before the Arbitrator was of bias. It is further urged that though Section 14 (1) of the Arbitration Act provides for termination of the mandate of the arbitrator in the event the arbitrator unable to act without undue delay but not in a case where the delay was at the instance of a party to the proceedings. In support of the said plea taken, learned counsel for the petitioners relies upon the following citations. \n1. M/s. Hindustan Wires Limited v. Mr. R.Suresh 2. Jayesh H.Pandya v. Subhtex India Limited 3. Bhupinder Singh Bindra v. Union of India and another 4. Vijay Hiralal v. J.N.Port Trust 5. Snehadeep Auto Centre v. Hindustain Petroleum Corporation Limited 6. Shyam Telecom Ltd., v. Arm Ltd. \n25) On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents would contend that when the order passed by this Honble High Court in a review fixing the time limit for completing the arbitral proceedings was communicated to the arbitrator on 28.09.2013, itself there was no justification for him to continue with the proceedings even after 28.02.2014. It is further urged that though the arbitrator in the docket orders dated 07.02.2014 and 16.02.2014, observed that the Arbitral proceedings have to be completed within the time fixed, but no application came to be filed by either of the party or the arbitrator, seeking extension of time. It is further urged that even assuming that the period of five months is to be calculated from 11.08.2014 ie., when the S.L.P.s were dismissed and the said order was communicated to the Arbitrator in the month of September, 2014, the period of five months gets expired in the month of February, 2015. In the absence of any stay after September, 2014, it is urged that the order impugned herein cannot be found fault with. \n26) Insofar as the argument on delay, the petitioners are now estopped from raising such plea, since it is pleaded that after filing of appearance on 26.10.2013, the respondents therein took time for filing vakalath and counters to the memo filed by the petitioners on 10.11.2013 and 23.11.2013. Thereafter, a claim-petition was filed on 25.01.2014 to which the respondents sought adjournment on 07.02.2014. On 16.12.2014 the petitioners/respondents therein failed to appear, and on 23.02.2014, an application under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act came to be filed before the Arbitrator. In view of the above, it is pleaded that the delay on the part of the petitioners/respondents is misconceived and lacks merit. \n27) Insofar as the plea of waiver by conduct, while explaining the purport of the judgments relied upon by the counsel for the petitioners, he would contend that in all the cases referred to above, time was fixed in the agreements entered into by the parties and the objecting party had rightly and willingly participated in the proceedings without any objection. Under those circumstances, the Courts held that by conduct the parties waived the time fixed under the agreement. Since the time was fixed by the Court and as the petitioners have opposed the appointment of arbitrator from the date of his appointment; never willingly participated in the said proceedings and as the office of the arbitrator has become functus officio after expiry of five months, pleads that his mandate will automatically get terminated. In support of his plea, he placed reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in NBCC Ltd. V. J.G.Engineering and Haryana Packaids Pvt. Ltd., v. Indian Oil Corporation Limited and B.C.C.I. vs. Kochi Cricket Private Limited . Stressing on the word to appearing in the first part of proviso to Section 26 of the Arbitration Act, which is not there in second part of Section 26 of the Arbitration Act and which reads as in relation to coupled with the judgment of the Apex Court in B.C.C.I. (14 supra) the counsel would contend that since C.O.P.No.81 of 2017 was filed under Section 14 (1) of the Arbitration Act on 11.04.2016, after coming into effect of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 2015, the amended Act shall apply to the present case as well and in view of Section 12 (5) of the Arbitration Act read with 7th schedule of the Amended Act, the Arbitrator is de jure disqualified.\n28) Having regard to the arguments advanced by both the counsel, it would be necessary to go into the events which took place prior to the order passed in Arbitration Application No.54 of 2012. By an order dated 15.03.2013, this Honble High Court in Arbitration Application No.54 of 2012 passed the following order:\nAs agreed, the applicants and the respondents shall refer their disputes to Mr. Ravinder Singh Sarma, whom they have already appointed as sole Arbitrator, for resolution of dispute between them, in terms of the arbitration clause in the settlement deed. The arbitrator so appointed is at liberty to take the assistance of an advocate/legal counsel/expert, if required, for assessing the damaged caused. He is at liberty to fix his fee as also that of the fee of the advocate/legal counsel/expert, if he so chooses to take his or her assistance, for assessing the damage caused. \n29) From a reading of the above, it is clear that basing on the agreement arrived at by the applicants and respondents the Court referred the dispute to Mr. Ravinder Singh Sarma, who was already appointed as a sole arbitrator, for resolving the disputes between the parties in terms of the arbitration clause in the settlement deed. This order which was passed in the month of March, 2013, was sought to be reviewed by way of Review Application No.494 of 2013. The said Review application was dismissed holding that the application for review was thoroughly misconceived, as by the earlier order, the arbitration mechanism and appointment of arbitrator have been activated. The Court further held that there is no dispute that the arbitration agreement is valid and subsisting and there is no allegation that the consent recorded by the Court was not correct. The Court further observed that recording of consent earlier by the Court was not required to be set at naught, when the parties have chosen an arbitrator and the same arbitrator was appointed by the Court. \nTherefore, the Court held that there was no illegality or infirmity in the order passed, which was impugned in the review application. However, the Court directed the learned Arbitrator to proceed with the arbitration proceedings and to complete the same within five months from the date of communication of the said order. It would be useful to refer to the relevant portion of the order, which is as under:\nThis application for review is thoroughly misconceived as by the earlier order the arbitration mechanism and appointment of arbitrator have been activated. There is no dispute that the arbitration agreement is valid and subsisting. There is no allegation that the consent recorded by the Court is not correct. Moreover, the recording of consent earlier by the Court was not required to be set at naught. When the parties have chosen in agreement an arbitrator and the same arbitrator has been accepted by this Court. Therefore, no illegality or infirmity in the order passed by this Court. The review application is therefore dismissed. I direct the learned Arbitrator to proceed with the arbitration proceedings and complete the same within five months from the date of communication of this order. \n30) After the dismissal of the review application, in the month of September, 2013, an application under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act came to be made before the arbitrator. Though five months period would expire by 29.02.2014, no objection was raised with regard to the said aspect. The contents of the application were on bias and the manner in which the consent was obtained for appointment of an arbitrator. After filing this application on 23.02.2014, S.L.P.s came to be preferred before the Apex Court challenging the order passed in Arbitration Application No.54 of 2012 and Review Application No.494 of 2013, which were dismissed on 11.08.2014, directing the arbitrator to dispose of the application un-influenced by the orders passed by the High Court. \n31) It is to be noted here that on 09.05.2014, the Apex Court stayed the proceedings before the Arbitrator and thereafter on 11.08.2014 the said SLPS were dismissed with observations referred to earlier. On receipt of the order passed by the Apex Court, the Arbitrator issued notices to the parties on 22.09.2014. On 11.10.2014, time was sought by the respondents herein and then on 01.11.2014 an application came to be filed to amend the grounds in Section 12 application. On 15.11.2014, the application filed under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act was dismissed and the matter was adjourned to 22.11.2014 for filing of written statement of the respondents herein. Against the said orders, Arbitration O.P.No.2889 of 2014 came to be filed and the said Court stayed the proceedings before the arbitrator on 25.03.2015. \n32) From the facts narrated above, it is clear that from 13.09.2013 there was no stay till 09.05.2014 and again from 11.08.2014 till 23.05.2015. At the same time, it is also to be noted that though the period of five months elapsed, no objection was raised by the respondents for termination of the mandate of the arbitrator on the ground of undue delay. On the other hand, in the SLPS filed before the Apex Court, it was specifically pleaded that the time limit of five months prescribed by the High Court in the review application will not be sufficient to complete the arbitration proceedings, as it involves intricate questions in fact and law. It would be useful to refer to the said paragraph, which is as under:\nFor that the Honble High Court has wrongly directed the learned Arbitrator to conclude the arbitration proceedings between the parties within five months from the date of communication. It is most respectfully submitted, that the Honble High Court has further failed to appreciate that the dispute between the parties involves huge stakes and therefore needs fair and proper adjudication to provide justice to the parties. It would be unjust for the parties, if the Arbitrator without application of mind would just rush to comply with the directions of the Honble High Court. It is submitted that looking into the complex issues of fact and law are involved in the matter, therefore oral evidence and cross- examination are required in the matter. The fixing of time limit in the matter has seriously prejudiced the case of the petitioners and the petitioners do not apprehend justice. Further, it is very inconvenient for the petitioners to move from Delhi to Hyderabad nearly every week and take appropriate remedies under pressure and paucity of time. \n33) It is also to be observed here that this plea was not raised in the application filed under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act and also in the amendment sought to Section 12 application. \n34) The narration of events, which are undisputed till now, go to show that though the period of five months elapsed, but the party, who is raising the objection now, participated in the said proceedings without raising their finger on this aspect. The proceedings referred to till now, more particularly the order in Arbitration Application No.54 of 2012 and Review Application No.494 of 2013, makes it very clear that both the parties have consented for appointment of Sri Ravinder Singh Sarma, as an arbitrator and the parties also did not dispute the contents of arbitration agreement, or in words their plea with regard to appointment of an arbitrator has become final long back. \n35) Coming to the aspect of undue delay in completing the proceedings, as observed by us earlier, the objecting party participated in the said proceedings even after expiry of five months, as fixed by this Court in the month of September, 2013 and also took a contra plea to the effect that the period of five months fixed by the High Court may not be sufficient to complete the proceedings, thereby giving an implied consent, for continuation of the proceedings after expiry of five months, more so, when such a plea was never raised even in an application filed under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act and also in the amendment sought to the said application. For the first time such an objection came to be raised in Arbitration O.P.No.2889 of 2014. \n36) It is also an admitted fact that though the respondents herein entered their appearance before the arbitrator on 26.10.2013, written statement came to be filed before him only on 16.05.2015. Therefore, it is clear that no written statement came to be filed even after dismissal of the S.L.P. by the Supreme Court on 11.08.2014. \n37) Thereafter, C.R.P.No.1861 of 2015 came to be filed challenging the order in Arbitration O.P.No.2889 of 2014, wherein this Court granted stay on 04.05.2015 which was in force till it was dismissed on 16.03.2016. Immediately thereafter the present O.P. 752 of 2016 (renumbered as C.O.P.No.81 of 2017) came to be filed on the ground of undue delay, wherein the proceedings before the arbitrator were stayed from 13.04.2016 till it was allowed on 29.12.2017. \n38) From the above, it is clear that except for few pockets of period during the last five years, proceedings were pending either before the Courts or stay of the arbitration proceedings was in operation. It is also to be observed here that though counsel for the respondents herein tried to contend that in spite of there being no stay from 13.09.2013 till 09.05.2014 and again from 11.08.2014 till 25.03.2015 and from 04.05.2015 till 16.03.2016, the Arbitrator failed to complete the proceedings within the time fixed, but as observed by us earlier, written statement came to be filed only on 16.05.2015, after their right to file written statement, which was forfeited was subsequently set aside.\n39) As observed by us, the arbitrator has been cautioning the parties to complete the proceedings before the expiry of the period. The Delhi parties, who are the respondents herein, were directed to cooperate with the arbitral tribunal in completing the proceedings within the time, but the matter was getting postponed on one pretext or the other and it cannot be said that the arbitrator was at fault. \n40) Section 14 of the Arbitration Act deals with failure or impossibility to act. The said section prescribe that the mandate of an arbitrator shall get terminated and he shall be substituted by another arbitrator, if he becomes de jure or de facto unable to perform his functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay and that he withdraws from his office or the parties agree to the termination of his mandate. \n41) Section 14 of the Arbitration Act would attract only when there is undue delay. Sub Section (1) (2) and 3 of Section 14 of the Arbitration Act, envisage a situation where the arbitrator may, on his own, recuse himself on objection being taken about his functioning as an arbitrator, or where both the parties agree to his mandate being terminated. Section 14 (1) prescribe an automatic termination of the mandate of the arbitrator. In the prescribed eventualities, there is a statutory termination of the arbitrators mandate. In State of Arunachal Pradesh v. Subhash Projects and Marketing Limited a Division Bench of Calcutta High Court held that if the facts constituting the eventualities in Section 14 (1) are neither in dispute nor demand any proof to be established, termination of the mandate of the arbitrator takes place on statutory prescription. The Court held that where there is a controversy regarding the grounds, which entails the termination of the mandate, the party has to invariably approach the Court to decide on the termination of the mandate. \n42) Dealing with the concept of undue delay and the meaning of word de jure and defacto and Section 14 (1) (a), a Division Bench of this Court in C.R.P.No.1861 of 2015, after referring to the authorities on subject and to the dictionary meaning of word dejure and defacto and relying upon the judgments in Priknit Retails Limited (supra) and Shyam Telecom Limited v. ARM Limited, observed that the incapacities referred in Section 14 (1) (a) of the Arbitration Act, are such as to have a direct nexus with the inability of the arbitrator to perform his functions. This incapacity or disability should occur to the arbitrator himself so that he becomes, as a matter of law or fact, unable to perform his function. The dejure impossibility referred to in Section 14 (1) (a) is the impossibility which occurs due to factors personal to the arbitrator, and de facto inability occurs due to factors beyond the control of the arbitrator. It has been observed that mere legal disability is not a condition precedent for invocation of Section 14 of the Act. The dejure inability must relate to his ability to function. \n43) Insofar as usage of word delay in Section 14 (1) of the Act, which relates to termination of the mandate of arbitrator, if it is for other reasons fails to act without undue delay. The Division Bench observed that the word delay is qualified by the word undue. Undue delay, and not mere delay, would alone justify the Court to declare the mandate of the arbitrator as terminated. The Division Bench held that the word undue means unjustified, unwarranted, unreasonable, excessive and inordinate. In order to declare that the mandate of the arbitrator stands terminated, the Court must be satisfied that the delay on the part of the arbitrator, was unjustified, inordinate or unwarranted. It has also held that for the Court, exercising jurisdiction under Section 14 (2) of the Act, to declare that the mandate of the arbitrator stands terminated, the petitioner was not only required to plead but also to prove that the arbitrator had failed to act without undue delay. The word fail means neglect, go wrong or fall short of what is expected. What is required to plead and prove is that the arbitrator had neglected to act without excessive or inordinate delay. The Division Bench further held that even if there is a delay on the part of the arbitrator in completing the proceedings, and to pass an award, it was open to the parties to waive their right to object. \n44) Section 4 of the Act deal with waiver of right to object, ie., a party who knows that any provision of this part from which the parties may derogate, or any requirement under the arbitration agreement, has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating his objection to such non-compliance without undue delay or, if the time limit is provided for stating that objection, within that period of time, shall be deemed to have waived his right to so object. (C.R.P.No.1861 of 2015). \n45) In Mascon Multiservices and Consultants Private Limited vs. Bharat Oman Refineries Limited the Bombay High Court held that the parties, that raise questions as to jurisdiction, must be held to have given a go bye to the stipulation as to time within which an award is to be made; if a party attends a number of meetings, after the time for making the award has expired, it would be a strong indication of waiver. The strength of an indication of waiver is not necessarily directly proportional to the number of meetings attended by a party after the stipulated time for making the award. It is the nature of the meeting and the nature of the conduct of a party which is as, if not more, important. \n46) In Hindustan Wires Limited v. R.Suresh (6 supra) a learned Single Judge of Bombay High Court held that, in view of the consent of both the parties for enlargement of time to complete the arbitration proceedings and to make an award, the mandate of the arbitrator does not come to an end; the arbitrator does not cease to have jurisdiction to proceed with the matter and to make an award; and even by the conduct of both parties, the time to complete arbitration proceeding and to make an award, stand extended.\n47) In Jayesh H.Pandya v. Subhtex India Limited (7 supra) the Bombay High Court held as under:\nwhere a party intends to assert a right of adherence to the time prescribed by the arbitration agreement, it must, at the earliest opportunity, make its intention know to ensure compliance with the rigid standard as to time; to hold otherwise would be to encourage a lack of candour on the part of the parties in their dealings before the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator was justified in coming to the conclusion that the petitioners had, by their conduct, waived their objection to enforce a punctilious observance of the time schedule of four months. It is held that to adopt any other construction would frustrate the object and the purpose of arbitral proceedings and being the whole machinery provided by the Act, to facilitate an efficacious recourse to arbitration, into grave peril. \n48) In Bhupinder Singh Bindra v. Union of India and another (8 supra) the Apex Court held that the Court interpose and interdict the appointment of an arbitrator, when the parties have chosen under the terms of the contract unless legal misconduct of the arbitrator, fraud, disqualification etc. is pleaded and proved. The Court held that there must be just and sufficient cause for revocation. \nIn the said case, though there was no allegation of misconduct, fraud or disqualification but due to non- cooperation of one of the parties the delay occurred in making the award. Under those circumstances, it has been held that the Court has no jurisdiction to revoke the appointment of an arbitrator on the ground of latches and appoint another person as arbitrator without consent of both the parties to the contract. \n49) In Snehadeep Auto centre v. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (10 supra) a Division Bench of Bombay High Court held that in N.B.C.C.Limited (12 supra) the Apex Court did not lay down an absolute proposition that the moment the award is made, after the stipulated period, it must be set aside; the observation of the Supreme Court, that the Arbitrator was bound to make and publish his award within the time mutually agreed upon by the parties unless the parties consented to further enlargement of time, did not rule out a contingency where the conduct of the parties could be implied with certainty to mean that they had consented not to insist on the mandatory time limit. The court also held that no unambiguous stand can be taken that the Arbitrator cannot proceed to declare the award, as his mandate had come to an end; and this conduct amounted to waiver of the objection of time limit, being a mandatory requirement for pronouncement of the award. In NBCC Limited (12 supra) the Apex Court recognized the importance of imposition of a time limit for conclusion of arbitration proceedings. It was a case where the arbitrator could not conclude the proceeding as agreed upon by the parties. The Court held that the Arbitrator has extended the time provided to it without any concrete reasons whatsoever and thus his mandate was liable to be terminated. The Apex Court held that even assuming that the arbitration process involves highly technical and complex issues, which are time consuming, it was open for the arbitrator or for the parties to approach the Court for extension of time to conclude the arbitration proceedings, which was not done either by the Arbitrator or by any of the parties. There was no cogent reason for the delay in making and publishing the award by the Arbitrator, as he already had relevant material at his disposal and could base his finding, on the observation made by the three arbitrators, who were appointed prior to him. \n50) Ramchandra Rungta v. Ram Swarup Rungta and Jayesh H.Pandya (7 supra), the arbitration proceedings continued and the parties were regularly appearing before the respective Arbitrators, by seeking extension of time to file their pleadings, for adjournment etc. In both the cases it was held that a clear intention had been evinced by the parties, waiving their right to insist on the time limit contained in the respective arbitration agreements for making and publishing the award. Hence, the Bombay and Delhi High Courts, in the facts of those cases, held that there was waiver of the stipulation in the arbitration agreement for publication of the award, within the specific period of time, by the parties. \n51) The learned counsel for the respondents relied upon the judgment of in Hindustan Wires Limited v. R.Suresh (6 supra) and also N.B.C.C. Limited (12 supra), to contend that as the time period for conclusion of proceedings had expired and in the absence of any application seeking extension of time, the arbitrator ceases to have jurisdiction. According to him, since the time limit is fixed by the Court, the period of participation cannot be waived on mere participation even after the expiry of the period. \n52) The judgment of the Apex Court in NBCC Limited (12 supra) which is relied to show that the time limit fixed can only be extended after obtaining necessary orders from the Court which has imposed the time, was a case where the parties initially agreed to extend the time till 31.10.1994 for making and publishing the award and the same was further extended till 30.09.2005, but the arbitrator failed to pass an award by 30.09.2005. \n53) Situation here is some what different. Here the proceedings have commenced and no reply to the claim- petition was filed till 16.05.2015 and the stay was in operation during the period from 25.03.2015 to 30.04.2015 and again from 04.05.2015 till 16.03.2016 and most importantly the respondents herein, who are raising the objection of time limit now, participated in the proceedings even after the expiry of time limit and also took the plea before the Apex Court that the time limit as fixed by the High Court is not sufficient to complete the proceedings. Further, written statement came to be filed on 16.05.2015 after their right to file which was earlier forfeited and then restored. Such being the position, the plea now taken by the very same party to terminate the mandate of the Arbitrator on the ground of delay, cannot be accepted and the judgment of the Apex Court in NBCC Limited (12 supra), in our view may not apply to the case on hand. \n54) From this, it is clear that the respondents herein were not co-operating with the arbitrator in filing the written statement to the claim-petition and only after they were unsuccessful before the Apex Court, a written statement came to be filed and thereafter again initiated proceedings before the Civil Court and then in High Court, where there was a stay till 16.03.2016.\n55) Further, the time limit for completing the arbitration proceedings was not fixed at the time when the arbitrator was appointed by the Court at the earliest point of time. The time limit came to be fixed, in a review application filed by the respondents herein questioning the appointment of an Arbitrator. \n56) Therefore, the Arbitrator cannot be found fault with for the delay in arbitration proceedings more so when the record clearly shows that the respondents waived their right in not raising any objection with regard to continuation of the proceedings or seeking termination of the mandate of the Arbitrator on the ground that the time prescribed for making the award expired. In fact the docket entries before the Arbitrator dated 07.02.2014 and 16.02.2014 show that he was pleading the parties more particularly the Delhi parties (respondents herein) to cooperate with the arbitration so as to complete the proceedings within the specified time to the maximum possible extent. Hence, the ground on which the mandate of the arbitrator came to be terminated, in our view, cannot be accepted. \n57) One other ground which is sought to be raised by the learned counsel for the respondents is as to whether the arbitration and conciliation amendment Act, 2015 will apply to the case on hand. \n58) The learned counsel took us through Section 26 of the amended Act, 2015 to show that only the Act as it stands after 2015 shall apply to the present case. Learned counsel for the respondents placed reliance on the judgment of BCCI vs. Kochi Cricket Pvt. Ltd. (14 supra) and also the judgment of Calcutta High Court in Tufan Chatterjee v. Rangan Dhar and the judgment of Delhi High Court in Raffles Design International India Private Limited and others v. Educomp Professional Education Limited and others in support of his plea.\n59) Before dealing with the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, it would be appropriate to refer to Section 26 of the Amended Act, which is as under:\n26. Act not to apply to pending arbitral proceedings: Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced, in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the Principal Act, before the commencement of this Act unless the parties otherwise agree but this Act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of this Act. \n60) Section 26 of the Amendment Act postulates that nothing contained in the said amendment Act is to apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the Principal Act, unless the parties otherwise agree. But the Amendment Act would apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced, on or after the date of commencement of the amended Act. \n61) According to him, the above provision has to be read in two parts. The first part being, nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the Principal Act, before the commencement of the amendment Act, unless the parties otherwise agree and the second part which is in continuation of the first part is to be read as that this Act would apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of 2015 Act. According to him, the word to appearing in the first part of the provision is not there in second part, which reads instead as in relation to, which thereby signifies that both the parts have a corresponding different interpretation to the above provision. According to him, the first part refers to arbitral proceedings before the Tribunal and the second part in relation to arbitral proceedings. In view of the judgment of the Apex Court in BCCI (14 supra), it is urged that the amendment Act, 2015 will not apply to the arbitral proceedings that have commenced before the date of coming into effect of the amendment Act and it will apply to the Court proceedings which have commenced on or after the amendment Act came into force. \n62) In other words, his plea is that the amendment Act which came into force with effect from 23.10.2015, would apply to the arbitral proceedings which commenced after 23.10.2015 but not to arbitral proceedings which commenced before 23.10.2015. Having regard to the above, it is urged that in view of Section 12 (5) read with 7 Schedule of the amended Act, the Arbitrator is de jure disqualified. \n63) A plain reading of Section 26 of the Amendment Act, would indicate that nothing contained in the amended Act shall apply to arbitral proceedings commenced, in accordance with provisions of Section 21 of the Principal Act, before commencement of this Act, unless parties otherwise agree, but this Act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings on or after the date of commencement of the amended act. \n64) Though the learned counsel for the respondents relied upon the judgments of Calcutta High Court and Delhi High Court namely Tufan Chatterjee (18 supra) and Raffles Design International India Private Limited and others (19 supra), but in view of the judgment of the Apex Court in BCCI v. Kochi Cricket Private Limited (14 supra), it may not be necessary to refer to the said judgments. \n65) The judgment of the Apex Court in BCCI v. Kochi (14 supra) was a case where a notice dated 18.01.2012 was sent by Kochi Cricket Pvt. Limited, invoking the arbitration under a franchise agreement dated 12.03.2011. A sole arbitrator was appointed, who delivered two arbitral awards dated 22.06.2015 against the appellant and in favour of the respondents. On 16.09.2015, the appellants filed an application under Section 34 of Arbitration Act, 1996 in the Bombay High Court challenging the aforesaid arbitral awards. On 26.11.2015, the respondents filed two execution applications in the High Court, for payment of the amounts awarded under the two awards, pending enforcement of such awards. These were resisted by two Chamber summons filed by the appellants dated 3.12.2015, seeking dismissal of the aforesaid execution applications on the ground that the old Section 36 would be applicable and that, therefore there would be an automatic stay of the awards until Section 34 proceedings are decided. Having regard to the above, the question before the Court was as to the construction of Section 26 of the Amendment Act, 2015. In other words, the Apex Court was dealing with the effect of an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration 1996 Act after the amendment Act came into force. Further, the question with which the Bench was confronted was whether Section 36, which was substituted by the Amendment Act, would apply in its amended form or in its original form to the appeals in question. After referring to the authorities on the subject and interpreting the provisions under Old and New Act, the Apex Court dismissed the appeals. \n66) Dealing with the provisions of the Old Act and the Amendment Act, 2015, the Honble Court in Para Nos.24 and 25 came to the following conclusions, which are as under:\n24. What will be noticed, so far as the first part is concerned, which states, Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced, in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the Principal Act, before the commencement of this Act unless the parties otherwise agree.. is that: (1) the arbitral proceedings and their commencement is mentioned in the context of Section 21 of the Principal Act; (2) the expression used is to and not in relation to; and (3) parties may otherwise agree. So far as the second part of Section 26 is concerned, namely, the part which reads but this Act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of this Act makes it clear that the expression in relation to is used; and the expression the arbitral proceedings and in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the Principal Act is conspicuous by its absence. \n25. That the expression the arbitral proceedings refers to proceedings before an arbitral tribunal is clear from the heading of Chapter V of the 1996 Act, which reads as follows:\nConduct of Arbitral Proceedings The entire chapter consists of Sections 18 to 27 dealing with the conduct of arbitral proceedings before an arbitral tribunal. What is also important to notice is that these proceedings alone are referred to, the expression to as contrasted with the expression in relation to making this clear. Also, the reference to Section 21 of the 1996 Act, which appears in Chapter V, and which speaks of the arbitral proceedings commencing on the date on which a request for a dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent, would also make it clear that it is these proceedings, and no others, that form the subject matter of the first part of Section 26. Also, since the conduct of arbitral proceedings is largely procedural in nature, parties may otherwise agree and apply the Amendment Act to arbitral proceedings that have commenced before the Amendment Act came into force. In stark contrast to the first part of Section 26 is the second part, where the Amendment Act is made applicable in relation to arbitral proceedings which commenced on or after the date of commencement of the Amendment Act. What is conspicuous by its absence in the second part is any reference to Section 21 of the 1996 Act. Whereas the first part refers only to arbitral proceedings before an arbitral tribunal, the second part refers to Court proceedings in relation to arbitral proceedings, and it is the commencement of these Court proceedings that is referred to in the second part of Section 26, as the words in relation to the arbitral proceedings in the second part are not controlled by the application of Section 21 of the 1996 Act. \nSection 26, therefore, bifurcates proceedings, as has been stated above, with a great degree of clarity, into two sets of proceedings arbitral proceedings themselves, and Court proceedings in relation thereto. The reason why the first part of Section 26 is couched in negative form is only to state that the amendment Act will apply even to arbitral proceedings commenced before the amendment if parties otherwise agree. If the first part of Section 26 were couched in positive language (like the second part), it would have been necessary to add a proviso stating that the Amendment Act would apply even to arbitral proceedings commenced before the amendment if the parties agree. In either case, the intention of the legislature remains the same, the negative form conveying exactly what could have been stated positively, with the necessary proviso. Obviously, arbitral proceedings having been subsumed in the first part cannot reappear in the second part, and the expression in relation to arbitral proceedings would, therefore, apply only to Court proceedings which relate to the arbitral proceedings. The scheme of Section 26 is thus clear: that the Amendment Act is prospective in nature, and will apply to those arbitral proceedings that are commenced, as understood by Section 21 of the Principal Act, on or after the Amendment Act, and to Court proceedings which have commenced on or after the Amendment Act came into force. \n67) From the judgment of the Apex Court, it is clear that the first part deals with reference to arbitral proceedings before the Arbitrary Tribunal and the Amendment Act would apply even to Arbitral proceedings commenced before the amendment, if the parties otherwise agree. In the instant case, we do not find any such consent being given by any of the parties warranting applicability of the amended Act, since the arbitration proceedings came to be initiated prior to the amendment. Further Section 29-A of the Amendment Act, prescribes time limit for completion of arbitral proceedings. Therefore the parties may opt to deal under the New Act even in cases which are pending before the Arbitrator as on the date of commencement of the Amendment Act. On such option being exercised, the parties are bound under the provisions of New Act. \n68) As observed by us earlier, in the instant case, we do not find any such consent being given by the parties seeking applicability of the Amendment Act, 2015. Therefore, the argument of the learned counsel for the respondents that the arbitrator is de jure disqualified in view of Section 12 (5) of the Act cannot be accepted. \n69) For the aforesaid reasons, the Civil Revision Petition is allowed holding that the order under challenge terminating the mandate of the arbitrator is illegal and incorrect, and accordingly, the same is set aside. \n70) There shall be no order as to costs.

claims amount in rs. interest in rs. a 16,13,23,938 18,39,12,704 b 12,57,47,964 14,33,52,644 c 24,08,90,000 15,65,78,500 d 24,08,90,000 15,65,78,500 e 10,00,00,000 6,00,00,000 f nil nil g nil nil h nil nil i 10,00,00,000 nil total 1,66,47,31,962 future interest @12% p.a. from 01.11.2018 till payment within 90 days and @ 14% p.a. thereafter. costs 5,00,00,000 5. aggrieved by the impugned award passed by the arbitral tribunal insofar as it related to rejecting the claim of the appellant in full in respect of claims f, g, and h and allowing the same only in part in respect of claims d, e and i, the appellant herein filed the aforesaid suit against the respondent herein under section 34 of the said act of 1996. 6. so also, the respondent also filed an arbitration suit in a.s.no.57/2019. the said suit was dismissed by the commercial court vide judgment and order dated 25.10.2021. learned additional government advocate appearing for the respondent submitted that the respondent has not challenged the aforesaid judgment and order dated 25.10.2021 passed in a.s.no.57/2019 and consequently, the same has attained finality and as such, the arbitral award has attained finality insofar as the respondent is concerned. 7. the suit in commercial a.s.no.62/2019 was contested by the respondent herein. by the impugned judgment and order, the commercial court dismissed the said suit filed by the appellant herein thereby confirming the arbitral award. aggrieved by the impugned arbitral award as well as the impugned judgment and order of the commercial court passed in commercial a.s.no.62/2019, the appellant is before this court by way of the present appeal. 8. in addition to reiterating the various contentions urged in the appeal and referring to the material on record, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the commercial court failed to appreciate that the appellant was entitled to the entire amounts put forth in claims d, e, f, g, h and i by him; that the reasoning and findings recorded by the arbitral tribunal and confirmed by the commercial court which allowed the said claims only partly and rejected the remaining portions / part of the said claims were patently illegal and erroneous and without properly considering or appreciating the material on record. it was also contended that the arbitral award contained several patent illegalities and that the same was in contravention of the fundamental policy of the indian law apart from being opposed to principles of morality and justice and contrary to public policy. it is therefore contended that the impugned arbitral award as well as the impugned judgment and order of the commercial court deserve to be set aside. 9. per contra, learned additional government advocate for the respondent submits that there is no merit in the appeal and having regard to the limited and restricted scope of interference under sections 34 and 37 of the said act of 1996, there is no merit in the appeal and the same is liable to be dismissed. 10. a perusal of the arbitral award will indicate that the arbitral tribunal has partly allowed the claim of the appellant in respect of claims d, e, and i and has rejected claims f, g and h. in this context, the details of the said claims are as under: i. claim 'd' this claim relates to the loss of profit said to have been suffered by the appellant on account of the respondent illegally restraining the mspcs from procuring raw materials from the claimant, which has been quantified at 10% amounting to rs.168,67,00,000/-; as against this amount claimed by the appellant, the arbitral tribunal awarded rs. 39,74,68,000/-. ii. claim 'e' this claim relates to the compensation sought for by the appellant for the loss caused to the appellant on account of illegal termination of the agreements by the respondent, which has been quantified as rs.64,36,93,378/-; as against this amount claimed by the appellant, the arbitral tribunal awarded rs.16,00,00,000/-. iii. claim 'i' this claim relates to the compensation sought for by the appellant on account of loss of reputation and mental agony and harassment due to illegal termination by the respondent, which has been quantified as rs.50,00,00,000/-; as against this amount claimed by the appellant, arbitral tribunal awarded rs.10,00,00,000/-. iv. claim 'f' this claim relates to the claim for compensation put forth by the appellant towards alleged loss sustained by it due to illegal termination of its contracts by the appellant resulting in failure on the part of the appellant to obtain the tenders and earn profit which has been quantified as rs.10,30,00,000/-; this claim was rejected by the arbitral tribunal. v. claim 'g' this claim relates to the claim for compensation put forth by the appellant towards alleged loss sustained by it due to illegal termination of its contracts by the appellant resulting in failure on the part of the appellant to obtain the tenders and earn profit which has been quantified as rs.31,40,00,000/-; this claim was rejected by the arbitral tribunal. vi. claim 'h' this claim relates to the claim for compensation put forth by the appellant towards alleged loss sustained by it due to illegal termination of its contracts by the appellant resulting in failure on the part of the appellant to obtain the tenders and earn profit which has been quantified as rs.1335 crores; this claim was rejected by the arbitral tribunal. 11. the question with regard to the limited scope of interference under section 34 of the said act of 1996 is no longer res integra; the apex court as well as this court has repeatedly held that the court dealing with section 34 application / petition does not act like an appellate court and cannot be re-appreciate / re-evaluate evidence on the merits of the matter and arrive at a different conclusion than that of the arbitral tribunal in view of the scheme of the said act of 1996. 12. in the case of south east asia marine engineering constructions limited vs. oil india limited reported in (2020) 5 scc 164, a three judge bench of the apex court held as under: 12. it is a settled position that a court can set aside the award only on the grounds as provided in the arbitration act as interpreted by the courts. recently, this court in dyna technologies (p) ltd. v. crompton greaves ltd. [dyna technologies (p) ltd. v. crompton greaves ltd., (2019) 20 scc 1 : 2019 scc online sc 1656] laid down the scope of such interference. this court observed as follows : (scc pp. 11-12, para 24) \"24. there is no dispute that section 34 of the arbitration act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various courts. we need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. section 34 is different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. the mandate under section 34 is to respect the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. if the courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated.\" 13. it is also settled law that where two views are possible, the court cannot interfere in the plausible view taken by the arbitrator supported by reasoning. this court in dyna technologies [dyna technologies (p) ltd. v. crompton greaves ltd., (2019) 20 scc 1 : 2019 scc online sc 1656] observed as under : (scc p. 12, para 25) \"25. moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this court have categorically held that the courts should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. the courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the arbitral tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under section 34 of the arbitration act.\" 14. however, the question in the present case is whether the interpretation provided to the contract in the award of the tribunal was reasonable and fair, so that the 10 same passes the muster under section 34 of the arbitration act? 15. in the present case, the respondent has argued that the view taken by the arbitral tribunal was not even a possible interpretation, therefore the award being unreasonable and unfair suffers from perversity. hence, the respondent has pleaded that the award ought to be set aside. in this context, we may state that usually the court is not required to examine the merits of the interpretation provided in the award by the arbitrator, if it comes to a conclusion that such an interpretation was reasonably possible. 13. in the case of project director vs. m. hakeem and another reported in (2021) 9 scc 1, it was held as under: 22. thus, under the scheme of the old act, an award may be remitted, modified or otherwise set aside given the grounds contained in section 30 of the 1940 act, which are broader than the grounds contained in section 34 of the 1996 act. 23. it is settled law that a section 34 proceeding does not contain any challenge on the merits of the award. this has been decided in mmtc ltd. v. vedanta ltd. [mmtc ltd. v. vedanta ltd., (2019) 4 scc 163 : (2019) 2 scc (civ) 293] , as follows : (scc p. 167, para 14) \"14. as far as interference with an order made under section 34, as per section 37, is concerned, it cannot be disputed that such 11 interference under section 37 cannot travel beyond the restrictions laid down under section 34. in other words, the court cannot undertake an independent assessment of the merits of the award, and must only ascertain that the exercise of power by the court under section 34 has not exceeded the scope of the provision. thus, it is evident that in case an arbitral award has been confirmed by the court under section 34 and by the court in an appeal under section 37, this court must be extremely cautious and slow to disturb such concurrent findings.\" 24. likewise, in ssangyong engg. & construction co. ltd. v. nhai [ssangyong engg. & construction co. ltd. v. nhai, (2019) 15 scc 131 : (2020) 2 scc (civ) 213] , this court under the caption \"section 34(2)(a) does not entail a challenge to an arbitral award on merits\" referred to this court's judgment in renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co. [renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co., 1994 supp (1) scc 644] , the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, 1958 (\"the new york convention\") and various other authorities to conclude that there could be no challenge on merits under the grounds mentioned in section 34 -(see paras 34 to 48). this court also held, in maharashtra state electricity distribution co. ltd. v. datar switchgear ltd. [maharashtra state electricity distribution co. ltd. v. datar switchgear ltd., (2018) 3 scc 133 : (2018) 2 scc (civ) 65] (at p. 170), that the court hearing a section 34 petition does not sit in appeal (see para 51). 12 25. as a matter of fact, the point raised in the appeals stands concluded in mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd. [mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181] , where this court held : (scc p. 208, paras 51-52) \"51. after the 1996 act came into force, under section 16 of the act the party questioning the jurisdiction of the arbitrator has an obligation to raise the said question before the arbitrator. such a question of jurisdiction could be raised if it is beyond the scope of his authority. it was required to be raised during arbitration proceedings or soon after initiation thereof. the jurisdictional question is required to be determined as a preliminary ground. a decision taken thereupon by the arbitrator would be the subject-matter of challenge under section 34 of the act. in the event the arbitrator opined that he had no jurisdiction in relation thereto an appeal thereagainst was provided for under section 37 of the act. 52. the 1996 act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness. intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. the court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. it can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. so, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum 13 level and this can be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it.\" 26. this statement of the law was followed in kinnari mullick v. ghanshyam das damani [kinnari mullick v. ghanshyam das damani, (2018) 11 scc 328 : (2018) 5 scc (civ) 106] at p. 334 (see para 15). 27. also, in dyna technologies (p) ltd. v. crompton greaves ltd. [dyna technologies (p) ltd. v. crompton greaves ltd., (2019) 20 scc 1] , this court held : (scc p. 15, paras 36-37) \"36. at this juncture it must be noted that the legislative intention of providing section 34(4) in the arbitration act was to make the award enforceable, after giving an opportunity to the tribunal to undo the curable defects. this provision cannot be brushed aside and the high court [crompton greaves ltd. v. dyna technologies (p) ltd., 2007 scc online mad 427] could not have proceeded further to determine the issue on merits. 37. in case of absence of reasoning the utility has been provided under section 34(4) of the arbitration act to cure such defects. when there is complete perversity in the reasoning then only it can be challenged under the provisions of section 34 of the arbitration act. the power vested under section 34(4) of the arbitration act to cure defects can be utilised in cases where the 14 arbitral award does not provide any reasoning or if the award has some gap in the reasoning or otherwise and that can be cured so as to avoid a challenge based on the aforesaid curable defects under section 34 of the arbitration act. however, in this case such remand to the tribunal would not be beneficial as this case has taken more than 25 years for its adjudication. it is in this state of affairs that we lament that the purpose of arbitration as an effective and expeditious forum itself stands effaced.\" 28. some of the judgments of the high courts are also instructive. a learned single judge of the delhi high court in cybernetics network (p) ltd. v. bisquare technologies (p) ltd. [cybernetics network (p) ltd. v. bisquare technologies (p) ltd., 2012 scc online del 1155] , held : (scc online del paras 47-51) \"47. the next question that arises is whether the above claims as mentioned in para 44 that have been erroneously rejected by the learned arbitrator can be allowed by this court in exercise of its powers under section 34(4) of the act? 48. under section 34(4) of the act, the court while deciding a challenge to an arbitral award, can either 'adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of the arbitral tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award'. this necessarily envisages the 15 court having to remit the matter to the arbitral tribunal. this is subject to the court finding it appropriate to do so and a party requesting it to do so. 49. in union of india v. arctic india [union of india v. arctic india, 2007 scc online bom 409 : (2007) 4 arb lr 524] , a learned single judge of the bombay high court opined that the court can modify the award even if there is no express provision in the act permitting it. the court followed the decision of the supreme court in krishna bhagya jala nigam ltd. v. harischandra reddy [krishna bhagya jala nigam ltd. v. harischandra reddy, (2007) 2 scc 720] . a similar view has been taken by a learned single judge of this court in union of india v. modern laminators ltd. [union of india v. modern laminators ltd., 2008 scc online del 956 : (2008) 3 arb lr 489] there the question was whether in light of the arbitrator having failed to decide the counterclaim of the respondent in that case the court could itself decide the counterclaim. after discussing the case law, the court concluded that it could modify the award but only to a limited extent. it held (arb lr p. 496) : (modern laminators ltd. case [union of india v. modern laminators ltd., 2008 scc online del 956 : (2008) 3 arb lr 489] , scc online del para 22) '22. . such modification of award will be a species of \"setting aside\" only and would be \"setting aside to a limited extent\". however, if the 16 courts were to find that they cannot within the confines of interference permissible or on the material before the arbitrator are unable to modify and if the same would include further fact finding or adjudication of intricate questions of law, the parties ought to be left to the forum of their choice i.e. to be relegated under section 34(4) of the act to further arbitration or other civil remedies.' 50. however, none of the above decisions categorically hold that where certain claims have been erroneously rejected by the arbitrator, the court can in exercise of its powers under section 34(4) of the act itself decide those claims. the allahabad high court has in u.p. state handloom corpn. ltd. v. asha lata talwar [u.p. state handloom corpn. ltd. v. asha lata talwar, 2009 scc online all 624 : (2009) 4 all lj 397] , held that while exercising the powers to set aside an award under section 34 of the act the court does not have the jurisdiction to grant the original relief which was prayed for before the arbitrator. the allahabad high court referred to the decision of the supreme court in mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd. [mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181] , where it was observed (scc p. 208): *** 51. the view of the allahabad high court in u.p. state handloom corpn. ltd. v. asha lata talwar [u.p. state handloom corpn. ltd. v. asha 17 lata talwar, 2009 scc online all 624 : (2009) 4 all lj 397] appears to be consistent with the scheme of the act, and in particular section 34 thereof which is a departure from the scheme of section 16 of the 1940 act which perhaps gave the court a wider amplitude of powers. under section 34(2) of the act, the court is empowered to set aside an arbitral award on the grounds specified therein. the remand to the arbitrator under section 34(4) is to a limited extent of requiring the arbitral tribunal 'to eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award'. there is no specific power granted to the court to itself allow the claims originally made before the arbitral tribunal where it finds the arbitral tribunal erred in rejecting such claims. if such a power is recognised as falling within the ambit of section 34(4) of the act, then the court will be acting no different from an appellate court which would be contrary to the legislative intent behind section 34 of the act. accordingly, this court declines to itself decide the claims of cnpl that have been wrongly rejected by the learned arbitrator.\" 29. the delhi high court in nussli switzerland ltd. v. organizing committee, commonwealth games, 2010 [nussli switzerland ltd. v. organizing committee, commonwealth games, 2010, 2014 scc online del 4834] , held : (scc online del para 34) \"34. a party like the organising committee which has its claims rejected, except a part, but which subsumes into the larger amount awarded 18 in favour of the opposite party, even if succeeds in the objections to the award would at best have the award set aside for the reason the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 as distinct from the power of the court under the arbitration act, 1940, does not empower the court to modify an award. if a claim which has been rejected by an arbitral tribunal is found to be faulty, the court seized of the objections under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 has to set aside the award and leave the matter at that. it would be open to the party concerned to commence fresh proceedings (including arbitration) and for this view one may for purposes of convenience refer to sub-section (4) of section 43 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. it reads: '43. limitations.--(1)(3) * * * (4) where the court orders that an arbitral award be set aside, the period between the commencement of the arbitration and the date of the order of the court shall be excluded in computing the time prescribed by the limitation act, 1963 (36 of 1963), for the commencement of the proceedings (including arbitration) with respect to the dispute so submitted.' \" 30. an instructive judgment of the delhi high court in puri construction (p) ltd. v. larsen & toubro ltd. [puri construction (p) ltd. v. larsen & toubro ltd., 2015 scc online del 9126] deals with the authorities of the madras 19 and calcutta high courts on the one hand and the other high courts dealing with this problem as follows : (scc online del paras 115-16 & 118) \"115. in these circumstances, this court holds that the reliefs granted by the tribunal cannot be sustained and are hereby set aside. the question that follows is whether this court, exercising jurisdiction under section 37 read with section 34 of the act, can modify, vary or remit the award. at the outset, it is noticed that there are divergent views on this issue. here, the court notices a somewhat divergent approach of various high courts. the case law is discussed in the following part of the judgment. authorities in favour of the power to modify, vary or remit the award 116. a learned single judge of this court in bhasin associates v. n.b.c.c. [bhasin associates v. n.b.c.c., 2005 scc online del 689 : ilr (2005) 2 del 88] held that 'the power to set aside an award when exercised by the court would leave a vacuum if the said power was not understood to include the power to remand the matter back to the arbitrator'. this view was subsequently adopted in single bench decisions in union of india v. modern laminators ltd. [union of india v. modern laminators ltd., 2008 scc online del 956 : (2008) 3 arb lr 489] (in the context of modification of the award), iffco-tokio general insurance co. ltd. v. indo-rama synthetics ltd. [iffco-tokio general insurance co. ltd. v. indo-rama 20 synthetics ltd., 2015 scc online del 6669] (decided on 20-1-2015) and canara bank v. bsnl [canara bank v. bsnl, 2015 scc online del 8379] (decided on 26-3-2015). in modern laminators [union of india v. modern laminators ltd., 2008 scc online del 956 : (2008) 3 arb lr 489] , the court relied upon the supreme court's decision in numaligarh refinery ltd. v. daelim industrial co. ltd. [numaligarh refinery ltd. v. daelim industrial co. ltd., (2007) 8 scc 466] , noting that the court therein had modified the award in terms of its findings; and the decision in krishna bhagya jala nigam ltd. v. g. harischandra reddy [krishna bhagya jala nigam ltd. v. harischandra reddy, (2007) 2 scc 720] , where the interest rate awarded by the arbitrator was modified. the learned single judge in canara bank relied upon a decision of a single judge of the madras high court in gayatri balaswamy v. isg novasoft technologies ltd. [gayatri balaswamy v. isg novasoft technologies ltd., 2014 scc online mad 6568 : (2015) 1 mad lj 5] the court in gayatri balaswamy [gayatri balaswamy v. isg novasoft technologies ltd., 2014 scc online mad 6568 : (2015) 1 mad lj 5] examined the issue in significant [sic] and held as follows : (gayatri balaswamy case [gayatri balaswamy v. isg novasoft technologies ltd., 2014 scc online mad 6568 : (2015) 1 mad lj 5] , scc online mad para 52) 21 '52. therefore, in my considered view, the expression \"recourse to a court against an arbitral award\" appearing in section 34(1) cannot be construed to mean only a right to seek the setting aside of an award. recourse against an arbitral award could be either for setting aside or for modifying or for enhancing or for varying or for revising an award. the expression \"application for setting aside such an award\" appearing in sections 34(2) and (3) merely prescribes the form, in which, a person can seek recourse against an arbitral award. the form, in which an application has to be made, cannot curtail the substantial right conferred by the statute. in other words, the right to have recourse to a court, is a substantial right and that right is not liable to be curtailed, by the form in which the right has to be enforced or exercised. hence, in my considered view, the power under section 34(1) includes, within its ambit, the power to modify, vary or revise.' the same view had been adopted earlier by single bench decisions of the bombay high court in axios navigation co. ltd. v. indian oil corpn. ltd. [axios navigation co. ltd. v. indian oil corpn. ltd., 2012 scc online bom 4 : (2012) 114 (1) bom lr 392] and angerlehner structurals & civil engg. co. v. municipal corpn. of greater mumbai [angerlehner structurals & civil engg. co. v. municipal corpn. of greater mumbai, 2012 scc online bom 1454 : (2013) 7 bom cr 83] and a division bench of the calcutta high court 22 in w.b. electronics industries development corpn. ltd. v. snehasis bhowmick [w.b. electronics industries development corpn. ltd. v. snehasis bhowmick, 2012 scc online cal 10262] . authorities holding there is no power to modify, vary or remit the award *** 118. this court is inclined to follow the decisions in central warehousing corpn.

[mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181] , where the court held : (mcdermott international inc. case [mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181] , scc p. 208, para 52) 23 '52. the 1996 act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness. intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. the court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. it can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. so, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it.' although the madras high court in gayatri balaswamy [gayatri balaswamy v. isg novasoft technologies ltd., 2014 scc online mad 6568 : (2015) 1 mad lj 5] appropriately noted that these observations in mcdermott international inc. [mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181] were not in the context of the specific issue being dealt herewith, this court is of the opinion that it is determinative of the court's approach in an enquiry under section 34 of the act. indeed, a court, while modifying or varying the award would be doing nothing else but \"correct[ing] the errors of the arbitrators\". this is expressly against the diktat ofmcdermottinternational inc. [mcdermott international inc. v. burn 24 standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181] further, if the power to remit the matter to the arbitrator is read into section 34, it would render inexplicable the deliberate omission by parliament of a provision analogous to section 16 of the arbitration act, 1940 in the present act. section 16 of the 1940 act specifically armed courts with the power to remit the matter to arbitration. noticeably, the scope of remission under the present act is confined to that prescribed in subsection (4) of section 34. besides the division bench rulings of this court in dda [dda v. bhardwaj bros., 2014 scc online del 1581] , state trading corpn. of india ltd. [state trading corpn. of india ltd. v. toepfer international asia pte ltd., 2014 scc online del 3426] , this was also noted by a full bench of the bombay high court in r.s. jiwani v. ircon international ltd. [r.s. jiwani v. ircon international ltd., 2009 scc online bom 2021 : (2010) 1 bom cr 529] , where the court held : (r.s. jiwani case [r.s. jiwani v. ircon international ltd., 2009 scc online bom 2021 : (2010) 1 bom cr 529] , scc online bom paras 28 & 35) '28. . an award can only be set aside under the provisions of section 34 as there is no other provision except section 33 which permits the arbitral tribunal to correct or interpret the award or pass additional award, that too, on limited grounds stated in section 33. . *** 25 35. . it is also true that there are no pari materia provisions like sections 15 and 16 of the act of 1940 in the 1996 act but still the provisions of section 34 read together, sufficiently indicate vesting of vast powers in the court to set aside an award and even to adjourn a matter and such acts and deeds by the arbitral tribunal at the instance of the party which would help in removing the grounds of attack for setting aside the arbitral award.' on the other hand, the calcutta high court in snehasis bhowmick [w.b. electronics industries development corpn. ltd. v. snehasis bhowmick, 2012 scc online cal 10262] did not analyse this distinction, or the specific observations of the supreme court in mcdermott international inc. [mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181] quoted above. further, the decisions in numaligarh refinery [numaligarh refinery ltd. v. daelim industrial co. ltd., (2007) 8 scc 466] and harischandra reddy [krishna bhagya jala nigam ltd. v. harischandra reddy, (2007) 2 scc 720] did not discuss the court's power to modify, vary or remit the award under section 34 of the act. therefore, in light of the dictum in mcdermott international inc. [mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd., (2006) 11 scc 181] and the difference in provisions of the 1940 act and the present act, this court holds that the power to 26 modify, vary or remit the award does not exist under section 34 of the act.\" 14. so also, in the case of delhi airport metro express private limited vs. delhi metro rail corporation limited reported in (2022) 1 scc 131, it was held as under: 28. this court has in several other judgments interpreted section 34 of the 1996 act to stress on the restraint to be shown by courts while examining the validity of the arbitral awards. the limited grounds available to courts for annulment of arbitral awards are well known to legally trained minds. however, the difficulty arises in applying the well-established principles for interference to the facts of each case that come up before the courts. there is a disturbing tendency of courts setting aside arbitral awards, after dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases to come to a conclusion that the award needs intervention and thereafter, dubbing the award to be vitiated by either perversity or patent illegality, apart from the other grounds available for annulment of the award. this approach would lead to corrosion of the object of the 1996 act and the endeavours made to preserve this object, which is minimal judicial interference with arbitral awards. that apart, several judicial pronouncements of this court would become a dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by categorising them as perverse or patently illegal without appreciating the contours of the said expressions. 27 29. patent illegality should be illegality which goes to the root of the matter. in other words, every error of law committed by the arbitral tribunal would not fall within the expression \"patent illegality\". likewise, erroneous application of law cannot be categorised as patent illegality. in addition, contravention of law not linked to public policy or public interest is beyond the scope of the expression \"patent illegality\". what is prohibited is for courts to reappreciate evidence to conclude that the award suffers from patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, as courts do not sit in appeal against the arbitral award. the permissible grounds for interference with a domestic award under section 34(2-a) on the ground of patent illegality is when the arbitrator takes a view which is not even a possible one, or interprets a clause in the contract in such a manner which no fairminded or reasonable person would, or if the arbitrator commits an error of jurisdiction by wandering outside the contract and dealing with matters not allotted to them. an arbitral award stating no reasons for its findings would make itself susceptible to challenge on this account. the conclusions of the arbitrator which are based on no evidence or have been arrived at by ignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. also, consideration of documents which are not supplied to the other party is a facet of perversity falling within the expression \"patent illegality\". 30. section 34(2)(b) refers to the other grounds on which a court can set aside an arbitral award. if a dispute which is not capable of settlement by arbitration is the subject-matter of the award or if the award is in conflict 28 with public policy of india, the award is liable to be set aside. explanation (1), amended by the 2015 amendment act, clarified the expression \"public policy of india\" and its connotations for the purposes of reviewing arbitral awards. it has been made clear that an award would be in conflict with public policy of india only when it is induced or affected by fraud or corruption or is in violation of section 75 or section 81 of the 1996 act, if it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law or if it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice. 31. in ssangyong [ssangyong engg. & construction co. ltd. v. nhai, (2019) 15 scc 131 : (2020) 2 scc (civ) 213] , this court held that the meaning of the expression \"fundamental policy of indian law\" would be in accordance with the understanding of this court in renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co. [renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co., 1994 supp (1) scc 644] . in renusagar [renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co., 1994 supp (1) scc 644] , this court observed that violation of the foreign exchange regulation act, 1973, a statute enacted for the \"national economic interest\", and disregarding the superior courts in india would be antithetical to the fundamental policy of indian law. contravention of a statute not linked to public policy or public interest cannot be a ground to set at naught an arbitral award as being discordant with the fundamental policy of indian law and neither can it be brought within the confines of \"patent illegality\" as discussed above. in other words, contravention of a statute only if it is linked to public policy or public interest is cause for setting aside the 29 award as being at odds with the fundamental policy of indian law. if an arbitral award shocks the conscience of the court, it can be set aside as being in conflict with the most basic notions of justice. the ground of morality in this context has been interpreted by this court to encompass awards involving elements of sexual morality, such as prostitution, or awards seeking to validate agreements which are not illegal but would not be enforced given the prevailing mores of the day. [ssangyong engg. & construction co. ltd. v. nhai, (2019) 15 scc 131 : (2020) 2 scc (civ) 213] 15. similarly, in the case of wellspun speciality solutions limited vs. oil and natural gas corporation limited reported in (2022) 2 scc 382, it was held as under: 22. before we analyse the award, we need to first ascertain the scope of section 34 of the arbitration act, before the 2015 amendment, which provided for certain specific grounds for challenge. section 34, as it existed, reads as under: \"34. application for setting aside arbitral award.--(1) recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3). (2) an arbitral award may be set aside by the court only if-*** 30 (b) the court finds that-(i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force, or (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of india.\" (emphasis supplied) 23. the limited grounds provided under section 34 of the act, has been interpreted by this court on numerous occasions. in this case at hand, the challenge of award is based on the fact that the same is against the public policy and patent illegality. public policy as a ground of challenge has always been met with certain scepticism. the phrase \"public policy\" does not indicate \"a catch-all provision\" to challenge awards before an appellate forum on infinite grounds. however, the ambit of the same is so diversly interpreted that in some cases, the purpose of limiting the section 34 jurisdiction is lost. this court's jurisprudence also shows that section 34(2)(b) has undergone a lot of churning and continue to evolve. the purpose of section 34 is to strike a balance between the court's appellate powers and integrity of the arbitral process. 24. the first case, which expounded on the scope of \"public policy\" was renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co. [renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co., 1994 supp (1) scc 644] , which inter alia provided that a foreign award may not be enforced under the said act, if the court dealing with the case is satisfied that the enforcement of the award will be contrary to the public policy. after elaborate discussion, the court arrived at the 31 conclusion that public policy comprehended in section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards (recognition and enforcement) act, 1961 is the \"public policy of india\" and does not cover the public policy of any other country. 25. for giving meaning to the term \"public policy\", the court observed thus : (renusagar power case [renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co., 1994 supp (1) scc 644] , scc p. 682, para 66) \"66. article v(2)(b) of the new york convention of 1958 and section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act do not postulate refusal of recognition and enforcement of a foreign award on the ground that it is contrary to the law of the country of enforcement and the ground of challenge is confined to the recognition and enforcement being contrary to the public policy of the country in which the award is set to be enforced. there is nothing to indicate that the expression \"public policy\" in article v(2)(b) of the new york convention and section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act is not used in the same sense in which it was used in article i(c) of the geneva convention, 1927 and section 7(1) of the protocol and convention act, 1937. this would mean that \"public policy\" in section 7(1)(b)(ii) has been used in a narrower sense and in order to attract the bar of public policy the enforcement of the award must invoke something more than the violation of the law of india. since the foreign awards act is concerned with recognition and enforcement of foreign awards which are 32 governed by the principles of private international law, the expression \"public policy\" in section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act must necessarily be construed in the sense the doctrine of public policy is applied in the field of private international law. applying the said criteria it must be held that the enforcement of a foreign award would be refused on the ground that it is contrary to public policy if such enforcement would be contrary to (i) fundamental policy of indian law; or (ii) the interests of india; or (iii) justice or morality.\" 26. in ongc v. saw pipes ltd. [ongc v. saw pipes ltd., (2003) 5 scc 705] , the scope of section 34 was expanded to include patent illegality as a ground for challenging the award and held as under : (scc pp. 72728 & 744-45, paras 31 & 74) \"31. therefore, in our view, the phrase \"public policy of india\" used in section 34 in context is required to be given a wider meaning. it can be stated that the concept of public policy connotes some matter which concerns public good and the public interest. what is for public good or in public interest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public good or public interest has varied from time to time. however, the award which is, on the face of it, patently in violation of statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public interest. such award/judgment/decision is likely to adversely affect the administration of justice. hence, in our view in addition to narrower 33 meaning given to the term \"public policy\" in renusagar case [renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co., 1994 supp (1) scc 644] it is required to be held that the award could be set aside if it is patently illegal. the result would be--award could be set aside if it is contrary to: (a) fundamental policy of indian law; or (b) the interest of india; or (c) justice or morality, or (d) in addition, if it is patently illegal. illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality is of trivial nature it cannot be held that award is against the public policy. award could also be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of the court. such award is opposed to public policy and is required to be adjudged void. *** 74. in the result, it is held that: (a)(1) the court can set aside the arbitral award under section 34(2) of the act if the party making the application furnishes proof that: (i) a party was under some incapacity, or (ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or 34 (iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration. (2) the court may set aside the award: (i)(a) if the composition of the arbitral tribunal was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, (b) failing such agreement, the composition of the arbitral tribunal was not in accordance with part i of the act. (ii) if the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with: (a) the agreement of the parties, or (b) failing such agreement, the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with part i of the act. however, exception for setting aside the award on the ground of composition of arbitral tribunal or illegality of arbitral procedure is that the agreement should not be in conflict with the provisions of part i 35 of the act from which parties cannot derogate. (c) if the award passed by the arbitral tribunal is in contravention of the provisions of the act or any other substantive law governing the parties or is against the terms of the contract. (3) the award could be set aside if it is against the public policy of india, that is to say, if it is contrary to: (a) fundamental policy of indian law; or (b) the interest of india; or (c) justice or morality; or (d) if it is patently illegal. (4) it could be challenged: (a) as provided under section 13(5); and (b) section 16(6) of the act.\" 27. eventually, a three-judge bench in ongc v. western geco international ltd. [ongc v. western geco international ltd., (2014) 9 scc 263 : (2014) 5 scc (civ) 12] , while upholding saw pipes case [ongc v. saw pipes ltd., (2003) 5 scc 705] , noted that \"illegality\" of the award must go to root of the matter. illegality of a trivial nature could not be held to violate the public policy. 28. in dyna technologies (p) ltd. v. crompton greaves ltd. [dyna technologies (p) ltd. v. crompton greaves ltd., (2019) 20 scc 1] , this court held : (scc p. 12, paras 24-25) 36 \"24. there is no dispute that section 34 of the arbitration act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various courts. we need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. section 34 is different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. the mandate under section 34 is to respect the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. if the courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated. 25. moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this court have categorically held that the courts should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. the courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the arbitral tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under section 34 of the arbitration act.\" 37 16. in the case of u.h.l. power company limited vs. state of himachal pradesh reported in (2022) scc online sc 19, the limited and narrow scope of section 34 of the said act of 1996 was reiterated by another three judge bench of the apex court as under: 16. as it is, the jurisdiction conferred on courts under section 34 of the arbitration act is fairly narrow, when it comes to the scope of an appeal under section 37 of the arbitration act, the jurisdiction of an appellate court in examining an order, setting aside or refusing to set aside an award, is all the more circumscribed. in mmtc limited v. vedanta limited7, the reasons for vesting such a limited jurisdiction on the high court in exercise of powers under section 34 of the arbitration act has been explained in the following words: \"11. as far as section 34 is concerned, the position is well-settled by now that the court does not sit in appeal over the arbitral award and may interfere on merits on the limited ground provided under section 34(2)(b)(ii) i.e. if the award is against the public policy of india. as per the legal position clarified through decisions of this court prior to the amendments to the 1996 act in 2015, a violation of indian public policy, in turn, includes a violation of the fundamental policy of indian law, a violation of the interest of india, conflict with justice or morality, and the existence of patent illegality in the arbitral award. additionally, the concept of the \"fundamental policy of indian law\" would cover compliance with 38 statutes and judicial precedents, adopting a judicial approach, compliance with the principles of natural justice, and wednesbury [associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corpn., [1948] 1 k.b. 223 (ca)] reasonableness. furthermore, \"patent illegality\" itself has been held to mean contravention of the substantive law of india, contravention of the 1996 act, and contravention of the terms of the contract.\" 17. a similar view, as stated above, has been taken by this court in k. sugumar v. hindustan petroleum corporation ltd. , where it has been observed as follows: \"2. the contours of the power of the court under section 34 of the act are too well established to require any reiteration. even a bare reading of section 34 of the act indicates the highly constricted power of the civil court to interfere with an arbitral award. the reason for this is obvious. when parties have chosen to avail an alternate mechanism for dispute resolution, they must be left to reconcile themselves to the wisdom of the decision of the arbitrator and the role of the court should be restricted to the bare minimum. interference will be justified only in cases of commission of misconduct by the arbitrator which can find manifestation in different forms including exercise of legal perversity by the arbitrator.\" 18. it has also been held time and again by this court that if there are two plausible interpretations of the terms and conditions of the contract, then no fault can be found, 39 if the learned arbitrator proceeds to accept one interpretation as against the other. in dyna technologies (p) ltd. v. crompton greaves ltd.9, the limitations on the court while exercising powers under section 34 of the arbitration act has been highlighted thus: \"24. there is no dispute that section 34 of the arbitration act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various courts. we need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. section 34 is different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. the mandate under section 34 is to respect the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. if the courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated.\" 19. in parsa kente collieries limited v. rajasthan rajya vidyut utpadan nigam limited10, adverting to the previous decisions of this court in mcdermott international inc. v. burn standard co. ltd. and rashtriya ispat nigam ltd. v. dewan chand ram saran12, wherein it has been observed that an 40 arbitral tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract, but if a term of the contract has been construed in a reasonable manner, then the award ought not to be set aside on this ground, it has been held thus: \"9.1 .it is further observed and held that construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide unless the arbitrator construes the contract in such a way that it could be said to be something that no fair-minded or reasonable person could do. it is further observed by this court in the aforesaid decision in paragraph 33 that when a court is applying the \"public policy\" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court of appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. a possible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. it is further observed that thus an award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be invalid on this score. 9.2 similar is the view taken by this court in nhai v. itd cementation (india) ltd., (2015) 14 scc 21, para 25 and sail v. gupta brother steel tubes ltd., (2009) 10 scc 63, para 29.\" 20. in dyna technologies (p) ltd. (supra), the view taken above has been reiterated in the following words: 41 \"25. moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this court have categorically held that the courts should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. the courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the arbitral tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under section 34 of the arbitration act.\" 21. an identical line of reasoning has been adopted in south east asia marine engg. & constructions ltd. [seamac limited] v. oil india ltd.13 and it has been held as follows: \"12. it is a settled position that a court can set aside the award only on the grounds as provided in the arbitration act as interpreted by the courts. recently, this court in dyna technologies (p) ltd. v. crompton greaves ltd. [dyna technologies (p) ltd. v. crompton greaves ltd., (2019) 20 scc 1 : 2019 scc online sc 1656] laid down the scope of such interference. this court observed as follows : (scc pp. 11-12, para 24) \"24. there is no dispute that section 34 of the arbitration act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various courts. we need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of 42 the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. section 34 is different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. the mandate under section 34 is to respect the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. if the courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated.\" 13. it is also settled law that where two views are possible, the court cannot interfere in the plausible view taken by the arbitrator supported by reasoning. this court in dyna technologies [dyna technologies (p) ltd. v. crompton greaves ltd., (2019) 20 scc 1 : 2019 scc online sc 1656] observed as under : (scc p.12, para 25) 25. moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this court have categorically held that the court should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. the courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the arbitral tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under section 34 of the arbitration act.\" 43 22. in the instant case, we are of the view that the interpretation of the relevant clauses of the implementation agreement, as arrived at by the learned sole arbitrator, are both, possible and plausible. merely because another view could have been taken, can hardly be a ground for the learned single judge to have interfered with the arbitral award. in the given facts and circumstances of the case, the appellate court has rightly held that the learned single judge exceeded his jurisdiction in interfering with the award by questioning the interpretation given to the relevant clauses of the implementation agreement, as the reasons given are backed by logic. 17. a perusal of the various contentions urged by the appellant before the commercial court as well as before this court clearly indicate that the same are in the realm of appreciation of evidence which is clearly beyond the scope and ambit of the limited and restricted jurisdiction available under sections 34 and 37 of the said act of 1996. as stated supra, the grievance of the appellant who was the petitioner / applicant before the commercial court in com.a.s.no.62/2019 is with regard to not allowing the entire claims -f, g and h and partly allowing claims d, e and i put forth by the appellant who contends that the claims ought to have been allowed in favour of the 44 appellant and not only a part / portion of the claims as had been done by the arbitral tribunal; a perusal of the arbitral award will clearly indicate that the arbitral tribunal has carefully and properly considered and appreciated the pleadings and evidence of the parties in relation to all the claims and has come to the conclusion that though the appellant had sought several amounts in relation to the aforesaid claims d to i, the appellant was entitled to only a part / portion of the claims and that the appellant had not adduced sufficient legal or acceptable evidence which would entitle him to the entire claim. under these circumstances, having regard to the limited and restricted scope of interference with the arbitral award which was based on appreciation of evidence and not on account of any nonconsideration of evidence nor based on no evidence, the commercial court was fully justified in dismissing the petition / application filed by the appellant under section 34 of the said act of 1996. 18. it is equally well settled that the court dealing with an application under section 34 of the said act of 1996 filed by the unsuccessful claimant cannot enhance or increase the amounts granted by the arbitral tribunal in 45 favour of the claimant nor can a claim be granted for the first time by the section 34 court by modifying, varying or correcting the arbitral award and the only option available to the section 34 court is to set aside the arbitral award, if permissible as stated supra and relegate the parties to fresh arbitration, if they so desire, as held by the apex court in the case of mc. dermott international inc vs. burn standard co. ltd., & others reported in (2006) 11 scc 181 and followed by co-ordinate bench of this court in the case of smt. padma mahadev and others vs. m/s. sierra constructions passed in comap no.2/2021 dated 22.03.2021. in the instant case, the material on record discloses that while claims a and b were fully allowed by the arbitral tribunal, claims f, g and h were rejected and claims c, d, e and i were allowed only in part, aggrieved by which the appellant filed the petition/application under section 34 of the said act of 1996. in view of the aforesaid well settled position of law stated supra that the section 34 court, muchless this court in an appeal under section 37 of the said act of 1996 cannot pass an award granting a claim that was rejected in respect of claims f , g and h nor grant the claim of the 46 appellant in full in relation to claims c, d, e and i, we are of the considered opinion that the trial court was fully justified in confirming the impugned arbitral award, which does not warrant interference on this ground also. 19. on careful perusal of the material on record and after giving our anxious consideration to the rival submissions, we are of the considered opinion that the arbitral tribunal has rightly held that the termination of the agreement was illegal because the respondent failed to prove the grounds of termination, the termination was arbitrary and against the principles of natural justice. the arbitral tribunal had jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute as the agreements were statutory contracts executed under the provisions of transparency in public procurements act. the award passed by the tribunal is based on evidence and as such, no interference is required by the court under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. the commercial court has rightly rejected the cases filed under section 34 of the said act of 1996. the impugned award passed by the tribunal as well as impugned judgment and order passed by the commercial court are correct and proper and they do not contain any illegality or 47 infirmity nor the same can be said to be perverse or capricious warranting interference by this court in the present appeal under section 37 of the said act of 1996. 20. accordingly, we do not find any merit in the appeal and the same is hereby dismissed. sd/chief justice sd/judge srl."
