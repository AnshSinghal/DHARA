Though the matters were listed in the 'Fresh' Category, however, on joint request of the counsel for the parties, the matters are heard today itself. \n2. The Writ Petition has been filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India with the following prayers:-\n\"That the petitioner most respectfully humbly prayed that A. It is therefore most respectfully prayed that this writ petition may kindly be allowed:-\nB. By an appropriate writ, order or direction order may kindly issued and quashed the impugned order dated 09.01.2024 (Annexure- 8) passed by learned Commercial Court No.2 Jodhpur in Commercial Suit No.21/2023 (Ncv No.80/2019) (M/s Hira Ram Hansa Ram vs. M/s Triveni Brokers & others), may kindly be set aside.\nC. By an appropriate writ, order or direction order may kindly issue and the application (Annexure-6) under Section 65 of the Evidence Act may kindly be rejected. \nD. Any other appropriate writ, order or direction, which this Hon'ble Court may deem it just and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case, may kindly be issued. E. Costs of this writ petition may kindly be may kindly be awarded in favour of the petitioner\" \n3. Brief facts of the case are that the plaintiff/respondent firm filed a commercial suit for recovering Rs.17,86,774/- (Annexure-\n1) which included the amount supposed to be deposited by the [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (3 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] petitioners against the supply of goods, on 02.11.2017, i.e. Rs.\n12,27,977/- along with the interest of Rs. 4,90,019/- from the said date. An Fir was also registered at No. 59/2018 at Police Station, Sumerpur, District Pali, against the petitioner/defendant firm under Section 420, 408, 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and subsequently the chargesheet was filed on 04.11.2018. \n4. After the service of notice, the petitioner/defendant firm filed a reply (Annexure-2) raising preliminary objections with regard to maintainability of the suit. Furthermore, the petitioner/defendant firm firm filed an application under Order Vii Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'Cpc') on account of non-disclosure of the 'cause of action' in the plaint. \n5. The Learned Commercial Court, vide order dated 11.08.2021 dismissed the application of the petitioner/defendant, against which the petitioner/defendant firm preferred a S.B.C.W.P No. 16350/2022 titled as Triveni Brokers v. Hiraram and Ors. Which is pending consideration before this Court. \n6. During the course of trial, the plaintiff/respondent firm filed an application (Annexure-3) under Order Xi Rule 12 and 14 of Cpc for taking on record the document/receipts. The petitioner/defendant firm filed a reply (Annexure-4) to the said application, raising an objection with respect to the applicability of Order Xi of Cpc to the proceedings under Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n7. Learned Commercial Court vide order dated 28.08.2023 (Annexure-5) dismissed the application filed by the [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (4 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] plaintiff/respondent firm. Subsequently, the plaintiff/respondent firm filed an application (Annexure-6) under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 for taking on record the document/receipts as secondary evidence, to which the petitioner/ defendant firm filed a reply (Annexure-7). \n8. Thereafter, the learned Commercial Court vide order dated 09.01.2024 (Annexure-8) allowed the application filed by the plaintiff/respondent. \n9. Thus, being aggrieved of the order dated 09.01.2024 (Annexure-8), the petitioner/defendant firm has preferred this writ petition. \n10. Learned Counsel for the petitioner/defendant firm submitted that the order passed by the learned Commercial Court is illegal, arbitrary and perverse as the learned Commercial Court has wrongly allowed the application filed by the plaintiff/respondent firm under Section 65 since the plaintiff/respondent firm have failed to disclose the existence of the original receipt and there is no observation of the learned Commercial Court with regard to Section 63 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, and thus the document produced by the plaintiff/respondent firm is not covered under the scope of secondary evidence as stipulated by the said provision. He also submitted that the learned Commercial Court has not given any finding whether the photocopy documents have been made from the original document as per Section 63(2) and (3) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. \n[2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (5 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024]\n11. Learned Counsel for the petitioner/defendant firm further submitted that as per Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, secondary evidence of the document may be given only where the original is shown or appears to be in possession or power of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved, or of any person, out of reach of the process of the Court, or wherein the original has been destroyed or lost. He also submitted that in the present case, the plaintiff/respondent failed to prove any of the condition stipulated under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and despite the same, learned Commercial Court has allowed the application filed by the plaintiff/respondent firm. \n12. Learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant firm submitted that the plaintiff/respondent cannot be allowed to bring the same application under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, as the application under Order Xi Rule 12 and 14 of the Cpc has already been dismissed. He further submitted that since the same application had been rejected by the learned Commercial Court vide order dated 18.08.2023 (Annexure-5), learned Commercial Court does not have the power to review its own decision.\n13. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent at the outset submitted that the application under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 has been filed to produce 27 receipts of the material sold by the petitioner/defendant, who is the broker for the plaintiff/respondent firm and thus the plaintiff/respondent firm is not able to produce the original receipts since these original [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (6 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] receipts are in the power and possession of the petitioner/defendant firm.\n14. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff/respondent firm further submitted that the purpose of application under Order Xi Rule 12 of Cpc and Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 serve two completely different purposes, wherein she submitted that Order Xi Rule 12 of Cpc provides for the application for discovery of documents while Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 provides for an application wherein the party seeks permission to give secondary evidence in cases where original documents cannot be produced. She further submitted that thus, the applications under Order Xi Rule 12 and Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 are two completely different stages. \n15. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff/respondent firm further relied upon the judgment passed by the Coordinate Bench of this Hon'ble Court in the case of Arun Kumar v. Special Judge, Ndps [S.B.C.W.P. No. 3322 of 2018 decided on 13.03.2018] wherein it was observed that Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 has a wide scope and it permits the admission of secondary evidence, including photostat copies, in certain circumstances. The relevant paragraph of the judgment reads as under:-\n\"9. After hearing learned counsel for the parties and perusing the record of the case as well as the precedent law cited by both the parties, this Court is of the view that Section 65 of the Act of 1972 has a very wide scope and once the suit is for specific performance and the photostat copy of the agreement which was sought to be produced by the respondents through the petitioner, has been refused then it was ofcourse correct on the part of the learned Court below to permit the respondents to take the photostat copy of the [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (7 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] document on record. The taking of the document on record does not necessarily mean that the document has become final as the right of the petitioners to raise all the objections regarding the admissibility of the document shall always remain open and could be decided by the learned Court below itself. The refuting of the documents was the domain of the petitioners but accepting the documents under Section 65 of the Act of 1972 was a very wide scope looking into the language of Section 65 of the Act of 1972 and hence, could not have been denied by the learned Court below.\" \n16. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff/respondent firm also submitted that at this stage, relevancy is not be seen and she placed reliance upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla in the case of Mahboob Hussan v. Smt. Vidya Sharma and Anr. [C.R. No. 74 of 2014 decided on 14.03.2017] wherein it was observed that the filing of application under Order Xi Rule 12 and 14 of the Cpc by the plaintiff/respondent firm was in the nature of the application under Section 66 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The relevant paragraph of the judgment is reproduced as under:-\n\"17. Thus, the sum and substance of the application filed by the respondents under Order Xi, Rule 14, C.P.C. was in the nature of the application under section 66 of the Act and, therefore, non-service of the specific notice under section 66 of the Evidence Act upon the petitioner in the given facts and circumstances is of no avail as no prejudice would be caused to him. Consequently, the decision relied upon by the petitioner are not at all applicable to the facts obtaining in the instant case. Moreover, the proposition argued before this Court is not even the defense taken up by the petitioner before the Court below.\" \n17. Heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the material available on record and the judgments cited at the Bar. \n18. The petitioner/defendant firm in its reply dated 01.12.2023 (Annexure-7), to the application under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act 1872, has clearly stated that the 27 receipts which the plaintiff/respondent no.1 sought to bring on record did not [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (8 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] mention petitioner/defendant firm's name, nor do they relate to the transaction between the parties to the suit. Meaning thereby the petitioner has admitted the existence of such payment receipts being issued by it. The relevant paragraph of the petitioner/defendant firm's reply to application under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is reproduced as under:- \n\"     2                                             11  12  14            ,                                                                                                     \"\n19. The respondent has filed an additional affidavit while placing on record the application file under Order Xi Rule 12 & 14 Cpc and the reply filed by the petitioner. Upon perusal of the application filed by the respondent, it is seen that the respondent has placed on record photostat copies of 27 receipts of the payment received by the petitioner/defendant of the payment received by the petitioner/defendant while submitting that the original is lying with the petitioner/defendant. It is also stated in the application filed by the respondent/plaintiff that the petitioner/defendant has collected money from the traders for which such payment receipts have been issued by the petitioner/defendants. The petitioner/ defendants has filed reply (Annexure-R/2) to the said application in which he has admitted that such receipts have been issued by the petitioner firm while disputing that the name of the [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (9 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] respondent firm is not present in the said receipts and it does not pertain to any transaction between the petitioner and the respondent. Thus, when the original document is shown or appears to be in the possession or power of the petitioner/defendant against whom the document is sought to be proved, then 27 receipts have rightly been permitted to be admissible in evidence. \n20. The petitioner/defendant has also accepted that it bought certain goods from the respondent/plaintiff on various occasions and worked as a broker for the respondent firm. Thus, the petitioner firm has admitted that there were transactions between the petitioner firm and the respondent firm and thus, in order to prove its case, the plaintiff/respondent has placed on record about 27 photostat copies of the payment receipts and the issuance of which have duly been admitted by the petitioner firm. Thus, the learned commercial court has rightly allowed the application by the respondent under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The relevant paragraph of the reply to the application under Order Xi Rule 12 and 14 of Cpc is reproduced as under:- \n\"        03                                                                                                              .        -                  \"\n21. Order Xi Rule 12 of Cpc deals with the discovery of documents and allows the court to order any party to a suit to [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (10 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] make discovery on oaths of the document in their possession or power, which relates to any matter in question in the suit. The purpose is to ensure that relevant documents are made available to the parties and the court for the proper adjudication of the dispute. On the other hand, Section 65 of the Evidence Act deals with the cases in which secondary evidence may be given and it also specifies the conditions wherein the secondary evidence is admissible. Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 Act reads as under: -\n\"65. Cases in which secondary evidence relating to documents may be given.--Secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition, or contents of a document in the following cases: --\n(a) when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power -- of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved, or of any person out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the Court, or of any person legally bound to produce it, and when, after the notice mentioned in section 66, such person does not produce it;\n(b) when the existence, condition or contents of the original have been proved to be admitted in writing by the person against whom it is proved or by his representative in interest;\n(c) when the original has been destroyed or lost, or when the party offering evidence of its contents cannot, for any other reason not arising from his own default or neglect, produce it in reasonable time;\n(d) when the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable;\n(e) when the original is a public document within the meaning of section 74;\n(f) when the original is a document of which a certified copy is permitted by this Act, or by any other law in force in 1 [India] to be given in evidence;\n(g) when the originals consist of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot conveniently be examined in Court, and the fact to be proved is the general result of the whole collection.\nIn cases (a), (c) and (d), any secondary evidence of the contents of the document is admissible. In case (b), the written admission is admissible. \nIn case (e) or (f), a certified copy of the document, but no other kind of secondary evidence, is admissible. [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (11 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] In case (g), evidence may be given as to the general result of the documents by any person who has examined them, and who is skilled in the examination of such documents.\"\n22. Furthermore, this Court observes that contrary to the intent of Order Xi Rule 12 of Cpc, the purpose of Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is to provide an exception to the general rule that the best evidence must be produced, in situations where the original document is lost, destroyed, or otherwise unavailable. This court also finds that in the case of Rajeev Khanna urf Raju s/o (late) Shri Azad Khanna v. Smt. Anita Tripathi D/0 (late) Shri Suraj Prakash Tripathi [S.B.C.W.P No. 22718 of 2017 decided on 03.01.2018], wherein it was held that even after dismissal of application under Order Xi Rule 12 and 14, sufficient steps had been taken by the defendant-petitioner for calling for original documents to be placed on record as secondary evidence, and thus the Coordinate Bench of this Hon'ble Court had allowed the application filed under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The relevant paragraph reads as under:-\n\"10. Having noted the submissions of learned counsel for both the parties and after going through the order impugned dated 18/08/2017 passed by the Additional Senior Civil Judge and Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate No.2, Jaipur Metropolitan, this Court finds that the learned trial court has noted that the documents no. 4 to 7 were not allowed to be taken on record vide order dated 28/01/2017. It is also seen that the application moved under Order 11 Rule 12 & 14 Cpc has been rejected solely on the ground that the proceedings against the defendant-respondent No.2 have been held to be ex-parte and therefore, the documents have been not called for from their possession. Thus, this Court finds that sufficient steps were taken by the defendant-petitioner for calling for the original documents which he wanted to place on record as secondary evidence. \n11. The Apex Court in the case of Rakesh Mohindra Vs. Anita Beri and others (supra) has held that the precondition for [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (12 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] leading secondary evidence is that the Court should be satisfied with appropriate steps have been taken by the concerned party for producing the original documents which are not in his possession and which are stated to be in possession of the other person. Originality, such documents ought to have been directed to be produced from the concerned party. However, in the circumstances, as noted above, if the original documents could not be produced and the defendant-respondent no.2 himself has placed photo copies of the originals, it would be in the interest of justice that the application under Section 65 of the Act of 1872 is allowed and the same is treated as secondary evidence for the purpose of disposal of the suit. The submission of learned counsel for the plaintiff-respondent that the onus lies for proving the various issues framed is only on the plaintiff- respondent, would not be of any material change. \n12. Consequently, the writ petition is allowed. The order impugned dated 18/08/2017 passed by the learned trial court is set aside and the application moved by the defendant- petitioner under Section 65 of the Act of 1872 for calling for secondary evidence relating to the two documents i.e. revised list of allottees and revised map as published, is allowed. No costs.\" \n23. Thus, the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that after rejection of the application filed by the respondent under Order Xi Rule 12 & 14 Cpc, the application under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, is not maintainable, is having no merit, as the respondent/plaintiff had taken sufficient steps for calling the original documents by way of filing application under Order Xi Rule 12 & 14 Cpc. Thereafter, when the application under Order Xi Rule 12 & 14 Cpc was rejected, the respondent/plaintiff placed on record the photostat copies of the original receipts, by way of filing application under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. \n24. Moreover, this Court observes that the petitioner/defendant's submission that the mandatory requirement of notice has not been fulfilled by the plaintiff/respondent firm, is devoid of merit, since by virtue of filing the application under Order Xi Rule 12 and [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (13 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] 14, this fact has come to notice of the petitioner/defendant firm that the plaintiff/respondent firm has presented photostat copies of the original receipts of the transactions made by the petitioner/ defendant firm and thus, under Proviso to Section 66 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, notice was not required. Section 66 of the Evidence Act, 1872 reads as under:-\n\"66. Rules as to notice to produce.-- Secondary evidence of the contents of the documents referred to in section 65, clause (a), shall not be given unless the party proposing to give such secondary evidence has previously given to the party in whose possession or power the document is, [or to his attorney or pleader,] such notice to produce it as is prescribed by law; and if no notice is prescribed by law, then such notice as the Court considers reasonable under the circumstances of the case:\nProvided that such notice shall not be required in order to render secondary evidence admissible in any of the following cases, or in any other case in which the Court thinks fit to dispense with it: --\nxxxx (2) when, from the nature of the case, the adverse party must know that he will be required to produce it;\nxxxx\"\n25. This Court finds that in the case of Ashok Dulichand v. Madahavlal Dube : (1975) 4 Scc 664, the Hon'ble Apex Court considering the provisions of Section 65 of the Evidence Act, held as under: -\n\"According to clause (a) of section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition or contents of a document when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved, or of any person out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the Court, or of any person legally bound to produce it, and when, after the notice mentioned in section 66, such person does not produce it. Clauses (b) to (g) of section 65 specify some other contingencies wherein secondary evidence relating to a document may be given.\" \n[2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (14 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024]\n26. Recently, this Court in the case of Virendra Kumar v. Neeraj Garg : S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.10391/2023 decided on 01.03.2024 while considering the identical controversy has held that pre-requisites of Section 65 of the Evidence Act, 1872 have to be satisfied before leading secondary evidence. In the case of Virendra Kumar (supra), this Court relied on the decision rendered by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Rakesh Mohindra v. Anita Beri and Ors. : (2016) 16 Scc 483. In the case of Rakesh Mohindra (surpa), the Hon'ble Court has held that in order to lead secondary evidence, certain pre-conditions are required to be fulfilled, where such original document(s) could not have been produced by the party relying upon such documents in spite of best efforts, and it was unable to produce the same which is beyond his control. It has also been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court that the party seeking to produce secondary evidence must establish for the non-production of primary evidence, unless, it is established that the original documents are lost or destroyed or are being deliberately withheld by the party in respect of that document sought to be used, secondary evidence in respect of that document cannot be accepted. The relevant para of the judgment passed in Rakesh Mohindra (supra) is reproduced as under:-\n\"Held, while allowing the appeal (1) The pre-conditions for leading secondary evidence are that such original documents could not be produced by the party relied upon such documents in spite of best efforts, unable to produce the same which is beyond their control. The party [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (15 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] sought to produce secondary evidence must establish for the non-production of primary evidence. Unless, it is established that the original documents is lost or destroyed or is being deliberately withheld by the party in respect of that document sought to be used, secondary evidence in respect of that document cannot accepted.\" \n27. This Court in the case of Mukesh Kumar v. Prithvi Raj : S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.12845/2019 decided on 28.07.2023 while allowing the writ petition preferred by the petitioner/defendant challenging the order passed by the trial court whereby the trial court rejected the application preferred by the defendant seeking lead secondary evidence, has held as under:\n\"17. Section 65 clause (a) of the Evidence Act lays down that secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition or contents of a document when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved. In the case in hand, the petitioner-defendant, in his written statement and in the application filed under Order 11 Rules 12 and 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure has mentioned that the document in question is in possession of the respondent-defendant. \n18. Section 66 of the Evidence Act provides for notice to the party in whose possession the document is shown. This Court finds that the purpose of notice is to provide information regarding showing the possession of the document. From the perusal of the material available on record, it reveals that the petitioner defendant filed an application under Order 11 Rules 12 and 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure for production of the document in question to which he filed reply, though denied to have the possession of the same and thus, the respondent-plaintiff was having prior knowledge about the production of such documents.\n19. Further, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that if the document in question is allowed to be produced as secondary evidence, then no prejudice would be caused to the respondent-plaintiff as he will have an opportunity to testify the said document by examining such witnesses, particularly in light of the issue No.5 framed by the learned trial Court. Also, the learned trial Court, vide order dated 04.01.2019, while deciding the application of the petitioner filed under Order 11 Rules 12 and 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, has observed that the document in question is necessary for deciding the suit and directed the petitioner-defendant to brought on record the same in [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (16 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] accordance with law and hence, the petitioner-defendant has preferred the present application under Section 65 of the Evidence Act. \n20. This Court, in the case of Arun Kumar (supra), this Court observed as under:-\n\"8. ... ... 32. ... ... ... As held by this Court that after taking the document on record, the party relying upon it, will have to prove its existence and execution so also its contents and conditions. Needless to observe that the respondent/defendant shall be permitted to raise all just objections regarding admissibility of the document in the teeth of the provisions of Registration Act and Stamp Act. The objection as and when raised, shall be decided by the learned Trial Court, in accordance with law. Any observation made by this Court consciously or otherwise touching upon admissibility of the document shall not come in the way of learned Trial Court to decide the same.\" \nIn the case of Smt. Mathura Devi (supra), this Court observed as under:-\n\"(13) ... ... The proposition of the secondary evidence never automatically means that the evidence rendered is truthful, authentic or genuine as the same has to be established during the course of trial. Thus, excluding the secondary evidence only with an apprehension of an improper evidence coming in at a preliminary stage is uncalled for.\" \n21. In view of the above, this Court finds that if the petitioner defendant is permitted to lead secondary evidence, then, it will not prejudice the case of the respondent-plaintiff as he will have full opportunity to examine the witnesses over the document so also he will be free to raise all his just objections. \n22. The writ petition is allowed in the above terms and the impugned order dated 08.08.2019 is quashed and set aside.\"\n28. In the case of Mahboob Hussain (supra), the High Court of Himachal Pradesh observed that filing of application under Order Xi Rule 12 & 14 Cpc by the plaintiff therein, was in the nature of application under Section 66 of the Evidence Act, 1872 and service of specific notice under Section 66 upon the defendant was not required, as no prejudice as such would be caused to the defendant therein.\n[2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (17 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024]\n29. This Court finds that the respondent/plaintiff has taken sufficient steps prior to filing application under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and has sufficiently shown that the original receipts are in possession or power of the petitioner/defendant. \n30. Thus, the order passed by the learned Commercial Court dated 09.01.2024 (Annexure-8) does not require any interference and the writ petition is, therefore, dismissed. Stay petition as well as all other pending applications, if any, also stand dismissed. [Civil Writ Petition No. 16350/2022] \n1. This writ petition has been filed under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India with the following prayers:-\n\"A. It is therefore most respectfully prayed that this writ petition may kindly be allowed:-\nB. By an appropriate writ, order or direction order may kindly issued and quashed the impugned order dated 11.08.2021 (Annexure- 5) passed by the learned Commercial Court No.1, Jodhpur and allow the application (Annexure-3) filed by the petitioner with regard to application under Order 7 Rule 11 Cpc in Commercial Suit No.80/2019 (Ncv No.80/2019) (M/s Hira Ram Hansa Ram Vs. Triveni Brokers & others), the suit file by the plaintiff may kindly be dismissed according to the provision of Order 7 Rule 11(a) of the Cpc C. Any other appropriate writ, order or direction, which this Hon'ble Court may deem it just and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case, may kindly be issued. \nD. Costs of this writ petition may kindly be may kindly be awarded in favour of the petitioner.\" \n[2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (18 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024]\n2. Brief facts of the case are that the plaintiff/respondent no. 1 firm filed a commercial suit (Annexure-1) for recovering Rs. 17,86,774/- which included the amount supposed to be deposited by the petitioners against the supply of goods, on 02.11.2017, i.e. Rs. 12,27,977/- along with the interest of Rs. 4,90,019/- from the said date. Furthermore, An Fir was registered at No. 59/2018 at Police Station, Sumerpur, District Pali, against the petitioner under Section 420, 408, 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and subsequently the chargesheet was filed on 04.11.2018. \n3. After the service of notice, the petitioner/defendant filed a reply (Annexure-2) raising preliminary objections with regard to maintainability of the suit. Furthermore, the petitioner/defendant filed an application (Annexure-3) under Order Vii Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'Cpc') on account of non-disclosure of the 'cause of action' in the plaint. Furthermore the Respondent-Plaintiff filed reply (Annexure-4) to the application filed by the petitioner-defendant under Order Vii Rule 11.\n4. The Learned Commercial Court, vide order dated 11.08.2021 (Annex-5) dismissed the application filed by the petitioner/defendant and thus, being aggrieved of the order dated 11.08.2021 (Annexure-5), the petitioner has preferred this writ petition. \n5. Learned Counsel for the petitioner-defendant submitted that the impugned order passed by learned commercial court rejecting the application filed by the petitioner-defendant under Order Vii [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (19 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] Rule 11 Cpc is illegal, arbitrary and perverse, inasmuch as the respondent No1-plaintiff has failed to disclose the cause of action in the plaint, as provided under order Vii Rule 11 (a) Cpc. He further submitted that the provision of Order Vii Rule 11 Cpc imposes an obligation on court to determine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action by scrutinising the averments in the plaint along with the documents relied upon by the plaintiff and also by perusing the material facts which are necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to entitle him to the reliefs claimed in the suit. \n6. Learned Counsel for the petitioner-defendant also submitted that by perusal of the plaint filed by the plaintiff it is clear that the suit was filed by the plaintiff in the year 2019 and in the pleadings of the plaintiff there is no disclosure of cause of action and thereby the suit is barred by provisions of Order Vii Rule 11(a) Cpc as in the entire plaint the plaintiff has not disclosed any cause of action and mere claim regarding liability of some due amount from the petitioner-defendant cannot be treated as disclosure of cause of action in the plaint.\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the joinder of proper party in the plaint is necessary for a trial against any person and the petitioner-defendant being a broker for the respondent No.1-plaintiff, inasmuch as the goods/material was not delivered to the petitioner-defendant and, therefore, the recovery cannot be made against the petitioner and the purchasers are also necessary parties in the suit, however, the learned trial Court has [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (20 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] not considered the same aspect. He also submitted in regard to the jurisdiction of High Court against the order passed by the commercial Court that as per Rule 55 of the Rajasthan High Court Rules the jurisdiction under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India lies with the Single bench and thus his writ petition is maintainable. \n8. In support of his submissions the Learned Counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on the judgments passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of T. Arivandandam vs T. V. Satyapal & Another reported in 1977 (4) Scc 467; Sopan Sukhdeo Sable & Ors vs Assistant Charity Commissioner & Ors reported in 2004(2) Wlc(Sc)Cvl122; Innovative Textiles Ltd versus Nitin spinners Ltd (D.B. Cwp No.8119/2023); Rajasthan State Mines And Minerals Ltd vs Ankur Minmine Product Private Limited (S.B.C.W.P 920/2019)\n9 . Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent-Plaintiff firm submitted that the writ petition filed by the petitioner is not maintainable, inasmuch as per Section 8 of the Commercial courts Act, 2015 there is bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order of a Commercial Court and thus the writ petition of the petitioner be dismissed on the said ground. She further submitted that the petitioner has made false averments that the plaint does not disclose the cause of action as mentioned in Order Vii Rule 11 (a) Cpc, whereas, the respondent- plaintiff has clearly mentioned in detail in its plaint regarding the cause of action and the non-payment of the amount by the [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (21 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] petitioner-defendant due to the respondent-plaintiff and moreover, the case of the plaintiff is a mixed question of facts and law and thus the averments of the petitioner-defendant in its application under order Vii Rule 11 for rejection of plaint, do not sustain.\n10. Learned counsel for the respondent-plaintiff further submitted that the respondent-plaintiff cannot be compelled by the petitioner as to who should be made the necessary party in the suit filed by it, particularly when the petitioner committed fraud against the respondent while he was working as a broker for the respondent and was selling the goods/material for the respondent however, was not making the payment of the same to the respondent. The petitioner/defendant has not paid the due amount to respondent/plaintiff after selling the goods/material, though the goods were sold through the petitioner/defendant and thus the petitioner/defendant was the only necessary party and the other purchasers were not required to be arrayed as defendants in the suit. Moreover, the petitioner has not even replied to the legal notice given to him by the respondent\n11. Learned counsel for the respondent-plaintiff also submitted that the fraudulent actions of the petitioner clearly discloses the cause of action which have been clearly mentioned in the suit and these are questions of facts and laws which will be decided after producing evidences and hearing the parties and therefore, the application filed by the petitioner Order Vii Rule 11 for rejection of [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (22 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] the plaint has rightly been dismissed as the averments in the plaint clearly describes and discloses the cause of action.\n12. Learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that while adjudicating regarding the cause of action under order Vii Rule 11 the plaint has to be read as a whole to find out whether the averments disclose the cause of action or whether the suit is barred by any law. In support of the same the respondent has placed reliance on the judgments passed by the Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Sardar Khan Khokhar versus Shri Devji Patel and Ors reported in 2011(3)Dnj (Raj) 1563 and Late Dhanpat Kanwar and Anr versus Smt Shanti and Ors (Sbcwp No. 9794/2017).\n13. Heard Learned Counsel for the parties; perused the material available on record and the judgments cited at the Bar. \n14. This Court finds that the learned Commercial Court has observed in its order dated 11.08.2021 that any specific word or sentence cannot determine the Cause of Action, and the \"bundle of facts\" as a whole should be considered while determining if there is disclosure of cause of action or not. The learned Commercial Court further observed that the plaintiff-respondent has repeatedly stated in its plaint that the petitioner-Defendant is liable to pay the amount due to the respondent-plaintiff which has not been paid by the petitioner-defendant and this relief of the respondent-plaintiff itself is the disclosure of the cause of action by the plaintiff-respondent. The learned Commercial Court also observed that on the basis of such technical grounds the [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (23 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] respondent-plaintiff cannot be deprived of the relief claimed, as all the facts and the plaint should be considered as a whole to determine if \"Cause of Action\" arises or not. \n15. The object of Order Vii Rule 11 Cpc is to provide a mechanism for rejecting a plaint at an early stage of the proceedings if it is found to be defective and does not disclose the cause of action or is barred by law. It is also important to note that provisions of Order Vii Rule 11 Cpc are mandatory in nature and not directory. The Court may reject a plaint if it does not comply with the requirements specified in Order Vii Rule 11 Cpc, which includes providing sufficient details of the cause of action. The petitioner/defendant has preferred application under Order Vii Rule 11 Cpc on the ground that the respondent/plaintiff has failed to disclose a cause of action in the suit filed by it. This Court further finds that the learned Commercial Court observed that the petitioner-defendant worked as a broker for the respondent and furthermore, the questions, firstly whether the purchasers who bought the goods from the petitioner be made necessary parties and secondly, whether the petitioner is a sole proprietorship or a partnership firm are mixed question of fact and law which do not attract the provisions of Order Vii Rule 11 Cpc, thus these contentions of the petitioner in the application under Order Vii Rule 11 do not sustain. \n16. This Court finds that by perusal of the plaint, it clearly describes that the petitioner firm was a broker for the respondent firm and sold the grocery goods for the respondent and thereafter [2024:Rj-Jd:12253] (24 of 30) [Cw-2222/2024] was supposed to pay the amount received by the petitioner firm to the respondent firm which seems was not paid by the petitioner. Furthermore, it is clearly stated in the plaint that the petitioner firm after supplying the goods to the purchasers and after receiving the amount from the purchasers have not paid the due amount to the respondent and has defrauded the respondent and thus, this clearly discloses the Cause of Action in the suit filed by the respondent, therefore the contentions of the petitioner that there is no disclosure of the Cause of Action is unsustainable. Relevant Portion of the Order Vii Rule 11(a) Cpc is reproduced here as under:-\n\"Order Vii- Plaint\n11. Rejection of plaint.-- The plaint shall be rejected in the following cases:--\n(a) where it does not disclose a cause of action;\"\n17. This Court finds that in the case of Azhar Hussain  v. Rajiv Gandhi : 1996 Supp SCC 315, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the whose purpose of conferment of powers under this provision is to ensure that a litigation which is meaningless and bound to prove abortive, should not be permitted to waste judicial time of the Court. The relevant portion of the judgment reads as under:\n\"12. .... The whole purpose of conferment of such powers is to ensure that a litigation which is meaningless, and bound to prove abortive should not be permitted to occupy the time of the court, and exercise the mind of the respondent. The sword of Damocles need not be kept hanging over his head unnecessarily without point or purpose. Even in an ordinary civil litigation, the court readily exercises the power to reject a plaint, if it does not disclose any cause of action.\"\n[2024:RJ-JD:12253] (25 of 30) [CW-2222/2024]\n18. This Court finds that in the case of Liverpool & London S.P. & I Assn. Ltd. v. M.V. Sea Success I : (2004) 9 SCC 512, the Hon'ble Apex Court held as under:\n\"139. Whether a plaint discloses a cause of action or not is essentially a question of fact. But whether it does or does not must be found out from reading the plaint itself. For the said purpose, the averments made in the plaint in their entirety must be held to be correct. The test is as to whether if the averments made in the plaint are taken to be correct in their entirety, a decree would be passed.\" \n19. Further it is seen that in the case of Church of Christ Charitable Trust & Educational Charitable Society v. Ponniamman Educational Trust : (2012) 8 SCC 706, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that the cause of action is a bundle of facts which gives the plaintiff the right to relief against the defendant and a cause of action must include the some act done by the defendant since in absence of such an act no cause of action can possibly accrue. \n20. This Court finds that in the case of ABC Laminart (P) Ltd. v. A.P. Agencies : (1989) 2 SCC 163, the Hon'ble Apex Court while explaining the meaning of 'cause of action' has held that a cause of action means every fact, which if traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to a judgment of the court and in other words, it is a bundle of facts. The relevant paragraph 12 of the said judgment reads as under:\n\"12. A cause of action means every fact, which if traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to a judgment of the Court. In other words, it is a bundle of facts which taken with the l aw applicable to them gives the plaintiff a fight to relief against the defendant. It must include some act done by t he defendant since in the absence of such an act no cause of action can possibly accrue. It is not limited to the actual infringement of the fight sued on but includes all t he material facts on which it is founded. It does not comprise evidence necessary to prove such facts, but every fa ct necessary for the plaintiff to prove to enable him to obtain [2024:RJ-JD:12253] (26 of 30) [CW-2222/2024] a decree. Everything which if not proved would give t he defendant a fight to immediate judgment must be part of t he cause of action. But it has no relation whatever to the defence which may be set up by the defendant nor does it depend upon the character of the relief prayed for by t he plaintiff.\" \n21. This Court finds that in the case of ITC Ltd. vs. Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal : (1998) 2 SCC 70, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that the basic question to be decided while dealing with an application filed under Order VII Rule 11 CPC is whether a real cause of action has been set out in the plaint or something purely illusory has been stated with a view to get out of Order VII Rule 11 of CPC.\n22. This Court finds that in another case of Madanuri Sri Rama Chandra Murthy v. Syed Jalal : (2017) 13 SCC 174, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that if on an entire and meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious and merit less in the sense of not disclosing any right to sue, the court should exercise power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. The relevant paragraph of the said judgment reads as under:\n\"7. The plaint can be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 if conditions enumerated in the said provision are fulfilled. It is needless to observe that the power under Order VII Rule 11, CPC can be exercised by the Court at any stage of the suit. The relevant facts which need to be looked into for deciding the application are the averments of the plaint only. If on an entire and meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious and meritless in the sense of not disclosing any right to sue, the court should exercise power under Order VII Rule 11, CPC. Since the power conferred on the Court to terminate civil action at the threshold is drastic, the conditions enumerated under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC to the exercise of power of rejection of plaint have to be strictly adhered to. The averments of the plaint have to be read as a whole to find out whether the averments disclose a cause of action or whether the suit is barred by any law. It is needless to observe that the question as to whether the suit is barred by any law, would always depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. \n[2024:RJ-JD:12253] (27 of 30) [CW-2222/2024] The averments in the written statement as well as the contentions of the defendant are wholly immaterial while considering the prayer of the defendant for rejection of the plaint. Even when, the allegations made in the plaint are taken to be correct as a whole on their face value, if they show that the suit is barred by any law, or do not disclose cause of action, the application for rejection of plaint can be entertained and the power under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC can be exercised. If clever drafting of the plaint has created the illusion of a cause of action, the court will nip it in the bud at the earliest so that bogus litigation will end at the earlier stage.\" \n23. In a recent judgment in Rajendra Bijoria & Ors. v. Hemant Kumar Jalan & Anr. : (2022) 12 SCC 641, the Hon'ble Apex Court while elucidating on the underline object of Order VII Rule 11 CPC held as under:\n\"20. It could thus be seen that this Court has held that the power conferred on the court to terminate a civil action is a drastic one, and the conditions enumerated under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC are required to be strictly adhered to. However, under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC, the duty is cast upon the court to determine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action, by scrutinizing the averments in the plaint, read in conjunction with the documents relied upon, or whether the suit is barred by any law. This Court has held that the underlying object of Order VII Rule 11 of CPC is that when a plaint does not disclose a cause of action, the court would not permit the plaintiff to unnecessarily protract the proceedings. It has been held that in such a case, it will be necessary to put an end to the sham litigation so that further judicial time is not wasted.\"\n24. A bare perusal of the pleadings of the plaint would reveal that the respondent/plaintiff has very specifically mentioned in the plaint that the goods were sold through the petitioner/defendant, who is in fact a commission agent/broker to various traders, however, the sale consideration was not paid to the plaintiff. It is seen from the pleadings of the plaint that the respondent/plaintiff has mentioned the date of transaction as well as the name of the traders and the amount due from the petitioner/defendant for such transactions. The pleadings of the plaint further states that [2024:RJ-JD:12253] (28 of 30) [CW-2222/2024] the total amount outstanding to the defendant is Rs.12,27,977/- alongwith interest total Rs.17,86,774/- as also the period during which the transactions took place between the petitioner/defendant and the respondent/plaintiff i.e. from 01.04.2017 to 02.11.2017. The respondent/plaintiff in the plaint has also contended that for recovering the amount from the petitioner/defendant, a legal notice dated 18.02.2019 was also served upon the defendant and copy of said legal notice and postal AD receipt have also been exhibited. The relevant paragraphs No.5, 6 and 7 of the suit filed by the respondent- plaintiff are reproduced hereinbelow:-\n\"5. ; g gS fd izfroknhx.k } kjk fofHkUu O;kikfjs;ksa dks nh xbZ fdjk.kk lkeku dh jkf\"k izfroknhx.k ds }kjk oknh QeZ dks nh tkrh Fkh] ijUrq uhps fuEu of.kZr O;kikfj;ksa ls izfroknhx.k us lkeku ds isVs jkf\"k izkIr dhA ijUrq oknh QeZ dks vnk ugha dh xbZ] tks fuEu izdkj gS %& -la- fnukad O;kikfj;ksa dk uke :i;s@jkf'k 1- 18-03-2017 Jh gfjflag lksuk.kk 5803@& 2- 18-03-2017 oS'.ko fdjk.kk LVksj 275@& 3- 18-03-2017 pkjHkqtk fdjk.kk LVksj 2]171@& lkjaxokl 4- 20-03-2017 lksuk.kk [ksrykth 27]560@& Hkkstu'kkyk 5- 20-03-2017 [ksrykth fdjk.kk LVksj 11]575@& twuk 6- 20-03-2017 pkjHkqtk fdjk.kk LVksj 17]00@& dwjuk 7- 20-03-2017 _frd fdjk.kk LVksj 2300@& lknM+k 8- 27-07-2017 oS'.ko fdjk.kk LVksj vkuk 5]892@& 9- 27-03-2017 Ckcwyky Hkknztwu 5]892@& 10- 27-03-2017 gfjvkse gksVy nslwjh 35]00@& 11- 27-03-2017 v'kksd fdjk.kk LVksj 1]080@& lsokM+h 12- 27-03-2017 pqUuhyky nslwjh 850@& fnukad 01-04-2017 ls fnukad 02-11-2017, rd dqy :i;s 12]27]977@& [2024:RJ-JD:12253] (29 of 30) [CW-2222/2024] \n6. ;g gS fd mDr lkeku izfroknhx.k } kjk oknh QeZ ls [kjhnk x;k rFkk fnukad 01-07-2017 ls 02-11-2017 rd izfroknhx.k ds }kjk o vU; O;kikfj;ksa ds fy;s :i;s 12]27]977@& v{kjs ckjg yk[k lRrkbZl gtkj ukS lkS lRrrj :i;s ek= dk fdjk.kk lkeku izfroknhx.k }kjk [kjhndj x;k rFkk izfroknhx.k }kjk fofHkUu O;kikfj;ksa dks Hkstkx;kA izfroknhx.k czksdj dk dk;Z djrs gq;s oknh QeZ ls le;&le; ij fofHkUu O;kikfj;ksa dks fHktokus ds fy;s m/kkj esa fdjk.kk dk lkeku oknh QeZ ls [kjhns x;s ijUrq mDr lkeku dh jkf'k izfroknhx.k }kjk oknh QeZ dks ugha pqdkbZ xbZ gSA izfroknhx.k ls oknh QeZ dk dqy cdk;k jkf'k 12]96]755@& v{kjs ckjg yk[k Nh;kuos gtkj lkr lkS ipiu :i;s ek= curh gSA 7. ; g gS fd izfroknhx.k ls oknh QeZ }kjk ckj&ckj fuosnu djus ij Hkh izfroknh us m/kkj fy;s fdjk.kk lkeku dh jkf\"k dk Hkqxrku ugh fd;k] ftlls O;fFkr gksdj oknh QeZ us tfj;s vf/koDrk fof/kd uksfVl izfroknhx.k dks fnukad 18-02-2019 dks Hkstk o tokc gsrq 15 fnu dk izfroknhx.k dks le; fn;k x;k fdarq izfroknhx.k ds }kjk fof/kd uksfVl izkIr djus ds ckotqn Hkh dksbZ tokc ugha x;k ;uk gh oknh ls laidZ fd;k x;kA fof/kd uksfVl ,oa izkfIr fjiksVZ e; ,-Mh- okn ds lkFk layXu gSA\" \n25 . The submission of the learned counsel for the respondent that the present writ petition is not maintainable before this Court, is not sustainable, as the Coordinate Bench of this Court in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.920/2019 : Rajasthan State Mines and Minerals Ltd. v. Ankur Minmine Product Pvt. Ltd. decided on 07.03.2019 has held that writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is maintainable, even against an interlocutory order passed by the commercial court irrespective of what has been contained in Section 8 of the Act of 2015, albeit with self imposed restrictions and restraints imposed by the Courts in light of various judicial pronouncements. \n26. This Court upon perusal of the plaint finds that the respondent/plaintiff has indeed made out a cause of action for filing the suit. The main thrust of the application seeking rejection of the plaint is that the plaintiff does not disclose the cause of action, which has been negated by the learned commercial court and rightly so. The plaintiff has sought a specific relief of the amount due on account of business transaction between the two [2024:RJ-JD:12253] (30 of 30) [CW-2222/2024] i.e. plaintiff and the defendant. In such circumstances, the suit filed by the respondent/plaintiff cannot be said to be lacking cause of action. It is important to note that the plaint filed by the respondent/plaintiff cannot be read in isolation as the averments made in the plaint have to be read in entirety as held by Hon'ble Apex Court in catena of judgments that disclosure of cause of action is nothing but a bundle of facts. Thus, upon bare reading of the plaint it is writ large that the respondent has been able to make out a cause of action in the plaint filed by it. \n27. Thus, in the considered opinion of this Court, no interference is made out in the judgment dated 11.08.2021 passed by the Commercial Court No.1 Jodhpur. The writ petition lacks merits and, therefore, the same is hereby dismissed. Stay application as well as all other pending applications, if any, also stand dismissed. \n(DR.

-----------------------------------------------------------------s.k. mishra, j. 1. the petitioner company has preferred the writ petition challenging the order dated 30.04.2024 passed by the senior civil judge (commercial court), cuttack in arbp no.14 of 2024, vide which the court below rejected its application under order 39 rule 3 read with section 151 of the code of civil procedure, 1908, shortly, \"the cpc\", moved in a section 9 application filed under the arbitration and conciliation act,1996, shortly, \"the act,1996\", to grant ex-parte ad interim injunction with an observation that, an order cannot be passed without hearing the opposite parties and accordingly, ordered for issuance of notice to the opposite parties fixing the date to 25.06.2024 for appearance. 2. while issuing notice to the opposite parties, this court, vide order dated 13.05.2024, as an interim measure, passed an order to maintain status quo as on the said date till the next date with regard to invocation of bank guarantee. paragraph 3 of the order dated 13.05.2024 passed in i.a. no.6416 of 2024, being relevant, is reproduced below for ready reference. \"taking into consideration the ratio decided by the apex court in (2022) 1 scc 712 (arcelor mittal nippon steel india limited vs. essar bulk terminal limited), (2016) 11 scc 720 (gangotri enterprises limited vs. union of india and others) & (2012) 5 scc 370 (maria margarida sequeira fernandes & others vs. erasmo jack de sequeira (dead) so also after going through the pleadings made in the writ petition and documents appended thereto, as an interim measure, it is ordered to maintain the status quo as on date with regard to encashment of bank guarantee no.32700igl0001122, which is valid till 05.09.2024, till the next date.\" 3. though it was ordered to list the matter in the week commencing from 17.06.2024, the present opposite parties appeared suo motu. instead of filing counter, dealing with the specific allegations made in the writ petition so also documents appended there to, i.a. no.6777 of 2024 has been filed for vacation of the aforesaid interim order. on being moved showing urgency, the matter was listed for orders and a short adjournment being granted, the petitioner also filed its objection to i.a. no.6777 of 2024 opposing to the prayer for vacation of stay. however, on consent of the learned senior counsel for the parties, the writ petition along with all i.as. were taken up together for hearing and final disposal. 4. the factual matrix(as pleaded in the writ petition), which led to filing of the writ petition, is that work order dated 24.01.2022 was issued in favour of the petitioner by the opposite party no.2 for construction of 400 flats at jindal nagar, south block (sharmik vihar) at jindal steel & power limited, shortly hereinafter \"jspl\". the total amount of the agreement value was rs.4,39,946,924.13. to execute the said work, the opposite party no.2 (jspl) had given an advance of 8.5% of the contract price amounting to rs. 3,73,95,490/and to secure the same, the petitioner executed bank guarantee (b.g.) in favour of jspl, drawn in opposite party nos.3 and 4 bank for the said amount. the contract dated 24.01.2022 is a reciprocal one without which it cannot be performed by the petitioner. as per the said contract, the petitioner was to complete the work within 8 months from the date of contract. but due to non-fulfillment of the reciprocal promises by jspl in time, the work could not be executed as per the programme. there are provisions in the contract that the management of jspl is to supply free materials in time. however, due to delay in supply of materials, there was massive impact on the work. further though the petitioner, as per the work executed, submitted running bills, the same were not released in time which resulted in suffering from cash inflow and delay in work. the management of jspl, without any notice to the petitioner, reduced the scope of work by 30-40 since march, 2023. it also did not provide sufficient hutment and facilities for the workers as per terms of the contract in terms of the requirement of the petitioner, for which the work could not run in full swing. due to non-fulfillment of reciprocal promises made by the jspl, by various letters, the petitioner drew attention of jspl in between 22.08.2022 to 20.02.2024 indicating therein as to not handing over a hindrance free site for excavation, non-payment of the deviation quantity of excavation, rock strata found during excavation, nonpayment of deviation quantity of excavation (not estimated at the time of contract allocation) leading to increase in cost and time, continuous delays in providing free issue materials i.e. backfill material, tmt bars, concrete, structural materials, ps panel, l-mesh, u-mesh, sand, cement, paint etc. labour hutment, free electricity and water. further there was various revision and rectification of drawings, delay in payment and non reconciliation of accounts and detail deduction sheets. further the gst payment as per the contract was not released and unilaterally the work was reduced without any intimation or discussion, for which the petitioner had deployed machinery, equipment, material and manpower. despite intimation of such hindrances, the opp. party has not solved any problem and huge outstanding bill has not been released, for which the petitioner suffered financial crisis. it is further case of the petitioner that without clearing the hindrances, as pointed out by the petitioner, the opposite party no.2 (associate vice president, commercial, jspl) vide letter dated 07.07.2023, issued notice to the petitioner company for revision in quantity / termination of contract due to alleged poor performance in the construction work. on receipt of the said letter dated 07.07.2023, the petitioner, vide letter dated 26.07.2023, wrote to the opposite party no.2 that while extension of time has been approved and there is a copy of note sheet reflecting the reason of delay, which is approved by the petitioner. the petitioner vide letter dated 11.08.2023, requested the manager-contract cell, jspl for urgent action for critical material shortage threatening project timeline and considering the situation to take immediate intervention to expedite the resolution of the matter. however, in violation of terms of the contract from the side of the management of jspl, vide letter dated 25.03.2024, the authorized signatory of the management of jspl communicated to the petitioner that as per the books of account, there is a debit balance of rs.4,12,54,904/towards unadjusted advance and other deductions and it was observed that the petitioner is not responding to the directions of the civil department of the company, which is allegedly impacting the site progress and such conduct of the petitioner is against the terms of the work order dated 24.01.2022 and advance against the petitioner is pending since 18.09.2023. if the payment is not received on or before 30.04.2024, the management of jspl will go for encashment of the b.g of rs.3,73,95,490/vide b.g. dated 08.03.2022, executed by the petitioner. in response to the letter dated 25.03.2024, reiterating its stand in reminder letter dated 22.08.2022, a reply was given by the petitioner to the opposite party no.2 vide letter dated 19.04.2024, indicating therein that as the petitioner has not violated the terms of contract, such communication dated 25.03.2024 is illegal. however, being aggrieved by the action of the opposite parties, the petitioner preferred arbitration petition under section 9 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, shortly hereinafter \"the act, 1996\", before the senior civil judge (commercial court), cuttack, along with petitions under order 39 rules 1 and 2 and order 39 rule 3 of the cpc for granting exparte injunction, prohibiting the opposite parties not to encash the b.g. pursuant to the letter dated 25.03.2024. the said petition was taken up for hearing by the commercial court on 30.04.2024. on the very day, the court below rejected the petition of the petitioner company for ex parte injunction and ordered to issue notice to the opposite parties. 5. as detailed above, knowing about filing of the writ petition and passing of the interim order dated 13.05.2024 in i.a. no.6416 of 2024, the opposite parties filed i.a. no.6777 of 2024 for vacation of the interim order on the ground that in view of the judgment of this court reported in air 2016 orissa 103 (m/s sai concrete pavers pvt. ltd., visakhapatnam vs. national aluminium company ltd., koraput), the writ petition is not maintainable. further, in view of the statutory bar under the commercial courts act, 2015, the status quo order dated 13.05.2024 is liable to be vacated. a further stand has been taken in the i.a. that in the matter of invocation of b.g., the courts can only interfere in exceptional circumstances. the opposite partycompany being severely prejudiced due to non-refund of the debit balance totaling to rs.4,12,54,904/by the petitioner, status quo order dated 13.05.2024 needs to be vacated. apart from dealing with the judgments referred to in the order dated 13.05.2024 cited by the petitioner, it has also been stated in the i.a. that order 39 rules 1, 2 and 3 of the cpc is not applicable to proceeding under section 9 of the act, 1996. if such an application is filed, the same can only be considered to be an application under section 9 of the act, 1996 and any order passed in a section 9 proceeding is appealable under section 37(1) (b) of the act, 1996. hence, the writ jurisdiction cannot be invoked to circumvent the procedure under the act, 1996. a stand has also been taken in the i.a. that interpretation and implementation of clause in a contract cannot be the subject matter of a writ petition, since the petitioner has already approached the commercial court by way of an application under section 9 of the act, 1996 and thus, intended to have the issues decided by an arbitral tribunal. a further stand has also been taken in the i.a. for vacation of stay on the ground that the clause 58 of the contract/work order dated 24.01.2022 between the parties provides for arbitration in respect of all disputes and differences of any kind, arising out of or in connection with the contract, whether during the progress of work or after its completion, and whether before or after the termination of contract. it has also been stated in the i.a. that in view of the bar under sections 8 and 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, the writ petition assailing an order passed by the commercial court rejecting an application under order 39, rule 3 of c.p.c. is not maintainable. 6. in response to the said i.a. filed by the opposite parties for vacation of stay so also regarding maintainability of the writ petition, the petitioner has filed an objection stating therein that the judgment of this court cited by the opposite party nos. 1 and 2 is not applicable to the present case, as in the said case it was decided that an appeal under order 43, rule 1(r) of the cpc, out of an order passed in an application under section 9 of the act, 1996, is not maintainable. in the instant case, the petitioner has approached this court under article 227 of the constitution of india to exercise its superintendence power against the order passed by the commercial court under order 39, rule 3 of the cpc. apart from the said stand, it has also been stated that since the b.g. executed by the petitioner is valid till 05.09.2024, the opposite party nos. 1 and 2 will no way be prejudiced as the petitioner is to get huge amount of pending bills along with other amounts from the opposite party. it has also been stated in the objection that in view of specific allegations, as detailed in paragraph 18 of the writ petition, the opposite party nos. 1 & 2 issued letter dated 25.03.2024 through their authorized signatory stating therein that as per the books of account, there is a debit balance of rs.4,12,54,904/towards unadjusted advance and other deductions. if the payment is not received before 30.04.2024, the opposite parties will go for encashment of the b.g. of rs.3,73,95,490/vide bg dated 08.03.2022 and the said letter is illegal as the petitioner is entitled to more amount from the opposite parties. a stand has also been taken in the objection that vide letter dated 11.05.2024, addressed to the opposite parties, the petitioner has requested to release all pending bills and issue gate pass for removal of machinery, shuttering materials and other unused building materials, such as tiles, plumbing items etc. so also requested to withdraw the claim of invocation of b.g. and release all outstanding payments and dues. a further stand has been taken in the objection that the contract executed between the parties requires reciprocal promise in which the opposite parties failed to discharge their obligations. the petitioner, vide various letters, including letter dated 26.07.2023, intimated the opposite parties regarding nonperformance of their contractual obligations. the petitioner, vide communication dated 26.06.2023, intimated the opposite parties regarding their failure to supply free material in time and also proposed to conduct a joint meeting to sort out the issues and prepare collective plan. however, the opposite parties have shown no interest, as proposed by the petitioner. it has also been stated in the objection that as per the condition of contract, electricity and water supply must be provided by the owner (opposite party) at one point free of cost to the contractor. the petitioner, vide letter dated 24.02.2022 and 30.03.2022, pointed out that it did not receive the same properly at the beginning. in fact, almost for a month or two, the petitioner was told that it must take the same from other contractor namely, spd, and the same would not be provided to the petitioner by the opposite parties, which resulted in a huge hindrance to start the work. it has also been alleged in the objection that the petitioner has not received all the drawings as on 26.07.2023 from the management of jspl, which in fact, is one of the reasons for extension that has been applied and approved by the opposite parties. further, there have been several revisions in drawing which also affected the progress of work. it has also been alleged in the objection that the opposite party nos.1 and 2 did not intend to pay the bills of the petitioner and have incorrectly taken measurements to reduce the quantity of work completed and consequently, undervalued the bills. also, the opposite parties have not released previously withheld quantities nor finalized the deviation items, for which payment is due. it has also been alleged that the opposite party nos. 1 and 2 are refusing to allow the petitioner to remove its machineries and materials from the site, which may have criminal conspiracy to exploit the petitioner's survival without payment. a stand has also been taken in the objection that the issues regarding pending bills, deviation from the original scope, withheld amounts, claims for delay in supply of materials and idling of machinery, manpower, interest and overhead, have been pending since long and the opposite party nos. 1 and 2 did not address these issues nor deputed any person for reconciliation or meeting, despite repeated reminders and letters given by the petitioner. further, the contract being a reciprocal one, due to non-fulfillment of the reciprocal promise by the opposite party nos. 1 and 2 in time, the work could not be executed as per the programme. further, the opposite party nos. 1 and 2 arbitrarily stopped issuing gate pass from september, 2023 to february, 2024 for which the personnel of the petitioner could not enter the premises and thereby work was stopped and it suffered loss of huge amount of money and the petitioner is entitled to running bills and other cost and damage to the tune of near about rs.20 crores from the opposite party nos. 1 and 2. it has also been stated in the objection that it is stand of the opposite party nos. 1 and 2 that vide letter dated 07.07.2023 it issued notice for revision in quantity / termination of contract due to poor performance in the construction work. it is well evident from the documents appended to the i.a. that the opposite party nos. 1 and 2 prepared minutes dated 30.04.2024 in which 30 days' time was allowed to the petitioner to rectify the defects. on the other hand, before expiry of 30 days, vide letter dated 07.05.2024 under annexure-h to the i.a., the opposite party no.2 issued letter to the bank for encashment of b.g., which shows that the opposite party no.2 has acted in a very unfair and mala fide manner. the prayer to vacate the interim order has also been opposed to on the ground that the petitioner has huge outstanding against the opposite party and though it has submitted the r/a bills to the opposite parties, the same are yet to be cleared. further, it has been averred that reconciliation of account would be sufficient to establish that allegation of refund towards unadjusted advance of rs.3,12,64,904/is incorrect whereas, the b.g. amount is rs.3,73,95,490/-. as such, without reconciliation of the bills of the petitioner, the letter dated 25.03.2024 for encashment of b.g. is illegal and arbitrary. a stand has also been taken in the objection that the judgments cited by the petitioner seeking for interim relief are applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case and as per the letter dated 29.11.2023 submitted by the petitioner, as at annexure-9 of the writ petition, the payment due against the opposite parties is for an amount of rs.514.01 lakhs. the opposite parties, without paying the same, arbitrarily issued letter dated 25.03.2024. after receiving the letter dated 25.03.2024, the petitioner issued a letter dated 19.04.2024 under annexure-11. apart from that, the petitioner has already invoked the arbitration clause and nominated hon'ble justice b.n. rath (former judge of this court) as its arbitrator, but the opposite parties have not yet responded to the same. it has also been stated in the objection that there is no clear bar in the arbitration act as well as in commercial courts act not to exercise the power under article 227 of the constitution of india. rather, in exceptional circumstances, when the action of a party is completely perverse and acted in bad faith, the interference of the writ court is permissible. a stand has also been taken in the objection that if the encashment of bg is not stayed, it will cause irretrievable injustice to the petitioner as the letter dated 07.05.2024 to encash the b.g. was only issued after notice was issued to the opposite parties by the commercial court pursuant to the impugned order dated 30.04.2024. thus, the action of the opposite parties is not fair and mala fide. accordingly, it has been stated that the prayer of the opposite parties to vacate the interim order passed by this court is liable to be rejected. 7. to substantiate the stand taken in the application for vacation of stay, mr. mukherjee, learned senior counsel for the opposite parties, relying on the judgment in perin hoshang davierwalla vs. kobad dorabji davierwalla, reported in 2014 scc online bombay 534 and in deepak mittal vs. geeta sharma, reported in 2017 scc online del 10365, submitted that an order making or rejecting an application for ex parte ad-interim injunction is essentially an order under section 9 of the act, 1996 only and not otherwise. mr. mukherjee further submitted that the scope and ambit of the act, 1996 does not empower the commercial court to entertain any application beyond the scope of the act, 1996 be it an application under order 39 rules-1 and 2 or 3, cpc. even if such an application is filed, the same can only be considered to be an application under section 9 of the act, 1996. mr. mukherjee further submitted that in view of the specific provisions under section 37 (1)(b) of the act, 1996, any order passed in a section 9 application, including interlocutory order, is an appealable order under the said provision. hence, as there is a specific alternative remedy of appeal against the interlocutory order passed in a section 9 proceeding, the writ petition is not maintainable. to substantiate such submission the following judgments were cited:mr. mukherjee, learned senior counsel, relying on the judgment of the apex court in gujarat maritime board vs. l & t infrastructure development projects ltd. and others, reported in (2016) 10 scc 46, submitted that the scope of interference with regard to encashment of b.g. is very limited and the court can only interfere with regard to encashment of b.g., where allowing encashment of an unconditional b.g. or a letter of credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned or in case of fraud of an egregious nature, which would vitiate the very foundation of such b.g. or letter of credit and the beneficiary seeks to take advantage of such situation. mr. mukherjee, learned senior counsel further submitted that whether the cancellation of contract is legal and proper, and whether on such cancellation, the b.g. could have been invoked on the extreme situation of the party justifying its inability to perform its obligations under the contract, etc. are not within the purview of an inquiry under article 227 of the constitution of india. between the bank and the opposite parties, the moment there is a written demand for invoking the b.g., pursuant to breach of the covenants between the parties is satisfied, the bank is bound to honour payment under the guarantee. it was also submitted by the learned senior counsel that the writ petition is not maintainable and the court below was justified to reject the petition to pass an ad interim ex parte injunction before hearing the opposite party and since the section 9 application is pending before the court below, at this juncture, the writ petition is not maintainable. to substantiate the said submission, the following judgments were cited: i) national highway authority of india vs. ganga enterprises and others, reported in (2003) 7 scc ii) adani agri fresh ltd. vs. mahaboob sharif and others, reported in (2016) 14 scc 517. iii) andhra pradesh pollution control board vs. ccl products (india) ltd., reported in (2019) 20 scc iv) trafalgar house construction (t) satyam shankaranarayana (jv) vs. state of orissa and others, reported in 2007 (suppl. 2) olr 822 : clt (2007) supp 394. v) deep industries limited vs. oil and natural gas corporation limited and others, (2020) 15 scc vi) deepak mittal & another vs. geeta sharma & others, 2017 scc online del 10365, 8. in response to the submissions made by the learned senior counsel for the opposite parties, mr. mishra, learned senior counsel for the petitioner submitted that even if it is accepted that against an interim order passed in a section-9 proceeding alternative remedy is available under section 37 (1)(b) of the act, 1996 to prefer an appeal, the present writ petition under article 227 of the constitution of india is maintainable. mr. mishra, further submitted that the petitioner preferred the writ petition in view of lack of clarity under section 37(1)(b) of the act, 1996 that even interlocutory orders passed by the commercial court in a section-9 application are also appealable and under such bonafide impression that only final order granting or rejecting an application under section-9 is appealable, being remediless, the petitioner has preferred the present writ petition. to substantiate such submission mr. mishra cited the following judgments:i) santosh kumar acharya vs. ratnakar swain, reported in 2023 scc online orissa 2301 ii) odisha state road transport corporation, bhubaneswar vs. arss bus terminal pvt. ltd., bhubaneswar, reported in 2023 (i) ilr-cut-253 iii) bhaven construction through authorized signatory premjibhai k. shah vs. executive engineer, sardar sarovar narmada nigam limited and another, reported in (2022) 1 scc 75. iv) baburam prakash chandra maheshwari vs. antarim zila parishad now zila parishad, muzaffarnagar, reported in air 1969 sc 556 mr. mishra, learned senior counsel for the petitioner, relying on the judgment of the supreme court in arcelor mittal nippon steel india ltd. vs. essar bulk terminal ltd., reported in (2022) 1 scc 712, submitted that applications for interim relief are inherent applications, which are required to be disposed of urgently. interim relief is granted in aid of final relief. the object is to ensure protection of the property being the subject matter of arbitration and/or otherwise to ensure that the arbitration proceedings do not become infructuous and the arbitral award does not become an award on paper, of no real value. similarly, relying on the judgment of the supreme court in gangotri enterprises ltd. vs. union of india and others, reported in (2016) 11 scc 720, mr. mishra, learned senior counsel submitted that the opposite parties are now claiming alleged unadjusted amount given to the petitioner as advance to carry out the contractual job so also penalty, which is yet to be adjudicated upon in an arbitral proceeding and the petitioner's running bills and other demands are yet to be honoured by the opposite parties. hence, the petitioner has made out a prima facie case in its favour for grant of injunction against the opposite parties not to invoke the b.g. relying on the judgment of the supreme court in union of india and another vs. millenium delhi broadcast llp and others reported in (2022) 7 scc 67, mr. mishra, learned senior counsel submitted that the b.g. given by the petitioner was executed as security against the advance given by the opposite party-company and is not a performance b.g. hence, the alleged unadjusted advance needs computation. unless and until the claim made by the petitioner is decided by the arbitral tribunal, the opposite parties will not be justified to encash the b.g. relying on the judgment of the supreme court in maria margarida sequeira fernandes and others vs. erasmo jack de sequeira (dead) through l.rs. reported in (2012) 5 scc 370, mr. mishra, learned senior counsel further submitted that unless the petitioner is protected, so far as invocation of b.g., it will cause irretrievable injustice to the petitioner, as huge amount in crores are laying unpaid at the end of the opposite party company despite repeated demands made by the petitioner to make the payment. if the opposite parties are permitted to encash the b.g., which is valid till 05.09.2024, there will be a great set back to the petitioner company affecting its financial condition, which may lead to irretrievable harm and injustice to the petitioner company, as the conduct of the opposite parties have weakened the financial condition of his client. mr. mishra further submitted that the pleadings made in the present writ petition and the documents annexed hereto to substantiate the said stand are same as in arbp no.14 of 2024.the court below failed to take note of the pleadings and contents of the documents appended to the section 9 application. 9. upon hearing the learned counsel for the parties and after going through the record so also case laws cited by the learned senior counsel for the parties, the following points emerge for consideration. (i) whether an interlocutory order passed by the commercial court in a section 9 application under the arbitration & conciliation act, 1996, rejecting the prayer of the petitioner for exemption of notice to the opposite party and pass an ad interim ex parte injunction, is appealable under section 37(1) (b) of the said act, 1996 so also section 13 of the c.c. act, 2015? (ii) if not what is the remedy available to an aggrieved party to challenge the said interlocutory order? (iii) whether the commercial court was justified to reject the application filed under order 39, rule 3 of the code of civil procedure in the section 9 application? (iv) whether injunction against invocation of unconditional bank guarantee is permissible? if so, when and under what circumstances? 10. so far as point nos.i) & ii), the same being interrelated, are dealt with and answered together. before dealing with the said points, it would be apt to extract below sections 8 and 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, order 43 rule 1(r) of c.p.c and sections 9 and 37 of the act, 1996 for ready reference: commercial courts act, 2015 \"section-8. bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order.-notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the commercial court. section-13. appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions.--(1) 1[any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court below the level of a district judge may appeal to the commercial appellate court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order.

(3) no second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or take away any right to appeal to the supreme court.\" (emphasis supplied) from the provisions under section 9 of the act, 1996, it is amply clear that the party may, before or during arbitration proceedings or at any time after making of the arbitral award, but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36 of the act, 1996, can apply to a court for the purpose, as detailed under the said provision. 11. though the high court of gouhati in sati oil udyog ltd. vs.

commercial court in a section 9 application, during pendency of the said application. 12. so far as judgment of this court in m/s. sai concrete pavers pvt. ltd.(supra) , cited by the learned senior counsel for the opposite parties, the issue before the coordinate bench was as to whether separate applications under order 39 rule 1 & 2 so also rule 3 of cpc are required to be filed in application moved under section 9 of the act,1996 and if an application moved before the court under order 39 rule 3 of cpc seeking for an ad interim ex parte injunction stands rejected, is the said order appealable under order 43 rule-1(r) c.p.c.? paragraphs 5 to 8, 11 and 12 of the said judgment, being relevant, are extracted below: \"5. mr. rao, learned counsel for the appellant placing reliance upon paragraph-11 of the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of a. venkatasubbiah naidu v. s. chellappan, reported in air 2000 sc 3032 contended that order passed either refusing or granting an application under rule-3 of order 39, cpc is appealable one. mr. rao further submits that there are two provisions under the act, namely, section-9 and section 17 of the act, which enable either the court or the arbitrator to pass interim orders or make an interim arrangement. section 9 of the act empowers the court to pass interim orders or make interim arrangement in contemplation of an arbitral proceeding. though the provisions of section 9 of the act deals with entertaining an application for interim measure it does not make any provision as to how the interest of the aggrieved party is to be protected before the petition under section 9 of the act is taken up on merit. thus, the application filed for injunction can only be entertained under the provisions of order 39 rules 1 and 2, cpc and not otherwise. thus, the appeal against the said order is maintainable before this court. 6. right of appeal is not inherent one. it is a creature of the statute, and should be considered on interpretation of the relevant provision. thus, it is to be examined as to whether the appellant has a statutory right to prefer an appeal against rejection of an application under order 39 rule-3, cpc. on a plain reading of section 104 as well as order 43 rule-1, cpc, which provides an appeal against order does not include an order of rejection of an application under order 39 rule-3, cpc. 7. law is no more res integra on this issue. this court in a decision in the case of sri. rabindra kumar mohanty v. smt. sujata mohapatra (fao no. 86 of 2012 disposed of on 10.07.2015) relying upon a. venkatasubbiah naidu (supra) as well as decisions reported in 1989 (ii) olr 455 and air 1993 (orissa) 78 held as under : \"6. in view of the discussion made above and the law laid down (supra), i have no hesitation to hold that an appeal is maintainable as against an ex parte ad interim order of injunction as provided under order xliii rule (1)(r) c.p.c., but not against the order refusing to exercise power under order 39 rule 3 c.p.c.\" 8. thus, it can be unhesitatingly held that no appeal lies against an order rejecting an application under order 39 rule-3, cpc\". xxx xxx xxx 11. section 9(1)(ii)(d) of the act empowers the court, namely, the district judge to make any interim arrangement including that of injunction or appointment of receiver. the language employed in section 9 of the act, more particularly the words \"and the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it\" makes it clear that the court shall have the same power to make any order in any proceedings under section 9 of the act. thus, an order making or rejecting an application for ad-interim injunction is essentially an order under section 9 of the act only and not otherwise. further, the scope and ambit of the act does not empower the district judge to entertain any application beyond the scope of this act, be it an application under order 39 rules-1 and 2 or 3, cpc. even if such an application is filed the same can only be considered to be an application under the provisions of section 9 of the act. 12. learned counsel for the parties made arguments at length on merits of the case relying upon different case laws of the hon'ble supreme court. this court does not feel it prudent to delve into the merit of the case at this stage which can be effectively gone into at the time of hearing of the petition under section 9 of the act. thus, in view of the discussions made above, this court holds that the appeal under order 43 rule-1(r), cpc is not maintainable and the same is accordingly dismissed.\" (emphasis supplied) 13. from the discussions made above, legal provisions enshrined under the relevant acts and c.p.c., as extracted above, so also judgments of various high courts for and against the point regarding maintainability of an appeal under section 37 (1)(b) of the act,1996, this court is in respectful agreement with the views taken by various high courts to the effect that interlocutory order passed by the court, refusing to entertain an application under order 39, rule 3 of c.p.c. to pass an ad interim exparte injunction order in a section 9 application filed under the act,1996 is not appealable. however, the reasons to agree with the said views are slightly different, as detailed below: i) as per the settled position of law, it is to be presumed that while enacting the subsequent law i.e. c.c. act, 2015, the legislature is conscious of the provisions of the act, 1996 prior in time and therefore, the later act shall prevail. ii) as provided under section 21 of the c.c. act, 2015, the said act shall have overriding effect. it provides that, save as otherwise provided, the provisions of the said act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force. iii) as held by the supreme court in kandala export corporation & another vs. m/s oci corporation & another, reported in (2018) 14 scc 715, both the act, 1996 and c.c. act, 2015 call for a harmonious interpretation. if at all there is any conflict, as to the substantive provisions, the act, 1996 prevails; but it has left the procedural niceties to the c.c. act, 2015. iv) section 8 of the commercial courts act, 2015 provides, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, \"subject to the provisions of section 13\", shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the commercial court. (emphasis supplied) v) proviso under section 13 of the c.c. act, 2015 mandates that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court, that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of c.p.c. and section 37 of the act, 1996. vi) in view of the proviso under section 13 of the c.c. act, 2015, read with order 43 rule 1(r) c.p.c., orders passed by the court, exercising power under order 39 rules 1, 2, 4 & 10, are appealable. vii) order 39 rule 3 of c.p.c. mandates, the court shall in all cases, except where it appears that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay, before granting an injunction, direct notice of the application to the opposite party. however, if the court grants injunction before noticing the opposite party, it shall record the reasons for ordering so. (emphasis supplied) viii) there is no such provision of appeal under order 43 or section 104 of c.p.c, if the court declines to exercise its exceptional/special power under order 39, rule 3 c.p.c. (which would be subject to recording the reasons for ordering so) to exempt notice to the opposite party before passing an ad interim injunction under order 39 rules 1 & 2 of c.p.c. ix) in view of the provisions under order-43, rule 1(r) of c.p.c., an order passed in a section 9 application filed under the act, 1996, granting the injunction under order 39 rules 1 & 2 c.p.c. or refusing to vacate the order of injunction on filing application under order 39 rule 4 c.p.c. are appealable, but not an order declining to exempt notice to the opposite party before passing an ad interim injunction. x) as held by the coordinate bench in m/s. sai concrete pavers pvt. ltd. (supra), even if separate applications are filed under order 39 rule 1 & 2 or rule 3 c.p.c. in a section 9 proceeding, the same is to be considered as an application under section 9 of the act,1996. in addition to the said views of the coordinate bench, this court is of the view that such an interlocutory order of refusal to exempt notice to the opposite party before passing an ad interim injunction in a section 9 proceeding, being akin to rejection of prayer made in an application under order 39 rule 3 c.p.c., is not appealable, as held in the said case. xi) in view of the above, this court is of further view that interlocutory order passed in a section 9 application moved before the district judge/ commercial court under the act, 1996, rejecting the prayer of the applicant to exempt notice to the opposite party and pass an ex parte ad interim injunction is not an appealable order and the party aggrieved has to approach the writ court under article 227 of the constitution of india. both the point nos.i) & ii) are answered accordingly. 14. so far as point numbers iii) and iv), regarding justification to reject the application for exemption of notice to the opposite parties and scope of judicial interference as to granting injunction against invocation of an unconditional bank guarantee, the said points are dealt with together for the sake of clarity and being interconnected. 15. a bank guarantee is an independent and distinct contract between the bank and the beneficiary and is not qualified by the terms of the underlying transaction, or the primary contract between the person at whose instance the bank guarantee is given and the beneficiary. as held by the supreme court in hindustan steel works construction ltd. vs. tarapore & co reported in (1996) 5 scc 34), the nature of obligation of the bank is absolute, and not dependent upon the inter se disputes or proceedings. the bank is liable to pay as soon as the demand is made by the creditor as held in national thermal power corpn. ltd. vs. flowmore pvt. ltd, reported in (1995) 4 scc 515. 16. in himadri chemicals industries ltd. vs. coal tar refining co, reported in (2007) 8 scc 110, the supreme court has held that in the matter of invocation of a bank guarantee or of credit, a bank guarantee is an independent and a letter separate contract and is absolute in nature. the existence of disputes between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of a bank guarantee, or letter of credit. in the matter of invocation, it is not open to a bank to rely upon the terms of the underlying contract between the parties. the supreme court has enunciated the following principles in the matter of injunction for restraining encashment of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit:\"(i) while dealing with an application for injunction in the course of commercial dealings, and when an unconditional bank guarantee or letter of credit is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee or a letter of credit in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes relating to the terms of the contract. (ii) the bank giving such guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms, irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. (iii) the courts should be slow in granting an order of injunction to restrain the realization of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit. (iv) since a bank guarantee or a letter of credit is an independent and a separate contract and is absolute in nature, the existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of bank guarantee or letter of credit. (v) injunction against encashment may be granted if there is fraud of an egregious nature which would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee or letter of credit, and the beneficiary seeks to take advantage of the situation. (vi) allowing encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee or a letter of credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned.\" 17. the principle laid down in himadri chemicals industries ltd. (supra) was followed by the supreme court in the matter of vinitec electronics pvt. ltd. v. hcl info systems ltd, reported in (2008) 1 scc 544 , wherein it was held that in the case of an unconditional bank guarantee, the same are payable by the guarantor on demand. when in the course of commercial dealings, unconditional guarantees have been given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realise such a bank guarantee in terms thereof, irrespective of any pending disputes. the bank guarantee is an independent contract between the bank and the beneficiary thereof. for a party to claim that the case falls under the exception of fraud or special equities, proper pleadings must be made out which lay down the factual foundation of the allegation of fraud or special equities. 18. however, in nhai v. ganga enterprise, reported in air 2003 sc 3823 : (2003) 7 scc 410, the supreme court has held that a bank guarantee has to be strictly construed as per the terms of the guarantee. the invocation must be in accordance with the terms of the bank guarantee, and any deviation therefrom, would render the invocation bad in law. if the enforcement is in terms of the guarantee, the courts would normally refrain from interfering with the enforcement of the bank guarantee. interference would be justified if the invocation is contrary to the terms of the guarantee, or in the case of fraud. 19. a bank guarantee must be honoured strictly in accordance with the terms of the guarantee, subject to two exceptions. the first is in a clear case of fraud, which the bank has notice of, and the beneficiary seeks to take advantage of. 20. the supreme court in general electric technical jasp services company inc. v. m/s. punj sons (p) ltd. and another, reported in air 1991 sc 1994, held that by interim injunction under order 39 rule 1 of the cpc, bank guarantee cannot be interdicted by court in the absence of fraud or special equities in the form of preventing irretrievable injustice between the parties. it was further held that it is the fraud of beneficiary, not the fraud of somebody else. 21. in svenska handelsnbanken v. indian charge chrome, reported in (1994) 1 scc 502, the supreme court has held that fraud in connection with the bank guarantee would vitiate the very foundation of the bank guarantee. the fraud must be of an egregious nature such as to vitiate the entire underlying transaction. 22. as held by the supreme court in b.s.e.s. ltd. (now reliance energy ltd.) v. fenner india ltd., reported in (2006) 2 scc 728,the second exception to the general rule of nonintervention is if there are 'special equities' in favour of injunction, such as when 'irretrievable injury or 'irretrievable injustice' would occur if such an injunction was not granted. 23. the supreme court in andhra pradesh pollution control board , reported in (2019) 20 scc 669 , while taking note of its earlier decisions in the matters of ansal engg. projects ltd. v. tehri hydro development corpn. ltd., reported in (1996) 5 scc 450, sbi v. mula sahakari sakhar karkhana ltd., reported in (2006) 6 scc 293, and hindustan construction co. ltd. v. state of bihar, reported in (1999) 8 scc 436, held that in absence of a case of fraud, irretrievable injustice and special equities, the court should not interfere with the invocation or encashment of a bank guarantee so long as the invocation was in terms of the bank guarantee. 24. thereafter, in standard chartered bank , reported in (2020) 13 scc 574 the supreme court again noticed its earlier decision in himadri chemicals industries ltd.(supra) and held that bank guarantee is an independent contract between bank and the beneficiary and the bank is always obliged to honour its guarantee as long as it is unconditional and irrevocable one. it has been further held that the dispute between the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the bank has given the guarantee is immaterial and is of no consequence, however, exceptions to this rule are when there is a clear case of fraud, irretrievable injustice or special equities. it was also held that the court ordinarily should not interfere with the invocation or encashment of the bank guarantee so long as the invocation is in terms of the bank guarantee. it was held that once the demand was made in due compliance with bank guarantees, it was not open for the bank to determine as to whether the invocation of the bank guarantee was justified so long as the invocation was in terms of the bank guarantee. relevant paragraphs of the said judgment are reproduced below: \"19. the law relating to invocation of bank guarantees with the consistent line of precedents of this court is well settled and a three-judge bench of this court in ansal engg. projects ltd. v. tehri hydro development corpn. ltd. [ansal engg. projects ltd. v. tehri hydro development corpn. ltd., (1996) 5 scc 450] held thus: (scc p. 454, paras 4-5) \"4. it is settled law that bank guarantee is an independent and distinct contract between the bank and the beneficiary and is not qualified by the underlying transaction and the validity of the primary contract between the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given and the beneficiary. unless fraud or special equity exists, is pleaded and prima facie established by strong evidence as a triable issue, the beneficiary cannot be restrained from encashing the bank guarantee even if dispute between the beneficiary and the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given by the bank, had arisen in performance of the contract or execution of the works undertaken in furtherance thereof. the bank unconditionally and irrevocably promised to pay, on demand, the amount of liability undertaken in the guarantee without any demur or dispute in terms of the bank guarantee. the object behind is to inculcate respect for free flow of commerce and trade and faith in the commercial banking transactions unhedged by pending disputes between the beneficiary and the contractor. 5. . the court exercising its power cannot interfere with enforcement of bank guarantee/letters of credit except only in cases where fraud or special equity is prima facie made out in the case as triable issue by strong evidence so as to prevent irretrievable injustice to the parties.\" (emphasis supplied) 20. a bank guarantee constitutes an independent contract. in hindustan construction co. ltd. v. state of bihar [hindustan construction co. ltd. v. state of bihar, (1999) 8 scc 436] , a two-judge bench of this court formulated the condition upon which the invocation of the bank guarantee depends in the following terms: (scc p. 442, para 9) \"9. what is important, therefore, is that the bank guarantee should be in unequivocal terms, unconditional and recite that the amount would be paid without demur or objection and irrespective of any dispute that might have cropped up or might have been pending between the beneficiary under the bank guarantee or the person on whose behalf the guarantee was furnished. the terms of the bank guarantee are, therefore, extremely material. since the bank guarantee represents an independent contract between the bank and the beneficiary, both the parties would be bound by the terms thereof. the invocation, therefore, will have to be in accordance with the terms of the bank guarantee, or else, the invocation itself would be bad.\" 22. taking note of the exposition of law on the subject in himadri chemicals industries ltd. v. coal tar refining co. [himadri chemicals industries ltd. v. coal tar refining co., (2007) 8 scc 110] , a two-judge bench of this court in gujarat maritime board v. larsen & toubro infrastructure development projects ltd. [gujarat maritime board v. larsen & toubro infrastructure development projects ltd., (2016) 10 scc 46 : (2017) 1 scc (civ) 458] has laid down the principles for grant or refusal for invocation of bank guarantee or a letter of credit. the relevant paragraph is as under: (himadri chemicals industries ltd. case [himadri chemicals industries ltd. v. coal tar refining co., (2007) 8 scc 110] , scc pp. 117-18, para 14) \"14. from the discussions made hereinabove relating to the principles for grant or refusal to grant of injunction to restrain enforcement of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit, we find that the following principles should be noted in the matter of injunction to restrain the encashment of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit: (i) while dealing with an application for injunction in the course of commercial dealings, and when an unconditional bank guarantee or letter of credit is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realise such a bank guarantee or a letter of credit in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes relating to the terms of the contract. (ii) the bank giving such guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. (iii) the courts should be slow in granting an order of injunction to restrain the realisation of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit. (iv) since a bank guarantee or a letter of credit is an independent and a separate contract and is absolute in nature, the existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of bank guarantees or letters of credit. (v) fraud of an egregious nature which would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee or letter of credit and the beneficiary seeks to take advantage of the situation. (vi) allowing encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee or a letter of credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned.\" 23. the settled position in law that emerges from the precedents of this court is that the bank guarantee is an independent contract between bank and the beneficiary and the bank is always obliged to honour its guarantee as long as it is an unconditional and irrevocable one. the dispute between the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the bank has given the guarantee is immaterial and is of no consequence. there are, however, exceptions to this rule when there is a clear case of fraud, irretrievable injustice or special equities. the court ordinarily should not interfere with the invocation or encashment of the bank guarantee so long as the invocation is in terms of the bank guarantee. 26. in our considered view, once the demand was made in due compliance with bank guarantees, it was not open for the appellant bank to determine as to whether the invocation of the bank guarantee was justified so long as the invocation was in terms of the bank guarantee. the demand once made would oblige the bank to pay under the terms of the bank guarantee and it is not the case of the appellant bank that its defence falls in any of the exception to the rule of case of fraud, irretrievable injustice and special equities. in absence thereof, it is not even open for the court to interfere with the invocation and encashment of the bank guarantee so long as the invocation was in terms of the bank guarantee and this is what has been observed by the division bench of the high court in the impugned judgment [heavy engg. corpn. ltd. v. standard chartered bank, 2019 scc online cal 617 : (2019) 3 cal lt 133] and that reflected the correct legal position.\" (emphasis supplied) 25. so far as the judgment cited by the petitioner, in arcelormittal nippon steel (india) ltd. (supra), the supreme court has held as follows:\"88. applications for interim relief are inherently applications which are required to be disposed of urgently. interim relief is granted in aid of final relief. the object is to ensure protection of the property being the subject-matter of arbitration and/or otherwise ensure that the arbitration proceedings do not become infructuous and the arbitral award does not become an award on paper, of no real value.\" (emphasis supplied) in gangotri enterprises ltd. (supra), the supreme court, vide paragraph nos.39, 40 & 43, held/observed as follows:\"39. coming now to the facts of the case at hand, we find that wordings of clause 62 of the contract in question with which we are concerned is identical to that of clause 18 of raman iron foundry case [union of india v. raman iron foundry, (1974) 2 scc 231] . clause 62 of gcc provides for determination of contract owing to default of contractor. the relevant portion of clause 62 reads as under: \"the amounts thus to be forfeited or recovered may be deducted from any monies then due or which at any time thereafter may become due to the contractor by the railways under this or any other contract or otherwise.\" 40. on perusal of the record of the case, we find that firstly, arbitration proceedings in relation to the contract dated 22-8-2005 are still pending. secondly, the sum claimed by the respondents from the appellant does not relate to the contract for which the bank guarantee had been furnished but it relates to another contract dated 22-8-2005 for which no bank guarantee had been furnished. thirdly, the sum claimed by the respondents from the appellant is in the nature of damages, which is not yet adjudicated upon in arbitration proceedings. fourthly, the sum claimed is neither a sum due in praesenti nor a sum payable. in other words, the sum claimed by the respondents is neither an admitted sum and nor a sum which stood adjudicated by any court of law in any judicial proceedings but it is a disputed sum, and lastly, the bank guarantee in question being in the nature of a performance guarantee furnished for execution work of contract dated 14-7-2006 (anandvihar works) and the work having been completed to the satisfaction of the respondents, they had no right to encash the bank guarantee. 43. in the light of foregoing discussion, we hold that the appellants have made out a prima facie case in their favour for grant of injunction against the respondents so also they have made out a case of balance of convenience and irreparable loss in their favour as was held by this court in raman iron foundry case [union of india v. raman iron foundry, (1974) 2 scc 231] . they are, therefore, entitled to claim injunction against the respondent in relation to encashment of bank guarantee no. 12/2006 dated 4-8-2006.\" (emphasis supplied) in union of india (supra), the supreme court, vide paragraph nos.14 and 15, held/observed as follows:\"14. clause 9 of the tender document enables the appellant to encash the bank guarantee, in case of failure on the part of the licensee either to deposit licence fee within 7 days of the beginning of each year or if the licensee stops the service without giving one year's notice. the bank guarantee can also be invoked if the licensee is declared or applies for being declared insolvent or bankrupt. there is no dispute that the licensee did not commence its operations and therefore the second condition does not apply. admittedly, the third condition is not applicable to the facts of the case. according to the appellant, bank guarantee was invoked due to failure on the part of the licensee to deposit the licence fee within 7 days of beginning of the year. essentially, the bank guarantee given by the respondent is a performance bank guarantee and was intended to ensure the due performance of the licence agreement. a perusal of the conditions of the relevant clauses of the agreement clearly shows that according to article 1.1 of schedule 'c' to the agreement, the licence was granted for period of 10 years which has to be reckoned from the date of issuance of wol by the wpc. admittedly, wol was never issued by wpc. a deemed operational licence, which was to be issued by the appellant, was not contemplated in the agreement. 15. we are of the opinion that the tribunal did not commit any error in its interpretation of the clause pertaining to bank guarantee by holding that the conditions provided therein have not been satisfied for the invocation of the bank guarantee.\" (emphasis supplied) in maria margarida sequeira fernandes(supra) the supreme court ,vide paragraph no.84, held/observed as follows:\"84. in order to grant or refuse injunction, the judicial officer or the judge must carefully examine the entire pleadings and documents with utmost care and seriousness. the safe and better course is to give a short notice on the injunction application and pass an appropriate order after hearing both the sides. in case of grave urgency, if it becomes imperative to grant an ex parte ad interim injunction, it should be granted for a specified period, such as, for two weeks. in those cases, the plaintiff will have no inherent interest in delaying disposal of injunction application after obtaining an ex parte ad interim injunction.\" (emphasis supplied) 26. after analysing the judgments of the supreme court on the point, as detailed above, and summarizing the principles decided there in as to the scope of interference / injunction against invocation of bg, this court is of the following views:i) the courts should be slow in granting the injunction to restraint the realization of a bank guarantee ii) however, there are two well recognized exceptions to this rule which are: (a) a fraud of egregious nature. (b) the invocation/encashment of bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties. iii) in some cases third exception is also carved out viz. when there are special equities in favour of the person seeking injunction. iv) in case the bank guarantee is not invoked in terms thereof, the bank can refuse to honour the bank guarantee, as in that case it would not be in accordance with the agreed stipulation and invocation would be improper. this can be treated as the fourth exception, as in such a case injunction can be granted. point no.iv) is answered accordingly. 27. now the question is, whether any of the above established grounds for injunction against invocation of bg, has been made out by the petitioner. to determine point nos. iii) and iv), it would be appropriate to examine the averments made in the section 9 application so also the documents appended there to in support of such averments, which are in ditto , as made in the writ petition , so also averments made in the i.a. for vacation of stay and objection filed by the petitioner in response to the said i.a. 28. paragraph nos.18, 19, 31 to 33 of the application under section 9 of the act, 1996, where in the petitioner has allegedly pleaded the grounds for interference regarding invocation of bg on the ground of special equities, so also contents of some of the

to your kind attention that we have been awarded the subject work vide wo no. 4563501345, dated: 25.02.2022. since the beginning of the work, there were multiple hindrances such as non-timely supply of materials and shortages of materials, pending cos of many lines of items, etc. this has been repeatedly reported to the concerned officials but there was never any concrete step taken by them for resolution of the hindrances. due to the same the work progress was hampered badly and it could not be completed as per the targeted timelines which was categorically explained in our different letters & intimated to the concerned authorities in personal meeting time to time but unfortunately nobody is taking any pain even to properly reply via letter. however always verbal assurance has been given that the issues will be resolved. after a lot of persuasions and intervention of the head office of jspl represented by mr. ashok mahunta (chairman commercial), finally on 18th october 2023, a video meet was organized and it was decided that the contract would be short closed and a physical meeting will be organized to decide a way forward. however, till date even after our repeated persuasion, multiple letters and requests, there has been no response from any officials. further we have invested a huge amount of funds for execution of the project which is now completely stuck due to negligence and unpreparedness of the jspl field officers. details of our pending payments with your company are tabulated below: sl.no. particulars amount 1 against ra 1 to 14 rs. 38.14 lakhs 2

23.01.2024 50 our letter dated: 29.02.2024 sub: concerns and challenges regarding contractual obligations dear sir, with reference to the subject cited above, we would like to inform you that from the first day, this contract has been delayed from the employer side. this includes not handing over a hindrance-free site for excavation, non-payment of the deviation quantity of excavation, rock strata found during excavation (which was not estimated at the time of contract allocation by jspl), leading to increased cost and time that has not yet been paid or accounted for. there were continued delays in the provision of free-issue material to be provided by jspl as per contract, which includes, but is not limited to, backfill material, tmt bars, concrete, structural material, ps panel, l-mesh, u-mesh, sand, cement, paint, etc. furthermore, as per the provisions of the contract, jspl was supposed to provide labour hutment, free electricity, and water, which was not provided. even after repeated requests, the same was not provided as per our requirement, which we have pointed out via many letters and presentations. moreover, there were various revisions and rectifications of drawings done by jspl, due to which a lot of work was delayed. furthermore, as per the condition of the contract, payment must be made by jspl within 1 month of the submission of the bill, but it was made within an average of 3 months that too partially. during this time, we received partial payment, and even after repeated requests to provide reconciliation of accounts and detailed deduction sheets, the same has not been done till date. additionally, many gst payment of our invoice by jspl. have not been made, which is a criminal offense. also, suo-moto our scope of work was reduced by jspl without any intimation or discussion, whereas we had deployed machinery, equipment, material, and manpower for the complete project and not the reduced scope, which leads to much higher costs than ascertained before the time of bidding. till date, the entire deviation quantity from the original scope has been submitted to jspl multiple times, but no payment has been made regarding the same. despite all these issues, the contractor had been working, but since march 2023, jspl has been making arbitrary decisions without proper consultation and representation of the contractor, keeping the contractor at their mercy, illegally stopping the contractor from taking out its material and machinery. this is a criminal conspiracy to steal or misuse the contractor's material by not providing the contractor and their people access to the site, and subsequently not providing the labour hutment, and blaming the contractor för slow-progress of work and not releasing payments. again, the company has also denied meeting the contractor's high-level management multiple times and seized all forms of communication by not responding to the contractor's mails, letters, etc., and only raising their issues without responding to the contractor's issues to handicap the contractor from executing its obligations. furthermore, the civil department has arbitrarily refused to review the contractor's bill, citing vague reasons. it is evident that jspl is engaging in a criminal conspiracy to avoid paying the contractor and impede their work by withholding essential resources such as drawings, electricity, water, site access, and accommodation. additionally, they are blackmailing the contractor by neglecting to verify the bill and threatening to invoke the bank guarantee, all while neglecting their contractual obligations as the project owner/employer. therefore, we urgently request your intervention to review our bills, approve necessary deviations, and promptly settle our outstanding payments. failure to comply will leave us with no choice but to take the shelter of court. thank you, yours faithfully, for, bansal infraprojects pvt ltd sd/(authorised signatory)\"

(supra), interim relief is granted in aid of final relief. the object is to ensure protection of the property being the subject-matter of arbitration and/or otherwise ensure that the arbitration proceedings do not become infructuous and the arbitral award does not become an award on paper, of no real value. hence, this court is of the view that the court below, while considering the application under order 39 rule 3, read with section 151 application, failed to appreciate the settled position of law so also take note of the contents of the documents filed along with the section 9 application. point no.iii) is answered accordingly. 37. admittedly, during pendency of the present writ petition, the opposite party (jspl) has made a communication to the opposite party-bank on 07.05.2024, as at annexure-h of the i.a., for invocation of bank guarantee on the ground that the petitioner has failed to perform its obligation under the agreement, though the said bg is not a performance bg. however, due to interim order dated 20.05.2024, which is still in vogue, the opposite parties were restrained from invoking the bank guarantee. the contents of the said letter dated 07.05.2024, being relevant, are extracted below: letter dated 07.05.2024 \"ref no: jspl/bg/en/4080 date : 07.05.2024 the manager, union bank of india ajit tower, near sindhi school, main branch, ramsagar para, raipur(cg)-492001 tel: 7525003213 subject encashment of bank guarantee dear sir, the following bank guarantee was issued by your bank in our favour on behalf of m/s bansal infra

faithfully, for jindal steel & power ltd. sd/authorized signatory\" (emphasis supplied) 38. on conjoint reading of the terms of bank guarantee, which mandates as to reduction by 10% of invoice value of each shipment, communication dated 25.03.2024 made to the petitioner, which well demonstrates that in addition to alleged refund towards unadjusted advance, a penalty of rs.1,00,00,000/was claimed towards project delay and the contents of the letter dated 07.05.2024, which was issued during pendency of the writ petition, which indicates that the opposite party wanted to invoke the bg on the ground that the petitioner failed to perform its obligation under the agreement, this court is of the prima facie view that the opposite party has acted contrary to the terms of bank guarantee, which was furnished to secure the advance given by the opposite parties to the petitioner. this court is also of prima facie view that there are special equities in favour of the petitioner and if the opposite parties are permitted to encash the bg, it may cause irretrievable injustice to the petitioner company. 39. admittedly, the section 9 application is still pending for consideration by the commercial court, cuttack on merit and if at this stage the opposite parties are permitted to invoke the bank guarantee, the prayer made in the section 9 application shall become infructuous. further, the petitioner has already moved before this court under section 11(6) of the act, 1996 for appointment of arbitrator. 40. hence, the parties are directed to appear before the senior civil judge, commercial court, cuttack in arbp no.14 of 2024 on 27.08.2024. if so required, the commercial court shall pre-pone the date to the said date, if the said case stands posted to any date beyond the said date. the opposite parties shall file their objection with all relevant documents, if any, to the application filed under section 9 of the act, 1996, within ten days from the said date. 41. on filing of objection, the senior civil judge, commercial court, cuttack shall proceed further in accordance with law and shall try to conclude the said proceeding at the earliest, preferably within a period of six weeks from the date of filing of the objection and documents by the opposite parties. 42. since the bank guarantee furnished by the petitioner is going to expire on 05.09.2024, the petitioner is directed to extend the said bg until 31.12.2024 well before the expiry of the said period. 43. as the opposite parties contested the present writ petition on technical grounds of maintainability so also scope regarding interference by the court regarding invocation of bank guarantee and are yet to file their objection in arbp no.14 of 2024, it is made clear that after filing of objection by the opposite parties, the senior civil judge, commercial court, cuttack shall proceed further in accordance with law and decide the prayer made in arbp no.14 of 2024 on merit taking into consideration the pleadings and documents on record, without being influenced by the observations made above. however, the interim order dated 20.05.2024 passed in the present case shall remain in force till disposal of the arbp no.14 of 2024, subject to extension of bank guarantee by 31st august, 2024. 44. accordingly, the writ petition stands disposed of. no order as to cost. . s.k. mishra, j. orissa high court,
