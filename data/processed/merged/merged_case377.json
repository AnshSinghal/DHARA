The Petitioner and the Respondents, who are the Plaintiff and the Defendants respectively in the original lawsuit [Cs(Comm) 2185/2021], are embroiled in a commercial dispute befo re the Commercial Court Judge at Tis Hazari, Central District, Delhi . The core of the dispute revolves around the Petitioner's plea for legal protection, primarily in the form of an injunction, to prevent the Respondents from engaging in alleged unauthorized use of the Petitioner's trademark \"AMAZE\" on the ground of passing off. \n2. As it stands, the aforementioned suit is currently in the process of adjudication, with the conclusive judgment and the determination of an interlocutory injunction still pending. However, the focus of this present petition is a comprehensive order issued on 02nd August, 2022 passed by Commercial Court Judge [hereinafter \"Impugned Order\"], dismissing two applications filed by the Petitioner, both seeking leave to introduce additional documents. Aggrieved by the same, Petitioner has appealed to this Court's supervisory jurisdiction, asserting that their right to a fair trial has been compromised, by a manifestly erroneous order. \nBackground of the dispute leading to the commencement of the present legal proceedings 3. The circumstances leading up to the filing of the present petition are succinctly outlined as follows:\n3.1. The Petitioner asserts that in July 2018, the Respondents approached the Petitioner seeking permission to utilize the Petitioner's mark, \"AMAZE\". \nUpon refusal, the Respondent No. 2 filed an opposition to Petitioner's trademark application for the mark \" \" under number 2424250 under Class 9 dated 06th November, 2012. The Petitioner countered this opposition, disputing the proprietary rights claimed by Respondent No. 2 over the \"AMAZE\" mark and its variants. \n3.2. In April, 2021, Petitioner gained knowledge of Respondents selling batteries under the deceptively similar mark \"AMAZE\". Petitioner contends that the Respondents' mark, which is structurally and phonetically identical to the Petitioner's, was purportedly adopted with an intent to capitalize on the goodwill and reputation of the petitioner. \n3.3. During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic in June-July 2021, the Petitioner, invoked its common law rights in the \"AMAZE\" trademark and filed a lawsuit to seek restraining orders against the Respondents from the use of the mark \"AMAZE\". Due to certain inadvertent circumstances, some of the key documents were excluded. Thus, on 01st September 2021, the Petitioner filed the first application seeking permission to present additional documents [hereinafter \"First Application\"]. Following this, on 04th January 2022, a second application was made seeking permission to introduce further documents to counter the claims made by the Respondents in their written statement [hereinafter \"Second Application\"]. Both these applications [collectively, \"the Applications\"] met strong resistance from the Respondents and were ultimately adjudicated by the Commercial Court Judge through the Impugned Order, leading to their dismissal. \nPetitioner's Case 4. Ms. Rajeshwari H., Advocate, presents Petitioner's case as follows:\n4.1. Petitioner adopted trademark \"AMAZE\" in the year 2008 and has been continuously, openly and extensively using the said mark since then. \nPetitioner discovered that Respondents had started selling batteries under the mark \"AMAZE\" without any consent/ permission from Petitioner, despite denial of a specific request to use the same. As a result, Petitioner filed a commercial suit to restrain them from using the said mark. The suit was filed online in June/July 2021, since counsel were working from home on account of restrictions as per Covid-19 norms/ guidelines and moreover, Covid-19 was in the aftermath of its peak. The suit came up for hearing on 08th July, 2021 when the Court directed the Petitioner to file physical paperbook of the suit. The first effective hearing took place on 05th August, 2021, through virtual mode. \n4.2. Petitioner, along with suit, produced all documents which they believed were in their power and possession. Since the officers of Petitioner and its counsel were working from their residence in light of Covid-19, certain documents were inadvertently not filed along with the plaint. On 01st September, 2021, Petitioner filed the First Application under Order XI Rule 1(4) (inadvertently mentioned as Rule 14) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 [hereinafter \"CPC\"] for filing additional documents which comprised of six invoices1 and online status of Respondents' five trademark applications.2 4.3 On 15th September, 2021, written statement was filed by Respondents, to which a replication was filed by Petitioner in November, 2021. On 04th January, 2022, Petitioner filed the Second Application under Order XI Rules 1(4) and 1(5) of CPC for producing additional documents in support of their pleadings to rebut the stand of Respondents emerging from their written statement. \n4.4. Additional affidavits were filed by Petitioner and Petitioner's counsel on 31st January, 2022, in view of the Commercial Court Judge's order dated 18th January, 2022, to explain reasons for not filing the documents along with the plaint. It was reiterated that the counsels were impacted by Covid-19 norms/ guidelines. Some of the counsels had even contracted Covid-19 Invoice Nos. 129, 012, 013, 017, 472, 471 of the period from 2008-2010. \nE-status of Respondents' trademark applications no. 2469374, 2469373, 2469372, 3723225 and 3723223. \ninfection or were attending medical exigencies at home. Copies of the medical reports of the counsel representing Petitioner and other members of the counsel's office were filed along with affidavit dated 31st January, 2022 of Ms. Nupur Goswami, Advocate, in the original suit. Further, Petitioner's staff members and CA were also unavailable/ working from home, on account of Covid-19, which is made out from Petitioner's affidavit dated 31st January, 2022. The Impugned Order failed to take into account the medical certificates and reports filed by the Petitioner, and exigencies pleaded by the Petitioner and their counsel. \n4.5. By way of the Impugned Order, the Commercial Court Judge misapplied the provisions of law and rejected the Applications on an erroneous interpretation of the relevant provisions. The Commercial Court Judge concludes that no reason has been made out to justify 'non-disclosure of documents with the plaint' though reasons given by Petitioner may be justified for 'non-filing of documents with the plaint'. This distinction of 'non-disclosure' and 'non-filing' is contrary to the mandate of Order XI Rule 1(5) of CPC. Further, the Commercial Court Judge has misapplied the ratio in the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sudhir Kumar v. Vinay Kumar G.B.3 to hold that documents ought to be disclosed with the plaint, failing which they cannot be produced at all. There is no such proscription in law. 4.6. Documents filed along with the Second Application were necessary to rebut the stand of Respondents in their written statement and hence, they fall within the ambit of Order XI Rule 1(1)(c)(ii) of CPC. It follows that the rigours of Order XI Rule 1(4) or 1(5) of CPC would not be attracted. The 2021 SCC Online SC 734.\nfinding in the Impugned Order, that the Petitioner was required to disclose the said documents, is erroneous. \n4.7. All the documents sought to be relied upon are supported by pleadings either in the plaint or in the replication. There is no requirement of law to plead each and every document in the plaint, thus the finding of non- disclosure of documents is incorrect. To support the relief, reliance is placed upon orders passed in 12 cases by Co-ordinate benches of this Court allowing additional documents to be taken on record, wherein issues had not been framed. \n4.8. Petitioner had furnished a reasonable explanation for not filing the documents earlier, however the same was disregarded without any basis. Judgments relied upon by Petitioner were ignored and distinguished on erroneous grounds. The Court failed to consider the extraordinary circumstances, on account of Covid-19, faced by Petitioner at the time of filing of suit that resulted in non-filing of the documents along with the plaint. \nRespondent's Submissions 5. Per contra, Mr. Sanjeev Sindhwani, Senior Counsel representing the Respondents, strongly opposed the petition by making the following submissions:-\n5.1. There is no error of jurisdiction or any other error warranting supervisory correction by this Court in exercise of Article 227 of the Constitution of India. This Court is not to sit in appeal or revision over the decision of the Commercial Court Judge in a legitimate exercise of jurisdiction under Article 227. Reliance is placed upon decisions of this Court in Bela Creation Pvt. Ltd. v. Anuj Textiles4 and M-Power Energy India (P) Ltd. and Anr. v. Sumana Mazumdar5.\n5.2. As per Order XI Rule 1(1) of CPC, Petitioner was required to file all documents which were in its power, possession, control or custody along with the plaint or within an extended period of thirty days, subject to leave as contemplated under Rule 1(4). This requirement is in consonance with the object of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and is a clear departure from the existing law relating to filing and production of documents/ additional documents. Leave of the Court to file additional documents not disclosed with the plaint can be sought only after establishing reasonable cause for non- disclosure along with the plaint, which has not been made out by Petitioner. 5.3. Additional documents sought to be filed along with the Applications were in Petitioner's power, possession, control and custody at the time of filing of the suit. Petitioner, at the time of filing of the suit, has to give a declaration on oath6 (which was given in the present case) that all documents in the power, possession, control and custody of Petitioner pertaining to the facts and circumstances of the case are disclosed and annexed with the plaint and Petitioner does not have any other document with him. This declaration cannot be rendered meaningless. The additional documents, not so declared or filed, cannot be relied upon/ produced subsequently except in exceptional circumstances and on the basis of justifiable and reasonable grounds. Any other interpretation and understanding of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 would be negating the very objective thereof. \n2022 SCC OnLine Del 1366. \n2022 SCC OnLine Del 3312. \nOrder XI Rule 1(3) of CPC, as amended by Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n5.4. In Sudhir Kumar (supra), the Supreme Court laid down that documents in power, possession, custody and control have to be filed with plaint or within extended period of 30 days, subject to seeking permission of the court at the time of filing of suit. Otherwise, strict rigours of Rule 1(5) will apply. 5.5. In Bela Creations (supra), the Court applied stringent provisions envisaged under Order XI of CPC and declined the plea of additional documents, including on Covid-19 grounds. The Court also refused interference on the basis of limited scope of jurisdiction under Article 227. The \"statutory proscription\" for filing additional documents in commercial matters was reiterated in The Great Gatsby Club v. Mahesh Prefab,7 where the ground of documents not having been collated was not accepted, and the Court also noted that the rigour of provisions of Order XI Rule 1 of CPC cannot be diluted on any sympathetic or other considerations. 5.6. Petitioner's claim of urgency in filing of the suit is equally misconceived as the Petitioner has been aware of Respondent's advertisement and use of the trademark 'AMAZE' at least since mid-2018. Respondents had first filed a Notice of Opposition dated 14th August, 2018 against Petitioner's application no. 2424250 and Petitioner also acknowledged Respondents' user in its Counter Statement filed on 10th October, 2018. Therefore, the submission of Petitioner that there was an urgency in filing the suit, is even otherwise, absolutely false. \n5.7. With respect to plea of Covid-19, it is further submitted that the suit was listed on various dates prior to issuance of summons on 05th August, 2021. Petitioner was present on all dates and vehemently pressed for ex parte 2022 SCC OnLine Del 2099.\ninjunction. In fact, Petitioner had been travelling to Delhi for signing the court pleadings and notarization of affidavits. The suit has been vigorously prosecuted and thus, the plea premised on the impact of Covid-19 plea is not sustainable. In this regard, Respondents rely on the judgment in HT Media and Ors. v. Brain Link International Inc. & Ors.8 passed by this Court, and further upheld by the Supreme Court.9 Analysis 6. The Commercial Court Judge remained unpersuaded by the explanations offered by the Petitioner to justify their delay in filing the requisite documents alongside the plaint. He delved into the evolution of the provisions pertaining to the filing of documents along with the pleadings, and the consequences of non-submission, invoking precedents of this Court and the Supreme Court. Consequently, he framed three pivotal questions for adjudication, as outlined in paragraph 14 of the Impugned Order as follows:\n\"a). Whether the documents sought to be filed by both the applications were in the power, possession, control or custody of plaintiff?\nb). If yes, whether plaintiff establishes a reasonable cause for non-disclosure of the same at the time of filing of the plaint as required under Order XI Rule 1(5) CPC.\nc). Whether the additional documents are required to answer the case set up by the defendant in terms of Order XI Rule 1(c)(ii) CPC.\"\n7. Regarding the first question, the Commercial Court Judge reached the conclusion that the disputed documents were indeed under Petitioner's power, possession, control, and custody at the time of the filing of the plaint. Having established this, he moved on to assess whether the Petitioner could establish 2021 SCC OnLine Del 5398. \nBrainlink International Inc. & Anr. v. HT Media Limited & Anr., Petition for Special Leave to Appeal C No. 3579/2022, order dated 14th March, 2022. \na valid reason for not disclosing these documents at the time of filing the plaint, as mandated by Order XI Rule 1(5) of CPC. His judgement on this issue, crystallised as the second question, extracted above, is summarized as follows:\n\" 21.1 Bare perusal of both the applications of the plaintiff makes it clear that whatever reasons plaintiff has disclosed therein are to justify the reason for non filing of the same alongwith the plaint. For instance, in the first application, plaintiff avers that some documents were left out inadvertently; as officers of plaintiff and its counsels were working from home due to Covid, certain documents were left out due to administrative error. Similarly, in the second application, plaintiff alleges that since some documents being old documents were kept at different site, which could not be accessed due to lockdowns, plaintiff could not file the same along with the plaint. \n21.2 Needless to say that in order to seek leave of the Court to file additional documents under Order XI Rule 1(5) CPC, plaintiff is required to establish a reasonable cause for non-disclosure of the same along with the plaint and not to establish a reasonable cause for non-filing of the same along with the plaint. There is a significant distinction between the reason for non-disclosure of a document at the time of filing of the plaint and the reason for non-filing of the same alongwith the plaint as the furnished reason may be reasonable for non-filing of the same, but the same reason may not be reasonable for non-disclosure of the same. For instance, lockdown may be a reasonable cause for non-filing of the same along with the plaint as due to lockdown plaintiff may not be in a position to collect the document from the particular place, but the same lockdown may not be reasonable cause for non- disclosing of the same as lockdown does not prevent the plaintiff to disclose the same at the time of filing of the plaint. But, in the instant case, plaintiff preferred not to disclose any reason for non-disclosure of the documents in question at the time of filing of plaint despite the fact that documents were in his power, possession, control or custody; rather he preferred to disclose the reasons for non-filing of the same, which is not sine qua non in Order XI Rule1(5) CPC. As the plaintiff failed to disclose any reasonable cause for non-disclosure of the documents in question at the time of filing of the plaint, I am of the view that plaintiff failed to fulfil the requisite mandatory condition of Order XI Rule 1(5) CPC to seek the leave of the Court. \n22. On January 18, 2022, learned counsel for the plaintiff sought leave of the Court to file additional affidavit in support of both the applications to disclose when the additional documents were retrieved by the plaintiff, which was granted by the Court. Accordingly, plaintiff filed the affidavit on January 31, 2022. 22.1 In para 3 of the affidavit, plaintiff states, \"I signed the plaint and affidavit but could not notarize them. I sent a scanned copy to my counsel in around Mid-June 2021.\" In para 4, plaintiff states that he traced out certain invoices (as mentioned in first application) in the last week of June 2021 and personally delivered at the office of his counsel on 29.06.21. In order words, it is admitted case of the plaintiff, he had traced out the documents mentioned in the first application prior to filing of the suit, which was admittedly filed online on 08.07.2021. In para 5 of the affidavit, plaintiff states that he visited Delhi on 16.07.2021 for re-execution of documents and notarisation thereof but since he had to return Aligarh quickly, he did not go through each and every document. Admittedly, hard copy of the plaint was filed on 16.07.2021 and the statement of truth was got attested from Oath Commissioner of 16.07.2021 wherein he also declared on oath that he has disclosed and filed all the documents in his power, possession, control or custody. Does plaintiff intend to say that he signed the plaint, affidavit and statement on truth without going through its contents? If yes, it is nothing but negligence of plaintiff, which cannot be considered a reasonable cause. \n22.2 No doubt, Covid 19 created unprecedented situation not only for individuals but also for institutions and even for all the organs of governments. But since necessity is the mother of invention, Covid 19 also taught all of us, how to interact or communicate in such unprecedented situations. Inter-net played a significant role to save the mankind, institutions from the catastrophic effects of Covid 19 as peoples started to hold meetings through various online platforms. Similarly, institutions started functioning online. Indian judiciary also started online filing and online hearing which were unknown prior to Covid 19. Plaintiff himself in para 3 of his affidavit stated that he sent a scanned copy to his counsel in mid June 2021. Thus, there was no such reason for the plaintiff even to come to Delhi from Aligarh just to deliver some invoices he could easily send the soft copy of the same to his counsel. Further, it is just unbelievable that plaintiff would not inform or confirm from the office of his counsel that the invoices had been received or not. Further, it was the duty of plaintiff to check whether the invoices were mentioned in the list of documents or not? If plaintiff preferred to sign the documents without going through it, then he can not take his lapse as a reasonable cause. If such plea is started to the considered as reasonable cause, it would defeat the object of enactment of commercial Courts Act. \n22.3 In the light of above, I am of the view that even reason furnished in the affidavit qua documents mentioned in the first application are insufficient to establish a reasonable cause for non-disclosure of the documents at the time of filing of the plaint.\"\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n8. The Commercial Court Judge turned his attention next to Petitioner's plea to introduce additional documents under Order XI Rule 1(1)(c)(ii) of the CPC, a situation contemplated in the third question. The Second Application, was also considered under the aforenoted provision, but was rejected as the Petitioner could not support the same on facts. In this determination, the Commercial Court Judge evaluated the jurisprudence presented by both parties and rejected the precedents referenced by the Petitioner, noting that the governing judgement on the issue is the Supreme Court's ruling in Sudhir Kumar (supra). He emphasized the criticality of demonstrating a reasonable cause for non-disclosure of documents, concluding that without such a justification, the Petitioner's contention lacked merit, thus precluding the belated introduction of documents. \n9. As can be seen from the emphasised extracted portions of the Impugned Order, the Commercial Court Judge has proceeded on the assumption of the necessity to establish a \"reasonable cause for non-disclosure of documents in the plaint\". A clear distinction is drawn by the Commercial Court Judge between a reasonable cause for 'non-disclosure' vis--vis a reasonable cause for 'not filing' the documents along with the plaint, which he perceives as significant. On this premise, he asserts that the reasons for non-disclosure of documents at the time of filing the plaint and the reasons for not filing the same are two separate and distinct concepts. He further holds that while a reason might be deemed reasonable for not filing the documents at the time of filing of plaint, it may not meet the requisite threshold of reasonableness for non-disclosure of the same. \n10. The aforementioned distinction forming the bedrock of the Impugned Order is not explicitly evident from the perusal of Order XI Rule 1(5) of CPC. The Commercial Court Judge's emphasis on the disclosure of documents that are within the power, possession, control, and custody of the Petitioner is indeed accurate. However, the drawn distinction between 'non-filing' and 'non-disclosure' appears to be contrived. Under Order XI Rule 1(1) of CPC, the plaintiff is obliged to file a list of all documents and photocopies of all documents within its power, possession, control or custody relating to the suit, including the documents the plaintiff references and relies upon in the plaint. In addition, Order XI Rule 1(3) of CPC imposes an additional obligation on plaintiff to declare on oath that all documents within the plaintiff's power, possession, control, and custody pertaining to the facts and circumstances of the proceedings initiated have been disclosed and their copies annexed with the plaint. Therefore, the law demands not only a disclosure but also filing of documents along with the plaint, thus, creating a 'dual requirement'. Order XI Rule 1(5) underscores the importance of this requirement by prohibiting the plaintiff from relying on documents not disclosed along with the plaint. Hence, the legal imperative is that if a document is within the plaintiff's power, possession, control, or custody, it should not only be disclosed but also filed along with the plaint. However, the Commercial Court Judge proceeds on the assumption that there is no disclosure by the Petitioner regarding the additional documents, thereby rendering the reason for non-filing irrelevant. His understanding is evident from the illustration in the Impugned Order, which notes \"For instance, lockdown may be a reasonable cause for non- filing of the same along with the plaint as due to lockdown plaintiff may not be in a position to collect the document from the particular place, but the same lockdown may not be a reasonable cause for non-disclosing of the same as lockdown does not prevent the plaintiff to disclose the same at the time of filing of the plaint.\" In the opinion of this Court, this principle has been erroneously applied to the facts of the present case. Therefore, the Commercial Court Judge's distinction between the reasons for 'non- disclosure' and 'non-filing' is rendered artificial. The lockdown induced by Covid-19 surely constitutes a reasonable cause for both non-disclosure and non-filing, subject to the satisfaction of the circumstances and the discretion of the Court. \n11. In addition, the Commercial Court Judge has returned a definitive finding against the Petitioner for failing to disclose the documents, at the time of filing the plaint. This finding is not backed by any fact-checking. Subject matter of the First application were six invoices (from the period of 2008 to 2010) and the online status of Respondents' five trademark applications, as noted in the background facts above. On a perusal of the plaint, it is made out that a corresponding disclosure was made for the said invoices pertaining to Petitioner's use of their trademark 'AMAZE', in paragraph 4 of the plaint to the following effect:-\n\"...The Plaintiff has been using the mark AMAZE written in stylized manner \"amaze SOURCE OF INFINITVE POWER\" since 2008. The Plaintiff has been openly, continuously and extensively using the mark AMAZE on the said goods as their essential feature since its adoption in 2008.\" \n12. Likewise, a disclosure and averments pertaining to Respondents' five trademark applications, which relate to the documents containing the online status of marks, find mention in paragraph 18 and 19 of the plaint, extracted as under:-\nParagraph 18 \"The investigation trial also lead to the marks applied for registration by the Defendant which is summarized in the table below...\"\nParagraph 19 \"It is pertinent to note that all marks are filed on 'proposed to be used' basis giving an impression that products under the mark AMAZE are yet to be launched in the market. All marks of Defendant are pending except TM except TM No. 3861216 which is registered against which the Plaintiff has filed rectification...\" \n13. Thus, there is a disclosure in the pleadings qua documents which form the subject matter of the First Application. Furthermore, keeping the legal principles of pleadings in mind, it must be noted that a plaintiff is not obligated to furnish a detailed disclosure of each document in the plaint itself. The law on this subject as evident from precedents mandates disclosure of material facts, not an exhaustive cataloguing of all documents in possession, in the plaint. The core of a pleading lies in the enunciation of material facts and not the amplification of every document that supports those facts. Under Order XI of CPC, a duty is imposed upon the parties to a suit to disclose all relevant documents that are within their power, possession, control or custody, at the earliest opportunity. Therefore, while the law requires a basic level of transparency qua critical documents, it does not insist on any exhaustive specification of every single document in the pleadings. We must understand that this requirement of disclosure serves to streamline the issues and prevent surprises at the stage of trial. The objective is to provide the opposite party, a fair notice of the case they need to meet, rather than to provide them with an exhaustive disclosure of each document in the plaint. Moreover, the express provision under Order XI of CPC to take on record additional documents filed belatedly, with the leave of the Court, indicates the legislative acknowledgment of potential circumstances that could arise leading to delayed disclosure or submission of some documents on justifiable reasons. The restriction under Order XI Rule 1(5) of CPC against filing of additional documents is not absolute, but conditional, allowing for their inclusion with permission of the Court. Given the existence of a pleading that supports the documents in the First Application, the Court must now determine if there was a justifiable reason for the delayed submission of these documents. \n14. The Petitioner justified the late submission of documents through affidavits dated 31st January, 2022, stating that the additional documents were located in a different premises under lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic and/or the technical staff not being available to retrieve the same, making them inaccessible until after the filing of the suit. Although the Commercial Court Judge recognized the compelling circumstances owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, yet the Impugned Order was passed on the premise that the lack of disclosure in the initial pleadings barred the subsequent submission of these documents. However, this Court is of the view that Petitioner's reasons relating to Covid-19 lockdown and the linked unavailability of staff should have been considered as a valid cause for not filing the said documents with the plaint. We find the Commercial Court Judge's dismissal of these reasons to be erroneous in such circumstances. \n15. It is noteworthy that the Commercial Court Judge primarily relied on the judgment in Sudhir Kumar (supra) to disallow the applications. However, in Court's view, the failure to contextualize the specific facts and circumstances of the present case has led to a misapplication of this precedent. In Sudhir Kumar's case, the first suit was filed in October 2018 and later withdrawn in July 2019, granting liberty to file a fresh suit. The second suit was instituted in August 2019, and an application for filing additional documents under Order VII Rule 14(3) of CPC was moved thereafter, which was dismissed by the Trial Court and subsequently confirmed by the High Court. The Supreme Court, in appeal, noted the absence of any urgency at the time of the second suit filing, and thus, concluded that the sheer volume of documents could not qualify as a reasonable cause for their delayed submission. A co-ordinate bench of this Court has also held in Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd. v. ARG Outlier Media Pvt. Ltd.10 that the judgment in Sudhir Kumar (supra) does not put any fetters on a Court from permitting additional documents to be taken on record if a party adduces satisfactory reasons for not filing the same with the plaint. In the case at hand, the filing was made at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic - a reality that was unforeseen and presented unique challenges and extraordinarily extreme circumstances affecting all walks of life. The Supreme Court in various judgements, such as Prakash Corporates v. Dee Vee Projects,11 as well as this Court in various judgments, have consistently advocated a more flexible stance while dealing with filings during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Supreme Court's view in Prakash Corporates (supra), excluded the period between 15th March, 2020 and 02nd October, 2021, when Covid-19 Pandemic was ongoing, from computing the extended period of limitation of 120 days in filing the written statement. Respondents place reliance on HT Media (supra) to contend that the Petitioner's plea of being impacted by Covid-19 does not hold ground. This view is rendered per incuriam, in light of the Supreme Court's authoritative view in Prakash Corporates (supra) of taking a liberal approach on filings during Covid-19, as also, the facts of the present case, wherein the non-filing of the documents in-question has been sufficiently linked to Covid-19, and even acknowledged in the Impugned Order. It is thus Neutral Citation No. 2023:DHC:001726.\n2022 SCC OnLine SC 180.\ndifficult to agree with the finding in the Impugned Order that Prakash Corporates (supra) does not come to the aid of the Petitioner. \n16. In the light of the exceptional challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, it becomes incumbent on this Court to eschew a strict interpretation and embrace a more lenient outlook in the matter at hand. As delineated earlier, the provisions of Order XI Rule 1(5) of CPC do erect a stringent boundary, but in the given scenario, the explanation tendered by the Petitioner sufficiently justifies the belated introduction of additional documents. Notwithstanding this, it is important to acknowledge that the suit is still at a nascent stage, with issues yet to be framed and the interim injunction application of the Petitioner still pending adjudication. The adage that 'procedure is the handmaid of justice' must guide our deliberations. While the essence of Order XI of CPC is to instil a sense of urgency in commercial proceedings, it should not be interpreted in a manner that hampers the pursuit of justice or enables one party to clinch victory on mere technical grounds before the matter has been thoroughly scrutinized at trial. Indeed, as pointed out by the Petitioner, Co-ordinate benches of this Court have allowed for additional documents to be filed in matters where issues had not been framed. That said, each case has to turn on its own facts and circumstance, which, as discussed above are compelling enough for exercise of the Court's discretion, as provided in law. \n17. Let's now turn our attention to the documents under scrutiny in the Second Application. Documents No. 31 to 42, which form subject matter of the Second Application, comprise of photocopies of Petitioner's advertisements in newspapers/ magazines, printouts relating to Petitioner's website and third-party websites showcasing Petitioner's products, Petitioner's social media activity, copies of its other promotional activities/ material, details of awards, CA certificate of sale/expenses, and invoices, in relation to the mark \"AMAZE.\" Additionally, Documents No. 43 to 47, in the Second Application, are copies of Respondent's video clips of the launch of their products along with printouts of screenshots of the same and Respondent's promotional activities along with printouts of news articles with coverage of Respondent's products from 2018. Said documents support Petitioner's contention regarding falsity of Respondent's claim of prior user of the mark \"AMAZE\". Thus, while the logic delineated above for documents that form part of the First Application would hold true for documents under the Second Application, it is also imperative to acknowledge the validity of the Petitioner's claim that they are entitled to introduce these documents to refute the Respondent's assertion of prior use. Indeed, documents, even if available in the public domain, may be filed when the need arises on account of a stand taken by a defendant in the written statement.12 18. The Petitioner has consistently argued that they are the bona fide and prior adopter and user of the mark since 2008, while the Respondents only recently entered the market. This assertion has been disputed by the Respondent, necessitating the Petitioner to counter this claim by producing the aforementioned additional documents. Through these documents, the Petitioner intends to demonstrate their extensive prior use of the mark and the Respondent's subsequent passing off. The Petitioner has utilized copies of newspapers/ magazine advertisements, invoices and other documents, that Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd (supra).\nwere not accessible during the initial suit filing. In the opinion of the Court, aforesaid documents would be relevant in determining the issue of prior use urged by the parties. Consequently, the Commercial Court Judge's ruling cannot sustain upon this ground either, and the Petitioner is indeed entitled to avail themselves of the provisions under Order XI Rule 1(1)(c)(ii) of CPC.\n19. Lastly, the Court must observe that the arguments put forth by Mr. Sindhwani regarding the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India hold merit and are well-grounded, however, it is important to explore the implications thereof in the current context. Article 227 imbues the High Court with the supervisory jurisdiction over all courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction. This supervisory role serves to, ensure the correct application of law, uphold justice, and prevent miscarriage of the same. In the case at hand, upon thorough review, it is evident that the Trial Court's perspective bears a manifest error. Consequently, this becomes an apt scenario for this Court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction, endowed by Article 227 of the Constitution of India. It is the responsibility of this Court, under the tenets of said provision, to correct such palpable errors. Therefore, this Court, while being cognizant of its jurisdiction, deems it fit to intervene in the current matter. \n20. Furthermore, in the interest of fairness and with an aim to balance the scales of justice, it is essential to take into account the delay in the prosecution of the suit due to the belated filing of documents by the Petitioner. In such circumstances, it is deemed appropriate to impose costs upon the Petitioner as a way to redress this delay. \n21. In addition, an opportunity should be extended to the Respondents to present any additional documents they may wish to submit. The Respondents are thus given a period of two weeks from the date of release of this judgment to file any such documents with the Trial Court, thereby ensuring that no party is disadvantaged, and the process remains equitable. \n22. In view of the above, the present petition is allowed with following directions:\n22.1. Impugned Order dated 02nd August, 2022 is set aside. \n22.2. Additional documents forming subject matter of Impugned Order are permitted to be taken on record, subject to just exceptions. 22.3. Cost of INR 50,000/- is imposed on Petitioner which is directed to be paid to Respondents within a period of one week from the date of release of this judgment. \n23. Disposed of along with other pending applications. \nSANJEEV NARULA, J JULY 03, 2023 d.negi",

[2.2] it is the case on behalf of the plaintiff so pleaded in the plaint that earlier the plaintiff company was incorporated in the name of sanskrut comfort systems pvt. ltd. which subsequently came to be converted into a public limited company by passing a special resolution and thereafter the name of the company was changed from sanskrut comfort systems pvt. ltd. to symphony comfort systems ltd. it is the case on behalf of the plaintiff company that plaintiff company is in the business of marketing, selling, trading and exporting of a range of air coolers under the name of \"symphony\" nationally and internationally for high quality products with excellent performance, aesthetic outlook and unique design wherein in the year ending 2015­16, the total turnover of the plaintiff exceeded approximately rs.523.98 crores. 7. it was also averred in the plaint that considering the worldwide business of the plaintif with warehouses servicing almost all states, dealers, retailers and distributors in almost all towns, cities and villages are established and on the basis of the well orchestered effort at constant innovation and consistent performance, the plaintiff company has been honoured with the award by the ministry of commerce and industry, government of india by granting a certificate of recognition as an export house in 2009 which came to be upgraded to a star export house. it was also averred that the plaintiff is also having a well­established research & development division (rdd) comprising of highly qualified and experienced engineers so as to develop better and more efficient products as well as unique and eye catching designs for their air coolers and other consumer products. [2.3] it was further averred and submitted that apart from various models of air coolers sold by the plaintiff, the plaintiff is also selling the \"diet\" model which has a unique design. it was further averred that the plaintiff company and the founder / m.d. shri achal bakeri is the holder of the design registration certificate for the said designs of \"diet\" model under the designs act, 2000 whereby the registrar has duly registered the unique designs of various models for sole and exclusive use of the proprietor and the models in question are \"diet 50t\" which has been registered on 04.02.2009 under classification 23­04 (air cooler) under design registration no.221068; that \"diet 22t\" is also registered on 05.02.2009 under classification 23­04 (air cooler) under design registration no.221084 \"diet 8t\" has been registered on 29.01.2009 under classification 23­04 (air cooler) under design registration no.220948. it is further averred that pursuant to the assignment deed of design, the same have been assigned in favour of the plaintiff company so as to enable the plaintiff company to market the said products under the registered designs. it was further averred that the plaintiff company has been selling and marketing the air coolers in different shapes and models and in order to make the air coolers attractive, eye catching, novel and impressionable to the customers, the plaintiff developed a novel shape, configuration and pattern for the air coolers and the said shape, configuration, ornament, composition of lines and pattern have been registered as per the registration details. it was further averred and the case on behalf of the plaintiff that as the plaintiff came to know that the defendant no.1 is illegally and without any permission or authority manufacturing, selling and marketing air coolers that are the unauthorised replicas and imitations of the air coolers of the plaintiff viz. \"diet\" (variants 50t and 22t as also 50i and 22i), through its respective manufacturing units and retail outlet and thereby passing off its goods i.e. air coolers viz. \"maharaja whiteline blizzard 50, maharaja whiteline blizzard 20\" as well as \"maharaja whiteline blizzard 50 dlx and maharaja whiteline blizzard 20 dlx\", stating and contending that the air coolers manufactured and marketed by defendant no.1 are so strikingly similar to the air coolers of the plaintiff i.e. diet 50t and diet 22t as well as diet 50i and diet 22i which may entail the purchaser / consumer to believe the products of defendant no.1 to be the products of the plaintiff. [2.4] it was further averred in the plaint and it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff company that defendant no.1 has recently launched the aforesaid models as reflects from the model features in february 2017 catalogue and the defendant no.1 has been extensively advertising and offering for sale the impugned air coolers through its website www.maharajawhiteline.com. therefore, it was the case on behalf of the plaintiff that since the plaintiff has established a unique and well­known design which has acquired a secondary meaning by virtue of its use and goodwill generated in the course of trade or business and therefore, the same can be considered as \"trade marks\" under the shape of goods category and the same is required to be protected by an action in the nature of passing off as the overall visual impression which creates in the minds of customers as to the source and origin of the goods is from the shape/aesthetic appearance of the goods and consequently an unwary or a gullible customer may easily get confused between the product of the plaintiff and defendant no.1 due to striking similarity in its shape, pattern and overall get­up. therefore, with above particular averments and contentions the plaintiff has instituted the suit for passing off damages, permanent injunction etc. as observed hereinabove in the said suit the plaintiff has taken out the notice of motion vide exhs.6­7 restraining the defendants, their agents, servants etc. by way of interim injunction restraining them from in any manner using the impugned design including the shape, get­up, layout, which is identical with or colourably / deceptively similar to the plaintiff's product and from passing off their goods viz. maharaja whiteline blizzard 50 and blizzard 50 dlx as also blizzard 20 and blizzard 20 dlx as those of the plaintiff. [2.5] that on being served with the process the defendants appeared before the learned commercial court. the original defendant no.1 filed its written statement and reply to interim injunction application vide exh.19. it was submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that the entire suit and application for interim injunction suffers from suppression of material fact which disentitles the plaintiff to claim any discretionary relief. it was also submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that the plaintiff has miserably failed to establish similarities between its products and the products of the defendant no.1 so as to maintain an action of passing off. [2.6] it was further submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that the defendant no.1 was earlier known as maharaja whiteline industries pvt. ltd., which was subsequently taken over by a group seb, france in the year 2014 and accordingly wholly owned subsidiary of group seb which is one of world's leading small domestic appliances company having global turnover of 5000 million euro (approximately rs.35,000 crores) in the year 2016 which launches more than 300 products and sell over 200 million products every year across the globe with operations spreading out to 150 countries. it was further submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that the defendant no.1 has created a distinct and unmistakable image on the basis of its innovative products in home appliance industries and is also having goodwill and reputation in the market. it was further averred on behalf of the defendant no.1 that for having the aesthetic look, new, novel and creative design to the products in question, the work of conceptualizing and developing the design, shape, etc. as entrusted to a specialized design firm viz. \"story design\" and the responsibility for the design front panel and deco control panel for the air coolers and the adoption thereof have been raised by the defendant no.1. it was further submitted that the defendant no.1 has incurred considerable expenditure in developing, designing, manufacturing, selling and marketing the product in question. it was submitted that therefore the defendant no.1 cannot be said to have merely copied / imitated the design of the plaintiff's products (diet model in the case on hand). [2.7] it was further submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that even prior to the filing of the suit, the plaintiff was aware of the shape as well as design of the products in question developed by defendant no.1 way back in january 2016 and no grievances whatsoever have been ventilated by the plaintiff against the defendant no.1 with regard to the products in question. it was further submitted that even the controller general of patent, design and trademark (authority) was pleased to register the design developed by defendant no.1 under the designs act, 2000 and the certificate to that effect has been issued in favour of the defendant no.1 which is nothing but a prima facie proof of the defendant no.1's originality, uniqueness and distinctiveness and the very fact as to the registration of defendant no.1's design has been suppressed by the plaintif. it was further submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that even the cancelation proceedings initiated by the plaintiff for cancellation of the registered design of defendant no.1 under section 19 of the designs act, 2000 (vice versa) have not been disclosed. it is submitted that therefore, non­disclosure of the aforesaid fact amounts to suppression and concealment of the material fact and therefore, the plaintiff is not entitled to the discretionary relief of interim injunction / injunction. in context of the case of the plaintiff as to the misrepresentation was created in the minds of the purchasers / customers, it was submitted on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that the products in question are materially distinct from each other. it was submitted that there is no true comparison of the competing products. relying upon the chart prepared by the defendant no.1 and produced with the list appended with the written statement, it was submitted that there is no question of any misrepresentation by the defendant no.1. it was submitted that even a look at the competing products through an ordinary purchaser's eye would make it abundantly clear that there is no chance of any confusion or deceit in the minds of general public regarding the origin of the product. referring to the products in question and showing the patterns and the distinctiveness of the products in question, it was submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that there is no possibility of misrepresentation on the part of the defendant no.1 as the defendant no.1 is selling its products in the brand name and trade name \"maharaja whiteline\" which is distinctively visible on each of its products. it was submitted that the brand name is otherwise well­known in the home appliance industry and having a distinct reputation and goodwill among the general public. [2.8] with regard to the issue as to shape and configuration of the products in question, it was submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that both the products in question are materially distinct and different from each other as is evident from the height, width, length and overall structure of the products and therefore the same rules out the possibility of the defendant no.1 having indulged in passing off its goods as those of the plaintiff. therefore, it was requested to reject the interim injunction application / notice of motion. [2.9] the interim injunction application was also opposed by the original defendant no.2 by filing detailed reply at exh.30. the defendant no.2 supported the case of the defendant no.1 and made same submissions which were made on behalf of the defendant no.1. [2.10] that thereafter by impugned order the learned commercial court has partly allowed the notice of motion application exhs.6­7 and has granted the temporary injunction in terms of para 38a of the application for interim injunction. clause 38a of the notice of motion exhs.6­7 which has been granted by the learned judge by impugned order as temporary injunction reads as under: \"38a. pending the hearing and final disposal of the present civil suit, this hon'ble court be pleased to restrain each of the defendants by themselves, its directors, servants, representatives, agents, stockists, distributors, retailers etc. from in any manner manufacturing, marketing, selling or advertising for sales thereby passing of the goods viz. maharaja whiteline blizzard 50 and maharaja whiteline blizzard 20 and maharaja whiteline blizzard 50 dlx and maharaja whiteline blizzard 20 dlx;\" that while allowing the notice of motion and granting the injunction in terms of para 38(a) of the notice of motion, the learned judge has observed as under: \"1. that the plaintiff is not only a prior user, but the first who introduced into the market a completely distinct shape which had not been introduced earlier and it is this novelty that has been the engine and cause for numerous sales and the popularity that the plaintif has earned; 2. that the plaintiff has created a good reputation nationally and internationally; 3. that the sales turnover of the plaintiff for the diet model for the year 2009 till 2016 is rs.73,197 lakh in total and that the plaintiff has averred to have spent huge amount on promotion of its business for the year 2014­15 by spending more than rs.3134.23 lakh; 4. that the diet model in question appears to have been registered way back in the year 2009 and therefore, admittedly the plaintiff seems to be a prior user with the goodwill and reputation with respect not only to the other products in question but also with regard to the diet model in question; 5. that as the design registration of the plaintiff and the novelty thereof rests and confined to the surface pattern of the products in question and not to the shape and configuration as submitted by the defendant no.1 cannot be a sole ground to deprive the plaintiff to subserve its legitimate right; 6. that the defendant no.1 appears to have recently launched the product in question in the market as per the invoices issued by the defendant no.1 in favour of the defendant no.2 dated 28.03.2017. even assumed to have launched its product in 2016, then also the product so introduced by the plaintiff is of the year 2009; 7. a comparison of both the products show a striking similarity considering overall structure, phonetic similarity and idea thereto, visual test of products in question.\" making above broad findings / observations the learned commercial court has granted the interim injunction in terms of para 38(a) of the notice of motion exhs.6­7. [2.11] feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court, below notice of motion exhs.6­7, original defendant no.1 has preferred the present appeal from order. [3.0] shri shalin mehta, learned senior advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 and shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate has appeared on behalf of the respondent no.1 herein original plaintiff. [4.0] shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case the learned commercial court has materially erred in allowing the notice of motion exh.6­7 and granting the temporary injunction against the appellant herein original defendant no.1 in terms of para 38(a) of the application for interim injunction. [4.1] it is vehemently submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that as such while granting interim injunction application, the learned commercial court has not properly appreciated and considered the fact that as such the plaintiff had not approached the court with clean hands and as such suppressed the material fact more particularly with respect to the date of knowledge of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 in the market with its products in question viz. maharaja whiteline blizzard 50 and blizzard 50 dlx as also blizzard 20 and blizzard 20 dlx. it is vehemently submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that as such the plaintiff made a false statement in the plaint and interim injunction application to the extent of its knowledge vis­a­vis shape and configuration of the appellant's maharaja whiteline blizzard series of air coolers. it is submitted that the planitiff made a false statement that he become aware of the shape and configuration of the appellant's maharaja blizzard series of air coolers in february 2017. it is submitted that the learned commercial court has failed to appreciate that infact in the cancelation petition filed by the original plaintiff against the original defendant no.1's registered design no.269833, it was admitted by the plaintiff about the knowledge of the appellant's products in question and in the plaint misrepresented its date of knowledge with respect to the said products as february 2017. it is submitted that therefore the learned commercial court ought to have rejected the interim injunction application on the said ground alone as it is a settled proposition of law that a party who conceals and suppress facts from the court is not entitled to any relief, much less any equitable relief. [4.2] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that even otherwise the learned commercial court ought to have appreciated that the delay in bringing an action of passing off also disentitles the plaintiff from the equitable relief of injunction. [4.3] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that even otherwise on merits also the learned commercial court has materially erred in granting the interim injunction in terms of para 38(a) of the interim injunction. [4.4] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that to be successful in an action of passing off, the claimant has to establish classic trinity i.e. (1) reputation and goodwill attached to the goods or services that the claimant supplies goodwill being attached to the badge of origin, (ii) misrepresentation (whether or not intentional) by the defendant to the public leading or likely to lead public to believe that the goods or services offered by the defendant are the goods or services of the claimant and (iii) consquent damage to the goodwill of the claimant. it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that it is a settled principle of law that the absence of even one element of passing off disentitles the claimant from any relief. it is submitted that in the present case the plaintiff has infact failed to establish any element of passing off. it is submitted that therefore the plaintiff has no even prima facie case establishing any of the test of passing off and therefore, the impugned order ought not to have been passed by the learned commercial court. [4.5] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that the learned commercial court has failed to appreciate that the plaintiff had miserably failed to establish that the shape of its 'diet 50t', 'diet 22t', 'diet 50i' and 'diet 22i' air coolers has acquired distinctiveness in the minds of the relevant pubilc as being indicative of the source denoting plaintiff's products and no one else. [4.6] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that the learned commercial court has failed to appreciate that the plaintiff has miserably failed to even prima facie establish goodwill in the shape of its 'diet 50t', 'diet 22t', 'diet 50i' and 'diet 22i' air coolers much less that the said that the said shape of the air coolers has become a source indicator of the plaintiff's products and no one else. [4.7] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that the learned commercial court has materially erred in observing and holding that the plaintiff is a prior user of the shape of the air coolers diet series air coolers. it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that even the plaintiff has failed to establish and prove the goodwill in their favour emanating from the shape of the 'diet series' of air coolers in india. it is submitted that whatever the documents of sale and goodwill are produced are that of foreign countries and not in india. it is submitted that therefore the finding recorded by the learned commercial court that the plaintiff has earned the goodwill with respect to 'diet series' of air coolers and therefore, the learned commercial court has materially erred in granting the injunction in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants. [4.8] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that the learned commercial court has erred in not appreciating that the registration of design of the plaintiff in relation to its air coolers is admittedly in the \"surface pattern\", whereas, the registration of design of the defendant no.1 in relation to its air coolers is in the \"shape and configuration\". it is submitted that therefore the entire action of the plaintiff is completely misplaced and therefore, no injunction could have been granted in favour of the plaintiff. [4.9] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that the learned commercial court has materially erred by wrongly placing reliance on the advertisements placed by the plaintiff for appointing distributors and dealers in india. it is submitted that apart from the fact that the said advertisement was not produced alongwith the plaint even the said advertisements are with respect to the air coolers of all the shapes, dimensions and sizes. it is submitted that therefore these advertisements would have no bearing on the mind of the purchasing public qua the shape of the 'diet series' of air coolers as being a source indicated by the plaintiff. it is submitted that similarly the brochure placed on record by the plaintiff contains air coolers of all shapes, dimensions and sizes and therefore, cannot be considered as indicative of the goodwill of the shape of the 'diet series' of air coolers. it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that as such the learned commercial court has materially erred in equating the goodwill and reputation knowledge by the plaintiff with the goodwill and reputation associated with the shape of 'diet series' air coolers. it is submitted that the same cannot be equated or considered on the same footing. it is further submitted that as such the learned commercial court has not properly appreciated the distinction and difference between the goodwill and reputation. it is submitted that goodwill and reputation are both distinct and separate. it is submitted that in a given case the plaintiff might have got the reputation but may not have acquired / got the goodwill with respect to particular goods with respect to the passing off action. [4.10] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that even otherwise the learned commercial court has materially erred in not properly appreciating the fact that the there can be no misrepresentation or confusion in the mind of purchaser when they go to purchase the air coolers, as the appellant herein original defendant no.1 is selling its products which are subject matter of the many order under its own distinct trade mark / name \"maharaja whiteline\" and the distinct name of the product \"blizzard\" is also prominently displayed on the product. it is submitted that trade mark / name which has been in use by the appellant herein original defendant no.1 since the year 1976 and the defendant no.1 has an annual turnover of approximately 231 crores for the year 2015­16 itself and therefore, the defendant no.1 is a well­known brand with a huge reputation and goodwill amongst the public. it is submitted that thus when the appellant original defendant no.1's goodwill is itself immense, the likelihood of public confusing the defendant no.1's good as those of the plaintiff or being associated with the plaintiff is negligible.

[5.3] it is further submitted by shri trivedi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such goodwill signifies the value of business in terms of turnover. it is submitted that reputation follows the goodwill. it is submitted that the plaintiff has both, goodwill and also reputation and therefore, the learned commercial court has rightly granted the injunction against the defendant no.1 with respect to the products in question. [5.4] shri trivedi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has taken us to findings recorded by the learned commercial court on prior user, on the plaintiff's acqiuring goodwill and reputation and also the goodwill with respect to their diet series air coolers more particularly with respect to the shape unique shape and tower coolers and the relevant documents / material on record which should have been considered by the learned commercial court. [5.5] it is further submitted by shri trivedi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such the suit is for passing off action and the injunction is against the defendants for passing off their goods in question. it is submitted that while considering the case for passing off only, as per catena of decisions of the hon'ble supreme court as well as this court only the particular similarities are to be looked at and the microscopic dissimilarities are not required to be considered. it is submitted that by and large overall similarities are to be considered. it is submitted that on considering both the products in question the learned commercial court has specifically given a finding that both the products products in question of the plaintiff as well as products in question of the defendant no.1 are by and large having overall similarities. it is submitted that therefore when there are by and large overall similarities there are all chances of confusion amongst the people purchasing air coolers and therefore, the learned commercial court has rightly granted the injunction. [5.6] it is further submitted by shri trivedi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such there are no suppression of material facts more particularly with respect to the date of knowledge of goods in question of the defendant no.1 as alleged on behalf of the defendant no.1. for the aforesaid he has taken us to the relevant documents / material on record namely cancelation petition as well as the averments in the plaint as well as the rejoinder before the learned commercial court on the allegation of suppression. it is submitted that therefore it can be said that defendant no.1 is not right in submitting that the plaintiff is not entitled for grant of relief on the ground of suppression of material facts. it is submitted that as such the design of the air coolers by the defendant no.1 was converted into blizzard model only in the month of february 2017. it is submitted that even otherwise it makes no difference whether the defendant no.1 is in market since 2016 and/or in 2017 as such the plaintiff is in the market of selling the diet series air coolers since 2009. it is submitted that as such in the year 2009 the defendant no.1 was not even born. [5.7] it is further submitted by shri trivedi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such the plaintiff has been successful in proving prima facie at this stage their goodwill and repuation and even with respect to the diet coolers. [5.8] it is further submitted by shri trivedi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original planitiff that while considering the action for passing off and grant of injunction on the allegation of passing off, mere representation is enough and the intention is not required to be proved. [5.9] it is further submitted by shri trivedi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such the defendant no.1 has not explained why the defendant no.1 has chosen the tower wall design of the air cooler and why not other shape. it is submitted that they should have adopted other shape. it is submitted that aforesaid shows the intention on the part of the defendant no.1 in passing off of their goods deceptively with that of the plaintiff's goods. [5.10] it is further submitted that in case of passing off and grant of injunction likelihood of damages itself is sufficient. it is submitted that mere likelihood is more than sufficient while granting the injunction.

[6.1] having found prima facie case and balance of convenience etc. and having found prima facie case that the air­coolers manufactured and being sold by the defendants ­ maharaja whiteline blizzard 50, maharaja whiteline blizzard 20, maharaja blizzard 50dlx and maharaja whiteline blizzard 20 dlx are deceptively similar to that of the design / tower models diet models designed, manufactured and sold by the plaintiffs, by impugned order the learned commercial court has granted the injunction against the defendants. [6.2] that while considering the impugned order the findings recorded by the learned commercial court are required to be referred to and considered, which are as under: (1) that the plaintiff company is in the business of marketing, selling, trading and exporting a range of air coolers and pioneer in establishing or marketing or producing or manufacturing the plastic body air coolers; (2) that the definition of \"mark\" under section 2(z) of the trade marks act include shape of goods; (3) that the plaintiff is operating under the trade name of \"symphony\" and the company's total turn over exceeded approximately rs.523.98 crores; (4) that the plaintiffs, its directors got design of the questioned product registered under the provisions of the design act, 2000; (5) that the plaintiff is pioneer in manufacturing of air­coolers etc. and the plaintiff has been given iso certification; (6) that design of each model has been registered; (7) that the defendant has got the design of the air­cooler in question registered in the year 2015, whereas the plaintiff have got registration of the design in the year 2009 and since then the plaintiff has been selling and manufacturing and exporting the products in question; (8) that the plaintiff is prior user and the first who introduced into the market a completely distinct shape which has not been introduced earlier; (9) that the plaintiff had received an award being a quality marks award 2014 for his \"diet\" model 22t and thereby has created good reputation nationally and internationally. [6.3] it is also further observed by the learned commercial court in paras 99 to 103 as under: \"99. it is pertinent to note here that since the issue on hand is for consideration of action of passing of and therefore the said action can be said to be a recurring action and based on common law rights. however, the entire issue rests on the overall shape, configuration, get­up and appearance of the products in question and the possibility of deceit and confusion in the minds of purchasers. thus, admittedly considering the issue on hand which pertains to passing of action, the plaintif is required to prove that the plaintif is a prior user, adopter, prior registered proprietor of the design in question who admittedly appears to have sold the products in question in the market and its sales turnover runs into crores of rupees and sales promotional expenses also in lacs of rupees whereas the defendant no.1 though appears to have been 60 engaged in the manufacturing and selling the products of home appliances, however considering the products in question disputed products, the defendants appear to have launched the products as acquainted by the plaintif since september 2016 (or january 2016). thus, the defendants, so far as the products in question are concerned, seems to be new comer who appears to harp over and to take the advantage of the reputation and association of the plaintif's products which amounts to an act of passing of. comparison of both the products visually: 100. to meet with the issue as raised by the defendants pertains to the products in question manufactured and developed by the defendant no.1, a completely distinct, both visually and aesthetically from that of the plaintif and no case for any confusion, much less deceit and also on account of the shape, configuration on the ground that the product of the plaintif have attained a secondary meaning and pattern of the product and resemblance thereof with the shape, configuration, pattern of the plaintif's products and the issue as to the product, if placed side by side as well as on independent comparison of both the products, it cannot be said that the product of the defendant no.1 is leading and/or likely to lead general public to believe that the goods ofered by defendant no.1 are of the plaintif. 61 thus, the aforesaid issues in the form of submissions, are required to be dealt with in compass of the entire material placed for consideration on record. 101. it is not in dispute that the whole case of the plaintif rests on the shape, configuration, pattern, etc. as to the product in question as disputed by the defendant no.1. at the outset, it is to state that at the joint request made by the learned senior advocates appearing for the respective parties seeking permission to produce their respective products before the court vide exh.27 and therefore this court while conceding the request, has had an occasion to see both the products in question which were brought before this court during the course of hearing and therefore the question whether the two are deceptively similar or not, the test, as held by several high courts is, what appeals to the eye of the judge on the first impression and therefore, the first impression has to be of a person with average intelligence and/or imperfect recollection. 102. even during the course of hearing, the learned senior advocate appearing for the defendant no.1 has tried to distinguish and show the dissimilarities between the products in question while referring the front view, rear view, upper view and lower view. however, the said test is to be applied and pertains to the infringement of the design under section 22 of the designs act, 2000 which at the most may fall under the category and issue of 62 fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof which amounts to an act of piracy and/or infringement. therefore, this court in the preamble of this order has made it categorically clear that several contentions raised by the learned senior advocates appearing for the respective parties which pertains to the infringement of the design would not be entertained as the entire gamut of the case on hand is dispute as to passing of which only rests on the shape, configuration and overall appearance of the products in question. in nutshell, a comparison of both the products show a striking similarity, however eforts seems to have been made by the learned senior advocate appearing for the defendant no.1 to show dissimilarities, but considering the test requires to be adopted is to see the salient features, overall similarity, is the touch­stone, mark or product must be viewed by observing overall structure, phonetic similarity and idea thereto, visual test of products in question. in short mark must be compared as a whole instead of microscopic examination as the products are placed side by side only to find out diference as overall similarity as appearing in case on hand, is sufficient. 103. apart from the goodwill and turnover of the products in question and in furtherance thereof as to the substantial goodwill and reputation inheres in the plaintif's products in question which seems to have been launched way back in the year 2009 and the 63 very fact has not been disputed by the defendants. not only that, at the relevant time, no other product as launched by the plaintif and with the similar comparable shape/appearance existed in the market prior to the introduction thereof by the plaintif. thus, the product in question so launched by the plaintif at the relevant time acquired a distinctive shape and/or get­up and/or colour scheme and/or overall appearance (surface pattern) cannot be disputed.\" it is further observed in paras 105 to 107 as under: \"105. in furtherance of the aforesaid aspect, even the product in question introduced by the plaintif at the relevant time wherein prior thereto, no such product or similar thereof or comparable shape and overall appeals existed and the gestures of the plaintif while launching such product completely amounts to a revolutionary and of distinct shape which had not been introduced earlier and therefore, the same can be termed as a novelty itself of the product in question which generated a huge sale and popularity. 106. though the eforts seems to have been made by the defendant no.1 by placing forward the ground as to the product in question being commonly known / design having overall similar appearance as that of the impugned design of the plaintif having been so granted in favour of lesko holdings by the uspto in 2006. however, while perusing the material in support of its contention, it prima facie appears that the said image, the xerox copy of which has been produced by the defendant no.1, is a body for a vertical fan whereas the impugned product in question is an air cooler. 107. not only that, the overall appearance of the said product, comparing with the impugned product, stands on a diferent footing. thus, the protest so lodged by the defendant no.1 while placing forward the aforesaid product to disentitle the claim of the plaintif with regard to the impugned product, would not come to the rescue of the contention of the defendant no.1 as the defendant no.1 seems to have launched its product admittedly in january 2016 whereas the product of the plaintif in question, as discussed hereinabove, was launched in 2009 and at that time, no other product with the similar or comparable shape and/or overall appearance existed in the market prior to the introduction thereof by the plaintif and the very existence amounts to goodwill and/or reputation in the shape and/or overall appearance of the product in question.\" [6.4] considering the findings recorded which are prima facie on appreciation of evidence / material on record and thereafter having opined / observed that the case for passing off is made out and thereafter the learned commercial judge has granted the interim injunction as prayed for in terms of para 38a, we are of the opinion that it cannot be said that the learned judge has committed any error. the findings recorded by the learned commercial court are on appreciation of evidence and having found prima facie case, balance of convenience etc. once having found the deceptive similarity between the products in question of the plaintiffs and the products in question of the defendants and having found that the plaintiffs introduced the design first time of a tower model diet model which had earned a reputation, goodwill etc. and the plaintiff is in prior use of the said design / models and having given the aforesaid findings, we are of the opinion that the case of passing off has been made out and therefore, the learned commercial court has rightly granted the injunction referred to hereinabove. [6.5] number of decisions have been cited by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties referred to hereinabove. however, all the decisions are required to be considered in the facts and circumstances of the case and a prima facie case being made out, considering the principles to be considered while granting the case of passing off. therefore, we are of the opinion that though we agree with the proposition of law laid down in the cited decisions relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, same shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand more particularly with respect to the findings arrived at by the learned commercial court referred to hereinabove. [6.6] we are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned commercial court. no interference of this court is called for against the impugned interim injunction granted by the learned commercial court. [7.0] in view of the above and for the reasons stated above, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court. under the circumstances, present appeal from order deserves to be dismissed and is, accordingly, dismissed. being a commercial dispute arising out of the commercial courts act, the learned judge, commercial court is directed to decide and dispose of the suit at the earliest. all concerned are directed to cooperate the learned commercial court in early disposal of the suit being a commercial dispute. it is observed that findings recorded by the learned commercial court and confirmed by this court are to be treated and considered as prima facie while deciding applications exh.6­7 and the learned commercial court to decide and dispose of the suit in accordance with law and on its own merits. with this, present appeal from order stands dismissed. civil application no.1 of 2017 in view of dismissal of main appeal from order, present civil application also stands dismissed. sd/­ (m.r. shah, j.) sd/­ (a.y. kogje, j.) further order after the pronouncement of the judgment, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant original defendant requests to extend the interim relief granted earlier. in the facts and circumstances of the case, interim relief granted earlier to continue till 20.08.2018. sd/­ (m.r. shah, j.) sd/­ (a.y. kogje, j.) ajay**"
