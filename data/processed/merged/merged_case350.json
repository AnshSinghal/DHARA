Upadhyay, Sr. Advocate with Mr. Ankit Pandey, Advocate.\n(In W.P.(227) No.415/2021) For Petitioner :Mr. S.B. Upadhyay, Sr. Advocate with Mr. Ankit Pandey, Advocate. \nFor Respondents :Mr. Kishore Bhaduri, Sr. Advocate with Mr. Sunny Agrawal and Mr. Vivek Chopda, Advocates. \nHon'ble Shri Justice Rajendra Chandra Singh Samant Cav Order 17/11/2021\n1. Both the petitions under Article 227 of Constitution of India have been brought challenging the order dated 07.07.2021 passed by the learned Commercial Court (District level), Atal Nagar, Naya Raipur, C.G., by which the learned Commercial Court has held that Commercial Court in Naya Raipur does not have the territorial jurisdiction to decide the reference.\n2. The petitioners in W.P.(227) No.393/2021 shall be referred to as 'petitioners' and the respondent in this petition, who is also petitioner in W.P.(227) No.415/2021 shall be referred to as 'respondent' in this order. \n3. The brief facts of the case are these that after the completion of tender process of the work order was issued to the respondent M/s Shri Balaji Metals & Minerals Pvt. Ltd. As on 16.07.2007, the cost of the work was Rs.50,17,19,700/-. The time fixed for completion of work was 3 years, but the contract could not be completed and the contract was terminated by the petitioner vide order dated 31.08.2009. The left over work was completed by a third party according to the terms of contract. \n4. The notice of recovery was issued against the respondent. \nRespondent raised objection and brought for consideration of the Committee as per the clause 12 of the contract. The petitioner constituted such Committee which was to submit a report with respect to the dispute present between the parties. The respondents then preferred a Writ Petition before the High Court which was disposed off by the High Court on 05.07.2012 by issuing some directions. As per the direction issued, the Committee which was constituted, heard both the parties and passed award on 31.12.2012 holding the decision of the petitioner regarding termination of contract and regarding issuance of notice for recovery of amount as legal and correct. \n5. The respondent then again moved an application before the High Court of Chhattisgarh seeking modification of order dated 05.07.2012 in the Writ Petition which was disposed off vide order dated 07.01.2013, holding that the respondent shall have the liberty to raise objection before the appropriate forum under the Arbitration and conciliation Act, 1996 i.e. before the Commercial Court at Naya Raipur, C.G. against the award of the Committee dated 31.12.2012. The Commercial Court, Raipur in the initial round allowed the application and the award of the Committee dated 31.12.2012 was set aside vide order dated 24.01.2017 holding that the Committee constituted was not in accordance with the law. The petitioner then preferred appeal before the High Court under Section 37 of  the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act, 1996') which was dismissed and the order passed by the Commercial Court was affirmed. \n6. The petitioner then filed a Special Leave Petition (C.) No.16988 of 2018 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. This S.L.P. was decided by the Supreme Court vide order dated 20.07.2018 by which all the earlier orders passed were set aside, a sole Arbitrator was appointed for arbitrating on the dispute present between the parties, in which the venue of the arbitration was fixed at New Delhi. The sole Arbitrator Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ashok Kumar Mathur, former Judge of Hon'ble Supreme Court, proceeded with the arbitration and passed the award dated 28.01.2020. This award was challenged before the Commercial Court, District level, Nava Raipur, C.G. It is in that proceeding, the learned Commercial Court has held that the Court is not vested with territorial jurisdiction to decide the issue present between the parties. \n7. It is submitted by the learned Senior counsel for the petitioner that the learned Commercial Court has erroneously relied upon the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of B.G.S. S.G.S. Soma J.V. Vs. N.H.P.C. Limited reported in (2020) 4 Supreme Court Cases 234. The place of sitting of the sole Arbitrator was decided by the Supreme Court only for the convenience of the learned Arbitrator. Whereas, the dispute between the parties has arisen in Chhattisgarh. It is submitted that it was only the venue of Arbitration for which the parties had agreed that it should be in Delhi for the convenience of the Hon'ble Arbitrator. \n8. Initially the arbitration award was passed by the Committee constituted by the petitioner in Chhattisgarh State and the same was challenged before the learned Commercial Court of Chhattisgarh State, which was decided by the Commercial Court itself. Therefore, the Commercial Court, Raipur is the only Court which has jurisdiction to entertain the application under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act, 1996'). Hence, this petition is fit to be entertained, therefore, relief is prayed for. \n9. Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent submits in reply to opposes the submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner and submits that the arbitration in the present case was held in Delhi. Respondent has already filed an application under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 in the Court at Delhi. According to the judgment in B.G.S. S.G.S. Soma J.V. Vs. N.H.P.C. Limited (Supra), both the Courts in Raipur as well as in Delhi have jurisdiction to entertain the application under Section 34 of the Act, 1996. The learned Commercial Court has held that both the parties have chosen Delhi as Seat of Arbitration as provided under Section 20(1) of the Act, 1996. It is submitted that according to the contract between the parties, both the parties have agreed for the Seat of Arbitration to be within the jurisdiction of Commercial Court at Raipur. The learned Commercial Court has misconstrued the venue of arbitration to be Seat of Arbitration. \n10.Reliance has been placed on the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of Swastik Gases Private Limited Vs. Indian Oil Corporation Limited reported in (2013) 9 Supreme Court Cases 32, in which it is very clearly held, that when the parties have agreed to the contract specifying the jurisdiction of the Court of a particular place, that is a clause in the agreement in exclusion of all the other Courts. \n11. Reliance has also been placed on the judgment of supreme Court in the case of Hindustan Construction Company Limited Vs. N.H.P.C. Limited & Anr. reported in (2020) 4 Supreme Court Cases 310, Brahmani River Pellets Limited Vs. Kamachi Industries Limited reported in (2020) 5 SCC 462, Indus Mobile Distribution Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Datawind Innovations Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. reported in (2017) 7 Supreme Court Cases 678, Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. Vs. Girdhar Sondhi reported in (2018) 9 Supreme Court Cases 49.\n12.It is further submitted by the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent that the order of the Supreme Court directing the place for arbitration for the convenience of the learned Arbitrator is meant only to describe the venue of the arbitration and that should not be considered as Seat of Arbitration. Hence, clearly the B.G.S. S.G.S. Soma J.V. Vs. N.H.P.C. Limited (Supra) Case shall not be applicable. It is only the Seat at Bilaspur as agreed by the parties, where the jurisdiction vests with the Commercial Court at Raipur, because there is no such Court present, and functioning in Bilaspur. Hence, the impugned order is not sustainable. \n13.In reply, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submits that the order of the Supreme Court and the S.L.P. cannot be regarded as having effect to oust the clause 32 of agreement between the parties. Hence, the impugned order is not sustainable. \n14.Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the documents present on record. \n15.The prayer in both the petitions is for quashing the impugned order. The order that was passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.6852 of 2018 passed on 20.07.2018 regarding appointment of the sole arbitrator. \n16.The petitioner and the respondent both being aggrieved by the arbitration award dated 28.01.2020 passed by the learned Arbitrator filed separate applications under Section 34 of Act, 1996. The application of the petitioner was registered as Arbitration M.J.C. No.14/2020 and the application of the respondent was registered as Arbitration M.J.C. No.06/2020. The learned Commercial Court by its own notion framed a legal question, whether the Commercial Court at Raipur has the territorial jurisdiction to consider and decide the applications filed by both the parties. In the impugned order, the learned Commercial Court made observation to this fact that both the parties had agreed that the seat for arbitration under Section 20 (1) of the Act, 1996 shall be at Delhi and on that basis, the impugned order was passed.\n17.As per the submissions made by the learned counsel for both the parties , the seat for arbitration and venue for arbitration both have different meaning. The Supreme Court has in the case of B.G.S. S.G.S. Soma J.V. Vs. N.H.P.C. Limited (Supra) case held in paragraph 82 :-\n\"82.On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments , it may be concluded that whenever there is the designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the \"venue\" of the arbitration proceedings, the expression \"arbitration proceedings\"\nwould make it clear that the \"venue\" is really the \"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression does not include just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award at that place. This language has to be contrasted with language such as \"tribunals are to meet or have witnesses, experts or the parties\" where only hearings are to take place in the \"venue\", which may lead to the conclusion, other things being equal, that the venue so stated is not the \"seat\" of arbitral proceedings, but only a convenient place of meeting. Further, the fact that the arbitral proceedings \"shall be held\" at a particular venue would also indicate that the parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby, that that place is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled with there being no other significant contrary indicia that the stated venue is merely a \"venue\" and not the \"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings, would then conclusively show that such a clause designates a \"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings. In an International context, if a supranational body of rules is to govern the arbitration, this would further be an indicia that \"the venue\", so stated, would be the seat of the arbitral proceedings. In a national context, this would be replaced by the Arbitration Act, 1996 as applying to the \"stated venue\", which then becomes the \"seat\" for the purposes of arbitration.\"\n18.Similarly, in the case of Swastik Gases Private Limited Vs. Indian Oil Corporation Limited (Supra) , it was held in paragraph 32 by the Supreme Court which is as follows:-\n\"32.For answer to the above question, we have to see the effect of the jurisdiction clause in the agreement which provides that the agreement shall be subject to jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata. It is a fact that whilst providing for jurisdiction clause in the agreement the words like 'alone', 'only', 'exclusive' or 'exclusive jurisdiction' have not been used but this, in our view, is not decisive and does not make any material difference. The intention of the parties - by having clause 18 in the agreement - is clear and unambiguous that the courts at Kolkata shall have jurisdiction which means that the courts at Kolkata alone shall have jurisdiction. It is so because for construction of jurisdiction clause, like clause 18 in the agreement, the maxim expression unius est exclusio alterius comes into play as there is nothing to indicate to the contrary. This legal maxim means that expression of one is the exclusion of another. By making a provision that the agreement is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata, the parties have impliedly excluded the jurisdiction of other courts. Where the contract specifies the jurisdiction of the courts at a particular place and such courts have jurisdiction to deal with the matter, we think that an inference may be drawn that parties intended to exclude all other courts. A clause like this is not hit by Section 23 of the Contract Act at all. Such clause is neither forbidden by law nor it is against the public policy. It does not offend Section 28 of the Contract Act in any manner.\" \n19.In the case of Hindustan Construction Company Limited Vs. N.H.P.C. Limited (Supra) referring to the judgment in B.G.S. S.G.S. Soma J.V. Vs. N.H.P.C. Limited (Supra), it was held that where a seat is designated in an agreement, the Courts of that place alone have jurisdiction. \n20.Later on in the case of Brahmani River Pellets Limited Vs. Kamachi Industries Limited (Supra), the Supreme Court has held in paragraph 15.4 as under:-\n\"15. XXX 15.1. XXX 15.2. XXX 15.3. XXX 15.4 Pointing out that the words like \"alone\", \"only\", \"exclusive\" or \"exclusive jurisdiction\" have not been used in the agreement and use of such words is not decisive and non-use of such words does not make any material difference as to the intention of the parties by having clause 18 of the agreement that the courts at Kolkata shall have the jurisdiction, the Supreme Court held as under:-\n\"31. In the instant case, the appellant does not dispute that part of cause of action has arisen in Kolkata. What appellant says is that part of cause of action has also arisen in Jaipur and, therefore, the Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court or the designate Judge has jurisdiction to consider the application made by the appellant for the appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11. Having regard to Section 11(12)(b) and Section 2(e) of the 1996 Act read with Section 20(c) of the Code, there remains no doubt that the Chief Justice or the designate Judge of the Rajasthan High Court has jurisdiction in the matter. The question is, whether parties by virtue of Clause 18 of the agreement have agreed to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts at Jaipur or, in other words, whether in view of Clause 18 of the agreement, the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court has been excluded?\n32. For answer to the above question, we have to see the effect of the jurisdiction clause in the agreement which provides that the agreement shall be subject to jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata. It is a fact that whilst providing for jurisdiction clause in the agreement the words like \"alone\", \"only\", \"exclusive\" or \"exclusive jurisdiction\" have not been used but this, in our view, is not decisive and does not make any material difference. The intention of the parties--by having Clause 18 in the agreement-- is clear and unambiguous that the courts at Kolkata shall have jurisdiction which means that the courts at Kolkata alone shall have jurisdiction. It is so because for construction of jurisdiction clause, like Clause 18 in the agreement, the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius comes into play as there is nothing to indicate to the contrary. This legal maxim means that expression of one is the exclusion of another. By making a provision that the agreement is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata, the parties have impliedly excluded the jurisdiction of other courts. Where the contract specifies the jurisdiction of the courts at a particular place and such courts have jurisdiction to deal with the matter, we think that an inference may be drawn that parties intended to exclude all other courts. A clause like this is not hit by Section 23 of the Contract Act at all. Such clause is neither forbidden by law nor it is against the public policy. It does not offend Section 28 of the Contract Act in any manner. \n33. The above view finds support from the decisions of this Court in Hakam Singh v. Gammon India Limited (1971) 1 SCC 286, A.B.C. Laminart Private Limited v.\nA.B.C. Agencies (1989) 2 SCC 163, R.S.D.V. Finance Corporation Private Limited v. Shree Vallabh Glass Works Limited (1993) 2 SCC 130, Angile Insulations v. Davy Ashomore India Limited (1995) 4 SCC 153, Shriram City Union Finance Corporation Limited v. Rama Mishra (2002) 9 SCC 613, Hanil Era Textiles Limited v. Puromatic Filters Private Limited (2004) 4 SCC 671 and Balaji Coke Industry Private Limited v. Maa Bhagwati Coke Gujarat Private Limited (2009) 9 SCC 403.\" \n21.In the case of Swastik Gases Private Limited Vs. Indian Oil Corporation Limited (Supra), it has been held by the Court in paragraph 16 as follows:-\n\"16.The question under consideration in Angile Insulations[6] was whether the court of subordinate judge, Dhanbad possessed the jurisdiction to entertain and hear the suit filed by the appellant for recovery of certain amounts due from the first respondent. Clause 21 of the agreement therein read, \"This work order is issued subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court situated in Banglaore in the State of Karnataka.....\". \nThis Court relied upon A.B.C. Laminart1 and held that having regard to clause 21 of the work order which was legal and valid, the parties had agreed to vest the jurisdiction of the court situated within the territorial limit of High Court of Karnataka and, therefore, the court of subordinate judge, Dhanbad in Bihar did not have jurisdiction to entertain the suit filed by the appellant therein.\"\n22.In the case of Indus Mobile Distribution Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Datawind Innovations Pvt. Ltd. (Supra), the Supreme Court made a clear distinction between the seat of arbitration and venue of arbitration in the paragraph 17, 18, 19 and 20 as follows:-\n\"17.In amendments to be made to the Act, the Law Commission recommended the following:\n\"Amendment of Section 20 12.In section 20, delete the word \"Place\" and add the words \"Seat and Venue\" before the words \"of arbitration\". \n(i) In sub-section (1), after the words \"agree on the\"\ndelete the word \"place\" and add words \"seat and venue\"\n(ii) In sub-section (3), after the words \"meet at any\"\ndelete the word \"place\" and add word \"venue\".\n[NOTE: The departure from the existing phrase \"place\" of arbitration is proposed to make the wording of the Act consistent with the international usage of the concept of a \"seat\" of arbitration, to denote the legal home of the arbitration. The amendment further legislatively distinguishes between the \"[legal] seat\"\nfrom a \"[mere] venue\" of arbitration.] Amendment of Section 31 17.In section 31 (i) In sub-section (4), after the words \"its date and the\"\ndelete the word \"place\" and add the word \"seat\".\" \n18. The amended Act, does not, however, contain the aforesaid amendments, presumably because the BALCO judgment in no uncertain terms has referred to \"place\" as \"juridical seat\" for the purpose of Section 2(2) of the Act. It further made it clear that Section 20(1) and 20 (2) where the word \"place\" is used, refers to \"juridical seat\", whereas in Section 20 (3), the word \"place\" is equivalent to \"venue\". This being the settled law, it was found unnecessary to expressly incorporate what the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has already done by way of construction of the Act. \n19. A conspectus of all the aforesaid provisions shows that the moment the seat is designated, it is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. On the facts of the present case, it is clear that the seat of arbitration is Mumbai and Clause 19 further makes it clear that jurisdiction exclusively vests in the Mumbai courts. Under the Law of Arbitration, unlike the Code of Civil Procedure which applies to suits filed in courts, a reference to \"seat\" is a concept by which a neutral venue can be chosen by the parties to an arbitration clause. The neutral venue may not in the classical sense have jurisdiction - that is, no part of the cause of action may have arisen at the neutral venue and neither would any of the provisions of Section 16 to 21 of the CPC be attracted. In arbitration law however, as has been held above, the moment \"seat\" is determined, the fact that the seat is at Mumbai would vest Mumbai courts with exclusive jurisdiction for purposes of regulating arbitral proceedings arising out of the agreement between the parties. \n20. It is well settled that where more than one court has jurisdiction, it is open for parties to exclude all other courts. For an exhaustive analysis of the case law, see Swastik Gases Private Limited v. Indian Oil Corporation Limited, (2013) 9 SCC 32. This was followed in a recent judgment in B.E. Simoese Von Staraburg Niedenthal and Another v. Chhattisgarh Investment Limited, (2015) 12 SCC 225. Having regard to the above, it is clear that Mumbai courts alone have jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts in the country, as the juridical seat of arbitration is at Mumbai. This being the case, the impugned judgment is set aside. The injunction confirmed by the impugned judgment will continue for a period of four weeks from the date of pronouncement of this judgment, so that the respondents may take necessary steps under Section 9 in the Mumbai Court.\"\n23.It is in another dispute, that in the contract, both the parties had agreed for the Seat of Arbitration to be at Bilaspur only, under the contract clause 32. The dispute raised by the respondent was earlier decided by the Committee arbitrating the case leading to continuation of litigation which reached finality before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Supreme Court then with a purpose to make settlement between parties by the order dated 20.07.2018 in Civil Appeal No.6852 of 2018 set aside by the earlier orders and directed the fresh arbitration on the case by appointment of Hon'ble Shri Justice Ashok Kumar Mathur, the former Judge of Supreme Court and it was for his convenience that the Seat of Arbitration was directed to be held in Delhi. This order of Supreme Court cannot be regarded as having an effect to nullify the agreement Clause 32 present between the parties. The place of sitting of arbitrator in this case particularly, can be regarded as venue of arbitration only. The seat of arbitration as agreed between the parties is certainly at Bilaspur. \n24.A clear distinction has been made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court regarding the terms of venue of arbitration and Seat of Arbitration in the case of Indus Mobile Distribution Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Datawind Innovations Pvt. Ltd. (Supra). The view in the case of Swastik Gases Private Limited Vs. Indian Oil Corporation Limited (Supra) has been affirmed in the case of Indus Mobile Distribution Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Datawind Innovations Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) judgment. Further, the Supreme Court has in the case of B.G.S. S.G.S. Soma J.V. Vs. N.H.P.C. Limited (Supra) judgment, has relied upon the judgment in the case of Indus Mobile Distribution Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Datawind Innovations Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) and no distinction was made. \n25.Hence, I am of this view that the learned Commercial Court has committed an error in holding, that it is not vested with jurisdiction to consider on the applications filed by the parties. The venue of jurisdiction has been misconstrued as the seat of jurisdiction whereas the seat of jurisdiction, between the parties is clearly Bilaspur according to the Clause present in the contract agreement. Therefore, the commercial Court at Nava Raipur, C.G. clearly has jurisdiction to entertain for hearing the application filed under Section 34 of the Act, 1996, as there is no such Court in Bilaspur. \n26.Hence, on the basis of the observations made here-in-above and the conclusion drawn, both the petitions filed are allowed and disposed off at the motion stage. The impugned orders in both the cases are set aside. The learned Commercial Court Naya Raipur, C.G. is directed to provide opportunity of hearing on the applications filed by both the parties under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 in accordance with law and dispose off the case at the earliest. \n27.Accordingly, both the petitions are disposed off. \nSd/-\n(Rajendra Chandra Singh Samant) Judge Monika",

order dated 21.5.2022 passed by the commercial court no.1, jodhpur (for short 'the commercial court') whereby, it has rejected the application under section 47 of the cpc filed by the petitioner-firm raising certain (2 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] objections in the execution petition filed on behalf of the respondent. brief facts of the case are that as per the respondent, the petitioner-firm had purchased goods from the respondent, however, it has failed to make payment within the stipulated time and, therefore, under the provisions of section 18(1) of the micro, small and medium enterprises development act, 2006 (for short 'the act of 2006'), the respondent has moved an application before the micro and small enterprises facilitation council (for short 'the msefc') on 27.2.2020 complaining regarding non-payment of the goods by the petitioner-firm. the msefc has issued notice to the petitioner-firm advising it to make payment of the due amount as mentioned immediately and in no case, later than 15 days from the date of receipt of notice with a caution that failing which, a case will be registered against it by the msefc. it appears that later on, the msefc has initiated conciliation proceedings as provided under section 18(2) of the act of 2006, however, the conciliation efforts failed and the msefc has decided to proceed under section 18(3) of the act of 2006 and ultimately has passed the award dated 13.9.2021 and directed the petitioner-firm to pay the original amount of rs.8,549,565/along with interest to the tune of rs.4,757,117/-, total

times of compound interest on the prevalent rate of interest as determined by the reserve bank of india. it is also mentioned in the award dated 13.9.2021 that the same has been passed pursuant to the decision taken in the sixth meeting of the msefc held on 24.3.2021. being aggrieved with the award dated 13.9.2021, the petitioner-firm has preferred sbcwp no.371/2022 before this court, however, the learned single judge of this court vide order dated 12.1.2022 has dismissed the aforesaid writ petition on the ground of availability of alternative/statutory remedy to the petitioner-firm to challenge the award dated 13.9.2021 under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (for short 'the act of 1996'). the order dated 12.1.2022 reads as under : \"1. by way of present writ petition, the petitioner has challenged the order dated 13.09.2021, which is required to be treated as an award, in terms of section 18 of the micro, small and medium enterprises act, 2006 (for short, 'the act of 2006'). 2. mr. akshat verma, learned counsel for the petitioner, argued that the award under challenge has been passed by two arbitrators, which is clearly contrary to section 10 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (for short, 'the act of 1996') inasmuch as, number of arbitrators are required to be in odd numbers. 3. it is also contended that immediately after receiving the notice of reference, the petitioner had sent a mail that he was indisposed and yet petitioner's request was (4 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] not acceded to by the arbitrators and impugned award came to be passed. 4. without pronouncing anything upon the merits of the petitioner's contention, suffice it to observe that in terms of section 18(3) of the act of 2006, the award in question is required to be governed by the act of 1996 and, therefore, the petitioner is supposed to challenge the same in terms of section 34 of the act of 1996 on all possible grounds including the one that has been canvassed before this court. 5. in the face of availability of alternative/statutory remedy, this court refuses to exercise its jurisdiction under article 226 of the constitution of india. 6. the writ petition, therefore, fails. 7. the stay application also stands disposed of accordingly. 8. it goes without saying that the petitioner shall be free to avail his remedies in accordance with law.\" the petitioner-firm, has thereafter, filed an appeal under section 34 of the act of 1996 before the commercial court and it has directed the petitioner-firm to deposit 75% of the award amount as per section 19 of the act of 2006. being aggrieved with the same, the petitioner-firm has preferred sbcwp no.5022/2022 before this court and this court vide order dated 26.4.2022 has disposed of the aforesaid writ petition while passing the following order : \"this writ petition has been filed on behalf of the petitioner-firm being aggrieved with the order dated 24.03.2022 passed by the commercial court no.1, jodhpur (hereinafter to be referred as 'the trial court'), whereby the trial court while (5 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] entertaining the appeal filed by the petitioner-firm against the arbitration award dated 13.09.2021 issued by the office of commissioner industries, micro and small enterprises facilitation council, headquarter-first, jaipur has directed the petitioner-firm to deposit 75% of the award amount as per section 19 of the micro, small and medium enterprises development act, 2006. learned counsel for the petitioner-firm has submitted that the trial court while directing the petitioner-firm to deposit 75% of the award amount has failed to take into consideration the financial condition of the petitioner-firm. it is also submitted that on account of covid-19 pandemic, the financial condition of the petitioner-firm is poor and it is difficult for it to deposit 75% of the award amount in one go. learned counsel for the petitioner-firm has submitted that the petitioner-firm is ready to deposit 75% of the award amount before the trial court in three monthly installments. learned counsel for the petitioner-firm undertakes that the petitioner-firm will deposit first installment on 02.05.2022, second installment on 01.06.2022 and third/last installment on 01.07.2022. learned counsel for the respondentfirm initially has opposed the prayer of the petitioner-firm, however, later on, agreed to grant time to the petitioner-firm to deposit 75% of the award amount in three monthly installments as suggested herein above by learned counsel for the petitioner-firm. in view of the above, this writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner-firm to deposit 75% of the award amount i.e. rs.99,80,011/(rupees ninety nine lacs eighty thousand eleven) in three installments before the trial court as per the following schedule :(6 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] three installments date of amount of installments installments deposit first installment 02.05.2022 rs.30,00,000/second installment 01.06.2022 rs.30,00,000/third/last installment 01.07.2022 rs.39,80,011/it is made clear, if the petitioner-firm makes any default in payment of any of the installments as directed above, the appeal preferred by it before the trial court shall automatically be dismissed. the trial court shall disburse the predeposit amount in favour of the respondentfirm as per its discretion. the petitioner-firm shall furnish an undertaking in writing before the trial court to the effect that till pendency of the appeal filed by it before the trial court, it shall not alienate any of its property. stay petition also stands disposed of.\" it is revealed that the petitioner-firm has not deposited 75% of the award amount as per the directions given by this court vide order dated 26.4.2022 and the appeal preferred by the petitioner-firm came to be dismissed as observed in the said order. in the meantime, the respondent has preferred execution petition before the commercial court and in those proceedings, the petitioner-firm has filed certain objections by moving an application under section 47 of the cpc. in the said application, the petitioner-firm has raised mainly three objections, which read as under : (7 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] (a) that the award dated 13.9.2021 was passed by the even number of members, which is not permissible and in contradiction of section 10 of the act of 1996. it is claimed that the arbitration tribunal consists of three members whereas, the same is signed by two members only, which is evident from the award dated 13.9.2021. it is contended that on the day, the award was passed, the third member of the arbitration tribunal was already expired and, as such, the award dated 13.9.2021 itself is nullity and is non-executable. (b) that the decree-holder has filed execution proceedings prematurely, hence, such execution is barred by section 36 of the act of 1996. (c) that because the award dated 13.9.2021 is not sufficiently stamped, therefore, the same remains unenforceable. the commercial court vide order dated 21.5.2022 has rejected the objections raised by the petitioner-firm by giving detailed reasonings. in respect of the objection no.1, the commercial court has concluded that the arbitration tribunal has already decided to pass an award while exercising powers under section 16 of the act of 2006 and the same is evident from the order-sheet of the arbitration tribunal dated 1.4.2021. the commercial court is of the opinion that since the decision of passing the award was already taken on 1.4.2021 by the odd number of members, the death of one of the arbitrator (8 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] after 1.4.2021 will not result in declaring the award as nullity because only the signatures of the third member is not on the award dated 13.9.2021. in respect of the objection no.2 raised by the petitionerfirm that the execution proceedings initiated by the respondent are premature, the commercial court has concluded that in any law, limitation is provided for filing application, appeal or suit and the same is treated as limitation period, however, there are provisions wherein the court can grant further time to file any application, appeal or suit beyond the limitation period as per its discretion, however, the said period granted by the court as per its discretion cannot be termed as limitation period. the commercial court is also of the view that since the award is passed on 13.9.2021 and the execution application is filed on 16.12.2021, whereas the limitation for challenging the award is provided as three months, it cannot be said that the execution proceedings are filed before expiry of three months period. so far as the objection raised by the petitioner that the award dated 13.9.2021 is not sufficiently stamped is concerned, the commercial court has concluded that the award passed by the arbitration tribunal is an instrument as defined in section 2(xix) of the rajasthan stamp act (for short 'the stamp act'). it is also observed that the arbitration tribunal was the enterprise of the competent government and (9 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] as per proviso to section 3(b) of the stamp act, any instrument issued by the competent government is not required to be stamped. it is further observed that prior to year 2008, as per the rule 5(13), an award is required to be stamped, but those rules were repealed in the year 2018 and as per the rules promulgated in the year 2018, there is no provision for paying any stamp duty on the award as per rule 5(10) and (11). assailing the order dated 21.5.2022, learned counsel for the petitioner-firm has submitted that since the award is passed by the even number of members, the same is contrary to section 10 of the act of 1996 and is nonexecutable, but the commercial court has illegally held that the award though signed by even number of members cannot be said to be non-executable since the decision of passing the award was taken by all the three members of the arbitration tribunal. learned counsel has further argued that as a matter of fact, when the award was passed, the fact remains that the third member of the arbitration tribunal was no more and, as such, the award cannot be said to be executable in any manner. it is further argued that the commercial court has illegally observed that the execution proceedings initiated by the respondent are not premature though from the facts itself, it is clear that the execution proceedings were initiated by the respondent before expiry of the period of challenging (10 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] the award as per the provisions of the act of 1996. it is further argued that the award was passed on 13.9.2021 and the limitation for challenging the same expires after 120 days, but the respondent has filed the execution proceedings before expiry of 120 days and, as such, it is clear that the execution proceedings initiated by the respondent are premature. learned counsel for the petitioner has further argued that the award was not sufficiently stamped and, as such, the same remains non-executable, but the commercial court has wrongly held that no stamp is required. learned counsel for the petitioner-firm has placed reliance on the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of chief engineer, hydel project and others vs. ravinder nath and others, reported in (2008) 2 scc 350; decision of the madras high court rendered in the case of s.a. mohideen vs. s.a. fasluddin and ors. [o.p. no.310 of 2018, o.a. nos.257, 258 of 2018 and a.no.2450 of 2018, decided on 02.08.2018]; decision of calcutta high court rendered in the case of srs investments bengal tiger ltd. and ors. vs. rahul todi and ors. [c.o.nos.39-41 of 2019 and c.o.no.197 of 2019, decided on 24.06.2019]; decision of the chhattisgarh high court at bilaspur rendered in the case of r.s. bajwa and company vs. state of chhattisgarh and ors., reported in air 2008 chh 75. (11 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] per contra, learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that the commercial court has not committed any illegality in rejecting the objections filed by the petitioner-firm vide order dated 21.5.2022, hence, no interference is called for in this writ petition. heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material available on record. before going into the merits of the arguments raised on behalf of the respondent assailing the validity of the order impugned, i would like to observe that the petitioner-firm is not entitled to get any relief from this court due to its conduct. earlier, against the order dated 13.9.2021, the petitioner-firm has preferred sbcwp no.371/2022, which came to be dismissed by this court while observing that the petitioner-firm has an alternate and efficacious remedy to challenge the award under section 34 of the act of 1996. it is to be noticed that a coordinate bench of this court has dismissed the above-referred writ petition while taking note of the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner-firm that the award is contrary to section 10 of the act of 1996. the petitioner-firm though filed an appeal under section 34 of the act of 1996 against the award dated 13.9.2021, but has not deposited 75% of the award amount as per section 19 of the act of 2006 and when the commercial court has insisted upon the petitioner-firm to deposit the same, the petitioner(12 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] firm has preferred sbcwp no.5022/2022 before this court claiming that on account of covid-19 pandemic, the financial condition of the petitioner-firm is poor and it is difficult for it to deposit 75% of the award amount in one go. it is urged on behalf of the petitioner-firm before this court that the petitioner-firm is ready to deposit 75% of the award amount in three monthly installments and thereafter undertakes to deposit three installments running from 2.5.2022 to 1.7.2022. this court, after taking into consideration the said undertaking given before this court, has directed the petitioner-firm to deposit 75% of the award amount in three monthly installments and the last installment of which was to be paid on 1.7.2022 itself. this court has made it clear that if the petitioner-firm makes any default in payment of any of the installments as directed above, the appeal preferred by it before the trial court shall automatically be dismissed. admittedly, the petitioner-firm has not deposited 75% of the award amount before the commercial court and the appeal filed by it challenging the award dated 13.9.2021 came to be dismissed. the conduct of the petitioner-firm of not depositing 75% of the award amount despite giving an undertaking before this court is a clear case of disobedience and cannot be appreciated. it appears that the petitioner-firm has used (13 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] different forums including this court to deny the decreeholder the fruits of the decree. the hon'ble supreme court in ravinder kaur vs. ashok kumar and another, reported in air 2004 sc 904 has deprecated such practice while observing as under : \"courts of law should be careful enough to see through such diabolical plans of the judgment-debtors to deny the decree-holders the fruits of the decree obtained by them. this type of errors on the part of the judicial forums only encourage frivolous and cantankerous litigations causing laws delay and bringing bad name to the judicial system.\" apart from that, i am also of the opinion that challenge of the petitioner-firm to the execution of the award dated 13.9.2021 is also barred by the principles of res judicata. the award dated 13.9.2021 has attained finality with the dismissal of the appeal filed by the petitioner-firm under section 34 of the act of 1996 before the commercial court in view of the order passed by this court in sbcwp no.5022/2022 decided on 26.4.2022 because admittedly, the petitioner-firm has failed to make payment of 75% of the award amount within the stipulated time granted by this court. it is settled that the principles of res judicata apply between two stages of the same litigation and in this reference, reliance can be placed on the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of satyadhyan ghosal and ors. vs. smt. deorjin debi and anr., reported in air (14 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] 1960 sc 941, wherein the hon'ble supreme court has held as under : \"7. the principle of res judicata is based on the need of giving a finality to judicial decisions. what it says is that once a respondent is judicata, it shall not be adjudged again. primarily it applies as between past litigation and future litigation, when a matter whether on a question of fact or a question of law has been decided between two parties in one suit or proceeding and the decision is final, either because no appeal was taken to a higher court or because the appeal was dismissed, or no appeal lies, neither party will be allowed in a future suit or proceeding between the same parties to canvass the matter again. this principle of res judicata is embodied in relation to suits in s.11 of the code of civil procedure; but even where s.11 does not apply, the principle of res judicata has been applied by courts for the purpose of achieving finality in litigation. the result of this is that the original court as well as any higher court must in any future litigation proceed on the basis that the previous decision was correct. 8. the principle of res judicata applies also as between two stages in the same litigation to this extent that a court whether the trial court or a higher court having at an earlier stage decided a matter in one way will not allow the parties to re-agitate the matter again at a subsequent stage of the same proceedings. does this however mean that because at an interlocutory matter in one way and no appeal has been taken therefrom or no appeal did lie, a higher court cannot at a later stage of the same litigation consider the matter again?\" (emphasis supplied) (15 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] on merits, i am of the view that the findings recorded by the commercial court while rejecting the objections filed by the petitioner-firm cannot be said to be perverse in any manner. though, it is true that at the time of passing of the award dated 13.9.2021, the third member of the arbitration tribunal was no more as he expired prior to passing of the award dated 13.9.2021, but the fact remains that the arbitration tribunal has principally decided to pass the award on 1.4.2021 and on that day, all the members of the arbitration tribunal were present and signed the proceedings. simply because the detailed award was passed on 13.9.2021, when one of the members of the arbitration tribunal was not alive, it cannot be said that the award became contrary to section 10 of the act of 1996. it is not the case of the petitioner-firm that immediately after the death of one of the members of the arbitration tribunal, it has raised any objection or prayed for appointment of new arbitration tribunal pointing out that one of the members of the arbitration tribunal is no more. as a matter of fact, the petitioner has not raised any objection till the execution petition is filed and this fact itself is sufficient to draw a presumption that though the petitioner-firm was aware about the death of one of the members of the arbitration tribunal, but it has not raised any objection with regard to the fact that (16 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] the decision to pass the award was not taken by all the three members of the arbitration tribunal. the finding recorded by the commercial court whereby it has rejected the objection that the execution proceedings initiated by the respondent prematurely is concerned, i do not find any fault in the same as the award was passed on 13.9.2021 and the execution application was filed on 16.12.2021. as per section 34(3) of the act of 1996, the limitation for challenging the award is three months, however, any application challenging the award can be entertained by the court within a further period of thirty days if the person challenging the award is able to show sufficient cause that he was prevented from making the application within a period of three months. the said period of thirty days can be extended by the court with its discretion, however, the limitation for challenging the award remains three months. as said earlier, the award was passed on 13.9.2021 and the limitation of three months was expired on 12.12.2021, whereas, the execution application was filed on 16.12.2021. in view of the above, the commercial court has not committed any illegality in not treating the execution proceedings premature and has rightly rejected the objection raised by the petitioner-firm. so far as the objection of the petitioner-firm to the effect that the award dated 13.9.2021 was not sufficiently stamped is concerned, learned counsel for the petitioner-firm has (17 of 17) [cw-8048/2022] failed to convince this court that the award was required to be stamped. so far as the judgments, on which, learned counsel for the petitioner-firm has placed reliance are concerned, the facts of the above-referred judgments are quite distinguishable, hence, the same are of no help to the petitioner-firm. in view of the above discussion, i do not find any merit in this writ petition and the same is hereby dismissed. stay petition is also dismissed.
