All the three petitions are preferred under Article 227 of the Constitution of C/Sca/20148/2021 Judgment Dated: 02/08/2022 India challenging the order pa ssed below Exhibit 1 dated 24.11.2021 by the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Kalol in different suits filed by the original respondent- plaintiff. As the factual as well the legal issues are identical, they are being decided by this common order, where the facts are drawn from the Special Civil Application No.20148 of 2021 for the purpose of adjudication. The parties shall be addressed as defendants (petitioners) and plaintiff (respondent) respectively. 1.1 Special Civil Suit No.60 of 2020 has been preferred against the defendants for recovery of Rs.5,91,71,513/- along with interest at the rate of Rs.3,21,06,723/- totaling Rs.9,12,78,236/- under the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 provision of Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ('the CPC' hereinafter), praying for a decree for a total amount against the defendants. 1.2 The plaintiff company preferred an application for attachment before judgment under the provision of Order XXXVIII, Rule 5 of the CPC. The defendants filed a written statement inter alia denying and disputing the contents of the suits and also raising the preliminary objections as to the territorial jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Kalol to adjudicate the said suit and during the course of hearing, the Commercial Court framed a preliminary issue of territorial jurisdiction as in the invoice raised by the plaintiff company, C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 the jurisdiction of Ahmedabad was chosen. 1.3 The defendants have strongly argued that Commercial Court, Kalol does not have the territorial jurisdiction to try the suit. After hearing the parties, learned Principal Civil Judge, Kalol directed that the Court has jurisdiction to hear and try the suit and both the parties were ordered to proceed with the matter. \n1.4 The certified copy of the order was made available on 17.12.2021 and hence, the present petition by the original defendants questioning the impugned order. \n1.5 According to the defendants, Section 6 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 provides the jurisdiction of the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Commercial Court which permits all suits and applications relating to the commercial dispute of a Specific Value arising out of the territory of the State over which has been vested territorial jurisdiction to try such suits and applications. Section 20 of the CPC provides that the suit to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action arises. Therefore, it is urged that as the defendants reside in Hyderabad and are carrying on the business from Hyderabad as per clause (a) and (b) of the Section 20 of the CPC, the Commercial Court, Hyderabad would have jurisdiction. 1.6 Again, it is admitted that as per clause (c) of Section 20 of the CPC within the local limit of the jurisdiction of the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Court, where the cause of action has arisen wholly or in part, the same would empower to entertain the matter. It is a bundle of facts which are necessary to be proved in a given facts. \n1.7 It is further the say of the defendants that in the matter of contract there may arise the cause of action of various kinds. In a suit for damages for breach of contract, the cause of action consists of making of the contract and its breach so that the suit may be filed either at a place where the contract was made or at a place where it should have been performed and the breach occurred. The determination of the place where the contract was made is a part of law of C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 contract, but making of an offer on a particular place does not form cause of action in a suit for damages for breach of contract. \n1.8 It is emphatically urged that the Principal Civil Judge, Kalol does not have the territorial jurisdiction to adjudicate the present suit as the defendant No.1-Firm is registered and located in Hyderabad and the agreement was accepted to supply the goods on issuance of purchase order at Hyderabad. Furthermore, from Hyderabad the purchase orders were issued for supply of the products and the products were to be delivered in different districts coming in the State of Telangana. Therefore also, the cause of action has arisen at Hyderabad for C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 acceptance of contract to supply product and the further cause of action would arise in the State of Telangana where the goods were delivered. No cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of the Commercial Court of Kalol. Hence, the order needs to be interfered with. 1.9 Moreover, it has been urged that in the invoice raised and produced by the plaintiff, parties have agreed to and have chosen the jurisdiction as Ahmedabad. As per the invoices, the money was payable at Ahmedabad, the defendants have made the payment through RTGS to the Bank specified in the invoice, which is situated at Ahmedabad. Thus, the part of cause of action has arisen at Ahmedabad, where money C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 was expressly payable as per the invoice. \nMoreover, the very existence of a jurisdiction clause in an agreement makes the intention of the parties to an agreement clear, where the contract itself specifies the jurisdiction of the Courts at a particular place and such Court shall have jurisdiction to deal with the matter. It is further emphasized that an inference can be drawn that the parties intended to exclude all other Courts and therefore, Section 6 of the Commercial Courts Act when read with Section 20 of the CPC, the Commercial Court at Kalol does not have jurisdiction. Therefore, the following prayers:\n\"27... \n(A) Your Lordships be pleased to quash and set aside C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 the impugned Order below Exhibit 1 dated 24.11.2021 passed by the Hon'ble Principal Senior Civil Court, Kalol in Special Civil Suit No.60 of 2020 holding it has jurisdiction to hear and try the subject suit; (B) Pending admission and final hearing of the present petition, Your Lordships be pleased to direct the Hon'ble Principal Senior Civil Judge,Kalol not to proceed further with the hearing of Special Civil Suit No.60 of 2020;\n(C) Pending admission and final hearing of the present petition, Your Lordships be pleased to direct the Hon'ble Principal Senior Civil Judge, Kalol not to pronounce the order below exhibit 5 filed by the respondent-plaintiff under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; and (D) Your Lordships be pleased to pass any other appropriate order, as deemed fit, in the interest of C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 justice.\"\n2. Affidavit-in-reply on issuance of the notice has been filed by the plaintiff, where it is contended that the petition has been preferred with an intent to delay and derail the proceedings in Special Civil Suit No.60 of 2020 pending before the Civil Court, Kalol and with an object to obstruct and delay the pronouncement of the order in an Application below Order XXXVIII, Rule 5 of the CPC.\n2.1 With respect to framing of preliminary issue of jurisdiction, it is contended that the trial Court concerned has suo moto raised a query with respect to the territorial jurisdiction as invoice is raised by the plaintiff containing the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 jurisdictional Clause \"Subject to Ahmedabad Jurisdiction\". Both the parties were heard at length, and the order was passed on 24.11.2021 holding that the Kalol Court has jurisdiction to try the suit. According to the defendants, the present case falls under the purview of Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and the appeal can be filed under Section 13 of the Act before the Commercial Courts Division of the High Courts and therefore, this petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is not maintainable. Moreover, the defendants also filed an application on 28.07.2021 under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC for rejection of the plaint, which also has been rejected. In that application, the defendants have not taken any ground with C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 respect to jurisdiction of Ahmedabad Court based on the clause mentioned in the tax invoice. \n2.2          It is the say of the plaintiff that the    defendants          approached           the       respondent for    availing       supply          of      plastic          material because             the         plaintiff                   is                an approved/authorised vendor for the State of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The plaintiff's registered office as well as factory both are situated within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court at Kalaol. Purchase orders were received at the address of plaintiff's factory as well as at the registered office located at Kalol. The payment from the defendants was also received at the factory address and C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 the plaintiff is also maintaining the account of the defendants-company at the said address as per the provision of the Companies Act. All transactions between the parties have entered into within the territorial jurisdiction of village Santej, Taluka Kalol. The Axis Bank's main Branch where plaintiff's account is maintained is situated at Ahmedabad and the defendants made payment in Bank Account maintained in the said Bank at Ahmedabad through RTGS as per the tax invoice raised by the plaintiff to the defendants, wherein at the bottom a printed clause, \"Subject to Ahmedabad jurisdiction\" has continued inadvertently, which was in practice before shifting of the company to the jurisdiction of Kalol Court in the year 2014. In fact, after C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 shifting of defenant-company to Santej address, there ought to have been discontinuation of stationary which printed the clause \"subject to Ahmedabad jurisdiction\", which is no longer a correct jurisdiction for the case in hands. \nTherefore,               the     said         unilateral                   clause whether             is    sufficient               to        decide               the jurisdiction of the Ahmedabad Court shall need to be answered in negation. Various grounds are raised to urge as to why the tax invoices would not lend the jurisdiction to the Court at Ahmedabad. 2.3 It is further denied that there is any express consent or acceptance of plaintiff as regards the jurisdiction clause mentioned in the invoice. The C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 written statement thus makes it clear that the defendants on one hand denied that there is any contract between the parties with regard to maintaining the account for supplying the Tarpaulins during the period from 2015 to 2020 and on the other hand, have not denied that the defendants received the invoices raised by the plaintiff without any protest. According to the respondent-plaintiff, to their utter shock and surprise, the defendants have raised the query of territorial jurisdiction in reply to the attachment application filed under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC. During the course of arguments before the trial Court, the defendants never stated that it had chosen the jurisdiction of Ahmedabad Court. For C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 the first time, the objection to the territorial jurisdiction has been raised when the query was made by the Kalol Court in respect of the jurisdiction clause in the tax invoice. Moreover, as per the tax invoice, the GST registration is also falling within the purview of Kalol- Gandhinagar GST Division. There is no remotest connection to the Ahmedabad jurisdiction except the main Bank Branch of Axis Bank of the plaintiff having been situated at Ahmedabad. \n2.4 Relying on various decisions, it is urged that any unilateral affirmation or a statement by one of the parties cannot be held to be an agreement to confer exclusive jurisdiction on any Court. More C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 particularly, when it is not a term accepted by the other side by way of an agreement. Various decisions have been relied upon to urge that the order of the trial Court is unassailable and in a recovery suit, the cause of action surely has arisen only in the territorial jurisdiction of the Civil Court at Kalol.\n3. Affidavit-in-rejoinder to the affidavit-in-reply had been filed which may not be necessary further to be dilated where the gist is that the cause of action has arisen at Ahmedabad. In the invoice, the answering plaintiff has chosen, agreed and submitted to the jurisdiction of Ahmedabad and by making payments in Ahmedabad, the defendants have signified C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 their consent to be subjected to Ahmedabad jurisdiction which thus forms part of agreement between the parties, the Ahmedabad Court has jurisdiction to deal with the matter and jurisdiction of other Courts is excluded. \n4. We have heard extensively the learned senior advocate, Mr.Mihir Thakore for the defendants assisted by the learned advocate, Ms.Vidhi Bhatt, who also tendered the written submissions and therefore, there will be no requirement to elaborate the submissions extensively made along the line of the memo of petition, gist of which is the exclusion of jurisdiction of all other courts in wake of payment made at main branch of Axis Bank pursuant to the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 invoice raised by the plaintiff and the clause in specific having been incorporated to \"Subject to jurisdiction of Ahmedabad Court\". Authorities which have been relied upon are as follows:\n(i) A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. and Another vs. A.P.Ahencies, Salem, reported in (1990) 2 SCC 163 (ii) Swastik Gases Private Limited vs. Indian Oil Corporation Limited, reported in (2013) 9 SCC 32 (iii) S.Manuel Raj and Co. vs. J.Manilal and Co., reported in 1962 SCCOnline (Guj.)\n(iv) Auto Movers vs. Luminous Power Technologies Pvt. Ltd., reported in (2021) SCC Online Del. 4287 (v) State of Gujarat vs. Union of India, C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 passed in SCA No.737 of 2018.\n5. per contra, learned senior advocate, Mr.Devang Nanavati assisted by the learned advocate, Mr.Pranav Thakkar has also fervently made the submissions and the written note also to assist the cause has been tendered and the reiterative emphasize is of denial of any agreement between the parties of agreeing to exclusionary clause in respect of Ahmedabad Court. \n5.1 Reliance is heavily made on the following authorities to substantiate the line of arguments. \n(1) Om Prakash Srivastava VS. Union of India & Anr., reported in (2006) 6 SCC 207 (2) Economic Transport Organisation vs. C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 United India Insurance Co.Ltd., reported in 1985 SCC Online (Ker) 169 (3) Maria Munnisa Begum vs. Noore Mohammad Saheb, reported in AIR (1965) AP 231 (4) North Bengal Das Brothers Zemindary Co Ltd. vs. Surendranath Das, reported in MANY/WB/0307/1955 (5) Satyapal vs. Slick Auto Accessories Pvt. Ltd., reported in 2014 SCC Online Del (6) Soniram Jeetmull vs. R.D.Tata & Co., reported in 1927 SCC Online PC 34 (7) Bharumal Udhomal vs. Sakhawatmal Veshomal and Ors., reported in 1955 SCC Online (Bom) 64 (8) State of Punjab vs. A.K.Raha, reported in AIR 1964 Calcutta 418 (9) R.S.D.V. Finance Co.Pvt. Ltd. vs. Shree C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Vallabh Glass Works Ltd., reported in (1993) 2 SCC 130 (10)Greentose PVT LTD vs. Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers Co. Ltd., passed in Second Appeal No.154 of 2013.\nQuestions to be determined:\n6. The moot question that requires the address is as to whether the Court at Kalol would have a jurisdiction for entertaining the suit for recovery initiated by the seller against the purchaser, seller, having the registered office at Kalol against the purchaser, based at Hyderabad or whether the Court at Ahmedabad would have exclusive jurisdiction in wake of the specific inclusion of the term of making payment at Axis Bank located in Ahmedabad and the clause added at the bottom of tax C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 invoice \"Subject to Ahmedabad jurisdiction.\" \n7. Yet, another question raised by the plaintiff is with regard to the maintainability of the present petition, which is preferred under Article 227 of the Constitution of India as according to the defendants, the suit has been preferred under the Commercial Court's Act and therefore, any challenge that needs to be made has to be under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Appellate Courts, Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions of High Courts Act, 2015.\nMaintainability of Petition:\nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 7.1 Apt would be to firstly consider the aspect of maintainability of petition. \nSection 13 of the Commercial Courts Act provides for appeals of Commercial Court below the level of District Judge from decrees of Commercial Court to the Commercial Appellate Court within 60 days and before the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court from the Commercial Court at the level of District Judge in original jurisdiction: \n\"13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions.--[(1)Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court below the level of a District Judge may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order. (1A) Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order:\nProvided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996). ] (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\" \n7.2 Here, the order is of Commercial Court below the level of District Judge for C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 having been passed by learned Senior Civil Judge, Kalol and therefore, the appeal would lie before the Commercial Appellate Court and not under Article 227 of the Constitution of India nor even before the Commercial Appellate division of the High Court. This petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India in wake of this efficacious remedy could not have been preferred. Powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India would always be available with the Courts for keeping the Courts below within the bounds of its jurisdiction in case of apparent error or grave injustice but, its exercise shall need to be done ordinarily when alternative and effective statutory remedy is not available. \nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Jurisdiction Issue:\n8.Territorial                  jurisdiction                  is         governed under       Section            20     of       the    Code            of       Civil Procedure which provides thus:\n\"20.Other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action arises.-Subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction- (a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, or (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually, voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally work for gain, provided that in such case either the leave of the Court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution; or (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.\"\nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Whereas Section 6 of Commercial Courts Act's provides for jurisdiction by following definite law on the subject of territorial jurisdiction in a suit for damage for breach of contract deserves discussion at this stage.\n9. In case of A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. and Another (supra) the Apex Court has held that when parties transacted on the basis of a clause in the agreement, the clause must be deemed to have formed the part of the agreement and the parties would be bound by it. Validity of the clause will depend upon the validity of an agreement. It further holds that where in a suit for damages for breach of contract when question arises of cause of action, making C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 of the contract is a part of a cause of action and a suit on contract can therefore be filed at the place where it was made. This decision further holds that when the Court has to decide the question of jurisdiction pursuant to an ouster clause what is necessary to be construed is the oust expression or clause to see whether there is an ouster of jurisdiction of other Courts. If such clause is unambiguous and specific, the same would bind the parties and unless the absence of ad idem can be shown, the other courts should avoid exercising jurisdiction. When words like \"alone\", \"only\", \"exclusive\" and the \"like\" have been used there is no difficulty, but even without such words in appropriate cases the 'maxim expressio unius est C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 exclusio alterius' meaning-expression of one is the exclusion of another shall need to be applied. It is quite clear that there shall need to be a specified jurisdiction in a contract where an intention has to be clear or excluding all others from its operation. \n8.1 Profitably the findings and observations of the Apex Court would need to be reproduced. \n\"11. The jurisdiction of the court in matter of a contract will depend on the situs of the contract and the cause of action arising through connecting factors. \n12. A cause of action means every fact, which if traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to a judgment of the court. In other words, it is a bundle of facts which taken with the law applicable to them gives the plaintiff a right to C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 relief against the defendant. It must include some act done by the defendant since in the absence of such an act no cause of action can possibly accrue. It is not limited to the actual infringement of the right sued on but includes all the material facts on which it is founded. It does not comprise evidence necessary to prove such facts, but every fact necessary for the plaintiff to prove to enable him to obtain a decree. Everything which if not proved would give the defendant a right to immediate judgment must be part of the cause of action. But it has no relation whatever to the defence which may be set up by the defendant nor does it depend upon the character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff. \n13. Under Section 20 (c) of the Code of Civil Procedure subject to the limitation stated theretofore, every suit shall be instituted in a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the cause of action, wholly or in part arises. It may be remembered that earlier Section 7 of Act 7 of 1888 added Explanation III as under :\nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Explanation III.-In suits arising out of contract the cause of action arises within the meaning of this section at any of the following places, namely:\n(1) the place where the contract was made; (2) the place where the contract was to be performed or performance thereof completed;\n(3) the place where in performance of the contract any money to which the suit relates was expressly or impliedly payable.\n14. The above Explanation III has now been omitted but never theless it may serve as a guide. There must be a connecting factor. \n15. In the matter of a contract there may arise causes of action of various kinds. In a suit for damages for breach of contract the cause of action consists of the making of the contract, and of, its breach, so that the suit may be filed either at the place where the contract was made or at the place where it should have been performed and the breach occurred. The making of the contract is part C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 of the cause of action. A suit on a contract, therefore, can be filed at the place where it was made. The determination of the place where the contract was made is part of the law of contract. But making of an offer on a particular place does not form cause of action in a suit for damages for breach of contract. Ordinarily, acceptance of an offer and its intimation result in a contract and hence a suit can be filed in a court within whose jurisdiction the acceptance was communicated. The performance of a contract is part of cause of action and a suit in respect of the breach can always be filed at the place where the contract should have been performed or its performance completed. If the contract is to be performed at the place where it is made, the suit on the contract is to be filed there and nowhere else. In suits for agency actions the cause of action arises at the place where the contract of agency was made or the place where actions are to be rendered and payment is to be made by the agent. Part of cause of action arises where money is expressly or impliedly payable under at C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 contract. In cases of repudiation of a contract, the place where repudiation is received is the place where the suit would lie. If a contract is pleaded as part of the cause of action giving jurisdiction to the court where the suit is filed and that contract is found to be invalid, such part of cause of action disappeared. The above are some of the connecting factors. \n16. So long as the parties to a contract do not oust the jurisdiction of all the courts which would otherwise have jurisdiction to decide the cause of action under the law it cannot be said that the parties have by their contract ousted the jurisdiction of the court. If under the law several courts would have jurisdiction and the parties have agreed to submit to one of these jurisdictions and not to other or others of them it cannot be said that there is total ouster of jurisdiction. In other words, where the parties to a contract agreed to submit the disputes arising from it to a particular jurisdiction which would otherwise also be a proper jurisdiction under the law their agreement to the extent they agreed not to C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 submit to other jurisdictions cannot be said to be void as against public policy. If on the other hand the jurisdiction they agreed to submit to would not otherwise be proper jurisdiction to decide disputes arising out of the contract it must be declared void being against public policy. Would this be the position in the instant case? \n17. In S. Manuel Raj & Co. v. J. Manilal & Co. where one of the parties to the contract signed an order form printed by the other party containing the words \"subject to Madras jurisdiction\" and sent the order form to the other party it was held that the party must be assumed to have agreed that Madras was the place for settlement of the dispute and it was not open to that person who signed the order form of the opposite party containing the printed words to show that printed words were not part of the contract and that those words in the contract was to exclude the jurisdiction of other courts and to keep sol jurisdiction to one court. It was observed that jurisdiction to one court. It was observed that the object of printing such words, as \"subject to Madras jurisdiction\" in the contract was to exclude the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 jurisdiction of other courts and to give sole jurisdiction to one court and it was in consonance with the commercial practice in India. Similarly in Sri Rajendra Mills v. H. V. M. Hazi Hassan Dada where there was a contract between the plaintiff and defendant under which the parties agreed that all suits arising on or out of the contract, would be instituted in the court at Salem, the Division Bench held that it was true that the suit could have been instituted either at Salem or at Howrah under Section 20(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure, as the cause of action, admittedly arose in part in both the places and it was therefore a case where two courts had concurrent jurisdiction and, in such a case, it was open to the parties to make a choice restricting the court in which the suit under or upon the contract could be instituted. In other words, both the courts having territorial jurisdiction, the parties by their agreement waived their right, to institute any action, as aforesaid except at Salem. It was observed that under those circumstances it was not open to the plaintiff to C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 object to the order for return of the plaint for presentation to the court at Salem as the choice of forum in case of alternative forums lies with the plaintiff and the plaintiff having debarred or precluded itself from going to any other court except at Salem which would be a proper court as against the defendants it would not be just to allow the plaintiff at the instance of any other party or under cover of its objection to institute the suit except in the court at Salem.\n18. In Hakam Singh v. M/s Gammon (India) Ltd. the appellant agreed to do certain construction work for the respondent who had its principal place of business at Bombay on the terms and conditions of a written tender. Clause 12 of the tender provided for arbitration in case of dispute. Clause 13 provided that notwithstanding the place where the work under the contract was to be executed the contract shall be deemed to have been entered into by the parties at Bombay and the court in Bombay alone shall have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon. On dispute arising between the parties the appellant C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 submitted a petition to the court at Varanasi for an order under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 that the agreement be filed and an order of reference be made to an arbitrator or arbitrators appointed by the court. The respondent contended that in view of the clause 13 of the arbitration agreement only the courts at Bombay had jurisdiction. The trial court also held that the entire cause of action had arisen at Varanasi and the parties could not by agreement confer jurisdiction on the courts at Bombay which they did not otherwise possess. The High Court in revision held that the courts at Bombay had jurisdiction under the general law and hence could entertain the petition and that in view of clause 13 of the arbitration agreement the petition could not be entertained at Varanasi and directed the petition to be returned for presentation to the proper court. On appeal therefrom one of the questions that fell for consideration of this Court was whether the courts at Bombay alone had jurisdiction over the dispute. It was held that the Code of Civil Procedure in its entirety applied to C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 proceedings under the Arbitration Act by virtue of Section 41 of that Act. The jurisdiction of the court under the Arbitration Act to entertain a proceeding for filing an award was accordingly governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. By the terms of Section 20(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure read with Explanation II thereto the respondent company which had its principal place of business at Bombay was liable to be sued at Bombay. It was held that it was not open to the parties to agreement to confer by their agreement jurisdiction on a court which did not possess it under the Code. But where two courts or more have under the Code of Civil Procedure jurisdiction to try the suit or proceeding an agreement between the parties that the dispute between them shall be tried in one of such courts was not contrary to public policy and such an agreement did not con travene Section 28 of the Contract Act. Though this case arose out of an arbitration agreement there is no reason why the same rule should not apply to other agreements insofar as jurisdiction is concerned. C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Without referring to this decision a Division Bench of the Madras High Court in Nanak Chand Shadurain v. T. T. Elect. Supply Co. observed that competency of a court to try an action goes to the root of the matter and when such competency is not found, it has no juris diction at all to try the case. But objection based on jurisdiction is a matter which parties could waive and it is in this sense if such jurisdiction is exercised by courts it does not go to the core of it so as to make the resultant judgment a nullity. Thus it is now a settled principle that where there may be two or more competent courts which can entertain a suit consequent upon a part of the cause of action having arisen there within, if the parties to the contract agreed to vest jurisdiction in one such court to try the dispute which might arise as between themselves the agreement would be valid. If such a contract is clear. unambiguous and explicit and not vague it is not hit by Sections 23 and 28 of the Contract Act. This cannot be understood as parties contracting against the statute. Mercantile law and practice permit such agreements. C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 19. In Naziruddeen v. P.A.Annamalai the question was whether Rule 35 of U.P.State Lottery Rules, 1969 confined the jurisdiction only to Lucknow. The rule said:\n\"35. Legal jurisdiction in all matters concering the State lottery shall be Lucknow.\" \nThe sole question for consideration therefore was whether the above rule had the effect of vesting exclusive jurisdiction only in the courts in Lucknow and thereby taking away the jurisdiction which the sub ordinate judge court at Vellore could have if it was established that the lottery ticket was stolen within the jurisdiction of that court from the first respondent. Held, it was well established that the jurisdiction of a civil court can be taken away only by an express provision or by necessary implication and ousting of a jurisdiction of civil court should not and ought not be inferred from an ambiguous provision. In that particular case it was common case of the parties that Rule 35 did not expressly take away the jurisdiction of any other court, and vest the exclusive jurisdiction only in the courts at Lucknow. A note of C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 caution was sounded by M. P. Thakkar, J. as he then was, in Snehalkumar Sarabhai v. E. T. Orgn. observing that the ouster clause could operate as estoppel against the parties to the contract, but it could not tie the hands of the court and denude it of the powers to do justice. Ordinarily, it was observed that the courts would respect the agreement between the parties which was borne out of the meeting of their minds out of consideration of convenience, but the courts were not obliged to do so in every case; and that a new approach to the question deserved to be made where the ouster clause was \"calculated to operate as an engine of oppression and as a means to defeat the ends of justice\". In such a case the free consent may be wanting and injustice may be avoided. \n20. When the court has to decide the question of jurisdiction pursuant to an ouster clause it is necessary to construe the ousting expression or clause properly. Often the stipulation is that the contract shall be deemed to have been made as a particular place. This would C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 provide the connecting factor for jurisdiction to the courts of that place in the matter of any dispute on or arising out of that contract. It would not. however, ipso facto take away jurisdiction of other courts. Thus, in Salem Chemical Industries v. Bird & Co. where the terms and conditions attached to the quotation contained an arbitration clause provided that: \"any order placed against this quotation shall be deemed to be a contract made in Calcutta and any dispute arising therefrom shall be settled by an arbitrator to be jointly appointed by us\", it was held that it merely fixed the situs of the contract at Calcutta and it did not mean to confer an exclusive jurisdiction on the court at Calcutta, and when a part of the cause of action had arisen at Salem, the court there had also jurisdiction to entertain the suit under Section 20(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure. \n21. From the foregoing decisions it can be reasonably deduced that where such an ouster clause occurs, it is pertinent to see whether there is ouster of jurisdiction of other courts. When the clause is clear, unambiguous and C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 specific accented notions of contract would bind the parties and unless the absence of ad idem can be shown, the other courts should avoid exercising jurisdiction. As regards construction of the ouster clause when words like 'alone', 'only', 'exclusive' and the like have been used there may be no difficulty. Even without such words in appropriate cases the maxim 'expressio unius est exclusio alterius' expression of one is the exclusion of another may be applied. What is an appropriate case shall depend on the facts of the case. In such a case mention of one thing may imply exclusion of another. When certain jurisdiction is specified in a contract an intention to exclude all others from its operation may in such cases be inferred. It has therefore to be properly construed.\" \n9. In case of Swastik Gases Private Limited (supra) the Apex Court was considering the question whether in view of Clause 18 of the consignment agency C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 agreement, the Calcutta High Court had exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the application made by the appellant under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. \n9.1 The plaintiff company was engaged in the business of storage, distribution of petroleum products and also manufactured and marketed various types of lubricating oils, grease, fluid and coolants. It appointed the appellant, M/s. Swastik Gases Private Limited situated at Jaipur in Rajasthan as the consignment agent. An agreement was entered into between the appellant and the plaintiff whereby the defendant, who was to act as an agent for marketing lubricants at Jaipur (Rajasthan). C / SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 There were divergent stands of the parties in respect of the place of signing the agreement. The dispute arose between the parties as huge quantity of stock of lubricants could not be sold by the appellant. When they could not resolved amicably, the arbitration clause was necessary to be invoked and hence, an application was made by the appellant before the Rajasthan High Court for appointment of an arbitrator where plea of lack of territorial jurisdiction of the Rajasthan High Court was raised. \n9.2          The Apex Court has held that the very       existence              of        the         exclusion                    of jurisdiction clause in the agreement would be rendered meaningless where it not given C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 its natural and plain meaning. The use of words like \"only\", \"exclusively\", \"alone\" and \"so on\" are not necessary to convey the intention of the parties in an exclusion of jurisdiction clause of an agreement. The Apex Court held that the very existence of a jurisdiction clause in an agreement makes the intention of the parties to an agreement quite clear and it is not advisable to read such a clause in the agreement like a statute. The Apex Court held that the Courts in Kolkata had jurisdiction to entertain the disputes between the parties. \n9.3 Apt would be to reproduce the relevant findings and observations of the Apex Court. \nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 \"29. When it comes to the question of territorial jurisdiction relating to the application under Section 11, besides the above legislative provisions, Section 20 of the Code is relevant. Section 20 of the Code states that subject to the limitations provided in Sections 15 to 19, every suit shall be instituted in a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction:\n(a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the leave of the court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution; or (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part arises.\nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 30. The Explanation appended to Section 20 clarifies that a corporation shall be deemed to carry on business at its sole or principal office in India or. in respect of any cause of action arising at any place where it has also a subordinate office, at such place. \n31. In the instant case, the appellant does not dispute that part of cause of action has arisen in Kolkata. What appellant says is that part of cause of action has also arisen in Jaipur and, therefore, the Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court or the designate Judge has jurisdiction to consider the application made by the appellant for the appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11. Having regard to Section 11(12)(b) and Section 2(e) of the 1996 Act read with Section 20(c) of the Code, there remains no doubt that the Chief Justice or the designate Judge of the Rajasthan High Court has jurisdiction in the matter. The question is, whether parties by virtue of Clause 18 of the agreement have agreed to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts at Jaipur or, in other C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 words, whether in view of Clause 18 of the agreement, the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court has been excluded?\n32. For answer to the above question, we have to see the effect of the jurisdiction clause in the agreement which provides that the agreement shall be subject to jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata. It is a fact that whilst providing for jurisdiction clause in the agreement the words like \"alone\". \"only\", \"exclusive\" or \"exclusive jurisdiction\"\nhave not been used but this, in our view, is not decisive and does not make any material difference. The intention of the parties-by having Clause 18 in the agreement is clear and unambiguous that the courts at Kolkata shall have jurisdiction which means that the courts at Kolkata alone shall have jurisdiction. It is so because for construction of jurisdiction clause, like Clause 18 in the agreement, the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius comes into play as there is nothing to indicate to the contrary. This legal maxim means that expression of one is the exclusion of another. By making a provision that C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 the agreement is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata, the parties have impliedly excluded the jurisdiction of other courts. Where the contract specifies the jurisdiction of the courts at a particular place and such courts have jurisdiction to deal with the matter, we think that an inference may be drawn that parties intended to exclude all other courts. A clause like this is not hit by Section 23 of the Contract Act at all. Such clause is neither forbidden by law nor it is against the public policy. It does not offend Section 28 of the Contract Act in any manner. \n33. The above view finds support from the decisions of this Court in Hakam Singh, A.B.C. Laminart, R.S.D.V. Finance, Angile Insulations, Shriram City, Hanil Era Textiles and Balaji Coke. \n34. In view of the above, we answer the question in the affirmative and hold that the impugned order does not suffer from any error of law. The civil appeal is, accordingly, dismissed with no order as to costs. The C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 appellant shall be at liberty to pursue its remedy under Section 11 of the 1996 Act in the Calcutta High Court.\" \n10. In case of S.Manuel Raj and Co.(supra) the revision was preferred by the original defendants. The plaintiffs placed an order on a printed form of the defendants on which it was printed in bold types \"Subject to Madras Jurisdiction\". An order form was signed by the plaintiffs and sent to the defendants. The contention was rejected by the learned judge of the small causes court that the Madras High Court alone had jurisdiction. The defendants, therefore, preferred the revision where the main contention urged was that the Madras High Court has jurisdiction in view of the fact that the order form signed by the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 plaintiffs contained the bold types \"subject to Madras jurisdiction\" and it is also underlined in the print. It was argued that it must be taken that the plaintiffs agreed to the term that only the Madras High Court would have jurisdiction when the order form was signed by the plaintiffs. The opponents contended that these words \"subject to Madras jurisdiction\" would not mean that Madras High Court alone would have jurisdiction. This Court held that when one of the parties to a contract signs a printed form printed by the other party and sends the order form to the other party it must be assumed that party agreed to the place for settlement of the dispute. It is not for a person, who signs an order form of the opposite party containing the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 printed words to say that the printed words are not part of the contract. \n10.1 Profitably the findings and observations of the Apex Court would need to be reproduced. \n\"4. When one of the parties to a contract signs a printed form printed by the other party containing the words \"subject to the jurisdiction of a place Q\" and sends the order form to the other party it must be assumed that that party agreed that Q is the place for the settlement of disputes. It is not open to a person who signs an order form of the opposite party containing the printed words to say that the printed words are not part of the contract. To take the view taken by the learned Judge of the Madras High Court would be to upset the commercial practice of India, and unless such a position is necessary in view of the wording of any particular section, I am not prepared to take that view. I am not prepared to upset the commercial practice of India unless the law requires me to C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 do so. There is nothing in the law to hold that the expression \"subject to jurisdiction of Q\" printed at the top of a form may not bind M who signed the order form. \n5. The learned counsel for the opponent has relied on Section 3 of the Indian Contract Act, which reads as follows:\n\"The communication of proposals, the acceptance of proposals, and the revocation of proposals and acceptances, respectively, are deemed to be made by any act or omission of the party proposing, accepting or revoking, by which he intends to communicate such proposal, acceptance or revocation, or which has the effect of communicating it.\" This section of the Contract Act must be given effect. On this point Mulla has observed as follows: \"English authorities have established that the first point to be considered is whether the nature of the transaction is such that the person accepting the document may suppose, not unreasonably, that the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 document contains no terms at all, but is a mere acknowledgment of an agreement not intended to be varied by special terms (per Stephen, J. in Watkins v. Rymill, (1883) 10 QBD 178, (at p. 189) In short is the ticket a contract or a mere receipt? In Chapelton v. Barry U.C., (1940) 1 KB 532, P took a deck-chair from a pile near a notice reading \"Hire of Chairs 2 d. per session of 3 hours.\" The notice asked hirers to obtain a ticket from D's attendant, and retain it for inspection. P obtained a ticket, pocketed it unread, sat on the chair and was injured when it collapsed. D relied on a provision on the ticket excluding liability, but the Court of Appeal held for P on the ground that the ticket was not a contractual document. \nIf the defendant has established that the document was contractual, he must further prove that he did what was reasonably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of the conditions. This is a question of fact. (In Henderson v. Stevenson, (1875) LR 2 Sc. and D. 470, C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 where an endorsement on a steamboat ticket was not referred to on its face, and Richardson, Spence and Co. and Lord Gough S.S. Co. v. Rowntree, (1894) AC 217, where the ticket was folded up so that no writing was visible without opening it, a finding of fact that the passenger knew nothing of any conditions was supported. The correct form of putting the question of fact was laid down by the C.A. in Parker v. South Eastern Rly. Co., (1877) 2 CPD 416. See Madras Railway Co. v. Govinda Rau, ILR 21 Mad 172 (at p. 174), and for a general summary of the law, Hood v. Anchor Line, (1918) AC 837, where both the contract and a notice on the envelope enclosing it pointedly called attention to the conditions. Failure to read is no excuse; Sheik Dawood v.\nS.I. Ry. Co. Ltd., ILR (1945) Mad 174 (AIR 1944 Mad 444). In an English case, inability to read has been held to be no excuse; Thompson v. L.M. and S. Ry. Co., (1930) 1 KB 41 (Infra). It has been held that there is sufficient notice, if the face of a railway ticket refers to conditions on the back, which are not expressly reproduced, but C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 incorporated by a reference to the time-tables of the railway Company: (1930) 1 KB 41. But the passenger is not bound by a purported exemption from liability, if the ticket is printed in such a way or delivered to him in such a state, as not to give reasonable notice on the face of it that it does embody some special conditions: Sugar v. L.M. and S. Ry., (1941) 1 All ER 172. (Here the words \"for conditions see back\" were obliterated by the date stamp on the ticket) In determining these questions the class of persons to whom the special conditions are offered, and the degree of intelligence to be expected of them, may properly be taken into account. (See Lord Ashbourne's remarks in (1894) AC 217 (supra).\" \n6. It is the contention of the learned counsel for the opponents that only the part at the bottom of the order form contains the conditions of the contract and not the words printed at the top. This contention is that the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 words \"subject to Madras jurisdiction\" are not a part of the contract but the rest of the document contains the terms of the contract. It is not their case that the printed form does not evidence the contract. It is conceded that the contract is contained in the document, namely, the order form. From the English cases cited by Mulla above, it would be clear that the words printed at the top would be a part of the contract and would be binding on the plaintiffs who have signed the order form. This is not a case of a ticket or a receipt taken by the plaintiffs but this is a case of an order placed by the plaintiffs themselves on a form signed by them and whatever is contained in the form would be binding on them in view of the signature on the form. It was easy for the plaintiffs to strike out the words \"subject to Madras jurisdiction\"\nbefore signing it. As they did not do so, these words are binding on the plaintiffs. \n7. It is next contended that the words do not mean that the jurisdiction of other Courts is excluded. Under the law C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 of Contract, certain Courts have jurisdiction, and it is with a view to exclude other Courts that the words like \"subject to Bombay jurisdiction,\" \"subject to Madras jurisdiction\" and so on are written in printed forms. The object of printing such words in the contract is to exclude the jurisdiction of other Courts and to give sole jurisdiction to one Court With respect I find it difficult to agree with the View taken by the learned Judge of the Madras High Court, I am not prepared to upset the commercial practice of India.\" \n10.1 The Gujarat High Court on the ground that there is no reason for upsetting the commercial practice of India when the object of printing such words in the contract is to exclude the jurisdiction of other Courts and to give sole jurisdiction to one Court, it had accepted the version of the original defendant and the revision C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 was allowed. \n11. The Delhi High Court in case of Auto Movers (supra) was considering the question of jurisdiction which was raised as a preliminary issue. Referring to section 20 of the CPC, the Court held that the part of cause of action has arisen also on account of the payment made by the defendant directly into the Bank account of the respondent/plaintiff and even if, these were not on regular basis since there is nothing to show that the place of payment had been fixed, even without following the principle that the 'debtor must seek out the creditor', the Delhi Courts would have jurisdiction to try the suit and the invoice does not vest jurisdiction in a C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 court which has no jurisdiction at all. 11.1 Profitably the findings and observations of the Apex Court would need to be reproduced. \n\"13. This issue was treated as a preliminary issue. The respondent/plaintiff in para No. 23 of the plaint averred that the invoices raised by the respondent/plaintiff were \"subject to jurisdiction of court of Delhi only\" and payments were also to be made in the jurisdiction of New Delhi and the cheque, which had been dishonoured was also to be received and realized in New Delhi. It was further stated that in the light of the established rule of law that in case of goods sold and delivered, the suit for its price will lie where the same is to be paid. It is on this basis that the respondent/plaintiff stated that the Delhi courts had jurisdiction to try the suit. In para No. 17 of the written statement, however, the petitioner/defendant submitted that the 'doctrine of election' could not be applied to the present case C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 inasmuch as, no cause of action had arisen in Delhi. According to the petitioner/defendant, the order for supply of the goods was placed at Kolkata Regional Office of the respondent/plaintiff. Invoices were raised from that office and the blank cheques towards security were received by the Kolkata Office. Further, the goods were supplied by the respondent/plaintiff at Suri, Birbhum, West Bengal. Therefore, the clause \"subject to jurisdiction of court of Delhi only\" was inconsequential. \n14. Section 20 of CPC governs the jurisdiction and reads as under: \"Section 20. Other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action arises. Subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction (a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or C / SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the leave of the Court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or personally works for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution;\nor (c) The cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.\" \n15. Section 20 clearly provides that a court within whose local limits the cause of action, \"wholly or in part\", arises, would have territorial jurisdiction to try the suit. Admittedly, the registered office of the petitioner/defendant is at N.S. Bose Road, Post Suri, Birbhum, West Bengal-731101. The learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant submitted that the invoice itself recorded a Kolkata address. The warehouse was also stated to be located at Kamahati, Panihati, West Bengal and therefore, the goods were neither dispatched from C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Delhi nor the invoices were raised at Delhi. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/plaintiff pointed to the \"subject to jurisdiction of court of Delhi only\"\nclause in the invoices. There does not appear to have been any demurrer by the petitioner/defendant against this clause. \n16. Thus, on two counts, under Section 20 of CPC, there is some strength in the contention of the respondent/plaintiff that on the basis of the 'place of work' of the petitioner/defendant, as well as the part cause of action of supply of goods, both reflect jurisdiction of the West Bengal courts. However, the respondent/plaintiff has also claimed that payments were to be received in Delhi and therefore, part cause of action has arisen in Delhi and as such, the clause in the invoices referred to hereinabove did not confer jurisdiction at a place which had no jurisdiction. \n17. In its reply to the present petition, the respondent/plaintiff has submitted that in relation to a C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 claim for the price of the goods sold and delivered, the suit is to be filed where the payments were to be made. Further, a debtor had to seek the creditor. It was claimed that the Cheque No. 170120 dated 17th May, 2012 for a sum of Rs. 28,48,947/- had been delivered by the petitioner/defendant to the respondent/plaintiff at the Delhi office and the petitioner/defendant knew well that the cheque would be deposited by the respondent/plaintiff at the Delhi Branch. The criminal complaint under Section 138 of N.I. Act was filed in Delhi. The bank statements of the respondent/plaintiff also clearly depict that the petitioner/defendant had made direct payments to the respondent/plaintiff into its account with ICICI Bank at J- 12/18, Rajouri Garden, New Delhi-110027. Thus, when on facts and in law, the suit could be filed at Delhi, the learned Trial Court had not committed any error in answering the preliminary issue in favour of the respondent/plaintiff. \nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 18. What is to be noticed here is that these averments of previous payments being made directly into the bank account of the respondent/plaintiff at Delhi, have not been denied by the petitioner/defendant. In its rejoinder, it has dismissed this averment by saying that \"accidental\" or \"even regular deposits of cheques\" for \"encashment at a branch of respondent's choice cannot clothe the court with territorial jurisdiction\". But, this would fortify the claim of the respondent/plaintiff that the invoices did not vest jurisdiction in a court that had no jurisdiction at all. \n19. The learned Trial Court has followed the decision of this court in Satyapal (supra) that where the place of payment has not been fixed, as appears to be the case here, payment was to be made at the place of the creditor i.e., at Delhi in the present case. The learned Trial Court has not misdirected itself in following the said judgment. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant that Satyapal (supra) was decided in the manner it did, only because the contract was entered C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 into at Delhi and the orders were placed at Delhi, is not wholly correct, inasmuch as this court had quoted with approval, the judgment of the learned Trial Court, which clearly held that in cases where the place of payment was not specified in the contracts/bills/invoices, parties had to follow the general rule that the payment had to be made at the place of the creditor. \n20. As held by the Supreme Court in Surya Dev Rai (supra), the supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is exercised for keeping the subordinate courts within the bounds of their jurisdiction. It is only when the courts below have assumed jurisdiction which they do not have or have failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested in them, that powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India ought to be exercised. No error is manifest and apparent on the face of the impugned order nor does it cause a grave injustice nor gross failure of justice has been occasioned thereby. C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 There is no occasion, therefore, to interfere with the impugned decision of the learned Trial Court. \n21. Before concluding, reference is made to the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant. The decision of the Karnataka High Court in Base Corporation Ltd. v. Amrutha Power Corporation, [judgment dated 25th September, 2018 in MFA 6564/2011] is not applicable as it relates to the vesting of jurisdiction in a court which otherwise did not have such jurisdiction. That is not the case here. In Shridhar Vyapaar (supra), the payments were made through RTGS into the bank at Kolkata whereas, in the present case, such payments were made into the account maintained by the respondent/plaintiff at ICICI Bank at Rajouri Garden, New Delhi. The decision in Mountain Mist Agro India (supra) was in relation to the N.I. Act and is not relevant for the determination of territorial jurisdiction in civil matters. Similarly, the decision of the Punjab High Court in Piyara Singh v. Bhagwan Das, 1950 C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 SCC OnLine Punj 108 is limited to the inapplicability of the principle 'debtor seeking the creditor' under the N.I. Act. \n22. When, in the present case, the part cause of action has arisen also on account of the payments made by the petitioner/defendant directly into the bank account of the respondent/plaintiff, even if these were not on regular basis, since there is nothing to show that the place of payment had been fixed, even without following the principle that the 'debtor must seek out the creditor', it is clear that the Delhi Courts have jurisdiction to try the suit and the invoice does not vest jurisdiction in a court which had no jurisdiction at all.\" \n12. In case of R.S.D.V. Finance Co.Pvt. Ltd. vs. Shree Vallabh Glass Works Ltd. (supra) the issue again was in respect of jurisdiction where the appellant R.S.D.V. Finance Company Limited filed a summary C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 suit against the respondent Shri Vallabh Glass Works Limited in the original civil jurisdiction of the High Court. As per the case of the plaintiff, it had deposited a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- with interest with the defendant for a period of 90 days and it was given to the defendant company through cheque in the Bank account of the defendant at Bombay. The deposit receipt contained an endorsement to the effect 'Subject to Anand jurisdiction'. The date of maturity of the amount was on 03.10.1983. When the defendant failed to pay the amount of Rs.10,00,000/- and requested the plaintiff to continue the said deposit till the end of November, 1983 and it also handed over to the plaintiff five post dated cheques drawn on a Bombay C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 bank. Thereafter, the defendant issued a cheque for a sum of Rs.22,288.32/- by way of interest on the said amount of Rs.10,00,000/- in favour of the plaintiff payable in Bombay. The five cheques for payment were submitted, but the same were dishonored because of \"insufficient funds\". These five post dated cheques each one was drawn on a Bombay Bank. \n12.1 The summary suit was filed for the principal amount and interest at the rate of 90% with 90 days rests. The endorsement 'Subject to Anand Jurisdiction' was raised as a contention in the written statement and the Bombay High Court was averred not to have jurisdiction to entertain the suit. According to the plaintiff, it never agreed C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 to the condition of the Anand jurisdiction made on the deposit receipt. However, that contention was accepted and since the suit was based on five post dated cheques and the cheques were being payable in Bombay, the Court at Bombay was said to have jurisdiction. The High Court at Bombay had already granted leave to the plaintiff under clause XII of the Letters Patent. The money was deposited by the plaintiff with the defendant at Bombay in defendant's account in the Bank of Baroda, Nariman Point Branch, Bombay. The cheques of repayment of the deposit were given by the defendant drawn on Bank of Baroda, Nariman Point Branch, Bombay. \n12.2 On an appeal by the defendant, the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Division Bench of the Bombay High Court held that the leave granted under clause XII of the Letters Patent must be revoked and it must be held that the Bombay High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit.\n12.3 Aggrieved against the judgment of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, the plaintiff came in appeal before the Apex Court. The defendant company had a Branch Office and also carried on business in Bombay. It also admitted the leave to sue under Clause XII of the Letters Patent was given by the Bombay High Court. The Apex Court considered the effect of the endorsement 'Subject to Anand jurisdiction' made on the deposit receipt issued by the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 defendant. The Apex Court also held that in the facts and circumstances of this case it cannot be disputed that the cause of action had arisen at Bombay as the amount of Rs.10,00,000/- itself was paid through a cheque of the Bank at Bombay and the same was deposited in the Bank account of the defendant in the Bank of Baroda at Nariman Point Bombay. The five post dated cheques were also issued by the defendant being payable to the plaintiff at Bombay. The endorsement 'Subject to Anand jurisdiction' has been made unilaterally by the defendant while issuing the deposit receipt that did not contain the ouster clause using the words like 'alone', 'only', 'exclusive' and the \"like\". Therefore, on the ground that the the maxim 'expressio unius est excusio C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 alterius' cannot be applied and it cannot be held that merely because the deposit receipt contained the endorsement 'Subject to Anand jurisdiction' it excluded the jurisdiction of all other Courts. As per the view taken by the Apex Court in case of A.B.C Laminart Pvt. Ltd. (supra).\n13.In case of Om Prakash Srivastava (supra) the question was of invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court. The appellant filed a Writ Petition before the Delhi High Court which refuse to consider by holding that though it may have jurisdiction to deal with the grievances of the appellant, but this could be more effectively dealt with by the Allahbad High Court. The Apex Court held that the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 question whether or not cause of action wholly or in part for filing a writ petition had arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of any High Court has to be decided in the light of the nature and character of the proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution. The writ petitioner-defendant has to establish to maintain the writ petition that a legal right claimed by him has prima facie either been infringed or is threatened to be infringed by the plaintiff within the territorial limits of the Court's jurisdiction and such infringement may take place by causing him actual injury or threat thereof. In the matter before the Apex Court it held that the Delhi High Court had not dealt with the question as to C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 whether it had jurisdiction to deal with the writ jurisdiction. It only observed that it may have jurisdiction, but the issue is relating to conditions of prisoners in the State of U.P. can be more effectively dealt with by the Allahabad High Court. It was open for the Delhi High Court to say that no part of the cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court, however, it did not say so. On the contrary, it says that jurisdiction may be there, but the Allahabad High Court can deal with the matter more effectively. That was not found to be a correct way to deal with the writ petition. Accordingly, the order was set aside. \nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 13.1 Findings and observations of the Apex Court reiterating well laid down law are as follows. \n\"9.By \"cause of action\" it is meant every fact, which, if traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to a judgment of the Court. In other words, a bundle of facts, which it is necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to succeed in the suit. \n10. In a generic and wide sense (as in Section 20 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908) \"cause of action\" means every fact, which it is necessary to establish to support a right to obtain a judgment. \n11. It is settled law that \"cause of action\"\nconsists of bundle of facts, which give cause to enforce the legal inquiry for redress in a court of law. In other words, it is a bundle of facts, which taken with the law applicable to them, gives the plaintiff a right to claim relief against the defendant. It must include some act C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 done by the defendant since in the absence of such an act no cause of action would possibly accrue or would arise. \n12.The expression \"cause of action\" has acquired a judicially settled meaning. In the restricted sense \"cause of action\" means the circumstances forming the infraction of the right or the immediate occasion for the reaction. In the wider sense, it means the necessary conditions for the maintenance of the suit, including not only the infraction of the right, but also the infraction coupled with the right itself. Compendiously, as noted above the expression means every fact, which it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of the Court. Every fact, which is necessary to be proved, as distinguished from every piece of evidence, which is necessary to prove each fact, comprises in \"cause of action\". \n13. The expression \"cause of action\" has sometimes been employed to convey the restricted idea of facts or circumstances which constitute either the infringement or the basis of a right and no more. In a wider and more C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 comprehensive sense, it has been used to denote the whole bundle of material facts, which a plaintiff must prove in order to succeed. These are all those essential facts without the proof of which the plaintiff must fail in his suit. \n14. The expression \"cause of action\" is generally understood to mean a situation or state of facts that entitles a party to maintain an action in a court or a tribunal; a group of operative facts giving rise to one or more bases of suing; a factual situation that entitles one person to obtain a remedy in court from another person. (See Black's Law Dictionary). In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary a \"cause of action\" is stated to be the entire set of facts that gives rise to an enforceable claim; the phrase comprises every fact, which if traversed, the plaintiff must prove in order to obtain judgment. In \"Words and Phrases\" (4th Edn.) the meaning attributed to the phrase \"cause of action\" in common legal parlance is existence of those facts, which give a party a right to judicial interference on his behalf. C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 15. In Halsbury Laws of England (Fourth Edition) it has been stated as follows:\n\"Cause of action has been defined as meaning simply a factual situation the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from the Court a remedy against another person. The phrase has been held from earliest time to include every fact which is material to be proved to entitle the plaintiff to succeed, and every fact which a defendant would have a right to traverse. 'Cause of action' has also been taken to mean that particular act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint, or the subject matter of grievance founding the action, not merely the technical cause of action\". \n16. As observed by the Privy Council in Payana v. Pana Lana (1914) 41 IA 142, the rule is directed to securing C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 the exhaustion of the relief in respect of a cause of action and not to the inclusion in one and the same action or different causes of action, even though they arises from the same transaction. One great criterion is, when the question arises as to whether the cause of action in the subsequent suit is identical with that in the first suit whether the same evidence will maintain both actions. \n17. It would be appropriate to quote para 61 of the said judgment, which reads as follows:\n\"61.(1) The correct test in cases falling under Order 11 Rule 2, is whether the claim in the new suit is in fact founded upon a cause of action distinct from that which was the foundation of the former suit.\" \n(2) The 'cause of action' means every fact which will be necessary for the plaintiff to prove it tranversed to order to support his right to the judgment. (3) If the evidence to support the two claims is different, then the causes of action are also different. C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 (4) The causes of action in the two suits may be considered to be away if in substance they are identical. (5) The cause of action has no relation whatever to the defence that may be set up by the defendant nor does it depend upon the character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff. It refers ... to the media upon which the plaintiff asks the court to arrive at a conclusion in his favour. This observation was made by Lord Waston in a case under Section 43 of the Act of 1882 where plaintiff made various claims in the same suit.\" \n14. In case of State of Gujarat vs. Union of India, passed in Special Civil Application No.737 of 2018 the question which was raised before the Court in a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India was whether Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act affects the powers of the High Court under Article 227 C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 of the Constitution of India. On extensive consideration of the decisions of the Apex Court including in case of Surya Dev Rai vs. Ram Chander Rai And Others, reported in (2003)6 SCC 675 and of Shalini Shyam Shetty And Another v. Rajendra Shankar Patil, reported in (2010) 8 SCC 329 and other decisions, this Court had held that bar contained under Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act shall not affect the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. It went to an extent of same that if the contention on behalf of the plaintiff that considering Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act, the writ jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is barred, it accepted such a provision would C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 suffer from the vice of unconstitutionality as observed by the Apex Court in these decisions. The power vested in the High Courts to exercise judicial superintendence over the decisions of the courts and Tribunals within their respective jurisdictions is part of the basic structure of the Constitution and no legislature can take away such power of superintendence conferred under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \n15. In case of Rajasthan High Court Advocate's Association vs. Union of India and others, reported in (2001) 2 SCC 294 the question of jurisdiction of the Court and the meaning of cause of action had been considered by the Apex Court to hold thus:\nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 \"17. The expression cause of action has acquired a judicially settled meaning. In the restricted sense cause of action means the circumstances forming the infraction of the right or the immediate occasion for the action. In the wider sense it means the necessary conditions for the maintenance of the suit, including not only the infraction of the right, but the infraction coupled with the right itself. Compendiously the expression means every fact which it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of the Court. Every fact which is necessary to be proved, as distinguished from every piece of evidence which is necessary to prove each fact, comprises in cause of action. \nIt has to be left to be determined in each individual case as to where the cause of action arises. The Chief Justice of the High court has not been conferred with the legislative competence to define cause of action or to declare where it would be deemed to have arisen so as to lay down artificial or deeming test for determining territorial jurisdiction over an individual case or class of cases. The permanent bench at Jaipur has been established by the Presidential Order issued under sub-section (2) of Section 51 of the Act. The territorial jurisdiction of the permanent bench at Jaipur is to be exercised in respect of the cases arising in the specified districts. Whether the case arises from one of the specified districts or not so as to determine the jurisdictional competence to hear by C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 reference to territory bifurcated between the principal seat and the bench seat, shall be an issue to be decided in an individual case by the judge or judges hearing the matter if a question may arise in that regard. The impugned explanation appended to the Order of the Chief Justice dated 23rd December, 1976 runs counter to the Presidential Order and in a sense it is an inroad into the jurisdiction of the judges hearing a particular case or cases, pre-empting a decision to be given in the facts of individual case whether it can be said to have arisen in the territory of a particular district. The High Court is right in taking the view which it has done. \n18. It was submitted at the end by the learned counsel for the appellant that the Division Bench of the High Court in its impugned order has observed that the permanent bench at Jaipur shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear the cases arising out of the 11 specified districts and the High Court at Jodhpur shall not have jurisdiction to hear those cases which fall within the territorial jurisdiction of Jaipur Bench. He submitted that the use of word exclusive pre-fixed to jurisdiction is uncalled for. We find no substance in this contention as well. The purpose of the Presidential Order is to carve out and define territorial jurisdiction between the principal seat at Jodhpur and the permanent bench seat at Jaipur. The cases are to be heard accordingly unless the Chief C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Justice may exercise in his discretion the power vested in him by the proviso to para 2 of the Presidential order. Clauses (1) and (2) of Article 226 of the Constitution provide how territorial jurisdiction shall be exercised by any High Court. Although the said clauses do not deal with principal seat or permanent bench of any High Court but in our opinion, there is no reason why the principle underlying thereunder cannot be applied to the functioning of the bifurcated territorial jurisdiction between the principal seat and permanent bench seat of any High Court. In case of a dispute arising whether an individual case or cases should be filed and heard at Jodhpur or Jaipur, the same has to be found out by applying the test from which district the case arises, that is, in which district the cause of action can be said to have arisen and then exercising the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution.\" \n16. In case of Economic Transport Organisation (supra) the issue that arose before the Munsiff's Court, Kozhikode in Kerala was whether the court had territorial jurisdiction to try the suit. The Court answered the issue in favour of C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 the plaintiffs, which was challenged before Kerala High Court in revision. The plaintiff consigned goods from Calicut to Sohranpur for carriage by the defendants revisionist, who constituted a transport undertaking. Consignment was not delivered at the destination and the goods had been insured with the first plaintiff. Insurer paid value of the goods to the second plaintiff and both of them filed the suit for recovery of damages from the transport undertaking. Head Office of the transport was at Calcutta, contract was entered into and the Branch Office of the transport undertaking was also situated at Calicut within the jurisdiction of the Munisiff's Court, Calicut. Consignment was to be delivered at a place within the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 jurisdiction of Kerala Court. There was no dispute that part of the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of two courts and both the Courts had jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit for damages. The defendant's Branch Office was situated within the jurisdiction of Calicut Court and therefore, the Calicut Court also had jurisdiction. \n16.1 Thus, the plaintiffs had choice of forums and they had exercise their choice. The trial Court had found that it had not been proved that the parties had entered into a binding contract ousting the jurisdiction of the Calicut Court and choosing the exclusive jurisdiction of the Calcutta Court. This was the finding which was assailed by the revisionist C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 petitioners. The agreement between the parties in the case is said to be contained in the consignment note given by the transport undertaking to the second plaintiff. Note had been prepared which was in a printed form containing various columns. At the bottom of the first page, the three sentences were printed and the third sentence reads: \"Subject to Cacutta jurisdiction only\". According to the revision petitioners, this amounts to agreement between the parties ousting jurisdiction of the Calicut court and investing exclusive jurisdiction in Calcutta High Court. \n16.2 This was rebutted by the plaintiffs and had been rejected by the court below. Therefore, the question that arose for C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 consideration was whether the printed words in small letters at the bottom of the first page of the consignment note \"subject to Calcutta jurisdiction only\" would constitute the term of agreement between the parties. \n16.3 After considering number of cases, the Kerala High Court held that when there is a choice of forum, it is open to the parties to agree on any exclusive forum for settlement of disputes. But such an agreement must be clearly spelling out either by express words or by necessary implication. Ouster of jurisdiction of courts cannot be lightly assumed or presumed and if there is such a concluded agreement, it will certainly operate as C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 estoppel against the parties to the contract. It is merely a unilateral affirmation or statement made by one of the parties, as long as it is not shown that the statement has been accepted by the other party as a term or condition of the agreement, it cannot be held that there is an agreement to confer exclusive jurisdiction on any court. Particular caution is necessary in regard to such a clause contained in a printed form, as in the case before Kerala High Court. It further held that where the printed form is signed by both the parties or where a form printed by one party is singed by the other party and forwarded by the letter to the former and the printed form contains clear words conferring exclusive jurisdiction on C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 a court at any particular place or ousting jurisdiction of the Court at any place, it may not be difficult to hold that the parties have agreed on such a term. \nHowever, in such a situation also, the Court may not have to be oblivious of the fact that the people often sign order forms containing a good deal of printed matter without caring to read what is printed and therefore, it cannot be said that everything which is printed may be deemed to form the part of the contract and where a printed form by one party is sent and is signed only by that party and delivered to the other party, without anything more, it would be difficult for the court to hold that there has been consensus parties are ad-idem in regard to the particular clause. C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Accordingly, the revision was dismissed. 16.4 The Apex Court extensively dealt with this issue of jurisdiction in the following manner: \n\"10. L.T. Societa v. Lakshminarayan (AIR 1959 Calcutta 669) dealt with a bill of lading containing several detailed clauses, one of which said that all requests for compensation shall be submitted for settlement to the agencies of the shipping company at the place of discharge and failing the agreement party to the claim intending to take legal steps against the company may summon them before the judicial authorities of Treiste or Genoa and expressly renounced the competence of any other judicial authorities. It was held that this detailed clause forms part of the agreement accepted by the parties and therefore parties are bound by the same. In M.B.T. Co. Madras v. A. Narasinha Rao (1968 (1) Andhra W.R.\n424) , the Court was dealing with a forwarding note, reverse of which contained printed terms and conditions, one of which was that the court in Madras city alone had jurisdiction in respect of claims and matters arising under the consignment and the court at Sattenapalle had no jurisdiction to entertain suit. The Court upheld the agreement as not being violative of S. 28 of the Act. \nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 However, there was no specific contention before the Court that the clause did not form part of the contract and therefore the Court had no occasion to decide that question. In S. Manuel Raj & Co. v. J. Manilal & Co. (AIR 1963 Guj. 148), Court was dealing with a printed form, printed by A and signed by B. Order in the printed form was sent by A to B. It was treated as a contract by correspondence and it was held that the clause in the printed form stating \"subject to jurisdiction of a place Q\"\nconferred exclusive jurisdiction on that Court and that the agreement was enforceable. \n11. In E.I.D. Parry (India) Ltd. v. Savani Transport (AIR 1980 A.P.30), the Court was dealing with two Way Bills at the top of which were printed in red link the words \"subject to Bombay jurisdiction\", and on the reverse of which were printed a clause. \"The Court in Bombay State alone shall have jurisdiction in respect of all claims and matters arising under the consignment or of the goods entrusted for transport.\" and also the clause \"The contract shall be deemed to have been entered into and made with the Administrative and Head Office of the Company at Bombay.\" Court treated these clauses as being part of the agreement. In this case also it was not specifically contended before the Court that the clauses did not form part of the agreement. \nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 12. In Hassani Stores v. Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (1961 K.L.T. 314), a Division Bench of this Court was dealing with the provisions in a contract note whereby the plaintiff was bound to institute suit in a court in Bombay and nowhere else. It was not contended before the Court that the clause was not part of the agreement. The contention was that it was only a provisional agreement. This contention was overruled. It was held to be valid. In Sri Prasad Industrials v. Savani Transports (P) Ltd. (1978 K.L.T. 248), a single Bench of this Court considered a regular contract between the seller and the transporter, Clause (17) of which stated:\n\"This contract shall be deemed to have been entered into and made with the administrative and Head office of the company at Bombay. It is therefore expressly agreed that the courts in Bombay alone shall have jurisdiction in respect of all claims and matters arising under the consignment or of the goods entrusted for transport.\" \n13.Contention was that the contract was not binding on the buyer. This contention was overruled by this Court. In Jafko Engineers v. Kerala State S.S.I. Corporation (1979 K.L.T. 206), a single Bench of this Court was dealing with a regular contract as per the terms of which exclusive jurisdiction was given to courts at one place. In this case also there was no contention that the particular clause C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 was not part of the agreement. The court upheld the agreement. \n14. Patel Bros. v. Vadilal (AIR 1959 Madras 227) dealt with a case of contract evidenced by a bill on which were printed at the top the words \"subject to Bombay jurisdiction\". The court held that the clause did not exclude jurisdiction of any other court. Ouster of jurisdiction of a court to which a person is entitled to resort to under the Civil Procedure Code or any other statute cannot be a matter of assumption or presumption but one to be proved by express words contained in the contract or at least by necessary or inevitable implication and that the test was not satisfied in that case. It was further held that the mere printing of those words cannot amount to a contract that both parties agreed to have Bombay as the venue for settlement of disputes. \n15. C. Satyanarayana v. L. Narasimham (AIR 1968 A.P.\n330) dealt with a letter written in letter head at the top of which were printed the words \"subject to Madras jurisdiction.\" It was held that merely because defendants had caused such printed words, it cannot become part of the contract, unless they were expressly agreed to by the plaintiff. It was held that there was no agreement. G.P. Venkataraju v. Palukuri (AIR 1975 A.P. 32) dealt with the case of a bill prepared by the defendant and addressed to C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 the plaintiff. The bill contained at the top printed words \"subject to Calcutta jurisdiction\". The court held that the words did not amount to contract between the parties to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the Calcutta Court. \n16. The Allahabad High Court in Kanpur Sugar Supply v. Harsukh (AIR 1971 Allahabad 502) dealt with a case of a series of bills and letters at the top of which were written the words \"subject to Rajkot courts only.\" The court said that by accepting the hundi or the bill, the receiver thereof was not agreeing to the condition that only Rajkot courts shall have the exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute. He may accept the bill and take delivery of the goods to avoid unnecessary disputes. But where in spite of the clear provision as to the exclusive jurisdiction of Rajkot courts, the party places a fresh order and accepts the condition, no other inference can be drawn except that both the parties had agreed that Rajokt courts alone shall have the exclusive jurisdiction. In Surajmall v. Kalinga Iron Works (AIR 1979) Ori. 126), the defendant sent a purchase order to the plaintiff and the plaintiff sent work order to the defendant. The words \"subject to Calcutta jurisdiction\" were printed at the top of the purchase order. The purchase order was not signed by the plaintiff. It was only a communication sent by the defendant to the plaintiff. The court held that it cannot be said that the plaintiff agreed to confine settlement in C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 allegation of disputes between the parties only at one place namely Calcutta. Ouster of court's jurisdiction should not be easily construed and could not be assumed or presumed very easily. It must be proved by necessary or inevitable implication. \n17. In Jagannath v. Nanakkal (1972 M.P.L.J. 981), Madhya Pradesh High Court considered an agreement relating to sale of goods. Body of the agreement contained no stipulation regarding jurisdiction. But the original agreement was on printed form with a heading \"subject to Vikarabaugh jurisdiction\". The Court held that inference of agreement to oust the jurisdiction cannot be drawn from the printed words of such a nature in the absence of any other evidence to show that it was actually a term of the agreement. \n18. In Secretary, Vikalanga Sevaka Co-op. Society Ltd. v. Sheth Brothers (1983 K.L.T. 652), Kader J. considered a long line of decisions of various courts to decide whether the printed words at the top of a bill \"subject to Delhi jurisdiction\" amounted to ouster of jurisdiction of other courts. The learned Judge held that the words did not constitute an agreement between the parties by which they agreed to oust the jurisdiction of all the courts except the courts in Delhi. \nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 19. When there is choice of forum, it is certainly open to the parties to agree on an exclusive forum for settlement of disputes. But such an agreement must be clearly spelled out either by express words or by necessary implication. Ouster of jurisdiction of courts cannot be lightly assumed or presumed. If there is such a concluded agreement, it will certainly operate as estoppel against the parties to the contract. If it is merely a unilateral affirmation or statement made by one of the parties, as long as it is not shown that the statement has been accepted by the other party as a term or condition of the agreement, it cannot be held that there is an agreement to confer exclusive jurisdiction on any court. Particular caution is necessary in regard to such a clause contained in a printed form, as in this case. Where the printed form is signed by both the parties or where a form printed by one party is signed by the other party and forwarded by the latter to the former and the printed form contains clear words conferring exclusive jurisdiction on a court at any particular place or ousting jurisdiction of the Court at any other place, it may not be difficult to hold that the parties have agreed on such a term. Even in such cases, courts must remember that people often sign order forms containing a good deal of printed matter without caring to read what is printed. It cannot always be said that everything which is printed may be deemed to form part of the contract. Where a form printed by one party is signed only by that C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 party and delivered to the other party, without anything more it will be difficult for the court to hold that there has been consensus ad idem in regard to the particular clause. Of course, if there is some other material to indicate acceptance or consent of the party who received the printed form, then the court is free to infer that the clause formed part of the agreement. \n20. If it can be held that the printed clause in the consigment note in this case formed part of the agreement, there is clearly ouster of jurisdiction of courts at Calicut. The form was got printed by the transport undertaking. It was signed by an employee of the undertaking. It was not signed by the consignor, second plaintiff. It was merely delivered to the consignor. Contract was entered into not by correspondence. It was a case of a single transaction covered by a single bill. The words themselves are printed in small letters at the very bottom of the way bill. There is no other material before the Court to show that this printed material was brought to the notice of the second plaintiff or that the second plaintiff had accepted the same. In these circumstances, I hold that this particular clause did not form part of the agreement between the parties. Parties did not agree to oust the jurisdiction of the Court at Calicut or to vest exclusive jurisdiction in courts at Calcutta. C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 21 . There is another aspect to this question. As pointed by Thakkar J. of the Gujarat High Court (as he then was) in Snehalkumara Sarabhai v. E.T. Organisation (AIR 1975 Guj. 72) while parties can lawfully enter into an agreement to restrict a dispute to a particular Court having jurisdiction, that stipulation though valid cannot take away the jurisdiction of the Court which admittedly has jurisdiction. The ouster clause can operate as estoppel against the parties to the contract. It cannot the hands of the court and denude it of the power to do justice. Ordinarily, Courts would respect agreement between the parties which is born out of the meeting of their minds and out of consideration of convenience. But the Courts are not obliged to do so in every case. Where the ouster clause is calculated to operate as an engine of oppression and as a means to defeat the ends of justice, it would be oppressive to drive the plaintiff to a court in a distant place to recover a comparatively small sum. The stipulation can be ignored by the excluded Court which otherwise possesses jurisdiction if it is considered to be oppressive having regard to the surrounding circumstances including the stakes involved. This is particularly so, when the defendant firm has its office and is doing business within the local limits of the courts and it would be unjust to enforce the stipulation against the plaintiff whilst it would not cause any real prejudice to the other side. In such case, the Court would refuse to entertain the contract C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 made by the contesting parties. On this reasoning, the Court interfered with the judgment of the Court below denying decree to the plaintiff on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction. Kader J. in 1983 K.L.T. 652 referred to these observations of the Gujarat High Court with approval. With great respect, I agree that this rule of reason and equity must also guide courts. \n17. Delhi High Court in case of Satyapal (supra) was considering the substantial question of law in the second appeal where one of the questions was pertaining to territorial jurisdiction. The case of plaintiff was that goods were supplied from Delhi, and hence, the cause of action partly arose in Delhi. As per the pleadings, the good were supplied at Bhiwadi in Rajasthan. The pleadings did not indicate that any part of cause of action accrued in favour of the plaintiff in Delhi. The Court considered the findings C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 and observations of the first appellate court by holding that first appellate court's observations were perverse because the trial Court by a very exhaustive judgment had held that the Court at Delhi had territorial jurisdiction; firstly because the payment was to be made in Delhi as once no place of payment is specified, the debtor has to seek the creditor, and since the creditor/plaintiff was at Delhi, therefore, the payment needed to be made at Delhi and part of the cause of action would accordingly arise at Delhi and the second reason for holding that civil courts at Delhi had territorial jurisdiction was because the contract was entered at Delhi as the order was placed upon the appellant/ plaintiff at Delhi. The Court held thus:\nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 \"22. It is a well established principle of law that where, under a contract no place of payment is specified, the debtor must seek his creditor and therefore a suit for recovery is maintainable at the place where the creditor resides or works for gain, because a part of the cause of action arises at that place also with the contemplation of section 20(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Reference may be made to the judgments titled as \"State of Punjab v. A.K. Raha\" reported as AIR 1964 CALCUTTA 418 (DB), \"Jose Paul v. Jose\" reported as AIR 2002 KERALA 397 (DB), \"Rajasthan State Electricity Board v. Dayal Wood Works\" reported as AIR 1998 ANDHRA PRADESH 381, \"Munnisa Begum v. Noore Mohd.\" Reported as AIR 1965 ANDHRA PRADESH 231 and \"State of U.P. v. Raja Ram\"\nreported as AIR 1966 Allahabad 159.\n23. In the judgment titled as \"State of Punjab v. A.K. Raha\" reported as AIR 1964 CALCUTTA 418 (DB) it was clearly held:\n..The general rule is that where no place of payment is specified in the contract either expressly or impliedly, the debtor must seek the creditor, see The Eider (1893) P 119 at p. 136, Drexel v. Drexel. (1916) 1 Ch 251 at p. 261, North Bengal, Das Brothers Zemindary Co. Ltd V. Surendera Nath Das, ILR (1957) 2 Cal 8. The obligation to pay the debt involves the obligation to find the creditor and to pay him at the place where he is when the money C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 is payable. The application of the general rule is not excluded because the amount of debt is disputed....\" \n24. In the judgment titled as Sreenivasa Pulvarising vs Jal Glass & Chemicals pvt. Ltd. reported as AIR 1985 Cal 74 it was also held:\n\"......In a contract of the nature now under consideration performance of the contract consists not only of delivery of the goods but also of payment of the price. Therefore, cause of action for a suit on breach of such a contract would arise not only where the goods were to be delivered but also where the price would be payable on such delivery.....\" \nIt was further held:\n\".......9. Therefore, the law continues to remain the same and in a suit arising out of a contract, a part of the cause of action arises at the place where in performance of the contract any money to which the suit relates in payable. ...\"\nAdverting to the facts of the present case office/factory of the Plaintiff is situated at Jwala nagar, Shahdara, Delhi-32. No place of payment has been specified in the contract/bills/invoices. The defendants are liable to make the payment for the goods supplied to them. No application was made by the defendants to the plaintiffs C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 for fixing a place of payment and Sec. 49 of the Indian Contract Act cannot apply to the facts of the case. Therefore, the payment was to be made at the office of the plaintiff. Further the purchase order was placed at Jwala Nagar, Shahdara, Delhi-32 and the goods were supplied from Jwala nagar, Shahdara, Delhi-32 Therefore a part of th cause of action definitely arises at Jawala Nagar, Shahdara, Delhi-32. Hence the present suit for recovery of the sale price can be filed before this court as the office of the plaintiff is situated within the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of the court. \n25. I therefore hold that this court has the territorial jurisdiction to try and entertain the present suit. This issue is therefore decided in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants.\" \nDebtor to seek creditor: \n18. This Court in Greentose PVT LTD vs. Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers Co.\nLtd., in Second Appeal No.154 of 2013 was also considering the issue of jurisdiction where the respondent- original plaintiff had submitted that the alleged condition on C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 jurisdiction did not form part of the contract between the parties. The plaintiff had no knowledge about the so-called clause relied on until the contract was completed. It was in a printed form on the printed invoice which was raised by the defendant after the plaintiff dispatched the purchase order. It was his contention that the contract was completed with sending of purchase order. Any clause on jurisdiction was not brought to the knowledge of the plaintiff and hence, was not part of contract. The suit was for damages for breach of contract, for which the defendant had given guarantee and had undertaken to indemnify for faulty material. \n18.1 The principal point raised by the appellant about the jurisdiction was based C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 on the documents forming part of the transactions which showed that there was a clause regarding the court at Bombay having jurisdiction, and it was agreed between the parties and it being in the nature of exclusionary clause on jurisdiction, the suit instituted at Bharuch was not competent in law. For considering whether the contract between the parties contained any condition as to confer the jurisdiction on the courts at Bombay only and whether such condition was impliedly agreed upon or emanated from the correspondence leading the contract, the material aspect considered by the Court was the point of time the contract could be said to have been completed between the parties. Considering section 4 of the Contract Act, C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 1872 which provided as to when communication of acceptance of offer becomes complete, the Court held that the acceptance of offer becomes complete as against the proposer when it is put into transmission to the defendant and when it goes out of control or power of the acceptor i.e. the plaintiff. Thus, as soon as the Purchase Order is sent by the plaintiff accepting the proposal, the communication of a proposal is complete when it comes to knowledge of the person to whom it is made as per Section 4 of the Contract Act, 1872. The Purchase Order was sent from the place of plaintiff in Bharuch, Gujarat to the defendant at Bombay. The acceptance of offer in so far as the plaintiff was concerned, became C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 complete with dispatch of the Purchase Order by the plaintiff. It was the issuance of Purchase Order which was the point of co-terminus when the contract between the parties completed. \n18.2         The reference was also made to the decision            of    ONGC     vs       Modern          Construction Company,            reported           in          [1997          Law          Suit (Gujarat) 123] where facts were that the contractor's tender was accepted by ONGC at Bombay, the work order was issued by the Superintending Engineer, Gujarat, the work was to be performed at Hazira, Surat, the payment was made at Bombay and Surat. This court observed that when the offers came to be accepted by ONGC, communication of acceptance was sent by ONGC to the contractor from Surat to Mansa by C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 telegrams, it was clear therefore that the communication of acceptance became complete qua the contractor, who was original proposer when intimation was sent into transmission by telegram from Surat to Mansa. \n18.3 Thus, communication of acceptance of offers maturing into conclusion of contract got completed as against the contractor when telegrams were sent from Surat and as against the acceptor O.N.G.C. When the telegrams were received by the proposer-contractor which means that contract came to be concluded the moment telegrams were sent from Surat as there was completion of acceptance of offers in so far as proposer of the offer was concerned and qua proposer-contractor and proposal C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 became promises. But insofar as acceptor O.N.G.C. was concerned, it had an option to revoke the acceptance of offers till communication was received by the proposer. \nTherefore, the Court held that the contention that contract was completed at place, Mansa, in Mehsana District, on the ground that intimation of communication of acceptance, i.e., the telegrams were received was not sustainable. The Court, therefore, in case of Greentose Pvt.Ltd. (supra) had also held that until the time the contract culminated and was completed, the clause in respect of jurisdiction was not in picture. The mention about \"Bombay jurisdiction\" was in the invoice raised pursuant to the Purchase Order of the plaintiff. What was stated in the invoice C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 was that \"This sale is subject to our business terms. Bombay jurisdiction and interest at 18%\". According to the Court, it was debatable in itself whether the above words would constitute in its effect a clause on jurisdiction, much less an exclusionary clause, whereby it could be construed that the jurisdiction would be of Bombay court only. \n18.4 The findings and observations of the Court would need to be reproduced below: \n\"6.4 In Hakam Sing Vs Gammon [(1971) 1 SCC 286], the Apex Court held, \"But such an agreement must be spelled out either by express words or by necessary implication. Ouster of jurisdiction of Courts cannot be lightly assumed or presumed. If there is such a concluded agreement, it will certainly operate as estoppal against the parties to the contract. If it is merely a unilateral affirmation C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 or statement made by one of the parties, as long as it is not shown that the statement has been accepted by the other party as a term or condition of the agreement, it cannot be held that there is an agreement to confer exclusive jurisdiction on any Court. Particular caution is necessary in regard to such a clause contained in a printed form, as in this case. Where the printed form is signed by both the parties or where a form printed by one party is signed by the other party and forwarded by the latter to the former and the printed form contains clear words clear words conferring exclusive jurisdiction on a court at any particular place or ousting jurisdiction of the court at any other place, it may not be difficult to hold that the parties have agreed on such a term. Even in such cases, Courts must remember that, people often sign order forms containing a good deal of printed matter without caring to read what is printed. It cannot always be said that everything which is printed may be deemed to form part of the contract. Where a form printed by one party is signed only by third party and delivered to the other party, without anything more it will be difficult for the court to hold that there has been consensus ad idem in regard to the particular clause. Of course, if there is some other material to indicate acceptance or consent of the party who received the printed form, C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 then the court is free to infer that the clause formed part of the agreement.\" \n6.5 Relying on Hakam Sing (supra), the Kerala High Court in United India Insurance Company Limited vs Associated Transport Corporation Private Limited and another [AIR 1998 Kerala 36](supra), set out the position of law. In the case before the Kerala High Court Exhibit. B1 contained printed words \"subject to Bombay jurisdiction alone\", and the Kerala High Court observed thus, \"Apart from the existence of these printed words, respondent has no case that there was a meeting of minds between the consignor and the carrier and there was a specific agreement in that behalf. The consignment was delivered to the carrier, the carrier took custody of the goods and thereafter issued the receipt or consignment note which contained the printed words. The note was signed only by an employee of the respondent. No doubt, they were handed over to the consignor. Hut there was nothing to indicate that there was an agreement between the parties to confer exclusive jurisdiction to Bombay Court. These printed words by themselves and without anything more would not be sufficient to constitute an agreement to oust the jurisdiction of all court other the court specified.\" \nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 6.6 In order that a condition becomes binding to the parties to the contract, and which applies to the conditions or clause as to the jurisdiction as well, the sine qua non is firstly, it must form part of the contract itself. Secondly, it ought to have been conveyed in the proper manner. The courts have held as noted above that merely because the standard printed form of invoice mentioned the jurisdiction subject to a particular place, it cannot exclude the jurisdiction of the court at other places where part of cause of action may arise. The next requirement is that the party must have knowledge of the condition and that both the sides must be ad idem. In any view, this essential ingredient was not there. \nxxx 7.1 The cause of action in the suit arising out of contract, would arise within the meaning of Section 20(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Such cause of action may arise at the place where the contract is made. It may arise at the place where contract is to be performed or came to be performed. The cause of action may also arise at a place where in performance of the contract, any money due thereunder expressly or impliedly has to be carried out.\nC / SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 7.2 In a suit for damages for breach of contract, the origination of cause of action is the bundle of facts by which the breach takes place and is felt. In this regard, the place where the contract is to be performed and in course of performance, the breach is noticed becomes significant fact for arising of cause of action. Since the cause of action consisting breach of the contract, the suit can be filed where the breach of the contract occurred. The plaintiff's suit in the present case was for damages for breach of contract-the performance guarantee and the breach occurred when the department concerned found at Bharuch in course of practical use of the goods-the conveyor belts that they were defective and they were defective and faulty. It could not be gainsaid that at least, a part of cause of action accrued that the place where the contract was performed and therefore, the court at Bharuch could be the proper jurisdictional venue for instituting the suit for damages on the ground of breach of contract.\n19. The Privy Council's decision in case of Soniram Jeetmull (supra) shall also need to be regarded. The question of course was with regard to the jurisdiction. The Court held that where there is an obligation to C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 pay money and either from the terms of the contract of from necessities of the case, a further obligation is implied to find the creditor so as to pay him, section 49 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 as to the place for performance of the promise, when no place is fixed, does not apply.\n19.1 It was a case where by a contract was made in Calcutta, the appellants agreed to make good to the plaintiffs' defaults in payments to them in respect of sales and purchases of grains in Rangoon, where the plaintiffs had a business branch. By leave of High Court at Rangoon, the plaintiffs sued appellants in that Court or money due under their agreement. It was held by the Privy Council that the appellants were under an implied obligation to pay in C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Rangoon and that consequently part of cause of action arose there and there was jurisdiction under clause 10 of the High Court Charter.\n19.2 The appellants were a firm carrying on business in Calcutta and the plaintiffs were a limited Company whose registered office was in Bombay, carrying on business at Calcutta, Bombay and Rangoon and in 1919 they had taken over and had since continued the business of Tata Sons and Co. By a contract made in Calcutta in 1911, the appellants agreed to assist Tata, Sons and Co. in securing constituents to purchase and/or sell grains in Rangoon, on constituents' account as common agents only and they would make good any undisputed claim which Tata, Sons and Co. might lose C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 owing to the failure or suspending payment of constituents. In consideration, Tata, Sons and Co. agreed to pay the appellants one-quarter of the commission they received. \n19.3 In 1924, the plaintiffs sued the appellants in the High Court at Rangoon to recover under the agreement the amount of two unsatisfied judgments which they had obtained against Calcutta firm. The High Court, on an ex parte application granted leave under clause 10 of the Charter to bring the suit. Under that clause the High Court has jurisdiction where a defendant does not reside or carry on business within the local limit of the jurisdiction and if, the cause of action arises wholly, or with leave of the Court, in part within those C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 limits, this was objected to in the written statement, that did not give the jurisdiction in the suit and the question was directed to be tried as a preliminary issue. In this backdrop, the Court held that it is a duty of debtor to seek creditor and the place of payment is impliedly fixed. \n20. In case of State of Punjab vs. A.K.Raha (supra) the appeal was by defendant-State of Punjab against a decree directing an inquiry as to the amount due and payable to the plaintiff company in respect of their claim. The question was the place of payment of the final bill when is not stated in the contract in terms, whether by necessary implication from the nature and the terms of the contract and the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 surrounding circumstances, the place of payment of the final bill may be fixed. The Court held that general rule in that where no place of payment is specified in the contract either expressly or impliedly, the debtor must seek the creditor. The obligation to pay the debt involves the obligation to find the creditor and to pay him at the place where he is when the money is payable. The application of the general rule is not excluded because the amount of debt is disputed. \n20.1 Profitably the findings and observations of the Apex Court would need to be reproduced. \n\"3.The place of payment of the final bill is not stated in the contract in express terms. If no place of payment is specified in the contract in express terms, the place may sometimes be fixed by necessary implication from the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 nature and the terms of the contract and the surrounding circumstances, see Mahaluxmi Bank Ltd. v. Chotanagpore Industrial and Commercial Association. 95 Cal L J 64 :\n(UK 1955 Cal 413), Sailendra Nath v. Ramsundar Ghosh, 16 Cal L J 279, Riley v. Holland (William) & Sons Ltd., (1911) 1 K B 1028 at p. 1031. In Soniram Jeetmull v. R. D. Tata & Co., Ltd. the Judicial Committee found that the obligation to pay the plaintiff company involved the obligation to pay them at their branch office 'at Rangoon. \nIn Thompson v. Palmer, (1893) 2 Q B 80, the Court held that the obligation to pay the plaintiff, a civil engineer, his travelling expenses and percentage of commission on the value of the work of construction done under his superintendence outside England involved an obligation to pay him at Newcastle where he generally earned on business and where the necessary plans and calculations for the work would be available and he would have the means of ascertaining the correctness or otherwise of the amount tendered. The fact that the moneys are payable to limited company may support the conclusion that the payment should be made at their registered office, which is the only place where in point of law they can be considered as legally existing: See Charles Duval & Co., Ltd. v. Gans, (1904) 2 K. B. 685, at p. 692, The question is whether in the instant case, the place of payment of the final bill may be fixed by necessary implication from the nature and terms of the contract and the surrounding C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 circumstances. During the relevant period of time, the Government of Punjab had its head-quarters at Simla but it is not suggested that Simla is the place of payment. Nangal is the place where the work was done and where the Executive Engineer had his office and measurement books and where the final bill was submitted. Mr. Ghose does not, however, claim that Nangal is the place of payment of the monies due under the final bill. The suggestion in the written statement was that the monies due to the plaintiff were payable at the treasury at Una, district Hoshiarpur, Punjab. The suggestion is not supported by the evidence on the record. Before us Mr. Ghose did not attempt to support the case so made ia the written statement. On behalf of the defendant the only positive suggestion was that the final bill was payable at one of the treasuries of the defendant in the Punjab, but we cannot accept this suggestion. We cannot find any necessary implication in the contract that the plaintiffs were obliged to receive payment of their final bill at any one of the numerous treasuries of the Punjab Government in the Punjab. Mr. Ghosh did not make any other positive suggestion with regard to the place of payment of the final bill. On the other hand, we find that the plaintiff company lad all along their registered office in Calcutta. They lad a temporary establishment at Nangal during the progress of the work; but with the conclusion of the work the temporary establishment was closed down. Before the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 commencement of the work the defendant sent to the plaintiffs at their registered office at Calcutta the tender notice, the request in writing to send the security deposit and also the order to commence work. After the conclusion of the work, the plaintiff company sent all their communications to the defendant from their registered office at Calcutta. The final bill was sent by the plaintiff company from their registered office where their measurements and cumulations were available. In the light of these surrounding circumstances and on a tair reading of the contract, we think that the obligation under the contract to pay to the plaintiff company the amount due on their final bill by necessary implication involved the obligation to pay them at their registered office at Calcutta wheretheir measurements and calculations were available. The breach of this obligation therefore took place at Calcutta. \n4. The case has been argued on the alternative footing that no place for payment can be fixed by necessary implication. No application was made by the defendant to the plaintiffs for fixing a place of payment and Section 49 of the Indian Contract Act cannot apply to the facts of the case. The general rule in that where no place of payment is specified in the contract either expressly or impliedly, the debtor must seek the creditor, see The Eider (1893) P 119 at p. 136, Drexel v. Drexel. (1916) 1 Ch 251 at p. C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 261, North Bengal, Das Brothers Zemindary Co. Ltd. v. Surendra Nath Das, ILR (1957) 2 Cal 6. The obligation to pay the debt involves the obligation to find the creditor and to pay him at the place where he is when the money is payable. The application of the general rule is not excluded because the amount of debt is disputed. On behalf of the appellant it is argued that the our attention was drawn to the case of Sabjee Sahib v. Noordiu Sahib, ILR 22 Mad 139. We cannot accept this contention. The claim for damages has been abandoned. The claim, as it stands now, is for refund of the security deposit and for payment of the price of the work done. The bill gives the quantities and particulars of the work done and the rates charged. Part of the claim is for price of the work done, including extras, to be ascertained by measuring each particular class of work and pricing it in accordance with the contract schedule. Beyond doubt, this claim is a debt or liquidated demand, see Halsbury's Laws of England, Third Edition Volume 3, Article 917, page 474. The rest of the claim is on a quantum meruit for reasonable price for work done for which no price is fixed. It is again well settled that an action of debt can be maintained for the value of work and labour upon a quantum meruit, see Lagos v. Grunwaldt, (1910) 1 K B 41 at pp. 46, 48, Stephenson v. Weir, (1879) 4 L R Ir 369 at p. 373. The value of the work done and of goods sold and delivered for which no price is fixed, formerly recoverable under C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 the Courts known as quantum meruit and quantum valeabat could be sued for under the indebitatus accounts, see Bullens and Leake Pleadings, Second Edition, p. 28. By the application of the general common law rate also the defendant was under an obligation to pay to the plaintiffs their dues under their final bill at their registered office at Calcutta and the breach of this obligation took place there. \n21. It is thus clear from the catena of decisions that in a suit for damage for breach of contract, the cause of action would arise within the meaning of section 20(C) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Such cause of action may arise at the place where contract is made or at the place where contract is to be performed or came to be performed. The origination of cause of action being the bundle of facts by which the breach takes place and is noticed and therefore, the breach which is noticed C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 become significant fact for arising of cause of action. \n22 . It is always open to the parties to agree on any exclusive forum for settlement of dispute, but such an agreement must be cleared which spells out either by expressed or by necessary implication ouster of jurisdiction of the Court. The ouster of Court's jurisdiction cannot be lightly assumed and if there is a concluded agreement, it will surely operate as estoppel against the parties to the contract. If it merely a unilateral statement or affirmation made by one of the parties, unless shown that the other party has accepted such term or condition, it cannot be held that there is an agreement C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 to confer exclusive jurisdiction on any Court where the printed form is by one of the parties forwarded by way of a letter to the other which contains the words conferring exclusive jurisdiction on a court at any particular place or ousting the jurisdiction of the Court. It may not be difficult to hold that parties have agreed on such a term. The Court also must be conscious at that juncture to note that many printed forms are in a routine manner signed by the parties. If a printed by one party is dispatched and is signed only by that party and if delivered to the other party without expressing anything more, consensus with regard to the particular jurisdiction is difficult to be gathered. C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 23. The Courts have very zealously guarded the ouster of jurisdiction of the Courts. The clause ousting the jurisdiction has to be absolutely clear, unambiguous and specific so as to bind the parties where unless the agreement on exclusion of other jurisdiction is noted. The other courts would surely have jurisdiction. The construction of the ouster clause with the words like 'exclusive only', 'alone' and 'like' are feasible, however, even without these words the maxim expression of one is the exclusion of another 'expressio unius est exclusio alterius' can be applied. \n24. Every case shall need to be examined on the basis of the facts and the intention of the parties to exclude all others from its C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 operation shall need to be inferred on the basis of the facts adduced. In the matter on hand, the question is with regard to the territorial jurisdiction of Principal Civil Judge, Kalol. The defendant firm is registered and located at Hyderabad. The agreement was accepted to supply the goods on issuance of purchase order at Hyderabad. The purchase orders were issued from Hyderabad and the products were to be delivered in different districts coming in the State of Telangana. In the invoices raised and produced by the plaintiff, it is a case of the defendant that parties have agreed to and has chosen the jurisdiction at Ahmedabad. The money, according to the plaintiff, was payable at Ahmedabad and the payments have been made by the defendants C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 through RTGS in the Bank specified in the invoice, which is situated at Ahmedabad. \nThus, the part of cause of action, according to the plaintiff, had arisen at Ahmedabad where money was expressly payable as per the invoice. Again, as per the say of the plaintiff, the existence of a jurisdiction clause in an agreement would make the intention of the parties to an agreement clear and the contract specified the jurisdiction of the court at particular place. Therefore, such court has jurisdiction to deal with the matter. It is also emphasized that an inference can be drawn that the party intended to exclude all others and therefore, Section 6 of the Commercial Courts Act when read with C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 Section 20 of the CPC, the Commercial Court at Kalol would have no jurisdiction.\n25. What can be noticed is that the trial Court has suo moto raised the query with respect to the territorial jurisdiction as invoice raised by the plaintiff contained jurisdiction clause 'subject to Ahmedabad jurisdiction'. \n26. The court after by-partite hearing had ordered holding that the Kalo Court has jurisdiction. The application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC filed by the defendant for rejection of the plaint also has been rejected by the Court. \n27. In the opinion of this Court, no interference is warranted so far as the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 order of Kalol Court is concerned as it would have the jurisdiction to try the suit for the facts and law discussed as also for the following reasons. \n28. The defendant approached the respondent plaintiff for availing supply of plastic material as a plaintiff is an authorised vendor for the State of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The plaintiffs's registered office as well as the factory both are situated within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court at Kalol. \nPurchase orders were received at the address of plaintiff's factory as well as at its registered office located at Kalol. The payment from the defendant was also received at the factory address and the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 plaintiff maintained the account of the defendant's company as per the provisions of the Companies Act. \n28.1 All transactions between the parties have been entered into within the territorial jurisdiction of village Santej, Taluka Kalol. The Axis Bank's main Branch where plaintiff's account is maintained is situated at Ahmedabad and the payment had been made by the defendant in Bank Account maintained in the said Bank at Ahmedabad through RTGS as per the tax invoice raised by the plaintiff to the defendants. At the bottom a printed clause, \"Subject to Ahmedabad jurisdiction\" has continued and therefore, according to the defendant, this printed material would govern the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 jurisdiction of the Court in exclusion of all other Courts. Such interpretation is not to be endorsed as the plaintiff has explained that before shifting of the company to the jurisdiction of the Kalol Court in the year 2014, the printed material continued to be used without getting the new invoices and material. The old stationary ought to have been discontinued containing such printed clause 'subject to Ahmedabad jurisdiction'. That is no longer correct jurisdiction for the case on hands. \n28.2 Again, this being a unilateral clause is not sufficient to decide the jurisdiction of the Ahmedabad Court. Again, there is a complete absence of any express C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 term or acceptance which reflects the ad idem of the parties as regard the jurisdiction clause mentioned in the invoice. It is also to be seen that the defendant in its written statement has denied that there is any contract between the parties with regard to maintaining the account for supplying the Tarpaulin during the period from 2015-2020 and at the same time, it is not denied that it received the invoices raised by the plaintiff. This query of territorial jurisdiction has been raised in reply to the attachment application filed under Order XXXVII Rule 5 of the CPC. The objection has been raised in respect of territorial jurisdiction when the query was raised by the Kalol Court by looking at the tax invoice. The GST C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 registration is also falling within the purview of Kalol-Gandhinagar GST Division. There does not appear to be any connection to the Ahmedabad jurisdiction except the main Branch of the Axis Bank of the plaintiff being situated at Ahmedabad. It is quite clear that unilateral affirmation or statement by one of the parties cannot confer exclusive jurisdiction in any Court. There does not appear to be any such term accepted by the other side by way of an agreement. \n29. The order of the trial Court, in the opinion of this Court is therefore not assailable and the cause of action surely has arisen in the territorial jurisdiction of the Civil Court, Kalol. \nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 30. In the invoice the plaintiff has chosen to mention the jurisdiction of Ahmedabad and by making payment at Ahmedabad, the defendant though had signified their consent to be subjected to the Ahmedabad jurisdiction, the Ahmedabad Court also may have a jurisdiction to deal with the matter, but the same cannot be in exclusion of other courts, much less the Court at Kalol. The Validity of the clause will depend upon the validity of an agreement in a suit for damages for breach of contract when question arises of cause of action making of the contract is a part of a cause of action and a suit on contract can therefore be filed at the place where it was made. When the Court needs to decide the question of jurisdiction pursuant to an C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 ouster clause as held by the Apex Court in a suit for damages for breach of contract when question arises of cause of action, making of the contract is a part of a cause of action and a suit on contract can therefore be filed at the place where it was made. There has to be an unambiguous and specific clause to bind the parties and in absence of any such clause, the jurisdiction of other courts surely cannot be ousted. The intention has to be cleared of excluding all others from its operation. The cause of action means the facts which if traversed, it would be required for the plaintiff to prove in order to support its rights to a judgment. These being a bundle of facts to which the law is applied and would eventually give a relief to the C/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 party. There has to be some act done by the defendant raising the cause of action. \n31. Here also in a matter of contract, there may arise the cause of action of various kinds and in a suit for damage for breach of contract, the suit can be filed either at the place where contract was made or at the place where it should have been performed and the breach occurred. The suit on a contract, therefore, can be filed at the place where it was made. It is not difficult to determine the place where the contract was made and Kalol being that place where such contract was made, the territorial jurisdiction of Kalol Court surely can be confirmed.\nC/SCA/20148/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 02/08/2022 32. Resultantly, these petitions preferred under Article 227 of the Constitution of India challenging the order dated 24.11.2021 in different suits filed by the original respondent-plaintiff shall require to be dismissed and are dismissed accordingly. \n(SONIA GOKANI, J) (HEMANT M.

kolkata high court and called upon sbpdcl to appoint their arbitrator. sbpdcl did not appoint their arbitrator so bedcpl filed request case no.06 of 2016 before this hon'ble court for appointment of

which was numbered as arbitration case no. 106 of 2016 and the minutes of the preliminary meeting was conveyed and recorded on 26.05.2016. issues were framed in the arbitration case on 04.03.2017. there were prayer to amend the issues and it was allowed on 20.05.2017, while extending arbitral proceedings by three months with the consent of the parties. 20. after commencement of arbitration proceedings, some issues arose and the parties moved before the court of learned district judge, patna by filing misc. (arbitration) case nos. 01 of 2017, 164 of 2017 and 165 of 2017. misc. (arbitration) case no.01 of 2017 had been filed with a prayer to extend the time patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 for completion of the arbitral proceedings in relation to arbitration case no.106 of 2016 so as to enable the arbitral tribunal to pass the award. misc. (arbitration) case no.164 of 2017 had been filed challenging the legality and validity of the interim award dated 05th august, 2017 passed by the learned arbitral tribunal by which i.a. no.10 of 2017 filed on behalf of sbpdcl has been rejected with cost in which the sbpdcl raised the question that the life of the tribunal had already ended and hence extension of its life by order dated 20th may, 2017 was illegal. misc. (arbitration) case no.165 of 2017 had been filed by sbpdcl challenging the legality and validity of the interim award dated 5 th august, 2017 passed by the learned arbitral tribunal by which the application filed by sbpdcl under section 16 of the act giving rise to i.a. no.7 of 2017 had been rejected with cost of rs.5 lacs. 21. sbpdcl filed i.a. no. 07 of 2017 under section 16 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 in which question on jurisdiction of the arbitrator to proceed with the arbitration was raised, contending that bedcpl being an agent of spml had no right to initiate the proceeding in its own name when the principal spml is itself a party to the dfa in view of provision to section 230 of the contract act, 1872. the other objection was in accordance with the definition of the word 'parties' in clause 2.2. of rfp, bedcpl is not a party to arbitration agreement with patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 sbpdcl rather it is an arbitration agreement between sbpdcl/ distribution licensee and spml being the successful bidder/distribution franchisee. similarly, i.a. no. 10 of 2017 was filed by sbpdcl questioning the extension granted by tribunal vide concerned order dated 20.05.2017 contending that arbitral tribunal's mandate had stood terminated on 13/14.05.2017 whereas the life/mandate of tribunal was extended on oral consent by the parties on 20.05.2017, that too, not with retrospective effect, as such, the tribunal had/have no right to continue the arbitral proceeding. both the i.as were heard and reserved for order on 11.07.2017. on 05.08.2017 both the i.a nos. 7 & 10 of 2017 were rejected while imposing cost of rs. five lacs (5,00,000/-) while upholding the order of extension of time by concerned parties. 22. m/s spml infra limited wrote a letter to sbpdcl on 11.08.2017 to withdraw its notice dated 17.07.2017 in the light of order dated 05.08.2017 of the arbitrators. the sbpdcl issued a final notice of termination of distribution franchisee agreement to spml infra limited on 25.11.2017. when things stood thus, on 11.06.2018 sbpdcl issued letter to spml infra limited while invoking section 21 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 for arbitration arising out of the same agreement (which is the subject matter of challenge in cwjc no. 13762 of 2018 filed by m/s spml infra limited). patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 23. the sbpdcl filed arbitration case no. 164 of 2017 against the order rejecting i.a no. 07/2017 and arbitration case no. 165 of 2015 was filed against the rejection of i.a no. 10/2017 under section 34 of the act treating the order of the learned arbitrator as an interim award. as the learned tribunal did not come out with an award within the extended period of 3 months which expired on 19.08.2017, arbitration case no.106 of 2016 came to an end and thereafter, bedcpl filed an application u/s 29-a(4) before the learned district judge being the principal civil court for extension of time on 01.09.2017 vide arbitration case no. 1/2017. the learned district judge heard all the three arbitration applications together and passed judgments dated 25.09.2021 whereunder the district court allowed the arbitration case no. 01/2017 and extended 6 months time permitting the arbitral tribunal to make an award from the date of order and dismissed the two arbitration cases being arbitration case nos. 164 & 165 of 2017 filed by sbpdcl rejecting its plea regarding parties and jurisdiction of the tribunal. learned district judge confirmed the extension granted by the tribunal and held it to be in accordance with section 29-a (3). feeling aggrieved by the order dated 29.05.2021 sbpdcl preferred miscellaneous appeal no. 635 of 2021 before this court. patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 24. in terms of order dated 25.09.2021 of the district judge passed in (miscellaneous) arbitration case no. 01 of 2017, arbitration case no. 106/2016 got revived by the arbitral tribunal. the sbpdcl preferred c.w.j.c no. 20350/2021 questioning the legality of the order dated 25.09.2021 by which the 6 months time to make an award was allowed. bedcpl requested the learned arbitrators to continue the proceeding but failed to fulfill the condition communicated by the presiding arbitrator and subsequently, the presiding arbitrator as also nominee arbitrator of sbpdcl communicated their unwillingness to continue with the proceeding on 04.10.2021. the sbpdcl has filed two appeals bearing ma nos. 635 & 638 of 2021 under section 37 of the act challenging the legality and validity of the order of the learned district judge. bedclp had filed request case no. 05/2022 under section 11(6) read with section 15 of the act for substitution/appointment of arbitrator with an object to continue the arbitral proceeding which had stood terminated. 25. from the agreement and various correspondences among parties, it is evident that sbpdcl, bedcpl and spml infra limited or parties to the above bunch of cases are ad idem for the implementation and execution of the agreement in terms of clause wherein m/s spml infra limited owes responsibility. to that effect an undertaking clause was incorporated. patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 26. core question in these bunch of cases are: (i) whether spml should be a party and whether arbitration agreement existed only between sbpdcl and bedcpl? (ii) whether extension of period of arbitral tribunal is erroneous in law and its mandate stood terminated? (iii) whether arbitral tribunal can be continued after substituting arbitrator on behalf of sbpdcl? (iv) whether appointment of arbitrator on behalf of spml is necessary? (v) whether substitution of arbitrators on behalf of bedcpl is warranted? (vi) whether request of sbpdcl for appointment of arbitrators on behalf of spml and bedcpl is maintainable? 27. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of sbpdcl submitted that bhagalpur electricity distribution company private limited (bedcpl) raised the dispute under the arbitration clause of the distribution franchisee agreement (dfa) instead of spml infra ltd. the bedcpl has no right to raise dispute against sbpdcl since bedcpl was only special purpose vehicle or an agent executing works on behalf of its principal spml infra ltd. in terms of section 230 of the contract act, an agent cannot sue in his own name. it is also submitted that there is no arbitration agreement existing between sbpdcl and bedcpl patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 in view of the definition of parties in rfp. the learned senior counsel further submitted that from the request for proposal (rfp), letters of intent (loi) and draft for agreement (dfa), it is amply clear that spml infra ltd. is the successful bidder and this entity was appointed distribution franchisee for all intent and purposes. but due to mischievous wording in dfa, it appears that bedcpl was appointed as distribution franchisee. the nomenclature or wording cannot change the intent and purpose meant in the aforesaid three documents, namely, rfp, loi and dfa. there has been no doubt over the fact that it is the spml which was required to give notice for appointment of arbitrator in case any dispute arose since under clause (g) of dfa, it has taken all the liabilities. it remained behind the curtain and allowed the bedcpl to raise the dispute and appoint an arbitrator and also issued notice to sbpdcl to participate in the arbitration proceedings. however, sbpdcl filed a suit for rectification in the nomenclature/wording of the dfa vide title suit no. 351 of 2017 in the court of learned subordinate judge-1, patna which is pending consideration even to this day. the learned senior counsel further submitted that the bedcpl is only a special purpose vehicle floated by spml. it is the holding company which created the bedcpl as its subsidiary and it is only an agent for a limited purpose to execute the project strictly in accordance with the patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 provisions as contained in request for proposal and letters of intent. but in order to get rid of its liability, the spml infra ltd. started promoting that the bedcpl is only the party in dispute against sbpdcl. if the bedcpl is treated as distribution franchisee agent, the very process of issuing request for proposal and the object of selecting the successful bidder as distribution franchisee would be frustrated. the sbpdcl was under bonafide belief that by mistake the bedcpl has been claimed as distribution franchisee, but it was by design and incorrect and nonexistent facts were incorporated fraudulently to deceive and cheat the sbpdcl and to protect spml from its liabilities. thus, it has been submitted by the learned senior counsel that there was no privity of contract inter se between the sbpdcl and bedcpl and this fact is clear from the words used in rfp that parties shall mean a reference to a selected bidder and bseb/sbpdcl. as the principal spml is itself the party to all the three above documents, as such, under section 230 of the contract act, the bedcpl is an agent and it has no right to sue. the learned senior counsel again reiterated that the agent has no right to sue even in a case where only an agent is the party to the contract but the principal is not. on the aforesaid aspect, the learned senior counsel relied on the following decisions: (i) radha sundar dutta vs mohd jahadur rahim and ors air 1959 sc 24 (para 11) patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 (ii) radhakrishna sivadutta rai & ors. vs. tayebali dawoodbhai, reported in air 1962 sc 538 (para 11 to 18) (iii) national textile corporation ltd. vs. nareshkumar badrikumar jagad & ors. reported in (2011) 12 scc 695 (para 30 and 31) (iv) union of india and anr. vs. chinoy chablani & co. reported in air 1982 cal 365 (para 10 to 14). 28. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of sbpdcl further submitted that the learned district judge failed to appreciate that the learned arbitrator had wrongly assumed that the sbpdcl had challenged the jurisdiction of the arbitrators rather the sbpdcl has challenged through out the bedcpl not being as a party as defined under section 2 (h) of the act to an arbitration agreement as defined in section 2 (b) read with section 7 of the act, as such, the respondents first party have no authority of law to initiate a proceeding i.e. an arbitration proceeding in accordance with the provisions of the act which empowers only a party to an arbitration agreement to initiate a proceeding. 29. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of sbpdcl further submitted that the hon'ble supreme court in the case of s.n. prasad v. monnet finance ltd., (2011) 1 scc 320 has held that, \"thus there can be reference to arbitration only if there is an arbitration agreement between the parties. the act makes it clear that an arbitrator can be appointed under the act at the instance of a party to an arbitration agreement only in respect patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 of disputes with another party to the arbitration agreement. if there is a dispute between a party to an arbitration agreement, with other parties to the arbitration agreement as also non-parties to the arbitration agreement, reference to arbitration or appointment of arbitrator can be only with respect to the parties to the arbitration agreement and not the non-parties.\" 30. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of sbpdcl further submitted that the mandate of the arbitral tribunal stood terminated on 13.05.2017 since the tribunal did not deliver award within 12 months of its constitution on 14.05.2016. since the parties to the arbitration did not extend the mandate of the tribunal, after expiry of its mandate on 13.05.2017, subsequently extension by three months purportedly on oral consent on 20.05.2017 was wrong since the mandate already stood terminated as on the date oral consent, i.e, 20.05.2017. further, sbpdcl challenged the initiation of the proceeding as also continuation of the proceeding by filing i.a. no. 7 of 2017 and i.a. no. 10 of 2017, respectively on the ground that mandate of the tribunal had already stood terminated. these two applications were rejected by an order dated 05.08.2017 and as the said order of the tribunal was having force of interim award. the sbpdcl filed misc. (arbitration) case nos.164/2017 and 165/2017 on 01.09.2017 before the learned district judge, patna being the principal civil patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 court, but the learned district judge, patna rejected both the petitions on 25.09.2021. meanwhile, bedcpl also moved before the learned district judge, patna for extension of the period of the arbitral tribunal under section 29a (4) of the arbitration and conciliation act and the learned district judge extended the mandate of the tribunal for further six months. such order is illegal and incorrect and even after extension of mandate of the arbitral tribunal by oral consent, the same expired on 19.08.2017. the learned senior counsel relied upon a decision of the supreme court in the case of jayesh h. pandya & anr. vs. subhtex india ltd. & ors. reported in (2020) 17 scc 383 as to termination of the mandate and refusal to extend the proceedings. 31. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of sbpdcl further submitted that the order of the learned district judge dismissing the arbitration case no.164 of 2017 was illegal and incorrect. the sbpdcl has challenged the order dated 05.08.2017 passed by the learned arbitral tribunal rejecting the application of the sbpdcl being i.a. no.10/2017. the said interlocutory application was filed for determination of the mandate and life of the tribunal on the ground that the mandate of the tribunal stood ended and hence extension by order dated 20.05.2017 was without any authority of law. the prayer was made that the learned arbitral tribunal ought to decide whether on patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 28.05.2017 the said tribunal had any jurisdiction to extend the life of the arbitration proceeding even with the consent of the parties. 32. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of sbpdcl further submitted that the term used in section 29a (4) is extension of the period to arbitral tribunal and not revival and once the mandate of the tribunal has come to an end, the learned district judge could not have extended the mandate since the word 'extend' denotes that an application by the party was needed to be filed for extension for making the award during the subsistence of the mandate/life of the tribunal, i.e., within 12 months and/or within the extended period by the parties and not after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal stood terminated on expiry of the period as prescribed under section 29a of the arbitration and conciliation act and/or the grounds mentioned in sections 13 and 14 of the act. 33. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of sbpdcl further submitted that sbpdcl has filed a request case for appointment of an arbitrator under section 11 (6) of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. the sbpdcl terminated the agreement on 25.11.2017 and has raised arbitral dispute by serving a notice in accordance with section 11 (3) read with section 21 of the act. the sbpdcl has appointed mr. justice v.n. sinha, a former judge of this court as its nominee arbitrator patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 and called upon the respondent no.1 spml infra limited to nominate its arbitrator so that two arbitrators might appoint/nominate a third arbitrator to constitute the arbitral tribunal in accordance with section 10 of the act. but, the spml did not appoint the arbitrator and they challenged the notice served on them by filing cwjc no.13672 of 2018. as the spml did not appoint its arbitrator within thirty days as provided under section 11 (4) (a) of the act, as such, sbpdcl has moved this court for appointment of an arbitrator on behalf of spml which could not appoint an arbitrator after expiry of period of 30 days. on this aspect, the learned senior counsel referred following two judgments of the hon'ble supreme court: (i) datar switchgears ltd. vs. tata finance ltd. & anr. reported in (2000) 8 scc 151. (ii) punj lloyed ltd. vs. petronet mhb ltd. reported in (2006) 2 scc 638. in terms of the aforesaid two judgments, two conditions are to be fulfilled and these conditions are: (a) there must exist a valid arbitration agreement and from clause 17.2, 17.2.5 and 17.2.6 of the distribution franchisee agreement (dfa), there exists a valid arbitration agreement between the sbpdcl and spml. (b) there must exist an arbitrable dispute between the parties; the sbpdcl terminated the agreement due to breach of patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 the terms and conditions of the agreement by spml and raised a dispute by serving a notice dated 11.06.2018. for this reliance has been placed on the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of zostel hospitality (p) ltd. v. oravel stays (p) ltd., (2021) 9 scc 765 wherein in para 9 it was held that, \"in view of the aforesaid, we are of the opinion that the respondents can raise the issue of arbitrability of the disputes before the arbitrator. needless to say, our expression of the view that an arbitration clause exists and the arbitrator should be appointed, would not affect the suit filed by the respondents.\" 34. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of sbpdcl further cited the following decisions of the supreme court (i) m/s s.b.p. & co. vs. m/s patel engineering ltd. & anr. (2005) 8 scc 618 and (ii) vidya drolia vs. durga trading corporation (2021) 2 scc 1, buttressing his submissions that this court should appoint arbitrator on behalf of spml infra ltd. so that two arbitrators of the parties could appoint a presiding arbitrator. 35. thus, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of sbpdcl submitted that the judgment/order dated 25.09.2021 passed by the learned district judge, patna in misc. (arbitration) case no. 01 of 2017 is against the relevant provisions of law as the learned district judge failed to consider the contention raised patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 by the sbpdcl regarding extension of the mandate and absence of any arbitration agreement between the sbpdcl and bedcpl for the reason that bedcpl being an agent of spml infra ltd. had no right to sue and nor can be sued in its own name where the principal is known in view of section 230 of the contract act, 1872. 36. further challenge has been made to the order dated 20.09.2021 of the learned district judge whereby the court dismissed the arbitration case nos. 164/2017 as also 165/2017 by which sbpdcl has challenged the order dated 05.08.2017 passed by the learned arbitral tribunal rejecting the application of the sbpdcl being i.a. no. 07 of 2017. the said i.a. has been filed under section 16 of the 1996 act challenging, inter alia, the jurisdiction of learned arbitral tribunal. 37. the learned counsel for the spml infra ltd. has submitted that the spml has come before this court by filing writ petition being cwjc no. 13762 of 2018 with a prayer for quashing the notice under section 21 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 by which dispute has been raised against the spml and for resolving the same by way of arbitration. the learned counsel further submitted that there is no arbitration clause/agreement between the spml and sbpdcl in terms of distribution franchisee agreement (dfa) dated 19.07.2013 and patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 clause 17.2 of dfa. the learned counsel further submitted that already an arbitration proceeding has been taking place between the sbpdcl and bedcpl in terms of distribution franchisee agreement and hence there cannot be second arbitration in relation to the same dispute arising out of the same agreement. the learned counsel further submitted that from the clause (e) of the dfa, it is evident that spml has promoted and incorporated bedcpl as a limited liability company, after it was declared successful bidder and floated bedcpl as a special purpose vehicle (spv) and it was in terms of letters of intent (loi) and bedcpl after entering into tripartite agreement became distribution franchisee in terms of the agreement entered into by the parties for execution of the distribution franchisee agreement (dfa). moreover, sbpdcl itself kept a proposal in its letter of intent that spml could create a special purpose vehicle for execution of the work and accordingly, bedcpl started working as distribution franchisee and it was accepted as such by sbpdcl when it entered into dfa wherein bedcpl has been made second part. spml was only a confirming party. at the same time, as per clause (g) of the dfa, spml undertook that in the event of failure of compliance of the obligation under the dfa by the bedcpl, all the obligations as per the distribution franchisee agreement including the investment required in the franchisee area should automatically patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 become the responsibility of the spml which further undertook to discharge all the obligations financially, commercially or otherwise of bedcpl during the entire contract period. thus, in terms of the agreement, it is not the spml but bedcpl which was to act as distribution franchisee and was to undertake to all obligations under the agreement and it was only on its failure to execute the same, the liability was to shift upon spml. the learned counsel brought to the notice of the court clauses 4.1, 5.5, 5.6.3, 5.6.4, 5.6.5, 14, 19.12 etc. to show that right of purchase and to distribute the electricity was that of distribution franchisee bedcpl and not of spml. further clause 17.2. of the agreement provides for amicable settlement of the dispute failing which the matter would be decided by the panel of three arbitrators in terms of the provisions of arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. the learned counsel further submitted that sbpdcl brought the issue of spml being the party to arbitration before the learned arbitral tribunal by raising the same in arbitration case no. 106 of 2016 wherein it has been held that the said issue was to be decided at the time of the final adjudication, but the matter could not be finally adjudicated as the life of the tribunal came to end when the sbpdcl refused to give its consent for extension of the time for publication of the arbitral award. the learned counsel further submitted that the issues regarding spml being the party before patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 the arbitral tribunal and other issues like jurisdiction of the tribunal and extension of the time of the tribunal have been taken up by the sbpdcl before the learned arbitral tribunal and the learned district judge and after the issue being decided against the sbpdcl, the same has been challenged before this court. once the issue has already been raised under the arbitration proceeding, the issuance of notice for fresh arbitration with the spml in relation to the same dispute becomes wholly illegal and it appears to be taken only in order to avoid final adjudication by the arbitral tribunal. 38. the learned counsel for the spml infra ltd. further submitted that once sbpdcl had submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, it cannot turn around and say that it does not consider bedcpl as the party to the arbitration agreement. moreover, issue of impleading a party in an arbitration proceeding is to be considered by the arbitral tribunal itself and on this point, learned counsel relied on the supreme court decision in the case of ivrcl ltd. vs. alkor petroo ltd., reported in 2016 scc online guj 7809 (para 40 & 41). 39. the learned counsel on behalf of spml further submitted that once the life of the arbitral tribunal has been extended by a competent court, the dispute has to be determined in the same arbitration proceeding and not separately. on the point patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 that the arbitration agreement cannot be invoked twice, the learned counsel relied on the following decisions: (i) sp singla constructions pvt. ltd. vs. state of himachal pradesh, reported in 2019 (1) pljr sc 276 (para 4, 13, 18, 21) (ii) antrix corporation limited vs. devas multimedia pvt. ltd., reported in (2014) 11 scc 560 (para 1, 16, 24, 27, 31, 33 & 34) (iii) nhpc ltd. erstwhile vs. m/s hindustan construction company ltd. & ors.), reported in 2015 scc online p & h 105 (para 1, 8, 9, 10 & 14) 40. the learned counsel for the spml infra ltd. further submitted that the language of section 29a (4) of the act is very much clear, which says \"if the award is not made within the period specified in sub-section (1) or the extended period specified under sub-section (3), the mandate of the arbitrator (s) shall terminate unless the court has, either prior to or after the expiry of the period so specified, extended the period\". 41. from bare reading of this section, it is clear that the court can extend the period of the arbitral tribunal either prior to or after the expiry of the period so specified in sub-section (1) or the extended period under sub-section (3). if the mandate has been validly extended by a court of law, the arbitration proceeding has been in existence and sbpdcl cannot invoke arbitration agreement for the second time. the learned counsel further patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 submitted that a party which is aggrieved by the order of the tribunal, not appeal-able under section 37 of the act, has to wait for passing of final award to raise the challenge under section 34 of the act. dismissal of an application under section 16 of the act cannot be interfered with in exercise of jurisdiction under article 227 of the constitution and proper remedy against it to wait for passing the final award under section 38 of the act. on this aspect, the learned counsel relied on the decision of the supreme court in the case of deep industries limited vs. oil and natural gas corporation limited and another, reported in (2020) 15 scc 706 (para 12, 13, 22, 25). 42. the learned counsel for the spml further relied on section 4 of the act on the point that a party who knows that any provision of part 1 of the act from which the parties may derogate, or any requirement under the arbitration agreement, has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without urging such objection to such non-compliance without undue delay or, if a time limit is provided for urging such objection, within that period of time, shall be deemed to have waived his right to so object. on this aspect, the learned counsel further relied on the decision of the supreme court in the case of bharat sanchar nigam limited and another vs. motorola india private limited, reported in (2009) 2 scc 337 (para 39). patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 43. the learned counsel for the spml further submitted that once an arbitrator was appointed in terms of the agreement, the provisions of sub-section 6 of section 11 cannot be invoked again and the remedy of the aggrieved party is by way of petition under section 13 and, thereafter, challenging the award under section 34 of the act. on this aspect, the learned counsel relied on the decision of the supreme court in the case of s.p. singla constructions private limited vs. state of himachal pradesh and another, reported in (2019) 2 scc 488 (para 1, 4, 14, 18, 19, 20 & 21). 44. thus, the learned counsel for the spml submitted that bedcpl being of a competent party to invoke the arbitration clause, invoked the same and sbpdcl submitted to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, participated in the arbitration proceeding, a valid arbitration proceeding came into existence and spml is not a party to the arbitration proceeding in terms of arbitration clause of the dfa cannot ask to participate in the arbitration proceeding. it was wrong and incorrect on the part of the sbpdcl to send notice to spml for appointment of an arbitrator. the sbpdcl has also taken recourse to challenge the jurisdiction as well as raising different issues before the arbitral tribunal and the same have been rejected by the tribunal. moreover, it was under the competence of the arbitral tribunal to patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 decide all such issues and challenging the issues before this court has been specifically prohibited and the issue has been settled by the hon'ble supreme court in the decision as stated supra. 45. the learned counsel for the bedcpl submitted that the bedcpl has also moved before this court by filing a request case no. 05 of 2022 for substitution of the arbitrator who was nominated by sbpdcl since the learned arbitrator has shown his unwillingness to proceed with the arbitral proceeding. the learned counsel further submitted that bedcpl invoked the arbitration clause of the dfa when dispute arose. the sbpdcl also nominated its arbitrator and two arbitrators on behalf of the parties further nominated a presiding arbitrator. now both the arbitrators appointed on behalf of sbpdcl and the presiding arbitrator have shown their unwillingness to continue with the arbitration proceeding necessity as arising for appointment of arbitrator on behalf of sbpdcl. the learned counsel further submitted that there is not merit in the submission made on behalf of sbpdcl that there is no arbitration agreement between sbpdcl and bedcpl. the language of tripartite agreement is very much clear. from the facts of the case, it is clear that bedcpl was floated as a wholly owned subsidiary by spml and sbpdcl entered into the agreement considering all the facts. initially sbpdcl was having no objection and it participated in patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 the arbitration proceedings once notice was served upon it by bedcpl when it invoked arbitration clause of the dfa. so there was nothing wrong in the initiation of the arbitration proceeding namely, sbpdcl and bedcpl. the issue whether spml is a party or not, was raised before the arbitral tribunal and it opined that it would be decided at the time of passing of final award on the basis of material available on record. so the contention of sbpdcl that bedcpl being an agent could not invoke arbitration clause is wrong and incorrect. moreover, bedcpl is wholly owned subsidiary of spml and in this manner it has its separate existence. the conjoint reading of letters of intent and the distribution franchisee agreement make the status of bedcpl very much clear. 46. the learned counsel for the bedcpl further submitted that once the right of bedcpl is accepted to invoke the arbitration clause with sbpdcl, the issue regarding extension of the mandate of the arbitral tribunal could be easily settled in the light of the specific provision of arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. the learned counsel further submitted that section 29a (3) provides that the parties may, by consent, extend the period specified in sub-section (1) for making award for a further period not exceeding six months. the learned arbitral tribunal extended its life by three months for passing the final award with consent of patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 the parties and when the award could not be delivered during the extended period, bedcpl moved before the learned district judge, patna for extension of the time period and the same was extended by six months under the provisions of section 29a (4) of the act. section 29a (4) provides that \"if the award is not made within the period specified in sub-section (1) or the extended period specified under sub-section (3), the mandate of the arbitrator (s) shall terminate unless the court has, either prior to or after the expiry of the period so specified, extended the period\". there could not be any infirmity in extension so granted by the learned district judge. the learned counsel further submitted that it is the duty of the court to interpret the legislation by liberally interpreting the statutes and from the plain reading of section 29a (4), there could be no doubt that even after expiry of the period it was within the duty of the court to extend the mandate. on liberal interpretation of the term used in the statutes, the learned counsel relied on the decision of the hon'ble supreme court rendered in the case of directorate of enforcement vs. deepak mahajan and anr., reported in (1994) 3 scc 440 (para 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 101, 102). 47. the learned counsel for the bedcpl further submitted that the word 'extension' is even applicable to the cases where the period prescribed as expired and it is not limited to prepatna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 existence of things. extension is permissible even after lapse of prescribed period. on this aspect, the learned counsel relied on the decisions in the case of commissioner of income tax vs. ajanta electricals, punjab, reported in (1995) 4 scc 182 (para 9, 10, 11 & 15). the learned counsel further relied on a decision of hon'ble supreme court in the case of tata capital financial services ltd. vs. siva industries and holding ltd. & anr. (manu/scor/95271/2022) wherein the application was filed for extension of time for completion of arbitration proceeding after the expiry of the original period as the last date was 24.08.2022 and the petition for extension was filed on 26.08.2022. the hon'ble apex court allowed the extension of the proceedings of the arbitrator. 48. thus, the learned counsel for the bedcpl stressed the fact that no illegality was committed by the arbitral tribunal when it extended the mandate under section 29a (3) of the act and also when the learned district judge extended the time period under section 29a (4). 49. the learned counsel for the bedcpl further submitted that since the arbitration agreement is still in existence and the arbitrator appointed on behalf of bedcpl is still continuing, there is no need to appoint arbitrator on behalf of spml. rather the request case of sbpdcl for appointment of patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 arbitrator on behalf of sbpdcl be considered and arbitrator be appointed on behalf of sbpdcl. 50. the learned counsel for the bedcpl further submitted that other issues raised by the sbpdcl should be raised before the arbitral tribunal itself which is a forum competent to decide the same and the sbpdcl has remedy to challenge the same under section 34 of the act after delivery of the final award. 51. in reply, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the sbpdcl submitted that the request case no. 05/2022 filed by bedcpl is a fraudulent proceeding, that too, at a time when spml had lost its right to nominate an arbitrator in spite of service of notice under section 21 of the arbitration and conciliation act 1996 within 30 days and have got filed request case no. 05/2022 through bedcpl to get appointed/nominated a substitute arbitrator on behalf of sbpdcl knowingly that sbpdcl had already filed request case no. 147/2018 four years ago which could not be decided due to objection raised by spml & bedcpl. the learned senior counsel again reiterated that bedcpl being an agent of the successful bidder spml had no right to sue nor was party to the arbitration agreement which empowers only two parties, distribution licensee (sbpdcl) & distribution franchisee/successful bidder (spml), to nominate patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 arbitrators in terms of clause 17.2.5 and 17.2.6 of dfa dated 19.07.2013. 52. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the sbpdcl further submitted that the petition under section 11(6) of the act for substitution of arbitrator is not maintainable because in accordance with section 29-a (5) of the act it is the principal civil court had the power. he further submitted that when the mandate of the erstwhile tribunal had stood terminated on 13.05.2017 and even if after extension for 3 months on 20.05.2017 could not make out an award, now after more than 5 years 8 months it is meaningless to revive the dead proceeding; that too when an alternative remedy to resolve the dispute had already been initiated being request case no. 147/2018 preferred by a party to arbitration agreement. it is a matter of record that spml, the real party and party to arbitration agreement, was/is not a party to the arbitration proceeding. the learned senior counsel has relied on the following decisions : 1. shailesh dhariyawan vs. mohan bal krishan lulla, (2016) 3 scc 619 ii. jayesh h. pandaya & anr. vs. subhtex india ltd. & ors., (2020) 17 scc 383 the hon'ble supreme court in the case of shailesh dhariyawan (supra) held that unless arbitration agreement categorically prohibits or debars resolution of dispute or difference patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 between parties by substitute arbitrator in case of death of named arbitrator or non-availability of said arbitrator, courts have power to appoint substitute arbitrator under section 15 (2). further principle of purposive construction while interpreting the document be resorted to and three basic rules must be followed : language, purpose and discretion. by interpretive process the court is supposed to realize the goal that legal text is designed to realize. similarly in the case of jayesh h. pandaya (supra), the hon'ble supreme court held that the essential element of waiver is that there must be a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a right. the voluntary choice is the essence of waiver. there should exist an opportunity for choice between the relinquishment and an enforcement of the right in question. it cannot be held that there has been a waiver of valuable rights where the circumstances show that what was done was involuntary. that apart, the doctrine of \"waiver\" or \"deemed waiver\" or \"estoppel\" is always based on facts and circumstances of each case, conduct of the parties in each case and as per the agreement entered into between the parties. sub-section (2) of section 14 clearly stipulates that if a controversy remains concerning any of the grounds referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1), the party may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, apply to the court to decide on the termination of the mandate and the appellants rightly applied to the patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 court for termination of the mandate of the arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of this section and the court was within its jurisdiction to decide accordingly. 53. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the sbpdcl further submitted that earlier a dispute was raised by bedcpl against sbpdcl, whereas the request case no. 147/2018 was filed for resolution of disputes which arose after 25.11.2017 when sbpdcl terminated the dfa as such the disputes arose on or after the said date between sbpdcl against spml; the earlier proceeding was not between the same parties and so s.p singhla case (supra) referred by the learned counsel opposing the prayer of sbpdcl to appoint an arbitrator is not applicable. 54. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the sbpdcl further submitted that the order of the learned district judge extending 6 months time proved futile and as on date there is no arbitral proceeding pending between bedcpl and sbpdcl. he further submitted that there is no provision to 'revive' a dead proceeding if, the parties are not in agreement, it is not a case of extension of the mandate of the tribunal rather to revive by substituting arbitrator a dead proceeding which stood terminated 5 years 8 months earlier, in other words forcing the parties to have an arbitration agreement. he further submitted that patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 once this court appoints an arbitrator on behalf of spml, both spml infra and bedcpl may raise all objections under section 16 of the act. it was reiterated that once the two conditions i.e. existence of valid arbitration agreement is proved and the other condition that there exists arbitrable disputes, in accordance with law settled a binding agreement for disputes to be resolved through arbitration is sine-qua-non for referring the partiers to arbitration. the denial by and on behalf of spml being not a party to arbitration agreement is malicious and false just to escape the liabilities as envisaged in clause-g of dfa and as per other terms and conditions thereto this plea is being raised. it is well settled that the nomenclature of the parties to the agreement that too a commercial contract would not be a deciding factor rather it is the object which determines the legality. the learned senior counsel had relied on the judgment of hon'ble apex court in the case of:(i) sasan power limited vs. north american coal corporation, (2016) 10 scc 813 (ii) mahanagar telephone nigam ltd. vs canara bank, (2020) 12 scc 767 55. the learned senior counsel for sbpdcl further submitted that in effect this writ application being cwjc no. 20350/2021 had become infructuous. so, far m.a 635/2021 and 638/2021 are concerned it is submitted that the learned district judge did not consider the issues raised by the appellants patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 (sbpdcl) and only on the ground that the court had extended the period of 6 months time for passing the award and dismissed the two petitions being arbitration case no.164 & 165/2017 by which the sbpdcl had challenged the order passed by the then arbitral tribunal rejecting the two interlocutory applications being i.a no. 7 & 10/2017 by which the appellant had raised questions as to the very right of bedcpl to initiate the arbitration proceeding and to continue the same, in other words very right to sue and by second i.a had challenged the very authority of the arbitral tribunal to extend the mandate of the arbitral tribunal by oral consent vide order dated 20.05.2017 although in accordance with section 29-a (4) the mandate of the arbitrator had stood terminated on 13.05.2017 itself but the learned district judge did not consider these pure questions of law and dismissed the same and as such the appeals filed by the appellant-sbpdcl are fit to be allowed and the order passed by the learned district judge dated 20.05.2021 affirming the order of the tribunal 05.08.2017 are fit to be quashed and cancelled with cost. 56. the foremost issue which arises for consideration is as to whether the claim of the sbpdcl is correct that only the spml is a party to the arbitration agreement and bedcpl is only an agent and hence in stead of bedcpl, it is spml which should be patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 the party in the arbitration proceedings before the arbitral tribunal. 57. it is made clear that we are most disinclined to decide this issue since time and again it has been held by the hon'ble apex court that such type of issue be left to be decided by the arbitrators and if there is an arbitration clause, it is not the business of the courts to enter into such disputed issues. reliance could be placed on the apex court decision in the case of ivrcl limited vs. alkor petroo limited & anr., reported in 2016 scc online guj 7809 (para 40 & 41). 58. but the same is true for ideal situation. the history of the cases before us is quite chequered. the request for proposal was initiated on 22.10.2012 and dfa was signed on 19.07.2013. the dispute was raised by the bedcpl and arbitration proceedings continued before the arbitral tribunal till 13.05.2017. thereafter, the cases were filed before the learned district judge, patna, which was decided on 25.09.2021. for sbpdcl, cause of action arose after initiation of arbitration proceedings on behalf of bedcpl and such action has not been challenged. thereafter, the matter travelled to this court and we are in the year 2023. so to give a quietus to the dispute on this issue, we think this court would look into the issue and decide the same since leaving it to be decided by the arbitral tribunal would only result in wastage of patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 valuable time and resources. then the hon'ble supreme court in the case of chloro controls india (p) ltd. vs. severn trent water purification inc, reported in (2013) 1 scc 641 has held that if need be so arise, or non-signatories to the arbitration agreement could also be made party to the arbitral proceeding. 59. the submissions made on behalf of the parties have mostly for or against the contentions of sbpdcl to make spml only the party in the arbitral proceedings. 60. let us revisit the facts to come to any conclusion on this issue. it is undisputed that pursuant to request for proposal of appointment of distribution franchisee by bseb later on replaced by sbpdcl, spml was the successful bidder. latter of intent was issued by the sbpdcl and the same was accepted by spml. in terms of proposal in the letter of intent, spml floated its 100 % subsidiary (special purpose vehicle) in the form of bedcpl and thereafter, dfa was signed by three parties, namely, sbpdcl, bedcpl and spml as first part, second part and third part, respectively. relevant portion of the agreement is extracted below for reference : \"south bihar power distribution company limited, a company registered under the companies act, 1956 having its registered office at vidyut bhawan, bailey road, patna-800021, bihar india hereinafter referred to as \"sbpdcl\" (which expression patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 unless repugnant to the context or meaning thereof shall include its successors and assigns) of the first part. and m/s bhagalpur electricity distribution company private limited (bedcpl), kolkata a company incorporated by the successful bidder (i.e. m/s spml infra limited) under the provisions of the companies act, 1956 and having its registered office at 22, abanindra nath thakur sarani, block a, 3rd floor, kolkata700016, west bengal, (hereinafter referred to as the \"distribution franchisee\" which expression shall unless repugnant to the context of meaning thereof, include its successors and permitted assigns and substitutes), represented herein through mr. amanuilah md.azmat ali, the authorized signatory, as authorized vide board resolution dated 15th july, 2013, of the second part. and m/s spml, infra limited, kolkata having its registered office at 22, camac street, block-a, 3rd floor, kolkata-700016, west bengal, in its capacity as the confirming party to this agreement (hereinafter referred to as the \"successful bidder\" which expression shall, unless the context otherwise requires, include its successors) patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 represented herein through mr. abhinandan sethi, the authorized signatory, as authorized vide board resolution dated 27th may, 2013, of the third part. each of the parties of the first, second and third parts are hereinafter, as the context may admit or require, individually referred to as a \"party\" and collectively as the \"parties\". whereas : a. south bihar power distribution company limited is a distribution licensee under the provisions of the electricity act, 2003 (the \"act\") having license to supply electricity coming under four (4) electric supply areas i.e. pesu, central electric supply area (cesa), magadh electric supply area (mesa) & bhagalpur electric supply area (besa) in the state of bihar. b. under the provisions of the act, sbpdcl is entitled to distribute electricity in a specified area within its area of supply through another person referred to as franchisee. c. for the purpose of sale and supply of electricity in the bhagalpur town and adjoining areas consisting of electric supply division bhagalpur (u), electric supply sub-division kahalgaon and electric supply sub-division aligunj of sbpdcl as more particularly described hereinafter, patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 sbpdcl selected m/s spml infra limited, kolkata through the competitive bidding process. d. sbpdcl issued a letter of intent no 02/com/df-27/013 dated 21.03.2013 to the said m/s spml infra limited, kolkata and the same had been accepted by m/s spml infra limited, kolkata vide letter no. spml/booo/booo/h7/181/q-309/176 dated 05.04.2013. e. the successful bidder has since promoted and incorporated the distribution franchisee as a limited liability company under the companies act 1956, and has requested the sbpdcl to accept the distribution franchisee as the entity which shall undertake and perform the obligations and exercise the rights of the successful bidder under the loi including the obligation to enter into this distribution franchisee agreement pursuant to the loi for executing the project. f. the parties are fully aware that this agreement is for sale and purchase of electricity for distribution in franchisee area through the distribution franchisee as contemplated under the electricity act 2003. g. m/s spml infra limited, kolkata undertakes that in the event of failure of compliance of obligation under the distribution franchisee agreement by m/s patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 bhagalpur electricity distribution company private limited, kolkata, all the obligation as per the distribution franchisee agreement including the investment required in the franchisee area shall automatically become the responsibility of the m/s spml infra limited, kolkata who undertakes to discharge all the obligations-financial, commercial or otherwise of m/s bhagalpur electricity distribution company limited, kolkata during the entire contract period. 61. it is pertinent to mention here that spml has been stated to be a confirming party to this agreement, though it has been mentioned as third part of the agreement. at the same time, it has been specifically mentioned that each of the party of the first, second and third parts would individually be referred as a \"party\" and collectively as the \"parties\" as the context might require. subsequent paragraph 'e' is important which reads as under : \"e. the successful bidder has since promoted and incorporated the distribution franchisee as a limited liability company under the companies act 1956 and has requested the sbpdcl to accept he distribution franchisee as the entity which shall undertake and perform the obligations and exercise the rights of the successful patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 bidder under the loi including the obligation to enter into the distribution franchisee agreement pursuant to the loi for executing the project\". 62. the aforesaid paragraph further makes it clear that bedcpl has been promoted and incorporated by spml as a distribution franchisee as a limited liability company for undertaking and performing the obligations and exercise the rights of the successful bidder, viz, spml under the letter of intent. on the other hand, clause g (quoted supra) of this agreement enjoins spml to step into the shoes of bedcpl in the event of its failure of compliance of obligation under the distribution franchisee agreement. 63. bare plain reading of the starting portion of the distribution franchisee agreement shows that spml was the successful bidder and it floated 100 % subsidiary in the form of bedcpl and tripartite agreement was entered into by the aforementioned three parties. 64. from the aforesaid contents of the agreement, there is no doubt about spml being a party to the distribution franchisee agreement. but whether spml could be said to be a party to the arbitration agreement? 65. in this regard, clause 17.2 has already been quoted hereinabove. the striking fact which comes out from the reading of patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 this clause is that though it is tripartite agreement, it only talks about two parties. thus, there appears ambiguity as to whether the language has been used to exclude spml from the ambit of dispute resolution mechanism. clause 17.2 talks about 'either party', 'both the parties' and 'parties', but in our opinion, there is no ambiguity at all. when sbpdcl (distribution licensee) has been taken to be the first party, naturally bedcpl and spml would be considered to be the other party to the dispute if any dispute so arise. so this language might have been deliberately used so that any of the parties could ask for arbitration in case of non-settlement of dispute by the permanent dispute resolution body. the status of bedcpl is very much clear. it is a 100% own subsidiary of spml which was the successful bidder and in case of failure of bedcpl to meet its obligations, spml has undertaken to discharge on its liabilities. 66. the contention of spml or bedcpl that spml should not be considered as a part of arbitration agreement, in our opinion, is erroneous for the reason that if spml has undertaken to cover up the liabilities of bedcpl in ultimate case of its failure to meet its obligations and situation having arisen so as to working of the agreement unsustainable. spml would be a natural party in order to avoid future litigation. let us take a hypothetical situation. if arbitration would have proceeded normally between sbpdcl and bedcpl and the same be ending into accepting the claims of patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 sbdpcl and the liability could not be met by the bedcpl, naturally the spml would be required to discharge its liability as per the agreement. what is wrong if spml is asked to join the proceeding from the very beginning so that it could safeguard its interest and the litigation is not prolonged on the ground of technicalities, if any, taken by spml after any award is passed against bedcpl. 67. if an agent can sue on its own name and maintain the action in a case brought by it, it does not foreclose the option of the other party to implead its principal and bring an action against it or to sue the principal. 68. moreover, when there is express contract between the parties which leaves no doubt in the minds of this court that spml has been a party to the litigation. thus, we decide and hold that spml is a party to the contract entered into the parties by acceptance of letters of intent pursuant to request for proposal and spml being declared successful bidder and even in terms of clause 17 of the distribution franchisee agreement though it has not been specifically mentioned as a party to the same but for all intent and purpose, the effect is the same and spml ought to be a party to the arbitration agreement. 69. it has been contended on behalf of the spml that the issue of spml being a party to the arbitral proceedings has already patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 been raised under the arbitration proceeding and raising the same issue before this court is wrong and incorrect. once this issue has been taken before the arbitral tribunal, the sbpdcl should have waited for final adjudication by the arbitral tribunal, but we are afraid this contention should have any force after passage of so much time when there is no arbitral tribunal in existence and the parties are before this court for appointment of arbitrators/ substitution of principal and one member arbitrators. 70. another contention which was taken by the spml was that after invoking of the arbitration clause 10, bedcpl and sbpdcl proceeded with the arbitration, it has waived its right to object under the provisions of section 4 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. but we do not think there is any merit in the submission made on behalf spml on this point. section 4 reads as follows : \"4. waiver of right to object.--a party who knows that-(a) any provision of this part from which the parties may derogate, or (b) any requirement under the arbitration agreement, has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating his objection to such non-compliance without undue delay or, if a time limit is provided for stating that patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 objection, within that period of time, shall be deemed to have waived his right to so object\". 71. from perusal of the provision of section 4 of the act, it is amply clear that waiver would be considered only if the party proceeds with the arbitration without stating his objection. the same is not the case here. sbpdcl has raised objection and asked for spml being made a party and the learned arbitral tribunal decided to adjudicate upon this matter at the time of final award. so, this contention of spml is also without any force. in the light of apex court decision in the case of chloro controls india (p) ltd. (cited supra), the principle is that even non-signatories to the arbitration agreement could also be made party to the arbitral proceedings if the circumstances demonstrate it was the mutual intention of the respective parties. therefore, the contentions of bedcpl and spml are to be rejected. 72. the second issue which has been the subject matter of intense litigation is whether the extension of period of arbitral tribunal by the court of learned district judge was in accordance with law or whether its continuation was erroneous and its mandate stood terminated? 73. section 29a provides for time limit for arbitral award and extension of mandate of arbitrator. the whole of this section reads as under : patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 \"29a. time limit for arbitral award.--(1) the award in matters other than international arbitration shall be made by the arbitral tribunal within a period of twelve months from the date of completion of pleadings under sub-section (4) of section 23. provides that the award in the matter of international commercial arbitration may be made as expeditiously as possible and endeavour may be made to dispose of the matter within a period of twelve months from the date of completion of pleadings under sub-section (4) of section 23. (2) if the award is made within a period of six months from the date the arbitral tribunal enters upon the reference, the arbitral tribunal shall be entitled to receive such amount of additional fees as the parties may agree. (3) the parties may, by consent, extend the period specified in sub-section (1) for making award for a further period not exceeding six months. (4) if the award is not made within the period specified in sub-section (1) or the extended period specified under sub-section (3), the mandate of the arbitrator(s) shall terminate unless the court has, either prior to or after the expiry of the period so specified, extended the period: provided that while extending the period under this subsection, if the court finds that the proceedings have been delayed for the reasons attributable to the arbitral tribunal, then, it may order reduction of fees of arbitrator(s) by not exceeding five per cent for each month of such delay. provided further that where an application under subsection (5) is pending, the mandate of arbitrator shall continue till the disposal of the said application. patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 provided also that the arbitrator shall be given an opportunity of being heard before the fees is reduced. (5) the extension of period referred to in sub-section (4) may be on the application of any of the parties and may be granted only for sufficient cause and on such terms and conditions as may be imposed by the court. (6) while extending the period referred to in subsection (4), it shall be open to the court to substitute one or all of the arbitrators and if one or all of the arbitrators are substituted, the arbitral proceedings shall continue from the stage already reached and on the basis of the evidence and material already on record, and the arbitrator(s) appointed under this section shall be deemed to have received the said evidence and material. (7) in the event of arbitrator(s) being appointed under this section, the arbitral tribunal thus reconstituted shall be deemed to be in continuation of the previously appointed arbitral tribunal. (8) it shall be open to the court to impose actual or exemplary costs upon any of the parties under this section. (9) an application filed under sub-section (5) shall be disposed of by the court as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made to dispose of the matter within a period of sixty days from the date of service of notice on the opposite party.\" 74. in the instant case, as the award was not made within the period of twelve months from the date the arbitral tribunal entered into the reference, under section 29a (3), the parties by consent extended the period for six months and the same was recorded by the learned arbitral tribunal on 20.05.2017. though patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 it has been contended on behalf of the sbpdcl that it has not given any written consent for the same and was not agreeable for extension of the arbitral tribunal, the same was recorded erroneously. it has been contended on behalf of sbpdcl that as the mandate of the arbitral tribunal expired on 13.05.2017 after its constitution on 14.05.2016, even the subsequent extension for three months purportedly on oral consent on 20.05.2017 was wrong since the mandate already stood terminated and it was not extended with retrospective effect. 75. another point raised by the sbpdcl was that even if the first extension by oral consent of the parties is taken to be valid, it came to an end on 19.08.2017. evidently, bedcpl approached the court of learned district judge, patna after termination of mandate and once the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has come to an end, it could not be extended and what the learned district judge did/was to revive the mandate and life of the arbitral tribunal. 76. on the other hand, contention of the spml and bedcpl has all along been that the court can extend the period of arbitral tribunal either prior to or after the expiry of the period so specified in sub-section (1) or the extended period under sub-section (3). this is clear mandate of sub-section (4) of section 29 a. patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 77. prior to consideration on the aforesaid issue, this court would like to consider the legality of the extension said to be accorded by the parties on oral consent by which the period of arbitral tribunal was extended for three months vide order dated 20.05.2017 passed by the arbitral tribunal. perusal of the order dated 20.05.2017 with regard to extension of the proceeding shows it is worded in the following manner : \"at the request of the parties, for the present, the arbitral proceeding is extended by three (3) months\". 78. there is no mentioning of the fact that it has been extended from the date the period of 12 months as contemplated under section 29 a (1) has ended. there is no dispute that the said period ended on 13.05.2017 and parties were competent to extend the period for upto six months. but effectively there was no proceeding in existence when the matter of extension of arbiral proceeding was taken up. the parties could be stated to have agreed to the proposition for extension of the arbitral proceeding had it been recorded that the same was being extended with retrospective effect. but the same is not the case here. what would otherwise have been a normal extension has run into rough weather due to casual wordings of extension. however, this court would not like to leave the matter as such. patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 79. first issue which comes into mind is as to whether once the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has expired, the court can be justified in extending the same. we are of the view that submissions made on behalf of spml or bedcpl are misconceived. what sub-section (4) talks about is the power of the court to extend the mandate of the arbitrator (s) i.e. the said order could be passed during the existence of the mandate or after the expiry of the period so specified which means 12 months plus the period of extended time as per section 29a (3) of the act and not at the point of time when the mandate has already stood terminated even after grant of extension. as per mitra's legal and commercial dictionary, 6th edition, the terms 'extend' means to enlarge, expand, lengthen, prolong, to carry out further than its original limit. similarly, the word 'extension' has been stated to be an increase in length of time. this implies the word extension ordinarily meaning the existence of something to be extended and its term for the purpose of enlarging or giving further duration to any existing right, but does not import right. similarly, the definition of the word 'extension' in chambers 21st century dictionary is 'the process of extending something, or the state or being extended; an added part, that makes the original larger or longer; an extra period beyond an original time limit\". if the mandate has already patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 terminated and it has expired for the arbitral tribunal if the legislature so intended. it would have used the term revival or renewal and not the word extension which presupposed existence of something. on this aspect, we find some force in the submission made on behalf of the sbpdcl. 80. however, we are concerned with larger issue in this case which goes into the root of the matter. it is whether court of learned district judge was competent to entertain the petitioner for extension of arbitral tribunal. coming back again to section 29a (4) of the act which talks about power of the court to extend the mandate of the arbitrators. at the same time, section 29a (6) provides that while extending the period referred in subsection (4) it shall be open to the court to substitute one or all the arbitrators. 81. before considering the matter further, it would be appropriate to consider different provisions of act. section 2 of the act defines the term 'court'. section 2 (1) (e) reads thus : in this part, unless the context otherwise requires,\"(e) \"court\" means-(i) in the case of an arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the high court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 subject-matter of a suit, but does not include any civil court of a grade inferior to such principal civil court, or any court of small causes; (ii) in the case of international commercial arbitration, the high court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a suit, and in other cases, a high court having jurisdiction to hear appeals from decrees of courts subordinate to that high court\". 82. this definition of the word 'court' is preceded by the term, 'in this part, unless the context otherwise requires' which bears in ordinary sense in case of an arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, the principal civil court of original jurisdiction is a district, and includes the high court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction. but we are more concerned with the process of appointment of arbitrators and their substitutionas it would be seen that the definition of court under section 2 (e) has no relevance with regard to appointment and substitution of arbitrator. 83. section 11 of the act provides for appointment of arbitrators, which reads as under : \"11 appointment of arbitrators. -(1) a person of any nationality may be an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 (2) subject to sub-section (6), the parties are free to agree on a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators. (3) failing any agreement referred to in subsection (2), in an arbitration with three arbitrators, each party shall appoint one arbitrator, and the two appointed arbitrators shall appoint the third arbitrator who shall act as the presiding arbitrator. (4) if the appointment procedure in sub-section (3) applies and-(a) a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days from the receipt of a request to do so from the other party; or (b) the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty days from the date of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, on an application of the party, by the arbitral institution designated by the supreme court, in case of international commercial arbitration, or by the high court, in case of arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, as the case may be. (5) failing any agreement referred to in subsection (2), in an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties fail to agree on the arbitrator within thirty days from receipt of a request by one party from the other party to so agree the appointment shall be made on an application of the party in accordance with the provisions contained in sub-section (4). (6) where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties,-patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 (a) a party fails to act as required under that procedure; or (b) the parties, or the two appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an agreement expected of them under that procedure; or (c) a person, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to him or it under that procedure, the appointment shall be made, on an application of the party, by the arbitral institution designated by the supreme court, in case of international commercial arbitration, or by the high court, in case of arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, as the case may be to take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment. (7) *** (8) the arbitral institution referred to in subsection (4), (5) and (6), before appointing an arbitrator, shall seek a disclosure in writing from the prospective arbitrator in terms of sub-section (1) of section 12, and have due regard to-(a) any qualifications required for the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties; and (b) the contents of the disclosure and other considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator. patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 (9) in the case of appointment of sole or third arbitrator in an international commercial arbitration, the arbitral institution designated by the supreme court may appoint an arbitrator of a nationality other than the nationalities of the parties where the parties belong to different nationalities. (10) *** (11) where more than one request has been made under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) to different arbitral institutions, the arbitral institution to which the request has been made first made under the relevant sub-section shall be competent to appoint\". 84. prior to amendment in 2019, section 11 (4) of the act read as under :(4) if the appointment procedure in sub-section (3) applies and-(a) a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days from the receipt of a request to do so from the other party; or (b) the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty days from the date of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the supreme court or, as the case may be, the high court or any person or institution designated by such court. patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 85. thus, sub-section (4) of section 11 provides that if a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days from the date of receipt of a request to do so from the other party or the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty days from the date of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the supreme court or as the case may be, the high court or any person or institution designated by such court. in the case at hand, the arbitral tribunal was constituted on appointment of arbitrators being made by the parties and thereafter the appointed arbitrators nominated the presiding arbitrator. but the question arises whether the learned district judge was correct in his approach in extending the time of learned arbitral tribunal? no doubt section 29a (4) provides that extension of mandate of appointment of arbitrator (s) by the court either prior or after the expiry of the period so specified. 86. now, a piquant situation arises. if the power to appoint arbitrator has been vested with high court and supreme court under section 11 (4) of the act, legislature would never intended its substitution under section 29 a (6) by the court of principal civil judge as it appears from the plain reading of section 2(e)(i). but the meaning of court for the purpose of section 29a would patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 be different from what it is under section 34 and section 37 of the act. 87. in the present case, though the arbitrator was appointed by the parties themselves, but in case of any dispute they would otherwise have been appointed by the high court or the supreme court as the case may be and taking cue from this provision under section 11 (4), 11 (5) and 11 (6) of the act, we can say that if the principal civil court cannot substitute the arbitrators, by corollary, it cannot extend the period of arbitrator(s) under section 29a (4). otherwise it would give rise to conflict between the power of the high court as well as the supreme court to appoint arbitrators under section 11 of the act and those of the principal civil courts to substitute them under section 29 (a) (6). moreover initially when sbpdcl failed to appoint arbitrator, bedcpl approached this court by filing request case no.06 of 2016 and during pendency of the aforementioned case, sbpdcl appointed its arbitrator. 88. on similar issue, a matter came up before the high court of gujarat in misc. civil application (0j) no.1 of 2018 in r/petn. under arbitration act no.56 of 2016 (bhanubhai ramanbhai patel vs. nilesh ramanbhai patel). paragraph 15 of the aforesaid decision is quite explicit. \"15. this provision thus make a few things clear. patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 firstly, the power to extend the mandate of an arbitrator under sub-section (4) of section 29a beyond the period of twelve months or such further period it may have c/iaap/56/2016 ia order been extended in terms of sub-section (3) of section 29a rests with the court. neither the arbitrator nor parties even by joint consent can extend such period. the court on the other hand has vast powers for extension of the period even after such period is over. while doing so the court could also choose to substitute one or all of the arbitrators and this is where the definition of term 'court' contained in section 2(1)(e) does not fit. it is inconceivable that the legislature would vest the power in the principal civil judge to substitute an arbitrator who may have been appointed by the high court or supreme court. even otherwise, it would be wholly impermissible since the powers for appointment of an arbitrator when the situation so arises, vest in the high court or the supreme court as the case may be in terms of sub-section (4), (5) and (6) of section 11 of the act. if therefore there is a case for extension of the term of an arbitrator who has been appointed by the high court or supreme court and if the contention of shri mehta that such an application would lie only before the principal civil court is upheld, powers under sub-section (6) of section 29a would be nonpatna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 operatable. in such a situation sub-section (6) of section 29a c/iaap/56/2016 ia order would be rendered otiose. the powers under sub-section (6) of section 29a are of considerable significance. the powers for extending the mandate of an arbitrator are coupled with the power to substitute an arbitrator. these powers of substitution of an arbitrator are thus concomitant to the principal powers for granting an extension. if for valid reasons the court finds that it is a fit case for extending the mandate of the arbitrator but that by itself may not be sufficient to bring about an early end to the arbitral proceedings, the court may also consider substituting the existing arbitrator. it would be wholly incumbent to hold that under sub-section (6) of section 29a the legislature has vested powers in the civil court to make appointment of arbitrators by substituting an arbitrator or the whole panel of arbitrators appointed by the high court under section 11 of the act. if we therefore accept this contention of shri mehta, it would lead to irreconcilable conflict between the power of the superior courts to appoint arbitrators under section 11 of the act and those of the civil court to substitute such arbitrators under section 29a(6). this conflict can be avoided only by understanding the term \"court\" for the c/iaap/56/2016 ia patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 order purpose of section 29a as the court which appointed the arbitrator in case of court constituted arbitral tribunal\". 89. on similar lines is the decision of the high court of bombay is a cabra instalaciones y. servicios vs. maharashtra state electricity distribution company limited, commercial arbitration petition (l) no.814 of 2019, (2019 scc online bom 1437). paragraph 7 reads thus: \"7. on a plain reading of section 29a alongwith its sub-sections, it can be seen that for seeking extension of the mandate of an arbitral tribunal, these are substantive powers which are conferred on the court and more particularly in view of the clear provisions of sub-section (6) which provides that while extending the period referred to in sub-section (4), it would be open to the court to substitute one or all the arbitrators, which is in fact a power to make appointment of a new/substitute arbitrator or any member of the arbitral tribunal. thus certainly when the arbitration in question is an international commercial arbitration as defined under section 2(1)(f) of the act, the high court exercising power under section 29a, cannot make an appointment of a substitute arbitral tribunal or any member of the arbitral tribunal as prescribed under sub-section (6) of section 29-a, as it would be the exclusive patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 power and jurisdiction of the supreme court considering the provisions of section 11(5) read with section 11(9) as also sections 14 and 15 of the act. it also cannot be overlooked that in a given case there is likelihood of an opposition to an extension application and the opposing party may pray for appointment of a substitute arbitral tribunal, requiring the court to exercise powers under sub-section (6) of section 29-a. in such a situation while appointing a substitute arbitral tribunal, when the arbitration is an international commercial arbitration, section 11(9) would certainly come into play, which confers exclusive jurisdiction on the supreme court to appoint an arbitral tribunal\". 90. the decision of allahabad high court in the case of indian farmers fertilizers cooperative ltd. v. manish engineering enterprises, reported in air online 2022 all 15 is also on the same issue. relevant paragraphs 34 to 36 read thus : \"34. thus, the power to substitute the arbitrator as mandated in sub-section (6) of section 29a vest only with the court. this provision cannot be read in isolation but with section 11, which provides for appointment of arbitrator. 35. once the appointment of arbitrator or arbitral tribunal has been made by the high patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 court or the supreme court exercising power under sub-sections (4), (5) and (6) of section 11 then the power to substitute the arbitrator or the arbitral tribunal only vest with the said appointing authority i.e. high court or supreme court, as the case may be. 36. the argument raised from the side opposite that the word \"court' occurring in section 2(1)(e) means the principal civil court and not the high court cannot be accepted, as once the appointment was made by the high court exercising power under section 11, the power to substitute an arbitrator cannot vest under sub-section (6) of section 29a with the principal civil court\". 91. thus, the cumulative reading of section 2 (e), section 11 (4) (5) (6) and section 29 a (4) and (6) of the act makes it crystal clear that the court which could grant extension of time could only be the court which has the power to appoint the arbitrators and not the principal civil court which is the court for other purpose under the act. otherwise, the conflict between the power of the superior courts to appoint arbitrators under section 11 of the act and powers of the principal civil court to substitute such arbitrators under section 29 a (6) of the act could not be reconciled. so, we find and hold that the learned patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 district judge erred while granting the extension of time to the learned arbitral tribunal. 92. a question may arise for consideration in the present case as the arbitrators were not appointed by the high court and were appointed by the parties themselves during pendency of request case no.06 of 2016 filed on behalf of bedcpl for appointment of arbitrator on behalf of sbpdcl, there ought not to be any issue for their extension or for that matter substitution under section 29 (4) (6) of the act. but in that case, the proceedings on this assumption that the principal civil court got jurisdiction as the arbitrators were appointed by the parties themselves would again give rise to conflicting situation. let us take example of a situation where one of the arbitrators has been appointed by the one of the parties and the second arbitrator by the high court and for substitution of either of them there could not be jurisdiction conferred upon both the principal civil court as well as on the high court. so, to avoid such difference and conflicting cases in future it is more necessary to clear this aspect that the principal civil court (the court of learned district judge in the present case) has no jurisdiction to entertain the applications for extension of mandate of arbitral tribunal. 93. so we come to a conclusion on this point that the extension of term of the arbitral tribunal by the learned district patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 judge was without authority of law on jurisdiction and the same came to an end after its first extension on consent of the parties. if it is presumed that the same was with retrospective effect since the extension has been recorded after the expiry of the 12 months of the period. 94. moreover, the view taken hereinabove is also fortified by the conduct of the parties. bedcpl filed its petition for substitution of arbitrators before this court under section 29 a (6) of the act, whereas sbpdcl filed its petition for appointment of fresh arbitrators while making spml party to such arbitration proceeding. so the parties have no doubt in their minds that if substitution is to be done, the jurisdiction lies with this court and not the court of learned district judge, otherwise, they would have moved before the learned district judge for substitution. obviously the inference is that only the court which has got power to substitute the arbitrators should be moved for extension of time for arbitral proceedings. 95. once we have held that there exists no arbitration proceedings as on date, there could be no arbitral tribunal in existence as on date since its term came to expiry in terms of section 29 a (1) and even after subsequent extension under section 29 a (3). so, this court is required to consider the issue of appointment of arbitrators afresh. patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 96. now let us take up the question of continuation and substitution of arbitrators as prayed by the parties. the stand of spml is very clear. it has contended from the very beginning that it is not a party to the arbitration agreement which did not find favour with this court as discussed in earlier paragraphs. once we have come to a conclusion that spml is a necessary party to the arbitration agreement though this issue was left open by the learned arbitral tribunal as reflected from its order dated 05.08.2017. the natural consequence would be that it be asked to join the arbitration proceedings and appoint an arbitrator on its behalf. it is again reiterated even at the cost of repetition that spml and bedcpl could not be treated as different from each other on conjoint reading of different documents, viz, rfp, loi, dfa and specially the arbitration clause of dfa. so, we hold that arbitrator needs to be appointed on behalf of spml and bedcpl. 97. sbpdcl has submitted before this court that it has nominated hon'ble mr. justice v.n.sinha (since retired) to be its nominee arbitrator. the contention of bedcpl is that arbitration proceedings are still subsisting and its nominee arbitrator, hon'ble mr. justice pravir kumar samanta (since retired) is continuing. once we have held that arbitration proceeding has come to an end and arbitrators are to be patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 appointed afresh. in circumstances other than the present one, this court might have asked the parties to nominate their arbitrators. but considering the fact that the dispute in the matter has been lingering on for almost 7 to 8 years, this court would suggest the panel of arbitrators on behalf of the parties to choose, who in turn will nominate the presiding arbitrator. it is made clear that one arbitrator is to be chosen by sbpdcl and another by spml and bedcpl jointly. this exercise would be completed by the parties within two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. 98. the arbitral proceedings are being ordered to be started afresh and it is not an extension within the meaning of section 29a (6) of the act. the arbitral tribunal shall follow the timeline as prescribed in section 29 a. ordering for fresh arbitration in the matter has become more necessary as the spml has not been a party to the earlier arbitration proceeding and it has been ordered to be treated as a party in the present case. so it is incumbent upon this court to see that spml is not prejudiced in any manner. moreover, considering the history of dispute, it would be proper and in the interest of justice that the parties start the arbitral proceeding on a clean slate. this court suggests the panel of following arbitrators to be chosen from by the parties. patna high court cwjc no.20350 of 2021 dt. 26-04-2023 1. hon'ble mr. justice jayanandan singh, former judge, patna high court, patna 2. hon'ble mr. justice vijayeshwar narayan sinha, former judge, patna high court, patna 3. hon'ble mr. justice mihir kumar jha, former judge, patna high court, patna 4. hon'ble mr. justice ramesh kumar datta, former judge, patna high court, patna 5. hon'ble mr. justice samarendra pratap singh, former judge, patna high court, patna 6. hon'ble mr. justice jitendra mohan sharma, former judge, patna high court, patna 7. hon'ble justice smt. nilu agrawal, former judge, patna high court, patna 8. hon'ble mr. justice jyoti saran, former judge, patna high court, patna 9. hon'ble mr. justice dinesh kumar singh, former judge, patna high court, patna 10. hon'ble mr. justice prabhat kumar jha, former judge, patna high court, patna 11. hon'ble mr. justice ashwani kumar singh, former judge, patna high court, patna. 99. in view of discussions
