This is an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter 'the Act') against the order dated 5.7.2021 passed by the Presiding Officer, Commercial Court, Gautam Budh Nagar in Arbitration Case No.110 of 2018 (Gaursons Promoters Pvt. Ltd. vs. Akash Engineers and Contractors) whereby the application preferred by the appellant-objector under Section 34 of the Act for setting aside the award dated 15.6.2018 of the Sole Arbitrator was rejected. \n2. The case projected by the claimant-respondent before the sole Arbitrator is that it claims to be a sole proprietorship firm by the name and style of Akash Engineers and Contractors having its office at L-303, Rail Vihar, Alpha-Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh. According to the claimant-respondent the appellant-objector, Gaursons Promoters Pvt. Ltd. which is a company incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 engaged in the constructions of commercial and residential project in an around the National Capital Region ( In short N.C.R.) approached the claimant-respondent sometime in the year 2011-12 with relation to the advertised projects namely G.E.C. Capital-10 at Gaur City-2, Sector 16-C, Greater Noida for the construction of residential township. \n3. It is also the case of the claimant-respondent that the claimant-respondent executed various works entrusted to it by the appellant-objector and in the year 2012-13 certain issues arose in respect of the project of the appellant-objector due to agitation by the villagers, erstwhile land owners which entailed a situation whereby the work was stalled.\n4. The claimant-respondent further asserts in the claim petition that earlier it was granted work for block A, K, Extended Basement, F & G and G.C.-5 at Gaur City, Sector-4, Noida by one of the sister concern of the appellant-objector being Gaursons Hi-tech Infrastructures (P) Ltd. As the work of the claimant-respondent is stated to be upto the mark and satisfaction so the appellant-objector approached the claimant and requested it to execute balance work of Block C and D. In this regard two work orders were issued namely:-(a) work order no. Gppl/Gc 10/Civ-C/260/13 (work order no.1) dated 1.11.2013 for Inr.2,38,26,296.00 (b) Work Order No.GPPL/GC 10/Civ-D/261/13 (Work Order no.2) dated 1.11.2013 of Inr.2,49,18,861.00.\n5. As per the pleadings set forth in the claim petition filed before the sole Arbitrator the work assigned to the claimant was as under:-\nWork Order no.1 S.No. Description Amount (Inr) A Item as per Contract Total Work Done as per Actual Qty 4,36,41,944 Extra Civil Work (Material Rate Difference) 32,57,564 Incentive Timely Rewardes 7,40,245 Extra Incentive Timely Rewardes 7,40,245 Structure Steel Railing 26,53,786 Total 5,10,33,783 B Extra Item Entertained/Approved Extra for Pergola 55,380 P.C.C.

Since, according to the claimant-respondent the appellant-objector did not honour its commitment as per the work order and the agreement executed between them, the disputes and differences occurred which occasioned the claimant-respondent to take recourse to the proceedings under Section 11(4) of the Act. \n7. Pursuant to the orders passed by this Court under Section 11(4) of the Act the sole Arbitrator was appointed. The claimant-respondent filed claim petition stating in para 57 as under :-\n\"That, as on date, despite repeated requests, Respondent has only made payments for an amount of Rs.5,70,00,000/- (Rupees Five Crore Seventy Lakh Only). However, an amount of Rs.4,85,75,958/-(Rupees Four Crore Eighty Five Lakh Seventy Five Thousand Nine Hundred and Fifty Eight Only) is due and payable to the Claimant till date (excluding interest). The Claimant has completed the work to the satisfaction of the Respondent, however, despite the same, the Respondent has withheld the amounts illegally and without any basis thereof. Therefore the Claimant is entitled to an amount of Rs.4,23,15,030/- (Rupees Four Crore Twenty Three Lakh Fifteen Thousand and Thirty).\" \nseeking following reliefs:- \n\"a). Award an amount of Rs.4,23,15,030/- (Rupees Four Crore Twenty Three Lakh Fifteen Thousand and Thirty) on account of Outstanding due and payable to the Claimant.\nb). Award an amount of Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees Forty lakh Only) on account of loss caused to the Claimant.\nc). Award the costs of arbitration in favour of the Claimant.\" \n8. The claim set up by the claimant-respondent before the Arbitrator was contested by the appellant-objector while filing statement of fact and counter claim. Relevant extracts are as under:-\n\"28.That the averments mentioned in para no. 35 to 42 arc misconceived and totally falsc as respondent has alrcady paid Rs. 5,70,00,000) (Fivecrore seventy lakh rupees) which is the admitted position of the claimant and the same has been paid as per the procedure laid down under the work order and the joint measurement was conducted of the work executed at the site vide dated 19.08.2015 which was duly admitted by the claimant and accordingly it was admitted by the claimant that total quantity of the work done in C & D block is amounting of cumulative bill of Rs. 4,23,15.030/- whereas, claimant in through present claim has wrongly shown a total outstanding of Rs. 9,93,15.030 which in no manner matching the work executed by the claimant at site and beyond the scope of the work order. More so, it can be easily ascertain that the claimant has already been extra and the same needed to be refunded back to the respondent along with the interest.\"\n37.

However, the present Claim petition is devoid details of merit and no such claim as prayed by the Claimant is maintainable. In reply it is submitted that the Claimant has claimed Rs 5,70,00,000 but the detail of which has not been given, however, as per the stand of the Respondent, the payment has been done strictly in accordance with the schedule mentioned in the work order. The Claimant is also demanding the interest of Rs. 50,00,000/- which itself is not maintainable as the payment was already done as per schedule and the present claim is not maintainable. That the Respondent has suffered a huge loss due to delay in the project, and as such, they are not liable to pay for the cost and expenses which have been stated in the Para under reply. A true copy of summary along with the details of statement regarding the payment made to M/s. Akash Engineering and suppliers.\" \n9. In the counter claim of the appellant-objector INR 4,69,62,127.00 was claimed under various heads from the claimant-respondent. \n10. The sole arbitrator after hearing the respective parties pronounced the award dated 15.6.2018 holding that the total amount payable for Block C & D by the appellant-objector to the claimant-respondent comes to be INR.3,67,29,767.00 + INR.3,86,66,734.00 = INR.7,53,96,501.00 and amount of INR.5,02,00,000.00 has been received by the claimant-respondent from the appellant-objector, thus the balance amount comes to INR.2,51,46,501.00 and while rounding the same the claimant-respondent was made entitled to the payment of INR.25000000.00 along with the interest @ 16% per annum w.e.f. the 1st April, 2015 till the making of the award and the interest payable thereafter till the date of payment would be at the rate prescribed specified in Section 31(7) (b) of the Act and so far as the cost payable by the appellant-objector to the claimant-respondent, the same was quantified to INR. 12,00,000/-. \n11. Aggrieved against the award dated 15th December, 2018 of the learned sole Arbitrator, the appellant-objector preferred an application under Section 34 of the Act before the Commercial Court, Gautam Budh Nagar which was registered as Case No.110 of 2018, (Gaursons Promoters Pvt. Ltd. vs. Akash Engineers) which on contest came to be rejected on 5.7.2021. \n12. Questioning the order dated 5.7.2021 passed by the Presiding Officer, Commercial Court, Gautam Budh Nagar in Arbitration Case No.110 of 2018, (Gaursons Promoters Pvt. Ltd. vs. Akash Engineers and Contractors) and the award dated 15.6.2018 of the sole Arbitrator in the matter of Gaursons Promoters Pvt. Ltd. vs. Akash Engineers and Contractors, the present appeal has been preferred. \n13. On the presentation of the appeal this Court passed the following order on 5.10.2021. \n\"Heard Shri Nikhil Agrawal, learned counsel for the appellant and Shri Syed Safdar Ali Kazmi, learned counsel for the respondent. Submission of learned counsel for the appellant is that the specific application filed by the appellant seeking discovery of the books of the account of the claimant-respondent remained undisposed by the learned arbitrator. Relying mostly on the unsubstantiated claim, the award has been made and an excessive amount has been awarded. He would further submit, once the tax deducted at source (TDS) was acknowledged by the claimant-respondent, it had to be accepted that the full payment had been made by the appellant for the actual work done by the third party engaged by the claimant-respondent. However, in absence of the books of account produced by the respondent-claimant, that verification could not have been possible. On the other hand, Shri Kazmi submits that this award is based on the admitted amounts as per the books of the appellant/contractee. Matter requires consideration. Let lower court record be summoned. List again on 01.12.2021. \nTill the next date of listing, the operation effect of the award may remains stayed subject to the appellant depositing the entire awarded amount within a period of three weeks' before the court below. Upon such deposit being made, Rs. 50 lakhs may be released in favour of the respondent-claimant without security and the balance amount be retained in separate interest bearing term deposit with a Nationalized Bank. It shall abide by the further orders of this Court.\" \n14. On Civil Misc. Clarification Application No.6 of 2021 the following order was passed on 7.12.2021. \nRef:- Civil Misc. (Clarification) Application No.6 of 2021 Heard learned counsel for the parties. \nIn the order dated 05.10.2021, we had provided for stay of the execution of the impugned order, subject to certain conditions. Clearly, the conditions stipulated were with respect to payment of the principal amount of compensation excluding interest. \nAccordingly, the application is disposed of. \nOrder on Appeal:-\nList in due course. \n15. This Court on 15.3.2024 proceeded to pass the following order:-\n1. Heard Sri Shashi Nandan, learned Senior Advocate assisted by Sri Mohit Yadav & Sri Mayank Yadav, learned counsel for the appellant and Sri Vinayak Mittal, learned counsel for the respondent. \n2. Learned counsel for the parties pray for time to prepare short notes on the dispute pertaining to the amount of TDS for which the claim of the appellant is that the amount was deducted and deposited and, therefore, the respondent is not entitled to seek that amount all over again and has been wrongly awarded by the Arbitrator whereas the claim of the respondent is otherwise. \n3. Learned counsel for the respondent made submissions that as the dispute pertains to the sum of Rs. 68 Lakhs only of TDS and on account of the interim order, granted by this court, a sum of Rs. 2 Crores, along with interest, is lying in deposit and the respondent is being deprived of the said amount, after retaining a sum of Rs. 68 Lakhs, which is the amount in dispute, rest of the amount may be ordered to be disbursed to the respondent.\n4. Learned counsel for the appellant resisted the said submission. \n5. However, in view of the fact that in the submissions made, it has been specifically indicated that the dispute pertains to the amount of Rs. 68 Lakhs of TDS, we deem it appropriate and, therefore, order that the interim order granted by this court on 05.10.2021 as clarified on 07.12.2021, shall stand modified to the extent that except for a sum of Rs. 68 Lakhs and the interest accrued thereon, in terms of the directions given by this Court, rest of the amount, i.e. Rs. 1,32,00,000/-, along with interest accrued on the said amount, would be paid to the respondent, on respondent filing undertaking before the Commercial Court, Gautambudh Nagar that in case the appeal filed by the appellant is allowed, subject to any further directions by this Court, the amount shall be refunded back along with interest i.e. 6% per annum by the respondent.\n6. List the appeal on 09.04.2024.\n16. On 22.4.2024 the following order was passed:- \n\"While entertaining the aforesaid appeal, defects were cured while giving a regular number summoning for the lower court records, however the appeal is yet to be admitted. Heard Sri Shashi Nandan, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Sri Mayank Yadav and Sri Mohit Yadav for the appellant-objector and Sri Vinayak Mithal, learned counsel for the respondents at length. Admit. \nSince respondent is represented, thus there is no need to issue notice. A joint statement has been made by the counsels for the rival parties that they do not propose to file paper book and the appeal be heard on merits, dispensing with the requirement of filing paper book. In view of the said submission, we dispense with the requirement of filing of paper book. Judgement is reserved.\" \n17. Sri Shashi Nandan, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Sri Mayank Yadav and Sri Mohit Yadav for the appellant-objector have sought to argue that the award passed by the sole Arbitrator dated 15.6.2018 as well as the order dated 5.7.2021 rejecting the application under Section 34 of the Act in Arbitration Case No.110 of 2018 suffers from patent illegality, thus, it is liable to be set aside. \n18. Elaborating the said submissions it is being urged that the sole arbitrator travelled beyond the pleading and created a new case inasmuch as the claimant-respondent in claim petition had only claimed INR 4,23,15,030/- as due and outstanding amount after deduction of INR.5,70,00000/- out of total works executed by it, INR 98313169/- but the amount awarded was INR.25146501/- which was based upon no evidence at all. It is further submitted that there was a clear cut admission of the claimant-respondent in the claim petition that INR 5,70,00000/- was received by it but the sole arbitrator on presumption without there being an iota of evidence has come to conclusion that only INR. 5,020,0000/- was paid to claimant-respondent.\n19. It is also the submission of Sri Shashi Nandan, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant-objector that the sole arbitrator has completely overlooked and misread the documents available on record as it was specifically pleaded in statement of facts and counter claim that INR.46,96,2127/- was recoverable to it with respect of following payment made by it under various heads :- (a) other petty contactors, (b) claim of payment made to petty contractors of claimant, (c) claim of delay in construction of block C & D, (d) claim of payment made to suppliers of claimant due to its default, (e) claim of piece work not executed by the claimant, (f) claim of recovery of cement bags, (g) claim direct of payment of Sub-Contractor claimant for executing plaster work (h) claim of recovery of reinforcement steel used in 115mm thick brick work. \n20. While inviting attention of the court towards para 33 of the objections filed under Section 34 of the Act, it is submitted that there was a specific pleading that till 22.3.2017 total payment made to claimant-respondent was INR.7,60,30,739.22 for block C & D. Further attention was invited towards paragraph 33 of the order of Commercial Court dated 5.7.2021 while contending that appellant-objector had made payment of INR.71605696/- and TDS deposited was INR.735159/- the same was though noticed but brushed aside and not considered. Further reference was made to the Brief Notes and Relevant Documents as well as Judgment Compilation so as to show that in Assessment Years 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 the total amount paid was INR.7,16,05,696.00 and the TDS deducted and deposited was INR.7,16,059.00. Thus, the submissions of the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant-objector is that once the appellant-objector has paid the entire outstanding amount and the TDS has also been deducted and it is reflected in the website of the Income Tax Department and also as per the statement of account of the appellant-objector, then, the learned sole Arbitrator committed patent illegality in passed an award which is bereft of any evidence and beyond the subject matter, thus it is liable to be set aside. \n21. It has also been submitted that once the entire payment due & outstanding has been paid to claimant-respondent, there remained no dispute to be adjudicated by the Arbitrator and in failing to consider the said legal aspect the learned Arbitrator has transgressed its jurisdiction and erred in passing the award in favour of the claimant-respondent. \n22. Though according to the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant-objector the said grounds was neither raised before the Arbitral Tribunal nor Commercial Court but, the same being purely legal and going to the root of matter tantamount to patent illegality, the same can be raised and addressed by this Court in present proceedings.\n23. It is thus urged that in view of the amendments made in Section 34 of the Act while inserting Section (2-A) which came into effect from 23.10.2015 now an arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than International Commercial Arbitrations can be set aside by the Court if the Court finds then the award is vitiated by \"patent illegality\" appearing on the face of the award based upon no evidence or perverse finding. \n24. Reliance has also been placed upon the judgement in the case of Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) AIR 2019 SC 5041, PSA Sical Terminals Pvt. Ltd. vs. The Board of Trustees of V.O. Chidambranar Port Trust, Tuticorin & Ors., AIR 2021 S.C. 4661, Associate Builders vs. Delhi Development Authority AIR 2015 SC 620, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. vs. Discovery Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. AIR 2022 SC 2080, Alpine Housing Development Corporation vs. Ashok S. Dhariwal and others AIR 2023 SC 558, Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd. vs. Navigant Technologies Pvt. Ltd. AIR 2021 SC 2493 and State of Chhattisgarh & others vs. Sal Udyog Pvt. Ltd. AIR 2021 SC 5503 so as to contend that a finding of an arbitrator based on no evidence at all or award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside and more so the ambit of interference with respect to the domestic award under Section (2-A) of the Section 34 of the Act is wide enough once patent illegality is writ large. \n25. Lastly, it has also been argued on behalf of the appellant-objector that an application was preferred by the appellant-objector under Order XI Rule 12 of the C.P.C. for discovery of the Books of Accounts/Ledger qua the project works in question which is in the possession of the claimant-respondent before the arbitrator, in which on 6.11.2017, the Arbitral Tribunal passed the following order.-\n\" in view of the payment chart referred above the respondent application for discovery filed today will be considered only if any of the items in the payment chart are disputed by the claimant, because burden of proving the plea of claimant regarding delay on account of short payment is upon the claimant who can adduce evidence regarding the amount of work done (including extra work if any) upto a certain date and the payment received from the respondent till that date. Hard copies of all aforesaid documents may be filed by respective parties on the next date.\" \n26. Submission is that despite the fact the aforesaid application was legally maintainable and the onus was upon the claimant-respondent to substantiate its claim from its books and account while producing it before the Arbitral Tribunal but the learned Arbitral Tribunal kept the application pending and fastened the liability upon the appellant-objector . It is thus submitted that the said procedural irregularity tantamounts to miscarriage of justice and in contravention of the fundamental policy of the Indian Law. In case the said application would have been allowed then the complete picture would have surfaced. \n27. Countering the said submissions, Sri Vinayak Mithal, learned counsel for the claimant-respondent submitted that the award passed by the learned sole Arbitrator on 15.6.2018 and the order dated 5.7.2021 of the Commercial Court rejecting the Section 34 application, needs no interference as the scope under Section 34 of the Act is limited and it cannot in any manner whatsoever be akin to the Appellate jurisdiction against the orders of the Trial Courts. He submits that in view of the language employed in Section 34 of the Act the appellant-objector has to draw its case within the parameters earmarked under Section 34 of the Act and the appellant-objector cannot insist the court to rehear and the re-appropriate facts. \n28. Submission is that there are contradictions and inconsistency in the stand of appellant-objector as different figures have been shown in different stages of proceeding which have no co-relation with each other that to not reliable as the same are not based upon statutory requirements. \n29. Lastly, it is argued that mere non disposal of application by Sole Arbitrator for discovery of accounts and ledger would not be fatal as the amounts paid to the claimant-respondent was as per the admission of appellant-objector. No prejudice has been caused to appellant-objector. The same can be at best said to be a trivial irregularity but not a patent illegality exposing the award to be set aside under Sub-Section (2-A) of the Section 34 of the Act. \n30. In view of the argument advanced by the rival parties the following issues falls for determination before this Court:\n(a) Whether the arbitral tribunal committed patent illegality by traveling beyond the pleadings and granting relief in excess to what was claimed?\n( b) Whether the claimant/respondent discharged its burden to prove its claim and the onus stood shifted upon the appellant/objector? \n(c) What would be the import and the impact of the admissions made by the appellant/objector in cross examination? \n(d) Legal effect of non-disposal of application under Order XI Rule 12 of the CPC by Arbitral Tribunal for discovery of book & account/ledger by claimant-respondent. \n(e) Whether it is open for the appellant/objector to raise legal issues going into the root of the matter in Appellate proceedings under Section 37 of the Act for the first time? \n31. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record carefully. \n32. Before delving into the tenability of the arguments of the rival parties it would be apposite to have a quick survey of the scope, ambit and the parameters under which the Appeal under Section 37 of the Act, is to be decided. \n33. To begin with it would be apposite to quote the provisions contained under Section 34 & 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act in extenso.-\n\" 34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.--(1) Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub- section (2) and sub-section (3). \n(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if-- (a) the party making the application 1[establishes on the basis of the record of the arbitral tribunal that]--\n(i) a party was under some incapacity, or (ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or (iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration:\nProvided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or (v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this Part from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this Part; or (b) the Court finds that-- (i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force, or (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India. \nExplanation 1.--For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India, only if,--\n(i) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81; or (ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law; or (iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice.\nExplanation 2.--For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute.\n(2A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the Court, if the Court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the award:\nProvided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by re-appreciation of evidence. (3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal:\nProvided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.\n(4) On receipt of an application under sub-section (1), the Court may, where it is appropriate and it is so requested by a party, adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of arbitral tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. \n(5) An application under this section shall be filed by a party only after issuing a prior notice to the other party and such application shall be accompanied by an affidavit by the applicant endorsing compliance with the said requirement.\n(6) An application under this section shall be disposed of expeditiously, and in any event, within a period of one year from the date on which the notice referred to in sub-section (5) is served upon the other party.\" \n\"37. Appealable orders.--(1) [Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, an appeal] shall lie from the following orders (and from no others) to the Court authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the order, namely:--\n(a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8;\n(b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9;\n(c) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34.\n(2) Appeal shall also lie to a Court from an order of the arbitral tribunal-- (a) accepting the plea referred to in sub-section (2) or sub- section (3) of section 16; or (b) granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under section 17.\n(3) No second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or takeaway any right to appeal to the Supreme Court.\" \n34. The aims and the objects for enacting the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 was to provide a mechanism to the public to resolve their disputes in a process less rigorous, technical and formal that of litigation coupled with the fact that the same should be more accessible, efficient and even cost effective for the parties involved whether at individual level or at the level of a business or corporation. The basic concept stems from alternative dispute mechanism which is advantageous for the general public at large who are involved in dispute giving wheels for effective disposal and release of burden on the Courts. \n35. Section 34 of the Act was deliberately engrafted in a couched manner bearing in mind the fact that there should be limited intervention of Courts in arbitral proceedings especially after the proceedings have been concluded and the award has been pronounced by the arbitral tribunal. \n36. Notably, the yardsticks and the parameters under which intervention by the courts of law in the proceedings against the award stands bracketed in Section 34 of the Act which obviously starts with caveat that the arbitral award may only be set aside by the Court if the party making the application establishes on the basis of the record of the arbitral tribunal;\n(i) was under some incapacity;\n(ii) the arbitral agreement is not valid under the law for the time being in force;\n(iii) a party making the application was not given proper notice of appointment of arbitrator or he was unable to present his case;\n(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated or not falling within the terms of the submission of the arbitrator;\n(v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties unless such agreement was in conflict with the provisions;\n(vi) the subject matter of dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under law for the time being in force;\n(vii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India.\n37. Importantly, by virtue of Act No. 3 of the 2016 (with effect from 23.10.2015) Section 34 of the Act along with other sections underwent amendment and Section 2(A) came to be inserted in Section 34 whereby it was provided that an arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations may also be set aside by the Court if the Court finds that the award is vitiated by \"patent illegality\" appearing on the face of the award with a caveat that award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of erroneous application of law or by appreciation of evidence. \n38. Nonetheless, while assailing the order passed under Section 34 of the Act either setting aside the award or upholding the award an appeal is provided under Section 37 of the Act, however, the contours of the proceedings under Section 37 also is limited to the scope and the ambit of challenge under Section 34 of the Act. \n39. The aforesaid proposition of law stands culled out in the umpteen number of decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court, also in the case of Associate Builders (supra), Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. (supra), Sal Udyog Private Limited (supra), PSA Sical Terminals Pvt. Ltd. (supra), Batliboi Environmental Engineers Vs. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited & Another AIR (2024) SCC 375. In the recent judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 8067 of 2019 (S.V. Samudram Vs. State of Karnataka & Another) decided on 4.1.2024. \nIssues No. (a), (b) & (c)\n40. Since the issues No. (a), (b) & (c) are interwoven , thus, they have being decided compositely. \n41. In order to address the said issues it would be appropriate to briefly set out the case of the parties as apparent from the record. The claimant-respondent in its claim petition had pleaded that it had executed works under two work orders No. 1 and 2 for an amount of INR 4,85,75,958/- and INR 4,97,37,211/- totalling to INR 9,83,13,169/- out of the said amount, claimant-respondent claimed that it had received an amount of INR 5,70,00,000/- and as per the prayer clause INR 4,23,15,030/- remained outstanding and payable to it. In the statement of facts and counter claim of the appellant-objector it was acknowledged that INR 5,70,00,000/- had been paid to the claimant-respondent and the counter claim was of INR 4,69,621.27/-. \n42. Essentially, the dispute is two fold firstly, whether the claimant-respondent received the total outstanding amounts against the work executed by it and secondly, inconsistency in the two figures i.e. the claim of the appellant-objector that it paid INR 5,70,00,000/- as whereas according to the claimant-respondent it received INR 5,02,00,000/-.\n43. The Arbitral Tribunal while passing the award on 15.6.2018 came to the conclusion that the total amount payable with respect to Blocks C and D comes to (INR 3,67,29,767+3,86,66,734) = INR 7,53,96,501/-, against which the claimant received INR 5,02,00,000/-, thus, INR 2,51,46,501/- after rounding up to INR 2,50,00,000/- was liable to be paid to the claimant-respondent. \n44. Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant-objector has assailed the said findings while contending that it was never the case of either claimant-respondent or the appellant-objector that INR 5,02,00,000/- was paid and received by the claimant rather to the contrary it was a clear admission of the claimant-respondent in the claim petition that it had received INR 5,70,00,000/-, thus, the award suffers from perversity. \n45. In order to test the said argument, we have meticulously scanned the entire records available before the Court. We find that in the claim petition the claimant-respondent had acknowledged the receipt of INR 5,70,00,000/- and the said fact also stood admitted by the appellant-objector in its statement of facts. The chapter in normal circumstances would have been closed there, however, the Court finds from the Lower Court records that on 20.2.2018 Sri Rohit Sharma, the C.O.O. of the Gaursons Group who was at that point of time Senior Vice President in its cross-examination being paper No. 71 while replying to the following question replied as under:-\n\"Question:- How much payment was made to the claimant for the two Towers (C & D) R.S.- Refer affidavit, page 16 to 20. Amount paid is as follows:\nS.No. Particulars Amount (In Rs.)\n1.\nAmount paid to the M/s. Akash Engineers and Contractors 5,02,69,435 2. Amount paid on behalf of the suppliers 1,48,68,487 3. Amount paid on behalf of the sub-contractors 9,71,109 Total 6,61,09,031/-\n46. Perusal of the cross examination of Sri Rohit Sharma reveals that the appellant-objector as per their record had paid INR 5,02,69,435/- to the claimant-respondent, INR 1,48,68,487/- on behalf of the suppliers and INR 9,71,109/- on behalf of the Sub-Contractors totaling to INR 6,61,09,031/-.\n47. Now a question arises whether an admission made in the cross examination is required to be given weight or not. \n48. Here, in the present case there are certain redeeming features which also needs to be noticed. The claimant had set out its case in the claim petition particularly paras 56 and 57 which has been quoted in the earlier part of the judgment, which came to be replied by the appellant-objector in para 37 of the statements of fact and counter claim where neither any definite figure has been disclosed nor the amount outstanding or paid has been indicated. \n49. The learned Arbitrator had summarized the final bills of Block-C and D, the payment to be made as per the claim of the claimant-respondent and the appellant-respondent, thereafter, derived the figure which is recapitulated hereinunder:-\nBlock C Awarded Amount Brief Comments Sr. No. Description As per Respondent As per claimant Word Done 4,24,43,362 4,36,41,944 4,24,43,362 Less Incentive @ Rs. 5/- Per Sq ft.\n-7,14,824 Nil Incentive was payable Rate difference for Bricks 14,22,872 14,22,872 Rate difference for coarse sand for Brick work 2,37,412 2,37,412 Rate difference for coarse sand for Plaster 9,16,907 9,16,907 Incentive 13,21,100 7,40,245+7,40,245=14,80,490 13,21,100 P.C.C.

Notably, the appellant-objector is a private limited company, thus, while making payments to the contractors or sub-contractors or in case of suppliers adherence to the provisions contained under Section 194C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 as amended from time to time is mandatory.\n51. The same is:-\n\"194C. Payments to contractors.--(1) Any person responsible for paying any sum to any resident (hereafter in this section referred to as the contractor) for carrying out any work (including supply of labour for carrying out any work) in pursuance of a contract between the contractor and a specified person shall, at the time of credit of such sum to the account of the contractor or at the time of payment thereof in cash or by issue of a cheque or draft or by any other mode, whichever is earlier, deduct an amount equal to-- (i) one per cent where the payment is being made or credit is being given to an individual or a Hindu undivided family; \n(ii) two per cent where the payment is being made or credit is being given to a person other than an individual or a Hindu undivided family, of such sum as income-tax on income comprised therein. \n(2) Where any sum referred to in sub-section (1) is credited to any account, whether called \"Suspense account\" or by any other name, in the books of account of the person liable to pay such income, such crediting shall be deemed to be credit of such income to the account of the payee and the provisions of this section shall apply accordingly.\" \n52. As per Section 194C of the Income Tax Act, a duty is cast upon a person responsible for paying a sum to any resident (hereinafter referred to any contractor) for carrying out any work in pursuance of the contract between the contractor and a specific person at the time of the credit of the sum to an account of the contractor or at the time of the payment thereof in cash or by issue of cheque or draft or by other mode whichever is earlier and a deduction of amount equal to 1% where payment is being made or credit is being given to an individual or Hindu undivided family and 2% in other cases.\n53. Admittedly, in the present case there is no dispute that works contract came to be executed between the appellant-objector and the claimant-respondent. Therefore, the provisions of Section 194C of the Income Tax Act is applicable. Though in the cross examination of Sri Rohit Sharma dated 28.2.2018 INR 6,61,09,031/- is stated to have been paid but the actual amount as per the statement, bifurcation whereof was INR 5,02,69,435/- to the claimant-respondent and amount paid on behalf of suppliers and sub-contractors was INR 1,48,68,487/- and INR 9,71,109/-.\n54. Apparently, in the counter claim of the appellant-objector in sub-paragraph (i) to (viii) it was averred that payments were made to the suppliers and the sub-contractors. As per the mandate of 194C of the Income Tax Act a statutory duty was cast upon the appellant-objector to make necessary deductions (TDS) but, there is nothing on record to show that any deductions were made. \n55. For the very first time, in application under Section 34 of the Act filed before the Commercial Court in para 33 it was averred that the appellant-objector till 22.3.2017 had made a total payment of INR 7,60,30,739.22/- for both the blocks and the appellant-objector had filed payment summary with its counter claim. Furthermore, during the course of the arguments before the Commercial Court it was also argued by the appellant-objector that total amount paid was INR 7,16,05,696/- and tax deducted was 7,35,159/-. Even before this Court in the brief note and the relevant document compilation dated 5.3.2023 page 1 it has been mentioned that a total amount INR 7,16,05,689/- was credited in the account of the claimant-respondent for the Assessment Year 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 and an amount INR 7,16,054/- was deducted as TDS. In the said background, the Court finds that the appellant/objector is taking inconsistent stand at different stages in the proceedings which does not inspire the confidence of the Court. More so, when figures are not matching and there is no plausible explanation offered by it. \n56. Much emphasis has been laid down upon the fact that in the award of the Arbitrator there are material contradictions, since on one hand it has been observed that claimant did not produce any document to show that TDS or a part of it was not credited in its account, therefore, TDS cannot be claimed, however, on the other hand, liability has been fastened upon the appellant-objector while holding that its version was not accurate and reliable and there was an admission in the statement of facts and counter claim that INR 5,02,00,000/- was paid to the claimant-respondent instead of INR 5,70,00,000/- though there was no admission at all. In our opinion, the said contradiction would not be of any aid or help to the appellant-objector particularly when from the records it is borne out that there is a clear cut admission of the appellant-objector by way of deposition in cross examination of Sri Rohit Sharma that INR 5,02,00,000/- had been paid to the claimant-respondent. Minor contradictions cannot be permitted to demolish a case particularly when the same is writ large from an admission of a party. The arbitral tribunal in the award has drawn a comparative chart of the claim set up by the appellant-objector and the claimant-respondent and thereafter proceeded to derive the actual figures which was due and outstanding and liable to be paid to the claimant-respondent. In absence of any challenge made to the said figures by the appellant-objector either in the proceedings under Section 34 of the Act or before this Court in the present proceedings, this Court is not required to go into the said issues. \n57. Another facet which needs to be noticed is that the claimant-respondent was paid incentives for the works executed by it. Though a feeble attempt was made based upon the allegations in the counter claim that since the entire work was not executed by the claimant-respondent so the said works were got executed by the appellant-objector from the sub-contractors /suppliers but the Court finds that the findings of payments of incentive remains unassailable particularly when no challenge has been raised either before the Commercial Court or before us. \n58. Though, ordinarily in view of the provisions contained under Section 101 read with Section 102 and Section 114 of the Evidence Act, 1872 the burden of proof stood upon the claimant-respondent to prove its case but in the present case in hand once there is a clear admission of the appellant-objector admitting a particular fact which remains intact without any challenge being raised to the same then it cannot be said that the Arbitral Tribunal committed any patent illegality in awarding the said amount. \n59. Moreover, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sushil Kumar Vs. Rakesh Kumar reiterated in (2003) 8 SCC 673 while relying upon the earlier judgment in the case of Thiru John Vs. Returning Officer (1977) 3 SCC 546 in para 63 observed as as under:-\n63. In Thiru John Vs. Returning Officer the law is stated in the following terms: (SCC page 545, para 15) \"15. It is well settled that a party's admission as defined in Sections 17 to 20, fulfilling the requirements of Section 21 of the Evidence Act, is substantive evidence proprio vigore. An admission, if clearly and unequivocally made, is the best evidence against the party making it and though not conclusive, shifts the onus on to the maker on the principle that 'what a party himself admits to be true may reasonably be presumed to be so and until the presumption was rebutted, the fact admitted must be taken to be established'.\" \nIssue No. (d):\n60. So far as the next issue regarding non-disposal of the application under Order XI Rule 12 CPC for discovery of the books of accounts/ledgers of claimant-respondent rendering the award to be fatal and vitiated is concerned, the same at first blush appears to be attractive but it may not have any substance for the simple reason that Sri Rohit Sharma in his cross examination had given a specific figure of the amount paid to the claimant-respondent. \n61. Importantly, it is also not the case of the appellant-objector either before the Arbitral Tribunal or in the proceedings under Section 34 of the Act or before this Court that the deposition made during cross examination was actuated by fraud, coercion or misconception or he was not authorized and not competent to make the said statement. Further there is no application even for recalling the said statements also. The position might have been different, in case, the appellant-objector would have demonstrated from the record that the INR 5,70,00,000/- was paid to the claimant-respondent, but, since the same is lacking, thus, mere irregularity of non-disposal of the said application would not render the award to be suffering from patent illegality making it vitiated.\nIssue No. (e):\n62. There is no quarrel to the proposition of law that a legal issue going into the root of the matter can be raised for the very first time in the appellate proceedings. However, the question is dependent upon the facts of a particular case. Here, the Court finds that the said principle would not apply and make any difference for the variety of reasons: (i) admission is best piece of evidence; (ii) the deposition of the witness, Rohit Sharma on behalf of the appellant-objector which remains intact; (iii) inconsistency in the stand of the appellant-objector which has not been explained; (iv) non-challenge to the quantum awarded to the claimant-respondent under various heads; (v) waving of counter claim; (vi) acceptance of the fact that incentives were paid to the claimant-respondent for the works executed by it and of course; (vii) resiling from the admissions at appellate stage. \n63. Viewing the case from four corners of law we are of the firm opinion that the appellant-objector has miserably failed to show any patent illegality warranting interference in the present appeal. Moreso, when the scope of interference under Section 34 is limited and within the contours of the ground specified under Section 34 of the Act. \n64. Resultantly, the appeal sans merit and is liable to be dismissed and is dismissed 65. Interim order stands vacated. \n \nOrder Dated:- 8.5.2024  \nPiyush/Rajesh  \n         (Vikas Budhwar, J.)

mr.m.r.gokul krishnan and mr.s.patrick common judgment (judgment of the court was delivered by r.subramanian, j.) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 finding itself unable to agree with the pronouncement of the division bench in hindustan unilever limited ponds house v. s.shanthi, reported in 2021 (6) ctc 1, another division bench of this court had referred the following questions for determination by the full bench: (i) whether an order passed by this court, on its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, exercising powers under clause 12 of the letters patent for high court of madras, granting leave to any applicant to institute suit within the jurisdiction of this court, can be said to be an order passed under the commercial courts act, 2015? and further (ii) whether an order passed by this court refusing to revoke leave granted to any applicant as referred in (i) above, can be said to be an order passed under the commercial courts act, 2015? 2. the facts which are necessary for disposal of this reference are https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 as follows: the first respondent in all these appeals instituted a suit against the appellants, four in number, seeking a money decree for rs.12,39,749.55 us dollars at the exchange rate on the date of the judgment payable towards the 17 unpaid bills, to pay interest of rs.18,46,665.39 calculated at 12% per annum on the said bills and to pay interest at 12% per annum on 12,39,749.55 us dollars from the date of plaint till date of realisation. 2.1 the said suit was filed during june 2018 along with an application seeking leave to file the suit in this court under clause 12 of the letters patent. leave was granted by this court on 02.07.2018. upon service, the defendants in the suit/the appellants herein filed independent applications in application nos.10178 of 2018, 726 of 2019, 8040 and 8043 of 2018 seeking revocation of the leave on various grounds. the commercial division which heard the revocation applications, dismissed the applications by a common order dated 11.11.2019. aggrieved, the defendants 1 to 4 filed independent appeals in osa nos.26 to 29 of 2020. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 2.2. the appeals came up for hearing before the commercial appellate division of this court where a doubt was raised regarding the jurisdiction of the commercial appellate division to hear these appeals. since the commercial appellate division, prima facie felt that the appeals may have to go before the court having the roaster, since it did not consider it to be a commercial court matter at present, a direction was issued on 25.11.2021 directing the appeals to be listed before the bench having the roaster for hearing appeals against orders on the original side of this court. pursuant to the said direction, the appeals were listed before the bench which had made the reference as aforesaid. 2.3. we have heard mr.n.vijayaraghavan and mr.sharath chandran, learned counsel appearing for m/s.n.p.vijaya kumar, for the appellant in osa nos.26 and 27 of 2020, mr.arun karthik mohan, learned counsel appearing for the appellant in osa nos.28 and 29 of 2020 and mr.k.sukumaran, learned counsel appearing for m/s.m.r.gogulkrishnan and mr.s.patrick, for the first respondent in all https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 the appeals. 2.4. mr.n.vijayaraghavan, mr.sharath chandran and mr. arun karthik mohan, learned counsel appearing for the appellants would vehemently contend that at the stage of granting leave, the judge sitting on the original side of this court does not exercise powers under the commercial courts act and therefore, the orders passed refusing to revoke the leave cannot be termed as once passed by the commercial division in exercise of the powers under the commercial courts act. according to them in order to enable the respondent to contend that the appeals are barred in view of the proviso to section 13 read with subsection 2 of section 13 of the commercial courts act it should be shown that the order granting leave and the order refusing to revoke it should be shown to have been passed in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on the commercial division under section 7 ot the commecial courts act 2015. the learned counsel appearing for the appellants would contend that the decision in hindustan unilever limited ponds house v. s.shanthi, requires a reconsideration on more than one ground. they https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 would submit that the division bench in hindustan unilever limited ponds house v. s.shanthi, did not consider the question as to whether an order either granting leave under clause 12 or refusing to revoke the leave granted could be said to be an order passed in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred under the commercial courts act. 2.5. the learned counsel would further attempt to make a distinction based on the stage of the suit and according to them, a suit could become a commercial suit only upon its numbering and the cognizance of it is taken by the commercial court and not before that. according to them, the solitary issue that needs to be considered relates to grant of leave under clause 12 of the letters patent and not the other issues which were dealt with and decided by the division bench in hindustan unilever limited ponds house v. s.shanthi. a distinction is sought to be made by the learned counsel to the effect that an application under clause 12 is not a suit. it being an application anterior to the suit there is no suit registered as a commercial cause before the commercial division when the application for grant of leave is taken up https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 by the court. it is also their contention that the application for leave is heard by the judge on the original side and not by the commercial division under the commercial courts act. relying upon the language of section 4 of the commercial courts act, the learned counsel would contend that the commercial division would come into play only in a suit and not at any prior stage. 2.6. arguing further, the learned counsel would submit that till such time the issue relating to grant of leave is finally decided the proceedings are only on the original side of this court and not before the commercial division. therefore, according to the learned counsel, an order refusing to revoke the leave granted being a judgment under clause 12 is appealable under clause 15 of the letters patent dehors the provisions of the commercial courts act. it is also contended that since it is the judge of this court who is sitting as a commercial division exercising jurisdiction under the commercial courts act irrespective of the order being passed by the judge sitting in the commercial division or the judge sitting in the original side of this court, if the order is not one https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 passed in exercise of the jurisdiction under the commercial courts act, the bar or prohibition contained under section 13 would not be attracted. 2.7. taking shelter under the language of clause 12 of the letters patent, the appellants would contend that it is a special power vested in the chartered high courts by virtue of the letters patent and therefore, the exercise of such power cannot be deemed to be one under a particular enactment. if the power is not exercised under the particular enactment the prohibition contained in the said enactment would not stand attracted. in essence, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants is that there are two stages in hearing of a commercial dispute, one before numbering and the other after numbering. a suit does not part take the character of a commercial suit before it is numbered and any order passed at a stage anterior to numbering cannot be said to be one passed in exercise of the jurisdiction under the commercial courts act by the commercial division and therefore, such orders are appealable under clause 15 of the letters patent dehors the prohibition or the bar contained in section 13 of the act. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 3. contending contra mr.k.sukumaran, learned counsel appearing for the first respondent in all the appeals would submit that the stage at which the order is passed does not really matter. it is the subject matter of the suit that has to be looked into. if it is found that the subject matter of the suit could be termed as a commercial dispute within any one of the sub clauses (i) to (xxi) of sub section (c) of section 2 of the commercial courts act, then the same would qualify as a commercial dispute which is to be dealt with by the commercial division. 3.1. terming the distinction that is sought to be made by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant as non-existent, mr.k.sukumaran, learned counsel appearing for the first respondent would submit that the provisions of the enactment must be interpreted in such a manner that they would further the objects of the enactment and not otherwise. drawing us to the objects and reasons of the commercial courts act, mr.k.sukumaran, would submit that the very object being one to fast track the litigation by curtailing unnecessary appeals at the interlocutory stages, the provisions of the act must be read in such a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 manner to further the said intention, viz. quick disposal. he would also point out that the reference order attempts to make an artificial distinction on the basis of the stage at which the order is passed overlooking the fact that the provisions of the commercial courts act do not lend support to such distinction being made. the learned counsel on either side would rely upon various judgments in support of their submissions. 4. before adverting to the submissions of the counsel in detail, it will be useful to extract the relevant statutory provisions. clause 12 of the letters patent reads as follows: \"12. original jurisdiction as to suits: and we do further ordain that the said high court of judicature at madras, in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, shall be empowered to receive, try, and determine suits of every description if, in the case of suits for land or other immovable property, such land or property shall be situated, or, in all other cases, if the cause of action shall have arisen, either wholly, or, in case https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 the leave of the court shall have been first obtained, in part, within the local limits of the ordinary original jurisdiction of the said high court: or if the defendant at the time of the commencement of the suit shall dwell or carry on business or personally work for gain, within such limits; except that the said high court shall not have such original jurisdiction in cases falling within the jurisdiction of the small cause court at madras, in which the debt or damage, or value of the property sued for does not exceed one hundred rupees.\" clause 15 of the letters patent reads as follows: \"15. appeal from the courts of original jurisdiction to the high courts in its appellate jurisdiction: and we do further ordain that an appeal shall lie to the said high court of judicature at madras from the judgment] (not being a judgment passed in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 court subject to the superintendence of the said high court, and not being an order made in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction, and not being a sentence or order passed or made in the exercise of the power of superintendence under the provisions of section 107 of the government of india act, or in the exercise of criminal jurisdiction of one judge of the said high court or one judge of any division court, pursuant to section 108 of the government of india act, and that notwithstanding anything herein before provided an appeal shall lie to the said high court from a judgment of one judge of the said high court or one judge of any division court, pursuant to section 108 of the government of india act made (on or after the 1st day of february 1929) in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a court subject to the superintendence of the said high court, where the judge who passed the judgment declares that the case is a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 fit one for appeal; but that the right of appeal from other judgments of judges of the said high court or of such division court shall be to us, our heirs or successors in our or their privy council as hereinafter provided.\" 4.1. it will be useful to advert to the recommendations of the law commission of india contained in 188 th report dated 15th december 2003 which led to the enactment of the commercial courts act : 1.purpose to expedite commercial cases of high pecuniary value the purpose of the proposals in this report is to expedite commercial cases of high pecuniary value and create confidence in the commercial circles, within india and outside, that our courts are quite fast, if not faster than courts elsewhere. the last decade has brought about phenomenal changes leading to enormous growth in the commerce and industrial sector of india. the policies of the government have changed radically from 1991, the year in which our economy was opened up to foreign investment in a big way. privatisation, liberalization https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 and globalisation have resulted in giving a big boost to our economy. at the same time, world has become very much competitive. with such rapid increase in commerce and trade, commercial disputes involving high stakes are likely to increase. unless, there is new and effective mechanism for resolving them speedily and efficiently, progress will be retarded. the overall benefits that may accrue to the economy of the country as a whole by the establishment of the commercial division will, in our opinion, be in several hundreds of crores of rupees. in view of the present era of globalisation and liberalization, investment in india, both domestic and foreign is bound to increase tremendously once the investors of the world know with certainity and assurance that the commercial division in the high courts in india will dispose of the matters within a maximum period of two years which is comparable to the period of pendency in usa or uk. the expense involved in establishment of the commercial division will, in our view, be a small fraction of the overall benefits that will accrue to the economy of the country. investors will make freely investment in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 business ventures without fear of blocking their substantial business capital in undue prolonged litigation in courts. the proposed changes are likely to render the overall market friendly change in investment in business scenario. 2.method of expeditious disposal of \"commercial cases\" of high pecuniary value in nutshell: we recommend the creation of \"commercial division\" in each of our high courts so that these may handle 'commercial cases' of a high threshold value of (say) rs. 1 crore and above, or such higher limit as may be fixed by the high court and on fasttrack basis. such a procedure was recommended in our report on amendments to the indian arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 for 'fast-track' arbitration. the objective is that a commercial case of such high value should be disposed of within a period of one year or at the most two years in all the states in india. a maximum period of two years is perfectly justified and is comparable to the period of pendency in most courts abroad and in particular in us and uk. the proposed divisions should be manned by judges of the high court who are wellhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 versed in civil law and in particular, commercial laws. it is also proposed that high court judge should be given extensive exposure to the fast growing changes in commerce occurring globally and that their knowledge levels in respect of new branches of commercial law should be updated constantly by a programme of continuing lectures. the commercial cases above the pecuniary limit of (say) rs. 1 crore or more as stated above must, in our view, be taken up on the original side of the high court and to be allocated to the commercial division. simultaneously, pending appeals before the high court in relation to commercial cases of the high pecuniary value abovementioned must also to be allocated to the commercial division straightway rather than stand in queue along with other civil appeals pending in the high courts. likewise, the execution of decrees passed by the commercial division must also be undertaken by the same division. the statement of objects and reasons of the commercial courts act is as follows: statement of objects and reasons https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 the proposal to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes has been under consideration of the government for quite some time. the high value commercial disputes involve complex facts and question of law. therefore, there is a need to provide for an independent mechanism for their early resolution. early resolution of commercial disputes shall create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive indian legal system. 2. the law commission of india in its 188th report had recommended the constitution of the commercial division in each high court. accordingly, the commercial division of high courts bill, 2009 was introduced and passed by the lok sabha. however, during the discussion of the aforesaid bill in the rajya sabha, some members raised certain issues and in view thereof, the matter was again referred to the law commission of india for its examination. the law commission of india, in its 253rd report, has recommended for the establishment of the commercial courts, the commercial division and the commercial appellate divisions in the high courts for disposal of commercial disputes of specified value. 3. based on the recommendations of the law commission made in its 253rd report, a bill namely, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts bill, 2015 was introduced in the rajya sabha on 24th april, 2015 and the same is at present under the consideration of the department related parliamentary standing committee on personnel, public grievances, law and justice. as provided in the said bill, 2015, all the suits, appeals or applications related to commercial disputes of specified value i.e. one crore or above, are to be dealt with by the commercial courts or the commercial division of the high court 4. by way of the delhi high court (amendment) act, 2015, the ordinary original jurisdiction of the delhi high court has been increased from rupees twenty lakhs to rupees two crore and there is a provision for transfer of pending case from the delhi high court to district courts. on the enactment of commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts bill, 2015, some of the commercial disputes which are to be transferred to the district courts from the delhi high court may again be required to be transferred to the commercial division of the high court of delhi. it would cause delay in the disposal of cases as well as inconvenience to the parties and counsels and may also result in confusion. therefore, it became necessary that the provisions of the delhi high court https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 (amendment) act, 2015 and establishment of the commercial courts and commercial division of the high courts may be brought into force simultaneously. 5. as parliament was not in session and urgent steps were needed to be taken, the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division in high courts ordinance, 2015 was promulgated on 23rd october, 2015. 6. it is proposed to introduced the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts bill, 2015 to replace the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts ordinance, 2015 which, inter alia, provides for the following namely:— (i) constitution of the commercial courts at district level except for the territory over which any high court is having ordinary original civil jurisdiction; (ii) constitution of the commercial divisions in those high courts which are already exercising ordinary civil jurisdiction and they shall have territorial jurisdiction over such areas on which it has original jurisdiction; (iii) constitution of the commercial appellate division in all the high courts to hear the appeals against the orders of the commercial courts and the orders of the commercial https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 division of the high court; (iv) the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of such commercial courts and commercial division is proposed as one crore rupees; and (v) to amend the code of civil procedure, 1908 as applicable to the commercial courts and commercial divisions which shall prevail over the existing high courts rules and other provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. 7.the proposed bill shall accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the indian justice delivery system, and the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation. 8. the bill seeks to replace the aforesaid ordinance. 4.2. the relevant provisions of the commercial courts act 2015 are as follows: section 2(c) of the commercial courts act enlists various disputes which would be classified as commercial disputes. while section 3 provides for constitution of commercial courts, section 3(a) provides for constitution of commercial appellate courts. insofar as high courts https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 which are having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, section 4 provides for constitution of commercial division of high court, the said section reads as follows: \"4. constitution of commercial division of high court. — (1) in all high courts, having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the chief justice of the high court may, by order, constitute commercial division having one or more benches consisting of a single judge for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under this act. (2) the chief justice of the high court shall nominate such judges of the high court who have experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be judges of the commercial division.\" section 7 sets out the jurisdiction of the commercial division of high courts and it reads as follows: https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 \"7. jurisdiction of commercial divisions of high courts.—all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value filed in a high court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of that high court: provided that all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes, stipulated by an act to lie in a court not inferior to a district court, and filed or pending on the original side of the high court, shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the high court: provided further that all suits and applications transferred to the high court by virtue of sub-section (4) of section 22 of the designs act, 2000 (16 of 2000) or section 104 of the patents act, 1970 (39 of 1970) shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the high court in all the areas over which the high court exercises ordinary original civil jurisdiction.\" https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 section 13 provides for appeals against the decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions, it reads as follows: \"13. appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions.— (1) any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court below the level of a district judge may appeal to the commercial appellate court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order. (1a) any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court at the level of district judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order: provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996).] (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\" the other provisions of the act may not be very relevant for our purposes. 5. at the outset, it must be borne in mind that commercial courts act is an enactment which aims at speedy disposal and the legislature, with the said object in mind, had tinkered with certain provisions of the code of civil procedure to enable fast tracking of commercial litigations by curtailing appeals at the interlocutory stages and by providing mandatory time lines for performance of certain acts. the failure to adhere to the time lines would lead to orders being passed against the party who fails to adhere to such time lines. the hon'ble supreme court in various decisions has held that the time lines prescribed under the act https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 are mandatory and they have to be strictly adhered to. none of the parties seriously dispute the above said position of law. 6. we have extracted the relevant provisions of the commercial courts act. section 4 deal with constitution of commercial division of high courts and such constitution is for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under the act. section 7 which deals with jurisdiction of commercial divisions of high courts confers the jurisdiction to hear and dispose of all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value filed in the high court. section 13 provides for appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions. section 13(1a) permits an appeal by a person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial division of the high court to appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court. proviso to sub section (1) of section 13 confines appeals against the orders that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act 1996. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 7. subsection 2 of section 13 which contains a non-obstante clause provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the letters patent of the high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act. as could be seen from the provisions a conscious attempt has been made by the parliament to prohibit appeals and civil revisions from orders of the commercial division and the commercial courts at the interlocutory stages. section 8 of the act bars a revision application against an interlocutory order; section 13 bars appeals otherwise than in accordance with the act; section12(3) bars an appeal or revision under section 115 of the code against an order determining the jurisdiction made by the commercial court. care has been taken by the parliament to prevent appeals and to make some of the judgments which made appeals against certain interlocutory orders possible inoperative. 8. in shah babulal khimji v . jayaben d. kania and another, reported in 1981 (4) scc 8, the hon'ble supreme court held that order https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 xliii rule (1) of the code of civil procedure does not override or control clause 15 of the letters patent, thereby enabling appeals against orders which are not specifically made appealable under order xliii rule (1) invoking clause 15 of the letters patent. the effect of this judgment of the hon'ble supreme court is sought to be nullified by subsection 2 of section 13 by inserting a non-obstante clause and thereby making clause 15 of the letters patent unavailable to commercial disputes. 9. in p.s.sathappan(dead)by lrs. v. andhra bank ltd and others, reported in 2004(11) scc 672, the hon'ble supreme court held that despite the bar under section 104 (2) of the code of civil procedure, clause 15 could be invoked for appeals against the judgments of single judges of the high court made in the exercise of original jurisdiction. the effect of this judgment is also sought to be nullified by section 13(2) of the commercial courts act. 10. in iridium india telecom ltd v. motorola inc, reported in 2005 (2) scc 145, the hon'ble supreme court had held that the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 provisions of rule 1 of order viii would be subject to the rules framed under the letters patent which are protected under section 129 of the code of civil procedure, thereby concluding that the longer period of limitation of six weeks provided under the original side rules framed under section 129 of the code of civil procedure would apply to suits in the original side of the high court. the effect of this judgment is sought to be undone by subsection 3 of section 16 of the commercial courts act. subsection 3 of section 16 of the commercial courts act provides that any rule of the jurisdictional high court which is in conflict that the provisions of the code of civil procedure as amended by the commercial courts act, will not prevail over the provisions of the code of civil procedure as amended by the commercial courts act. rule 1 of order viii has been amended by the commercial courts act by providing an unalterable fixed period of limitation for filing a written statement and sub-section 3 of section 16 makes rule 1 of order viii as amended by the commercial courts act to override the rules framed by the high court on its original side. 11. to sum up the parliament has taken care to undo the effect of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 at least three judgments of the hon'ble supreme court by introducing the non-obstante clause in subsection 2 of section 13 and by subsection 3 of section 16 of the commercial courts act. we are pointing out the above feature only with the view to high light the importance that has been given, for speedy disposal of commercial litigation, by the parliament. 12. adverting to the contentions of the learned counsel for the appellants that a suit does not become a commercial cause unless it is numbered and any order passed prior to the stage of numbering would not be an order passed by the commercial division in exercise of the powers conferred under the act, we have to necessarily express our disinclination to accept the said argument. the reasons are not far to seek. we have extracted the provisions of the act. section 4 provides for constitution of a commercial division in the high court for the purposes of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under the act. 13. section 7 prescribes the jurisdiction of the commercial divisions of high courts. the main section provides that \"all suits and applications relating to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 commercial disputes of a specified value filed in a high court having ordinary civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the high court\". section 7 does not seek to make a distinction between applications anterior to or posterior to numbering of the suit. of course the learned counsel appearing for the appellants would contend that a suit could be said to be instituted only on presentation of the plaint and not otherwise. accordin to them since clause 12 enables an application for leave to institute a suit could be accompanied by a copy of the plaint and therefore, there is no institution of a suit upon presentation of an application for leave to file the suit. 14. our attention in this regard is drawn to clause 16 of rule 4 of order i of the original side rules, which defines the suit as all proceedings commenced by the filing of a plaint. rule i of order iii of the original side rules which deals with an application for leave to institute https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 the suit enables a party to file an application accompanied by the plaint in the intended suit or a copy thereof. we do not think such a fine distinction could be made inasmuch as the provisions of the commercial courts act are wide enough to cover even stages prior to the numbering of the suit. as we had already pointed out section 7 confers the jurisdiction to hear and dispose of all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes to the commercial division of the high court. if we are to accept the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants then we will be importing the words \"in such suits\" between the words applications and relating occurring in section 7, so as to read it as \"all suits and applications in such suits relating to commercial disputes.\" 15. we cannot add to a legislative provision in order to restrict the jurisdiction that is conferred on a court by the legislature. we are therefore unable to accept the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that an application anterior to the numbering of the suit cannot be heard by a commercial division and it should be deemed that it is heard and disposed of by the high court on its original side. no doubt a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 certain criticism is made by the learned counsel appearing for the appellants on certain conclusions reached by the division bench in hindustan unilever limited ponds house v. s.shanthi, wherein the division bench at paragraph 60 while dealing with maintainability of osa cad nos.24, 25, 26 and 27 of 2021, which are appeals filed against orders directing return of plaints under order vii rule 10, an appeal would lie under order xliii rule 1(a) of the code of civil procedure. the complaint of the counsel for the appellants is that the division bench has overlooked the fact that in view of order xlix rule 3 of the code of civil procedure, order vii rule 10 would not apply to the original side of a chartered high court. they would also point out that the division bench had at paragraph 107 relying upon r.p.o. connor v. p.g.sampath kumar, reported in air 1953 mad 897, held that the return can be made under section 151 of the code of civil procedure. 16. it is the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that if it is an order of return under section 151 of the code of civil https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 procedure which is not specifically made appealable under rule 1 of order xliii of the code of civil procedure, the conclusion of the division bench regarding maintainability of those appeals is incorrect. may be there is some substance in the submission of the learned counsel but we do not propose to go into the same as that question does not fall within the scope of reference made to us. 17. mr.k.sukumaran, learned counsel appearing for the first respondent would invite our attention to the judgment of the hon'ble supreme court in owners and parties interested in the vessel m.v.polaris galaxy v. banque cantonale de geneve reported in 2022 scc online sc 1293, to contend that the hon'ble supreme court had gone into the object of the act and held that the object of the commercial courts act, vis-a-vis the admiralty act and concluded that the commercial courts act would prevail over the admiralty act. in doing so, the hon'ble supreme court refused invoke the doctrine generalia specialibus non derogant, and concluded as follows: \"81. if such an order under the code of civil procedure https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 which does not fall under order xliii of cpc is held to be appealable, then the entire purpose of the commercial courts act would be defeated, and every single order passed in a course of a trial of an admiralty suit would be appealable under section 14 of the act. such orders would be large in number including orders in relation to discovery, inspection, case management hearing, admissibility of evidence, framing of issues, interrogatories, etc. this would make a mockery of the intended purpose of parliament in enacting the commercial courts act, which is to expedite trials in commercial suits of a specified value, and restrict the number of interlocutory appeals.\" 18. in deciding the above question, the hon'ble supreme court also pointed out that section 14 of the admiralty act which provides for an appeal from any judgment, decree, final order or interim order of a single judge of the high court under the admiralty act to the division https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 bench of the high court should be read harmoniously with order xliii rule 1 of the code of civil procedure, in view of section 12 of the admiralty act read with section 13 of the commercial courts act. 19. the hon'ble supreme court has also gone into the legislative intent and concluded that the courts while interpreting the provisions of a legislation particularly a legislation which seeks to achieve speedy disposal should give effect to the intendment of the legislature and shall not aid a litigant to delay trial by filing appeal even from inconsequential orders. we respectfully follow what the hon'ble supreme court has pointed out in the above judgment to conclude that an appeal against an order which is not made specifically appealable under order xliii rule 1 of the code of civil procedure, cannot be maintained and the distinction that is sought to be made with reference to the stage at which the order is passed is an artificial distinction not contemplated by the provisions of the commercial courts act. 20. as we have already pointed out the provisions of the commercial courts act do not aid the interpretation that is sought to be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 placed by the counsel for the appellants. in interpreting a statute particularly a statute like commercial courts act, we have to necessarily go by the language employed by it and we cannot supplant or add to the provisions of the act, so as to enlarge the scope of the provision. as we had already pointed out section 7 which invests the jurisdiction to hear and dispose of commercial disputes in the commercial division of the high court does not make a difference between pre-institution and post institution applications. once we reject the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants which attempts to make out an artificial line of distinction, the necessary conclusion would be that both the questions referred have to be answered in the negative. an application for grant of leave under clause 12 of the letters patent will definitely fall within the jurisdiction of a commercial division in terms of section 7 of the said act and it cannot be said to be an order passed outside the commercial courts act 2015. 21. we answer the questions referred as follows: (i) an order passed by this court in its ordinary original civil jurisdiction exercising powers under https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 clause 12 of the letters patent for the high court of madras granting leave to any applicant to institute a suit within the jurisdiction of this court will be an order passed under the commercial courts act 2015 in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on the commercial division under section 7 of the said act. (ii) an order passed by this court refusing to revoke leave granted to any applicant as referred in (i) above will also be an order passed under the commercial courts act 2015. 22. in the normal course, we should direct the appeals to be posted before the concerned division bench for disposal after answering the reference. we do not deem it necessary to do so since the reference itself is in relation to the maintainability of the appeals which has retained us for nearly three years now, we do not propose to further delay the matter by directing the appeals to be listed before the appropriate division bench. in view of our answers to the questions referred to us, the appeals will stand dismissed as not maintainable. there shall be no https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis osa.nos.26 to 29 of 2020 order as to costs. consequently, the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
