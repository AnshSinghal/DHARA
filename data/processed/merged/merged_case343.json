The Msefc has issued notice to the petitioner-firm advising it to make payment of the due amount as mentioned immediately and in no case, later than 15 days from the date of receipt of notice with a caution that failing which, a case will be registered against it by the Msefc. \nIt appears that later on, the Msefc has initiated conciliation proceedings as provided under Section 18(2) of the Act of 2006, however, the conciliation efforts failed and the Msefc has decided to proceed under Section 18(3) of the Act of 2006 and ultimately has passed the award dated 13.9.2021 and directed the petitioner-firm to pay the original amount of Rs.8,549,565/- along with interest to the tune of Rs.4,757,117/-, total Rs.13,306,682/- within a period of one month with a further direction that if the above-referred (3 of 17) [Cw-8048/2022] amount is not paid within a period one month, the petitioner shall pay three times of compound interest on the prevalent rate of interest as determined by the Reserve Bank of India. It is also mentioned in the award dated 13.9.2021 that the same has been passed pursuant to the decision taken in the sixth meeting of the Msefc held on 24.3.2021. \nBeing aggrieved with the award dated 13.9.2021, the petitioner-firm has preferred Sbcwp No.371/2022 before this Court, however, the learned Single Judge of this Court vide order dated 12.1.2022 has dismissed the aforesaid writ petition on the ground of availability of alternative/statutory remedy to the petitioner-firm to challenge the award dated 13.9.2021 under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short 'the Act of 1996'). The order dated 12.1.2022 reads as under :\n\"1. By way of present writ petition, the petitioner has challenged the order dated 13.09.2021, which is required to be treated as an award, in terms of Section 18 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Act, 2006 (for short, 'the Act of 2006').\n2. Mr. Akshat Verma, learned counsel for the petitioner, argued that the award under challenge has been passed by two Arbitrators, which is clearly contrary to Section 10 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, 'the Act of 1996') inasmuch as, number of Arbitrators are required to be in odd numbers. \n3. It is also contended that immediately after receiving the notice of reference, the petitioner had sent a mail that he was indisposed and yet petitioner's request was (4 of 17) [Cw-8048/2022] not acceded to by the Arbitrators and impugned award came to be passed. \n4. Without pronouncing anything upon the merits of the petitioner's contention, suffice it to observe that in terms of Section 18(3) of the  Act of 2006, the award in question is required to be governed by the Act of 1996 and, therefore, the petitioner is supposed to challenge the same in terms of Section 34 of the Act of 1996 on all possible grounds including the one that has been canvassed before this Court. \n5. In the face of availability of alternative/statutory remedy, this Court refuses to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. \n6. The writ petition, therefore, fails.\n7. The stay application also stands disposed of accordingly.\n8. It goes without saying that the petitioner shall be free to avail his remedies in accordance with law.\" \nThe petitioner-firm, has thereafter, filed an appeal under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 before the Commercial Court and it has directed the petitioner-firm to deposit 75% of the award amount as per Section 19 of the Act of 2006. \nBeing aggrieved with the same, the petitioner-firm has preferred SBCWP No.5022/2022 before this Court and this Court vide order dated 26.4.2022 has disposed of the aforesaid writ petition while passing the following order :\n\"This writ petition has been filed on behalf of the petitioner-firm being aggrieved with the order dated 24.03.2022 passed by the Commercial Court No.1, Jodhpur (hereinafter to be referred as 'the trial court'), whereby the trial court while (5 of 17) [CW-8048/2022] entertaining the appeal filed by the petitioner-firm against the arbitration award dated 13.09.2021 issued by the office of Commissioner Industries, Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council, Headquarter-First, Jaipur has directed the petitioner-firm to deposit 75% of the award amount as per Section 19 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006. \nLearned counsel for the petitioner-firm has submitted that the trial court while directing the petitioner-firm to deposit 75% of the award amount has failed to take into consideration the financial condition of the petitioner-firm. It is also submitted that on account of Covid-19 pandemic, the financial condition of the petitioner-firm is poor and it is difficult for it to deposit 75% of the award amount in one go. \nLearned counsel for the petitioner-firm has submitted that the petitioner-firm is ready to deposit 75% of the award amount before the trial court in three monthly installments. \nLearned counsel for the petitioner-firm undertakes that the petitioner-firm will deposit first installment on 02.05.2022, second installment on 01.06.2022 and third/last installment on 01.07.2022. \nLearned counsel for the respondent- firm initially has opposed the prayer of the petitioner-firm, however, later on, agreed to grant time to the petitioner-firm to deposit 75% of the award amount in three monthly installments as suggested herein above by learned counsel for the petitioner-firm. \nIn view of the above, this writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner-firm to deposit 75% of the award amount i.e. Rs.99,80,011/- (Rupees ninety nine lacs eighty thousand eleven) in three installments before the trial court as per the following schedule :-\n                                          (6 of 17)                 [CW-8048/2022 ] \n\n\n  Three Installments                Date of                      Amount of                                   Installments                  Installments                                     Deposit First Installment                   02.05.2022                   Rs.30,00,000/-\nSecond Installment                  01.06.2022                   Rs.30,00,000/- \nThird/Last Installment              01.07.2022                   Rs.39,80,011/-\nIt is made clear, if the petitioner-firm makes any default in payment of any of the installments as directed above, the appeal preferred by it before the trial court shall automatically be dismissed. \nThe trial court shall disburse the pre- deposit amount in favour of the respondent- firm as per its discretion. \nThe petitioner-firm shall furnish an undertaking in writing before the trial court to the effect that till pendency of the appeal filed by it before the trial court, it shall not alienate any of its property. \nStay petition also stands disposed of.\" \nIt is revealed that the petitioner-firm has not deposited 75% of the award amount as per the directions given by this Court vide order dated 26.4.2022 and the appeal preferred by the petitioner-firm came to be dismissed as observed in the said order.\nIn the meantime, the respondent has preferred execution petition before the Commercial Court and in those proceedings, the petitioner-firm has filed certain objections by moving an application under Section 47 of the CPC. In the said application, the petitioner-firm has raised mainly three objections, which read as under :\n(7 of 17) [CW-8048/2022]\n(a) that the award dated 13.9.2021 was passed by the even number of members, which is not permissible and in contradiction of Section 10 of the Act of 1996. It is claimed that the Arbitration Tribunal consists of three members whereas, the same is signed by two members only, which is evident from the award dated 13.9.2021. It is contended that on the day, the award was passed, the third member of the Arbitration Tribunal was already expired and, as such, the award dated 13.9.2021 itself is nullity and is non-executable.\n( b) that the decree-holder has filed execution proceedings prematurely, hence, such execution is barred by Section 36 of the Act of 1996. \n(c) that because the award dated 13.9.2021 is not sufficiently stamped, therefore, the same remains un- enforceable. \nThe Commercial Court vide order dated 21.5.2022 has rejected the objections raised by the petitioner-firm by giving detailed reasonings. \nIn respect of the objection No.1, the Commercial Court has concluded that the Arbitration Tribunal has already decided to pass an award while exercising powers under Section 16 of the Act of 2006 and the same is evident from the order-sheet of the Arbitration Tribunal dated 1.4.2021. The Commercial Court is of the opinion that since the decision of passing the award was already taken on 1.4.2021 by the odd number of members, the death of one of the arbitrator (8 of 17) [CW-8048/2022] after 1.4.2021 will not result in declaring the award as nullity because only the signatures of the third member is not on the award dated 13.9.2021. \nIn respect of the objection No.2 raised by the petitioner- firm that the execution proceedings initiated by the respondent are premature, the Commercial Court has concluded that in any law, limitation is provided for filing application, appeal or suit and the same is treated as limitation period, however, there are provisions wherein the court can grant further time to file any application, appeal or suit beyond the limitation period as per its discretion, however, the said period granted by the court as per its discretion cannot be termed as limitation period. The Commercial Court is also of the view that since the award is passed on 13.9.2021 and the execution application is filed on 16.12.2021, whereas the limitation for challenging the award is provided as three months, it cannot be said that the execution proceedings are filed before expiry of three months period. \nSo far as the objection raised by the petitioner that the award dated 13.9.2021 is not sufficiently stamped is concerned, the Commercial Court has concluded that the award passed by the Arbitration Tribunal is an instrument as defined in Section 2(xix) of the Rajasthan Stamp Act (for short 'the Stamp Act'). It is also observed that the Arbitration Tribunal was the enterprise of the competent government and (9 of 17) [CW-8048/2022] as per proviso to Section 3(b) of the Stamp Act, any instrument issued by the competent government is not required to be stamped. It is further observed that prior to year 2008, as per the Rule 5(13), an award is required to be stamped, but those Rules were repealed in the year 2018 and as per the Rules promulgated in the year 2018, there is no provision for paying any stamp duty on the award as per Rule 5(10) and (11).\nAssailing the order dated 21.5.2022, learned counsel for the petitioner-firm has submitted that since the award is passed by the even number of members, the same is contrary to Section 10 of the Act of 1996 and is non- executable, but the Commercial Court has illegally held that the award though signed by even number of members cannot be said to be non-executable since the decision of passing the award was taken by all the three members of the Arbitration Tribunal. Learned counsel has further argued that as a matter of fact, when the award was passed, the fact remains that the third member of the Arbitration Tribunal was no more and, as such, the award cannot be said to be executable in any manner. \nIt is further argued that the Commercial Court has illegally observed that the execution proceedings initiated by the respondent are not premature though from the facts itself, it is clear that the execution proceedings were initiated by the respondent before expiry of the period of challenging (10 of 17) [CW-8048/2022] the award as per the provisions of the Act of 1996. It is further argued that the award was passed on 13.9.2021 and the limitation for challenging the same expires after 120 days, but the respondent has filed the execution proceedings before expiry of 120 days and, as such, it is clear that the execution proceedings initiated by the respondent are premature.\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has further argued that the award was not sufficiently stamped and, as such, the same remains non-executable, but the Commercial Court has wrongly held that no stamp is required.\nLearned counsel for the petitioner-firm has placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Chief Engineer, Hydel Project and Others Vs. Ravinder Nath and Others, reported in (2008) 2 SCC 350; decision of the Madras High Court rendered in the case of S.A. Mohideen Vs. S.A. Fasluddin and Ors. [O.P. No.310 of 2018, O.A. Nos.257, 258 of 2018 and A.No.2450 of 2018, decided on 02.08.2018]; decision of Calcutta High Court rendered in the case of SRS Investments Bengal Tiger Ltd. and Ors. Vs. Rahul Todi and Ors. [C.O.Nos.39-41 of 2019 and C.O.No.197 of 2019, decided on 24.06.2019]; decision of the Chhattisgarh High Court at Bilaspur rendered in the case of R.S. Bajwa and Company Vs. State of Chhattisgarh and Ors., reported in AIR 2008 Chh 75. \n(11 of 17) [CW-8048/2022 ] Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that the Commercial Court has not committed any illegality in rejecting the objections filed by the petitioner-firm vide order dated 21.5.2022, hence, no interference is called for in this writ petition. \nHeard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material available on record. \nBefore going into the merits of the arguments raised on behalf of the respondent assailing the validity of the order impugned, I would like to observe that the petitioner-firm is not entitled to get any relief from this Court due to its conduct. \nEarlier, against the order dated 13.9.2021, the petitioner-firm has preferred SBCWP No.371/2022, which came to be dismissed by this Court while observing that the petitioner-firm has an alternate and efficacious remedy to challenge the award under Section 34 of the Act of 1996. It is to be noticed that a Coordinate Bench of this Court has dismissed the above-referred writ petition while taking note of the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner-firm that the award is contrary to Section 10 of the Act of 1996. The petitioner-firm though filed an appeal under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 against the award dated 13.9.2021, but has not deposited 75% of the award amount as per Section 19 of the Act of 2006 and when the Commercial Court has insisted upon the petitioner-firm to deposit the same, the petitioner- (12 of 17) [CW-8048/2022] firm has preferred SBCWP No.5022/2022 before this Court claiming that on account of COVID-19 Pandemic, the financial condition of the petitioner-firm is poor and it is difficult for it to deposit 75% of the award amount in one go. It is urged on behalf of the petitioner-firm before this Court that the petitioner-firm is ready to deposit 75% of the award amount in three monthly installments and thereafter undertakes to deposit three installments running from 2.5.2022 to 1.7.2022. \nThis Court, after taking into consideration the said undertaking given before this Court, has directed the petitioner-firm to deposit 75% of the award amount in three monthly installments and the last installment of which was to be paid on 1.7.2022 itself. This Court has made it clear that if the petitioner-firm makes any default in payment of any of the installments as directed above, the appeal preferred by it before the trial court shall automatically be dismissed. \nAdmittedly, the petitioner-firm has not deposited 75% of the award amount before the Commercial Court and the appeal filed by it challenging the award dated 13.9.2021 came to be dismissed. \nThe conduct of the petitioner-firm of not depositing 75% of the award amount despite giving an undertaking before this Court is a clear case of disobedience and cannot be appreciated. It appears that the petitioner-firm has used (13 of 17) [CW-8048/2022] different forums including this Court to deny the decree- holder the fruits of the decree. \nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ravinder Kaur Vs. Ashok Kumar and Another, reported in AIR 2004 SC 904 has deprecated such practice while observing as under :\n\"Courts of law should be careful enough to see through such diabolical plans of the judgment-debtors to deny the decree-holders the fruits of the decree obtained by them. This type of errors on the part of the judicial forums only encourage frivolous and cantankerous litigations causing laws delay and bringing bad name to the judicial system.\" \nApart from that, I am also of the opinion that challenge of the petitioner-firm to the execution of the award dated 13.9.2021 is also barred by the principles of res judicata. The award dated 13.9.2021 has attained finality with the dismissal of the appeal filed by the petitioner-firm under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 before the Commercial Court in view of the order passed by this Court in SBCWP No.5022/2022 decided on 26.4.2022 because admittedly, the petitioner-firm has failed to make payment of 75% of the award amount within the stipulated time granted by this Court. \nIt is settled that the principles of res judicata apply between two stages of the same litigation and in this reference, reliance can be placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Satyadhyan Ghosal and Ors. Vs. Smt. Deorjin Debi and Anr., reported in AIR (14 of 17) [CW-8048/2022] 1960 SC 941, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under :\n\"7. The principle of res judicata is based on the need of giving a finality to judicial decisions. What it says is that once a respondent is judicata, it shall not be adjudged again. Primarily it applies as between past litigation and future litigation, when a matter whether on a question of fact or a question of law has been decided between two parties in one suit or proceeding and the decision is final, either because no appeal was taken to a higher court or because the appeal was dismissed, or no appeal lies, neither party will be allowed in a future suit or proceeding between the same parties to canvass the matter again. This principle of res judicata is embodied in relation to suits in S.11 of the Code of Civil Procedure; but even where S.11 does not apply, the principle of res judicata has been applied by courts for the purpose of achieving finality in litigation. The result of this is that the original court as well as any higher court must in any future litigation proceed on the basis that the previous decision was correct. \n8. The principle of res judicata applies also as between two stages in the same litigation to this extent that a court whether the trial court or a higher court having at an earlier stage decided a matter in one way will not allow the parties to re-agitate the matter again at a subsequent stage of the same proceedings. Does this however mean that because at an interlocutory matter in one way and no appeal has been taken therefrom or no appeal did lie, a higher court cannot at a later stage of the same litigation consider the matter again?\" \n(Emphasis Supplied) (15 of 17) [CW-8048/2022 ] On merits, I am of the view that the findings recorded by the Commercial Court while rejecting the objections filed by the petitioner-firm cannot be said to be perverse in any manner. \nThough, it is true that at the time of passing of the award dated 13.9.2021, the third member of the Arbitration Tribunal was no more as he expired prior to passing of the award dated 13.9.2021, but the fact remains that the Arbitration Tribunal has principally decided to pass the award on 1.4.2021 and on that day, all the members of the Arbitration Tribunal were present and signed the proceedings. Simply because the detailed award was passed on 13.9.2021, when one of the members of the Arbitration Tribunal was not alive, it cannot be said that the award became contrary to Section 10 of the Act of 1996. It is not the case of the petitioner-firm that immediately after the death of one of the members of the Arbitration Tribunal, it has raised any objection or prayed for appointment of new Arbitration Tribunal pointing out that one of the members of the Arbitration Tribunal is no more. As a matter of fact, the petitioner has not raised any objection till the execution petition is filed and this fact itself is sufficient to draw a presumption that though the petitioner-firm was aware about the death of one of the members of the Arbitration Tribunal, but it has not raised any objection with regard to the fact that (16 of 17) [CW-8048/2022] the decision to pass the award was not taken by all the three members of the Arbitration Tribunal. \nThe finding recorded by the Commercial Court whereby it has rejected the objection that the execution proceedings initiated by the respondent prematurely is concerned, I do not find any fault in the same as the award was passed on 13.9.2021 and the execution application was filed on 16.12.2021. As per Section 34(3) of the Act of 1996, the limitation for challenging the award is three months, however, any application challenging the award can be entertained by the Court within a further period of thirty days if the person challenging the award is able to show sufficient cause that he was prevented from making the application within a period of three months. The said period of thirty days can be extended by the Court with its discretion, however, the limitation for challenging the award remains three months. As said earlier, the award was passed on 13.9.2021 and the limitation of three months was expired on 12.12.2021, whereas, the execution application was filed on 16.12.2021. \nIn view of the above, the Commercial Court has not committed any illegality in not treating the execution proceedings premature and has rightly rejected the objection raised by the petitioner-firm. \nSo far as the objection of the petitioner-firm to the effect that the award dated 13.9.2021 was not sufficiently stamped is concerned, learned counsel for the petitioner-firm has (17 of 17) [CW-8048/2022] failed to convince this Court that the award was required to be stamped. \nSo far as the judgments, on which, learned counsel for the petitioner-firm has placed reliance are concerned, the facts of the above-referred judgments are quite distinguishable, hence, the same are of no help to the petitioner-firm. \nIn view of the above discussion, I do not find any merit in this writ petition and the same is hereby dismissed. \nStay petition is also dismissed. \n(VIJAY BISHNOI),J ms rathore Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",

by this court dated 2nd march, 2023. the application for review was filed on the ground that this court while disposing of ga 4 of 2022 in cs no. 213 of 2016 dated 2nd march, 2023 held that the commercial courts act, 2015 came into force with effect from 31st december, 2015 but the commercial court were established at calcutta on 20th march, 2020 and thus in terms of section 15 of the commercial courts act, 2015, the suit filed by the plaintiff is required to be transferred to the commercial division. 2. mr. jayanta kumar mitra, learned senior advocate representing the defendant submitted that as per section 1 (3) of the commercial courts act, 2015 is deemed to have been come into force on 23rd october, 2015 but the plaintiff has filed this suit on 18th august, 2016 and thus it could not be regarded that the suit was pending at the time when the commercial courts act, 2015 came into force. 3. mr. mitra, learned senior advocate submitted that by a notification dated 16th july, 2016, the commercial division of this court was constituted and the suit was filed on 18th august, 2016 i.e. subsequent to the constitution of commercial division of this court and thus, it could not be said that the suit filed by the plaintiff was pending at the time when the commercial courts act, 2015 came into force. 4. mr. mitra, learned senior advocate submitted that the

2015. 5. mr. mitra, learned senior advocate submitted that by the notification dated 20th march, 2020, the pecuniary jurisdiction of the commercial court, including commercial division of calcutta

the order dated 2nd march, 2023 has not considered the paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of ga 4 of 2022, the reasons for which the defendant has prayed for rejection/dismissal of the suit filed by the plaintiff. mr. mitra submitted that in ga 4 of 2022, the defendant has sought for the withdrawal of the counter claim for filing at the appropriate forum but no reason is stated in the order dated 2nd march, 2023 while the prayer made by the plaintiff was not allowed. 7. mr. mitra, learned senior advocate submitted that there is a mistake or error apparent on the face of record as the order under review has not considered the relevant order/notification issued under the commercial courts act, 2015. 8. per contra, mr. ishaan saha, learned advocate representing the plaintiff submitted that section 2 (1) (i) of the commercial courts act, 2015 does not provide the specified value itself and it merely prescribes a lower limit below which the specified value to be notified by the central government cannot fall. he submits that section 3 (1a) empowers the government to issue a notification specifying the pecuniary value, which shall be less than rs. 3,00,000/or such higher value for the whole or part of the state, as it may consider necessary. 9. mr. saha submitted that while empowering the state government to notify the specified value, and prescribing the minimum limit, thereof section 3 (1a) also does not proceed to prescribe the specified value, itself, which is left to be fixed at the discretion of the state government upon consultation with the high court. 10. mr. saha submitted that a combined reading of section 2 (1) (i) and section 3 (1a) of the commercial courts act, 2015, it is apparent that no specified value is prescribed in the act itself. the specified value is left to be fixed by the state government at its discretion, by way of delegated legislation. he submitted that the notification 20th march, 2020 is issued in supersession of an earlier notification 15th november, 2018. he further submitted that the commercial courts act, 2015 itself did not prescribe a specified value but only prescribed the floor or lower limit, below, which is the specified value to be notified, could not fall, no specified value existed for the state of west bengal prior to 15th november, 2018. he submitted that the suit was filed on 18th august, 2016, prior to the notification of any specified value for the state of west bengal and remained pending at the time when specified value was notified on 20th march, 2020. 11. mr. saha relied upon the judgment passed by the coordinate bench of this court reported in air 2021 cal 190 (laxmi polyfab private limited -vseden realty ventures private limited) and submitted that section 15 has a terminus by reason of the user of the word \"pending\". the terminus is the date when the specified value is notified. the terminus shifts with the re-working of the specified value or in the other words, in the present case, if the authorities issue a notification stipulating that specified value under the act of 2015 would be rs. 3,00,000/then all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of such specified value pending in high court where there is a commercial division and in any civil court in respect of which a commercial court has been constituted and shall be transferred to the commercial division or the commercial court as the case may be. 12. mr. saha submitted that from a reading of the scheme of the act as a whole it is apparent that though the commercial courts act, 2015 deemed to have been come into force on 23rd october, 2015, the commercial courts and the commercial division of the high court cannot begin to exercise its jurisdiction until the specified value is notified. he submitted that the specified value was notified on 20th march, 2020 and the suit was filed on 18th august, 2016 which is prior to the notification of the specified value and thus the suit filed by the plaintiff is deemed to be a pending suit and thus eligible for transfer under section 15 of the commercial courts act, 2015. 13. considered the submissions made by the respective parties, perused the materials available on record and the judgment relied by the plaintiff. admittedly, the plaintiff had filed the suit before the ordinarily original civil jurisdiction on 18th august, 2016 and the suit is of commercial in nature. in the suit, the defendant had filed an application being ga 4 of 2022 praying for rejection of the plaint and for dismissal of the suit. on the other hand, the plaintiff had filed an application being ga 5 of 2023 for transfer of cs no. 213 of 2016 to the commercial division under section 15 of the commercial courts act, 2015. 14. this court has disposed of both the applications by a common order dated 2nd march, 2023 by passing the following order : \"it is admitted that the suit filed by the plaintiff is commercial in nature and the suit is required to be decided by the commercial court. as per record, the plaintiff has filed the suit on august 18, 2016. the commercial courts act, 2015 came into force with effect from 31st december, 2015 but the commercial courts were established at calcutta only on 20th march, 2020 and thus in terms section 15 of the commercial courts act, 2015, the suit filed by the plaintiff is required to be transferred to the commercial division.\" 15. the main contention of the learned counsel for the defendant that this court while passing the order dated 2nd march, 2023 has committed an error by taking into consideration that the commercial courts act, 2015 came into force with effect from 31st december, 2015 and the commercial court was established at calcutta only on 20th march, 2020 and thus this court was of the view that the suit was pending before this court when the commercial court was established at calcutta as the plaintiff had filed the suit on 18th august, 2016. 16. by a notification dated 16th july, 2016 in exercise of power conferred under section 5 of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high court act, 2015, the hon'ble chief justice has constituted the commercial appellate division of calcutta high court consisting of two hon'ble judges for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on commercial appellate division by the act and in the same notification, in exercise of power conferred under section 4 of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high court act, 2015, the hon'ble chief justice constituted the commercial division of calcutta high court consisting of one hon'ble judge for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and power conferred on the commercial division by the act. 17. after the notification dated 16th july, 2016, the commercial division of this court was inaugurated on 18th september, 2017 and commercial division has started functioning from the 12th march, 2018. on 20th march, 2020, the government of west bengal had issued three notifications in exercise of power conferred by sub section (1) of section 3, under sub section (1a) of section 3 and under sub section (2) of section 3 of the commercial courts act, 2015. in the notification under sub section (1a) of section 3, the pecuniary jurisdiction of the commercial division of the high court is fixed at an amount exceeding rupees rs. 10,00,000/-. 18. section 2 (i) of the act of 2015 describes specified value which reads as follows : \"(i) \"specified value\", in relation to a commercial dispute, shall mean the value of the subject-matter in respect of a suit as determined in accordance with section 12 [which shall not be less than three lakh rupees] rupees or such higher value, as may be notified by the central government.\". before the amendment dated 3rd may, 2018, the specified value was not less than one crore rupees. 19. the transfer provisions of pending suits and applications as has been incorporated in section 15 of the act of 2015, allows two methods of transfer of the pending suits and applications. one method of transfer is a transfer contemplated under sub-section (1), (2) and (3) of section 15 which, the court in seisin of the suit or application transfers such suit or application on a finding that, the dispute involved is a commercial dispute within the meaning of the act of 2015 and is of specified value. the other mode of transfer is on an application of a party to the commercial appellate division of the high court. 20. section 15 of the act of 2015 has to be read along with sections 6 and 7 of the act of 2015. 21. sections 6 and 7 of the act of 2015 are as follows:\"6. jurisdiction of commercial court.--the commercial court shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value arising out of the entire territory of the state over which it has been vested territorial jurisdiction. explanation.--for the purposes of this section, a commercial dispute shall be considered to arise out of the entire territory of the state over which a commercial court has been vested jurisdiction, if the suit or application relating to such commercial dispute has been instituted as per the provisions of sections 16 to 20 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908). 7. jurisdiction of commercial divisions of high courts.--all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value filed in a high court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial 45 division of that high court: provided that all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes, stipulated by an act to lie in a court not inferior to a district court, and filed or pending on the original side of the high court, shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the high court: provided further that all suits and applications transferred to the high court by virtue of sub-section (4) of section 22 of the designs act, 2000 (16 of 2000) or section 104 of the patents act, 1970 (39 of 1970) shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the high court in all the areas over which the high court exercises ordinary original civil jurisdiction.\" 22. sections 6 and 7 of the act of 2015 have vested the commercial court and the commercial division of a high court with jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of specified value. under section 7 of the act of 2015, all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value filed in a high court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the commercial division of the high court. the two provisos to section 7 of the act of 2015 are not material in the instant matters. 23. in the case of laxmi polypab pvt. ltd. (supra), the coordinate bench of this court held that : \"a suit which has been filed subsequent to the notification of the specified value in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court cannot be transferred to the commercial division of the high court by virtue of section 15(1) of the act of 2015. a suit filed subsequent to the notification of the specified value in the ordinary civil jurisdiction of a high court having a commercial division cannot be said to be a \"pending\" suit within the meaning of section 15(1) of the act of 2015. the moment a suit is not \"pending\" in terms of section 15(1) of the act of 2015, the same cannot be transferred to the commercial division by virtue of section 15(1) of the act of 2015. whether or not such a suit can be transferred under section 15(5) of the act of 2015 has not fallen for consideration and therefore, such issue is not answered. 73. despite the absence of power under section 15(1) of the act of 2015 to transfer a suit relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value filed in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court, having a commercial division, to the commercial division of such high court, after such suit being filed subsequently to the specification of the specified value, the court has powers under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 to deal with the same. power under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure 1908 stands regulated by section 15(1) of the act of 2015 so far as pending suits relating to a commercial dispute of the specified value in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court. once the suit has been filed beyond date of the notification of the specified value, order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908, governs the field. 74. in exercise of powers under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908, the court has to return the plaint to be filed before the court having jurisdiction. in the case of a suit relating to a commercial dispute of the specified value filed in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court having a commercial division, filed beyond the date of notification of the specified value, the plaint of such a suit must be returned to the plaintiffs for presentation before the appropriate court, in exercise of powers under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. once the same is done, the plaintiff in such a suit has to file the plaint of such suit in the same high court but in the commercial division of such high court. once the same is done, the question of operation of section 12a of the act of 2015 will arise. 76. a suit transferred under the provisions of section 15 of the act of 2015 has to be considered as the continuation of the old suit now to be tried either in the commercial division or in the commercial court as the case may be. however, a suit involving a commercial dispute and of the specified value filed subsequent to the notification of the specified value has to be transferred to the commercial court or the commercial division as the case may be under the provisions of order vii rule 11 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. such suit when presented before the commercial court or the commercial division has to be treated as a fresh suit in view of the ratio laid down in modern construction and company (supra). 77. the second to the fourth issues that have fallen for consideration can be answered in the manner following: (a) suits involving a commercial dispute filed in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction subsequent to the date of the notification of the specified value are not maintainable in such jurisdiction in view of provisions of section 7 of the act of 2015. 53 (b) in the event, in a suit governed by scenario (a) above, the plaintiff applies for transfer, the same can be granted under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (c) on an order under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 being passed, the plaint has to be returned to the plaintiff to be filed before the appropriate forum. (d) the rigors of section 12 a of the act of 2015 will apply to the suit returned under order vii rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 for it to be instituted before the commercial division on its presentation.\" 24. in the present case, the plaintiff filed the suit on 18th august, 2016 and the claim of the plaintiff is more than one crore. at the time of filing of the suit by a notification dated 16th july, 2016, the commercial division of the calcutta high court was established but the plaintiff has filed the suit in the ordinary original civil jurisdiction instead of commercial division. 25. the contents of the plaintiff that only by way of notification dated 20th march, 2020, the government of west bengal has notified the specified value and thus it cannot be said that the suit is filed prior to the establishment of the commercial division at calcutta. 26. in i.a g.a no. 4 of 2022, the defendant has made the following averments in paragraphs 7, 8,10 and 11 which reads as follows: \"7. it is pertinent to mention that the commercial courts act, 2015 was promulgated on 23rd october, 2015 and the commercial division of this hon'ble court was constituted by notification no. 2810g dated 16th july 2016 by the then hon'ble chief justice of this hon'ble court. the present suit was filed thereafter on 18.08.2016. 8. as per the provision of the commercial courts act, 2015, the commercial division this hon'ble court has the jurisdiction to hear and dispose of all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes the specified value. the valuation of the present suit is over and above the specified value. 10. the petitioner in this case has filed its written statement on december 21, 2018 wherein it has made a counter claim against the plaintiff. the suit being not maintainable and as such counter claim is also being arising out of a commercial dispute the petitioner may be permitted to withdraw such counter claim and file its claims in appropriate forum. 11. in the suit, the plaintiff has obtained an interlocutory decree dated 7th february 2019 passed on an interlocutory application being ga no. 2522 of 2016. copy of the judgment and order dated 7th february, 2019 is annexed hereto and marked with the letter \"b\". the said judgment and decree dated 7th february, 2019 and all orders passed in the present suit be recalled and/or set aside, being without jurisdiction and pending disposal of the present application be stayed.\" 27. by an order dated 7th february, 2019, this court had passed judgment on admission against the defendant. the defendant has preferred an appeal against the said judgment and by an order dated 19th november, 2019, the appellate court had modified the judgment dated 7th february, 2019. the order passed by the appellate court was further modified by an order dated 14th january, 2020. 28. this court while disposing of g.a no. 4 of 2022 and g.a no. 5 of 2023 by an order dated 2nd march, 2023 inadvertently recorded that the commercial courts act, 2015 came into effect from 31st december, 2015 instead of 23rd october, 2015 and this court also inadvertently recorded that commercial courts were established at calcutta on 20th march, 2020 instead on 16th july, 2016 and due to the said observation, this court had transferred the suit filed by the plaintiff from ordinary division to commercial division. this court also finds that the contentions made by the defendant in paragraphs 7, 8, 10 and 11 was not considered consequently no order was passed in terms of prayer (b), (c) and (d) of the said application. 29. considering the above circumstances, this court finds that the order passed by this court dated 2nd march, 2023, was on account of some mistake and the error apparent on the face of record as mention in paragraph 28 (supra), accordingly, common order passed in g.a no. 4 of 2022 and g.a no. 5 of 2023 date 2nd march, 2023 in cs 213 of 2016 is recalled. rvwo 10 of 2023 with ga 1 of 2023 and rvwo 13 of 2023 with ga 1 of 2023 are allowed. 30. commercial court established by notification dated 16th july, 2016 and the suit filed by the plaintiff on 18th august, 2016 that is after the establishment of the commercial court at calcutta. as regard the notification dated 20th march, 2020 that is only with regard to the specified value which the state government has notified in terms of section 3(1a) of the commercial courts act, 2015. as per section 2(i) of the commercial courts act, 2015, the initial specified value was not less than one crore and the suit filed by the plaintiff is more than one crore and thus the notification dated 20th march, 2020 is no way connected with the present case. 31. in view of the above, the suit filed by the plaintiff cannot be transferred to the commercial division of this court as the suit is filed after establishment of commercial division and thus the plaint is returned to the plaintiff to present before the appropriate court in accordance with law. 32. as regard to withdrawal of counter claim of the defendants, the defendant have specifically stated that as the suit is not maintainable before this court and the counter claim filed by the defendant is arising out of the plaint. in para 31 (supra), this court has returned the plaint and thus the defendant is allowed to withdraw the counter claim. 33. plaintiff had obtained judgment on admission by an order dated 7th february, 2019 and subsequently the said order was modified by the hon'ble appellate court. at the time of deciding the said issue, the defendant has not raised the issue with regard to the maintainability of the suit now, this court has decided that the suit cannot be transferred to the commercial division and the plaint is returned to the plaintiff and thus the order dated 7th february, 2019 is recalled. 34. in view of the above prayers (a), (b) and (c) of g.a no. 4 of 2022 in cs 213 of 2016 is allowed and g.a no. 5 of 2023 in cs 213 of 2016 is thus dismissed.
