(Arbitration) 03 of 2020.\n\n    [ 2 ]              The factual context of the case is as under:\n\n              Appellant, M/s. Engineering Projects ( India) Ltd. (Epil for short) ( a\n\n    Government of India Enterprise) signed an agreement in the form of\n\n    Mou with the Department of Agriculture, Government of Tripura on\n\n    15.11.2007 for construction of the College of Agriculture at Lembucherra. \n\n    Appellant split up the entire project into 3 packages for suitably executing\n\n    the work and floated Notice Inviting Tender (Nit for short) for\n\n    construction of the college building at Lembucherra which was in\n\n    package-1. The Nit was so published on 06.02.2008. Respondent, M/s.\n\n    M.P Khaitan, a registered contractor participated in the tender process\n\n    along with other contractors and submitted its tender. The tender\n\n    submitted by the claimant-respondent M/s. M.P. Khaitan having stood the\n\n    lowest, the General Manager, Epil, Kolkata issued a Letter of Intent (Loi\n\n    for short) in favour of the claimant on 10.03.2008. An agreement was\n\n    thereafter executed between the appellant and respondent, M/s. M.P.\n\n    Khaitan on 25.04.2008. The Loi indicated that date of commencement of\n\n    the work would be reckoned from the 10th day of issuance of the Loi. \n\n    The         contract   between    the    parties    which   was    valued    at\n\n    Rs.22,79,80,148.70/- was stipulated to be completed within a period of\n\n    18 months i.e. by 20.09.2009. The different units which were to be\n\n    constructed under package-1 were to be as under:\n\nArb. A. 3 of 2022\n                                        Page - 3 of 15\n\n\n\n              (i) Boys' hostel, (ii) Guest house, (iii) Workshop, (iv) Auditorium,\n\n    (v) Boys' hostel (Pg), (vi) New college building complex with library and\n\n    canteen, (vii) Local shopping complex, (viii) Mini sports stadium, (ix)\n\n    Dispensary building and (x) Garage.\n\n    [3]             Since completion of the work within time depended on the\n\n    performance of the reciprocal obligations, it was agreed upon between\n\n    the parties that the appellant would hand over the dispute free worksite,\n\n    designs and drawings etc. to the claimant-respondent within the\n\n    stipulated time and the appellant would also make timely payment to the\n\n    claimant-respondent as per the agreement. \n\n    [4]             The claimant-respondent started the work in time and\n\n    applied due diligence for execution of the work in time but due to\n\n    frequent interruptions by the appellant, the claimant-respondent could\n\n    not complete the work within the stipulated period of 20.09.2009. By\n\n    20.09.2009, the claimant completed only one unit i.e. the Pg hostel. \n\n    Seven other units were completed on 19.07.2011 at 22 months' delay. \n\n    Even on 19.07.2011, the garage could not be completed due to non-\n\n    availability of proper site. \n\n    [5]             However, after delayed completion of the work, claimant-\n\n    respondent claimed completion certificate from the appellant but the\n\n    appellant, despite series of communications made by the claimant, did\n\n    not issue the certificate in his favour which deprived the claimant-\n\n    respondent of getting higher ranking from Nbcc and Government \n\nArb.

Aggrieved claimant-respondent moved the\n\n    Gauhati High Court by filing a writ petition seeking direction to the\n\n    appellant for issuing completion certificate. Pursuant to the order of the\n\n    High Court, completion certificate was issued to the claimant-respondent. \n\n    [6]             Having   received    the   completion   certificate   from   the\n\n    appellant, claimant raised bill of a sum of Rs.92,74,632/-. Gross value of\n\n    the work was Rs.22,79,80,148.70/-. After deducting the amount already\n\n    paid to him during the execution of the work, claimant raised the bill of\n\n    Rs.92,74,632/- i.e. the balance payable to him.\n\n    [7]             The appellant disputed the claim by raising various\n\n    objections. Claimant-respondent invoked the arbitration clause of the\n\n    agreement for referring the matter to the arbitrator for adjudication. The\n\n    impugned judgment of the Commercial Court indicates that initially one S.\n\n    Roy Chowdhury was appointed as sole arbitrator. The respondent filed his\n\n    claim statement supported by documents before the said arbitrator. The\n\n    arbitrator having resigned on 30.05.2018, the claimant-respondent\n\n    approached this High Court by filing Arb. Petition No.7 of 2018 seeking \n\n    appointment of the arbitrator and the present arbitrator was appointed by \n\n    this Court by an order dated 20.09.2018 . \n\n    [8]             In the course of arbitration, appellant filed counter claim\n\n    before the arbitrator. In its counter claim, appellant contended that\n\n    despite providing all contractual support, claimant-respondent delayed\n\n    the completion of the work. He took 22 months beyond the scheduled\n\nArb. A. 3 of 2022\n                                            Page - 5 of 15\n\n\n\n    date of completion to complete the work. While granting extension, the\n\n    appellant reserved the right to recover damages as per the agreement\n\n    under Clause 72.1 which provided as under:-\n\n                      \"If the contractor fails to maintain the required progress\n                in terms of Clause 72.4 or relevant clause of Acc to complete\n                the work and clear the site on or before the completion date or\n                extended date of completion, he shall, without prejudice to any\n                other right or remedy available under the law to Epi on\n                account of such breach, pay as agreed compensation the\n                amount calculated at the rates stipulated below or such other\n                smaller amount as the Engineer in Charge (whose decision in\n                writing shall be final and binding) may decide on the amount\n                of tendered value of the work for every completed day/week\n                (as applicable) that the progress remains below that specified\n                in Clause 72.4.1 or the relevant clause in Acc or that the work\n                remains incomplete.

A. 3 of 2022 \n                                          Page - 10 of 15\n\n\n                    the respondent, it surfaces that the issue was very specific, inter alia,\n                    that if the respondent is entitled to get balance payment on the value\n                    of work done amounting to Rs.92,74,663/-. The claim statement of\n                    the respondent so laid before the arbitrator as well as the issue so\n                    framed by the arbitrator make it abundantly clear that the interest is\n                    to be calculated on the value of work done . So the argument so raised\n                    by learned advocate for the petitioner stands not sustainable. As\n                    regards the point so raised as to issue No.3, it was contended that the\n                    petitioner did not get the opportunity to cross-examine the\n                    respondent on the documents on the basis of which the relief was\n                    granted. In this regard, we are of the considered opinion that such a\n                    contention nevertheless brings the matter within the mischief of\n                    section 34 of the Arbitration Act. That apart, the petitioner had the\n                    opportunity to make request to the arbitrator in view of section 24 of\n                    the Arbitration Act, but they omits to do so. \n\n                    8.     Now coming to issue No.9, it is apparent on the claim\n                    statement so submitted by the respondent before the arbitrator that\n                    the respondent specifically had claimed damages being suffered\n                    towards payment of insurance charges for car and Wc Policy. It\n                    follows, therefore, the argument so placed by the learned advocate\n                    for the petitioner, inter alia, that the issue No.9 stands beyond the\n                    submission of arbitration cannot be accepted. Moreover, no relief was\n                    granted by the arbitrator while deciding the issue No.9 on the\n                    reasoning that such claim stands beyond the agreement. \n\n                    9.      Similar to that of the issue No.1 the interest @ 10% per\n                    annum so granted by the arbitrator while deciding issue No.16, the\n                    issue itself is very much clear as to the amount on which such interest\n                    is to be calculated. \n\n                    10.     The scheme and scope of the provisions of Section 34 of\n                    Arbitration Act aims at keeping the supervisory roles of the court at\n                    minimum level, therefore, we cannot correct the errors, if any, done\n                    by the arbitrator by sitting as an Appellate Court and also by re-\n                    appreciating the matters on record, it can only be quashed leaving the\n                    parties to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. The contentions\n                    so raised on behalf of the petitioner do not bring the matter within\n                    the mischief of any of the grounds as enumerated in Section 34(2) or\n                    34(2-A) of the Arbitration Act in view of the law as referred to above. \n\n                           In view of the discussion as we had herein-above I order as\n                    follows.\n                                                   Order\n11. In the result, the application for setting aside the arbitral award dated 21.11.2019 made in Arb/2018(2)/Ss by the sole arbitrator Mr. Subhas Sikdar, Retired District Judge stands rejected......\" \n[23] As stated appellant has challenged the said judgment dated 25.2.2022 of the District Court by filing this appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act mainly on the following grounds:\nArb. A. 3 of 2022 Page - 11 of 15 (i) The District Commercial Court did not appreciate the fact that the sole arbitrator in his award dated 21.11.2019 did not specify the amount of award for which the District Commercial Court should have set aside the award.\n(ii) The sole arbitrator while deciding issue No.16 awarded interest on the award, but it was impossible to ascertain the amount of interest since the amount of award was not specified by the learned Arbitrator.\n(iii) The sole arbitrator travelled beyond the terms of the arbitration agreement for which the learned Commercial Court should have dismissed the award of the arbitrator. The arbitrator should have heard the Director of Agriculture for adjudication of the dispute. The learned Commercial Court overlooked this aspect and erroneously dismissed the petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. \n[24] Heard Mr. P. Majumder, learned advocate appearing alongwith Ms. S. Debbarma, learned advocate for the appellant. Also heard Mr. Somik Deb, learned senior advocate appearing alongwith Mr. A. Baran, Ms. R. Chakraborty, Mr. K. Debnath, and Mr. S. Majumder, learned advocates for the respondents. \n[25] Main contention of the appellant is that no amount of award has been specified in the arbitrator's award and as such, the same should Arb. A. 3 of 2022 Page - 12 of 15 have been dismissed by the learned District Judge (District Commercial Court).\n[26] Mr. Somik Deb, learned senior advocate appearing for the respondent on the other hand, contends that the arbitrator's award is well-founded which does not call for any interference. Counsel contends that by a detailed judgment, the District Commercial Court has rejected appellant's petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act and upheld the award made by the sole arbitrator by assigning good reasons. It is contended by Mr. Deb, learned senior counsel that contention of the appellant's counsel that the arbitrator has not specified the amount of award is not acceptable because, the arbitrator has recorded issue-wise findings and specified the amounts as admissible to the claimant- respondent under the various heads. Learned senior counsel, therefore, urges the Court to dismiss the appeal. \n[27] We have gone through the entire facts and circumstances of the case and the materials placed on record and considered the submissions of learned counsel representing the parties. The arbitral award dated 21.01.2019 is placed in file as Annexure-A. We have also gone through the arbitral award. As stated, the sole arbitrator framed as many as 17 issues in the claim of the present respondent and framed 5 issues in the counter claim filed by the present appellant and recorded issue-wise findings in the claim as well as in the counter claim. In his award, the sole Arbitrator seems to have specified the amounts awarded Arb. A. 3 of 2022 Page - 13 of 15 to the claimant-respondent under various heads. The appellant has failed to establish any patent illegality in the arbitral award. Award of the sole arbitrator is based on evidence and the arbitrator appears to have examined each of the issues in detail and assigned sound reasons for deciding those issues. \n[28] It is a settled position of law that the Court cannot sit in appeal and examine correctness of the arbitrator's award on merit. Court can interfere only on limited grounds. In this regard, we can profitably refer to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of McDermott International INC vs. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. and Others reported in (2006) 11 SCC 181 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as under:\n\"58. In Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. this Court laid down that the arbitral award can be set aside if it is contrary to (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; (b) the interests of India; or (c) justice or morality. A narrower meaning to the expression \"public policy\" was given therein by confining judicial review of the arbitral award only on the aforementioned three grounds. An apparent shift can, however, be noticed from the decision of this Court in ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd. (for short \"ONGC\"). This Court therein referred to an earlier decision of this Court in Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. Ltd. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly wherein the applicability of the expression \"public policy\"\non the touchstone of Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act and Article 14 of the Constitution of India came to be considered. This Court therein was dealing with unequal bargaining power of the workmen and the employer and came to the conclusion that any term of the agreement which is patently arbitrary and/or other wise arrived at because of the unequal bargaining power would not only be ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India but also hit by section 23 of the Indian Contract Act. In ONGC this Court, apart from the three grounds stated in Renusagar, added another ground thereto for exercise of the court's jurisdiction in setting aside the award if it is patently arbitrary. \n59. Such patent illegality, however, must go to the root of the matter. The public policy violation, indisputably, should be so unfair and unreasonable as to shock the conscience of the court. Where the arbitrator, however, has gone contrary to or beyond the expressed Arb. A. 3 of 2022 Page - 14 of 15 law of the contract or granted relief in the matter not in dispute would come within the purview of Section 34 of the Act. However, we would consider the applicability of the aforementioned principles while noticing the merits of the matter. \n60. What would constitute public policy is a matter dependant upon the nature of transaction and nature of statute. For the said purpose, the pleadings of the parties and the materials brought on record would be relevant to enable the court to judge what is in public good or public interest, and what would otherwise be injurious to the public good at the relevant point, as contradistinguished from the policy of a particular Government. (See State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nahata.\")\" \n[29] The Apex Court in the case of Associate Builders vs. Delhi Development Authority reported in (2015) 3 SCC 49 reiterated that Court can interfere only when the findings recorded by the arbitrator are arbitrary, capricious, perverse and suffer from patent illegality. Observation of the Hon'ble Apex Court is as under:\n\"33. It must clearly be understood that when a court is applying the \"public policy\" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court of appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. A possible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. Thus an award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be invalid on this score. Once it is found that the arbitrators approach is not arbitrary or capricious, then he is the last word on facts. In P.R. Shah, Shares & Stock Brokers (P) Ltd. v. B.H.H. Securities (P) Ltd., this Court held: (SCC pp. 601-02, para 21) \"21. A court does not sit in appeal over the award of an Arbitral Tribunal by reassessing or reappreciating the evidence. An award can be challenged only under the grounds mentioned in Section 34(2) of the Act. The Arbitral Tribunal has examined the facts and held that both the second respondent and the appellant are liable. The case as put forward by the first respondent has been accepted. Even the minority view was that the second respondent was liable as claimed by the first respondent, but the appellant was not liable only on the ground that the arbitrators appointed by the Stock Exchange under Bye-law 248, in a claim against a non- member, had no jurisdiction to decide a claim against another member. The finding of the majority is that the appellant did the transaction in the name of the second respondent and is therefore, liable along with the second respondent. Therefore, in the absence of any Arb. A. 3 of 2022 Page - 15 of 15 ground under Section 34(2) of the Act, it is not possible to re-examine the facts to find out whether a different decision can be arrived at.\" \n[30] Having applied the tests laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court to the case in hand, we are of the considered view that the arbitral award impugned before us, does not call for any interference. The District Commercial Court has rightly rejected appellant's petition for setting aside the arbitral award. Resultantly, the appeal stands dismissed. \nIn terms of the above, the case is disposed of. \nPending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of. (S.G.

\"cpc\") claiming following relief:\"a. transfer the commercial trademark civil suit no. 35 of 2021 titled as sarine technologies ltd. vs. diyora and bhanderi corporation & ors., pending in the court

expeditiously, preferably within three (3) months; d. pass any such other order(s) that this hon'ble court deems fit in the facts and circumstances of the present case.\" 3. the background of the case is that commercial trademark suit no.35 of 2021 was filed by the petitioner before the commercial court at surat seeking inter alia relief of permanent and mandatory injunction, rendition of accounts, damages and other and further direction under the provisions of the copy right act, 1957 against the respondents original defendants to prevent infringement of its valid and subsisting copyright in the advisor software/computer programme by the respondents. the advisor software /computer programme is a rough diamond and gemstone planning software, the objective of which is to generate an optimal planning and polishing plan for processing rough diamonds so that maximum value can be taken from the rough diamonds. according to the petitioner, the respondents used the infringing copies of the advisor software of the petitioner and neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined therefore, the above commercial trademark suit came to be filed. 4. during the pendency

24.11.2020 and directed the learned commercial court to decide the matter expeditiously. 5. in background of the above facts, the petitioner would claim that the learned commercial judge at surat (mr. vivek n. mapara) has fixed the schedule for expeditious trial and hearing of the commercial trademark suit as per the provisions of the commercial courts act. it is further the case of the petitioner that learned commercial judge mr. vivek n. mapara has invested sufficient and valuable time in recording the evidence tendered by both the parties, which by itself, of peculiar nature considering the issue of infringement and copyright of the software involved in the commercial trademark suit. learned judge mr. vivek n. mapara, who was presiding at commercial court, surat, is transferred to commercial court, city civil court, ahmedabad before delivering judgment in the commercial trademark suit. therefore, the petitioner approaches this court to transfer the proceedings of the aforementioned commercial trademark suit to the learned commercial court, city civil court, ahmedabad. 6. heard learned senior counsel mr. shalin mehta assisted neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined by learned advocates mr. ishwen upneja, ms. pooja dhruve, ms. dhwani lakhani for ortis law offices for the petitioner and learned senior counsel mr. sn soparkar assisted by learned advocates mr. tarun khurana, mr. rajat sabu, mr. jwalit soneji for the respondents. 7. learned senior counsel mr. shalin mehta would submit that this is a unique case. in the commercial trademark suit, the petitioner claimed infringement and copyright of the advisor software against the respondents. he would further submit that to understand the issue involved in the suit, the comparison of source code and object code are to be illustrated. he would further submit that the typical kind of evidence has been led before learned commercial judge mr. vivek m. mapara, when he was posted as learned commercial court, surat. both the parties have invested valuable time and energy before learned judge mr. vivek mapara to adjudicate the issue. he would further submit that since the matter was part heard by the learned judge mr. vivek mapara and since entire evidence of both the parties is recorded while he was presiding the commercial court at surat, it is necessary that learned judge mr. vivek mapara decide the dispute between the parties. 7.1 learned senior counsel mr. shalin mehta would further submit that in fact, the argument in the case has run for more than 30 days, which indicates that sufficient and valuable time has been devoted by learned judge mr. vivek mapara as the entire evidence is recorded while he was presiding the commercial court, surat and upon such evidence, elaborate neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined argument has been made before him. thus, he has sufficient understanding of the technicality and complexity involved in the matter and therefore, considering this peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, he would submit to transfer the commercial trademark suit from the learned commercial court, surat to learned judge mr. vivek mapara, who is presently posted as commercial judge, city civil court, ahmedabad. 7.2 learned senior counsel mr. shalin mehta would further submit that on earlier point of time, the respondents herein had given unequivocal consent and submitted no objection in transferring the commercial trademark suit to learned judge mr. vivek mapara, who is presently posted as commercial judge, city civil court, ahmedabad. therefore now, they cannot aback from the consent they have made before the court. he would further submit that the respondents cannot play game of chase. the respondents, who have categorically stated before the court (before coordinate bench) that they have no objection in transferring the commercial trademark suit, cannot withdraw their consent. 7.3 to buttress his submission, learned senior counsel mr. shalin mehta has relied upon following judgments:(1) advance magazine publishers inc. vs. bombay rayon fashions ltd and others reported in 2021 air cc 283 (2) smt. mv rekha vs. sri sathya @ suraj, ilr 2010 kar neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined 7.4 on above submissions, learned senior counsel mr. shalin mehta urges to allow the petition and to grant the relief. 8. per contra, learned senior counsel mr. sn soparkar for the respondents would submit that even if both the parties give consent in transferring the matter from one court to another court, that will not confer jurisdiction upon the concerned court to transfer the matter from one court to another court. he would further submit that the consent given by the respondents in the matter to transfer the suit from commercial court, surat to learned commercial judge mr. vivek m. mapara, city civil court, ahmedabad is insignificant and irrelevant. he would further submit that when the court is hearing the matter u/s 24 of the cpc, the court is required to record and satisfy the reason for transfer of the matter from one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction. he would further submit that in the present case, the petitioner has not shown any apprehension that he will not get justice from learned judge, presently presiding over commercial court at surat and in that fact, the court cannot readily infer with the issue of territorial jurisdiction of the learned commercial court, surat. he would further submit that the court should refer to principle of inconvenience rather refer to rule of convenience while deciding the matter u/s 24 of the cpc. he would further submit that in the present case, the petitioner has not displayed inconvenience that he might not get justice in conducting the case at learned commercial court, surat. neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined 8.1 learned senior counsel mr. soparkar would also contend that investing valuable time or efforts by the party in a suit is of no mean and reason to transfer the suit from one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction. pointing towards relief claimed by the petitioner, he would submit that instead of asking for transfer of the suit from one court to another court, the petitioner has asked to transfer the commercial trademark suit from one court to the judge, which is not permissible u/s 24 of the cpc. 8.2 learned senior counsel mr. soparkar would further submit that there are several suits where peculiar issues are involved. so upon that consideration, it cannot be prayed that since in the particular suit i.e. commercial trademark suit in the present case, involved scientific, technical and complex issues, it can only be understood by learned judge mr. vivek n. mapara. he would submit that the judge, who is now posted as commercial judge, commercial court, city civil court, ahmedabad has not shown unwillingness to conduct the matter and has not expressed that he would not understand the technicality and complexity of the issue involved in the matter. thus, he would submit that the ground canvassed by the petitioner does not help him in getting the relief. he would submit that sufficient time may have been consumed before the concerned judge, but again that is not a ground to transfer the commercial trademark suit from one court to a particular judge. 8.3 learned senior counsel mr. soparkar would further submit that if that hypothesis propounded by the petitioner is neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined accepted, then it will set a bad precedent. referring to para 19 and 20 of the petition, learned senior counsel mr. soparkar submits that according to pleadings of the petitioner, the arguments in the commercial trademark suit were concluded on 23.5.2022, thereafter, learned judge mr. vivek mapara has directed the parties to file their written submission, the written submissions were also filed on 8.7.2022 and thereafter, the matter was reserved for pronouncement of judgment. he would submit that practically, the matter was reserved for judgment on 23.5.2022 or it can be said that it was reserved for judgment on 8.7.2022 when written submission was filed by both the parties. pointing towards the averments made in para 20 of the petition, he would further submit that though subsequent thereto, an application was filed by the income tax department on 6.9.2022 and it was decided on 4.1.2023, practically, the final arguments of the commercial trademark suit were heard on 23.5.2022 by learned judge mr. vivek mapara, in which, written submission is filed on 8.7.2022, but did not pass the judgment till he transferred. 8.4 learned senior counsel mr. soparkar would further submit that on 22.5.2023, due to general transfer of the judges took place in the state of gujarat, learned judge mr. vivek mapara was transferred from commercial court, surat to the commercial court at ahmedabad. in these circumstances, on 19.5.2023, learned judge mr. vivek mapara passed the judicial order that \"let the matter to be heard again\", means, he has released the the matter from delivering the judgment. it is submitted that practically, the commercial trademark suit was neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined pending for judgment before learned judge mr. vivek mapara for almost a year and he has not delivered the judgment within a span of one year, but thereafter, when he was transferred, he has released the matter and put the matter to the stage of fresh hearing. 8.5 learned senior counsel mr. soparkar would submit that in case of anil rai vs. state of bihar reported in (2001) 7 scc 318, it is observed that if the judgment is not pronounced within a period of six months, it should be placed before another bench for fresh arguments. he would further submit that this judgment has been followed by the hon'ble apex court in recent judgment in case of umesh rai vs. state of u.p. rendered in criminal appeal no.1518 of 2023. this submission was canvassed to contend that since for more than a year, learned judge mr. vivek mapara has not delivered the judgment (after hearing the arguments) in the matter, the matter was required to be heard afresh by any other judge. he would submit that the functional inconvenience of the parties cannot determine exercise of jurisdiction of the court. he would submit that there is no peculiar circumstance established by the petitioner which may compel this court to exercise jurisdiction u/s 24 of the cpc. he would submit that it is not a peculiar case, where it could be said that only learned judge mr. vivek mapara could understand the technicality and complexity of the issues involved in the commercial trademark suit. 8.6 to buttress his submission, he has relied upon following judgments:neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined 1. mahabir prasad singh vs. jacks aviation pvt. ltd. reported in (1999) 1 scc 37. 2. m/s fumo chem pvt. ltd. vs. m/s raj process equipments and systems pvt. ltd. and others rendered in transfer petition (civil) no.755 of 2021. 8.7 upon above submissions, learned senior counsel mr. soparkar prays to dismiss the petition. 9. in reply, learned senior counsel mr. shalin mehta reiterated his submission canvassed earlier to submit that both the parties have invested sufficient amount, time and skill in adjudicating the commercial trademark suit before learned commercial judge mr. vivek m. mapara and therefore, it is expedient for both the parties to get the decision from the concerned judge mr. vivek n. mapara. 10. having heard learned advocates for both the sides and applying anxious thoughts to issue canvassed, at the outset, let refer section 24(1) of the cpc, which reads as under:\"(1) on the application of any of the parties and after notice to the parties and after hearing such of them as desired to be heard, or of its own motion without such notice, the high court or the district court may at any stage(a) transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same, or (b) withdraw any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending in any court subordinate to it, and (i) try or dispose of the same; or neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined (ii) transfer the same for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same; or (iii) retransfer the same for trial or disposal to the court from which it was withdrawn.\" 11. section 24 of the code empowers the high court or a district court to transfer inter alia any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it or in any court subordinate to it to any other court for trial and disposal. the said provisions confers comprehensive power on the court to transfer suits, appeals or other proceedings \"at any stage\" either on an application by any party or suo motu. although it is discretionary power to transfer cases, it cannot be wielded indiscriminately with straitjacket or cast-iron formula and made unanimously applicable to each, but all situations. it cannot be gainsaid that the power to transfer a case must be exercised with due care, caution and circumspection. 12. in case of kulwinder v kandi friends education, reported in (2008) 3 scc 659, the hon'ble apex court put the answer to the question that what are the grounds which could be considered for transfer of case from one court to another. the relevant observations are as under:\"reading sections 24 and 25 of the code together and keeping in view various judicial pronouncements, certain broad propositions as to what may constitute a ground for transfer have been laid down by courts. they are balance of convenience or inconvenience to the plaintiff or the defendant or witness; convenience or inconvenience of a particular place of trial having regard to the nature of evidence on the points involved in the suit: issues raised by the parties; reasonable apprehension in the mind of the litigant that he might not get justice in the court in which the suit is pending; important questions of law involved or a considerable neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined section of public interested in the litigation; interest of justice demanding for transfer of suit, appeal or other proceedingetc. above are some of the instances which are germane in considering the question of transfer of a suit, appeal or other proceeding. they are, however, illustrative in nature and by no means be treated as exhaustive. if on the above or other relevant considerations, the court feels that the plaintiff or the defendant is not likely to have a fair trial in the court from which he seeks to transfer a case, it is not only the power, but the duty of the court to make such order.\" 13. in case of maneka sanjoy gandhi v rani jethmalani reported in (1979) 4 scc 167, the hon'ble apex court stipulated the grounds generally available for the transfer of the case, which may put in the forefront, which reads as under:\"\"assurance of fair trial is the first imperative of the dispensation of justice and the central criterion for the court to consider when a motion for transfer is made is not the hypersensitivity or relative convenience of a party or easy availability of legal services or like mini grievances. something more substantial, more compelling, more imperilingfrom the point of view of public justice and its attendant environment, is necessitous if the court is to exercise its power of transfer. this is the cardinal principle although the circumstances may be myriad and vary from case to case.\" 14. it is not the case of the petitioner that he has apprehension that he will not get fair and impartial justice from the judge, who is presently posted at commercial court, surat. even, it is not pleaded by the petitioner that it is inconvenient for the petitioner or the respondents to attend the court proceedings at commercial court, surat for deciding the matter. the eccentric line, which was espoused by the petitioner for seeking transfer of the suit is that learned judge mr. vivek mapara, who was posted as commercial judge, surat at the relevant time, is acquainted with the technicality and complexity of the case, as pleadings are completed before him, issues are framed by him and all evidence neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined are recorded when he was presiding the matter as well as arguments of the case are comprehensively made to him and therefore, the suit should chase him from the commercial court, surat to commercial court, ahmedabad, where he is posted as commercial judge. this is something unusual urge. 15. to be noted that every year, in general transfer, in subordinate courts, several judges are transferred from one place to another place, they may have recorded the evidence in case, they may have heard the arguments in the case and they may reserve the matter for judgment before they transferred from one place to another place. they may have invested sufficient time and efforts in one or other cases. if the proposition canvassed by learned advocate mr. shalin mehta is considered, then on every general transfer of the judges in subordinate courts, the matters, which they have heard or recorded the evidence at a particular place are, to be transferred from that place to the place where particular judge is transferred. 16. what emerges that it is a freakish request. the matter cannot chase a judge until well settled grounds to transfer the case are available. section 24 of the cpc permits transfer of case from one court to another court, but not from one court to another judge. the pleading of the petitioner suggests that the argument in the matter was concluded on 23.5.2022, written submissions are tendered on 8.7.2022, the matter was kept for judgment since then. of course, during the interregnum period, an application was filed by the income tax department on neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined 6.9.2022 and which came to be decided on 4.1.2023. but it does not mean that matter has been altered from the stage of final argument to some other stage. the income tax department was a third party to the commercial trademark suit and seeking some order from the court, but it is not the case of the petitioner that final argument was canvassed again after 23.5.2022 or 8.7.2022. it also appears that learned judge. mr vivek mapara has not pronounced the judgment till he remains in charge of commercial judge surat. meaning, thereby, learned judge, mr vivek mapara has not pronounced the judgment until his transfer took place w.e.f. 22.5.2023 to the commercial court at ahmedabad. it is pertinent to note that on 19.5.2023, learned judge, mr vivek mapara has passed an order that let the matter be heard again. this order has not been challenged by the petitioner. 17. a strange contention was made before the court that since the respondents have made no objection for transferring the commercial trademark suit from the commercial court, surat to the court of learned judge mr. vivek mapara presently posted as commercial judge, city civil court, ahmedabad and therefore, the respondents cannot aback from their promise. to be noted that the court is not required to exercise power under section 24 of the cpc on promise of the party. principal of fair trial is one of pivotal considerations for the court to exercise the power of transfer the proceedings to appropriate court. 18. as observed by the hon'ble apex court in case of mahabir prasad singh (supra), change of the court is not allowable mere neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined because parties have no objection for such change. the relevant observations of the hon'ble apex court reads as under:\"sri arun jaitley, learned senior counsel, made a plea before us that in view of all what happened and also in the light of the fact that appellant too has no objection to change the court, the case may be allowed to be transferred to another court. we have considered the aforesaid plea in all seriousness. we do not come across any valid ground whatsoever for a change of court. a change of court is not allowable merely because the other side too has no objection for such change. or else, it would mean that when both parties combine together they can avoid a court and get a court of their own choice. we are not disposed to give such an option to the parties. we, therefore, refrain from acceding to the said plea made by sri jaitley.\" 19. in view of this, finding, the contention that the respondents once have consented in transferring the commercial trademark suit from the commercial court, surat to the court of learned judge mr. vivek mapara presently posted as commercial judge, city civil court, ahmedabad, the court is required to pass necessary orders for transferring the suit, cannot be acceded to. 20. at the cost of the repetition, it can be said that transfer of the matter can be made to ensure the fair trial to the party. convenience of the parties may not be enough ground to exercise the power. the party seeking transfer of the matter in the chosen forum, has to establish that forum in which particular matter is pending, will result in denial of justice. at this juncture, useful reference can be made to the judgment of dav boys senior secondary school and others vs. dav college managing committee reported in (2010) 8 scc 401, more particularly, para 12, which reads as under:\"12. section 25 of the code itself makes it clear that if any application is made for transfer, after notice to the parties, if the court is satisfied that an order of transfer is expedient for the ends of justice necessary direction may be issued for transfer of neutral citation c/mca/1177/2023 cav judgment dated: 10/10/2023 undefined any suit, appeal or other proceedings from a high court or other civil court in one state to another high court or other civil court in any other state. in order to maintain fair trial, this court can exercise this power and transfer the proceedings to an appropriate court. the mere convenience of the parties may not be enough for the exercise of power but it must also be shown that trial in the chosen forum will result in denial of justice. further illustrations are, balance of convenience or inconvenience to the plaintiff or the defendant or witnesses and reasonable apprehension in the mind of the litigant that he might not get justice in the court in which suit is pending. the above-mentioned instances are only illustrative in nature. in the interest of justice and to adherence of fair trial, this court exercises its discretion and order transfer in a suit or appeal or other proceedings.\" 21. in so far is the judgment in case of advance magazine (supra), upon which learned senior counsel mr. shalin mehta relied upon, it stands on its own footing and facts and does not avail any assistance to the petitioner. 22. insofar as judgment relied upon in case of smt. m.v. rekha (supra) is concerned, in this case, it was an issue of transfer of family suit on convenience of the wife. so this judgment does not render any assistance to the petitioner as the issue involved in that matter pertains to the matrimonial dispute, where conveniency of the wife is taken into consideration. 23. for the foregoing reasons, the petition sans merit and is accordingly dismissed. rule discharged.
