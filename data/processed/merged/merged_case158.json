This letters patent appeal has been filed against judgment dated 30th November 2022 passed by learned writ Court in W.P.(C) No. 2638 of 2020 whereby the writ petition has been dismissed. \n3. The writ petition was filed on 09.09.2020 under Article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging the order dated 31 st January 2020 passed by the learned Presiding Officer, Commercial Court, Ranchi in Commercial Revocation (Arbitration) Case No. 04 of 2019 whereby the petition for setting aside the arbitral award filed under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for the sake of brevity herein after referred as the \"Arbitration Act\") has been dismissed.\n4. The arbitral award dated 18.05.2012 was passed by the Facilitation Council (for the sake of brevity herein after referred as Council) constituted under The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 (for the sake of brevity herein after referred as \"the Msmed Act\"). \n5. In the year 2008, the appellant published a tender for supply of battery backup online Ups with isolated transformer.

It is the case of the appellant that the respondent installed and commissioned 282 Ups and did not install and commission of 10+12 (total 22) Ups. It is their further case that some Ups were non- functional which the respondent did not repair/replace/maintain in spite of request by the appellant. The appellant invoked arbitration clause. \n6. The respondent moved before the Facilitation Council, Jharkhand for outstanding claim of Rs.39,34,112/- on account of delayed payment and interest including, interalia, non-payment for 22 Ups valued at Rs.8,83,861/-.

After expiry of the period of limitation to challenge the award, the appellant filed writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India on 07.11. 2012 being Wpc No. 6876/2012 alleging violation of principles of natural justice which was dismissed vide order dated 29.04.2013 by holding that on facts appellant failed to establish that the order has been passed without notice or adequate opportunity of hearing. It was also held that the writ petition was filed after expiry of the period of limitation to challenge the award. The appellant filed Letters Patent Appeal being Lpa no. 200/2013 against the order dt. 29.4.13 passed in W.P.(C) No. 6876/2012 which was disposed of on 25.03.2014 with  liberty and observations to move under section 34 of the Arbitration Act read with section 19 of the MSMED Act before the Competent Trial Court. \n8. Pursuant to the order of LPA, the appellant filed the application under section 34 of the Arbitration Act before the Sub-Judge I, Ranchi being Misc. Case No. 11 of 2014 for setting aside the Arbitral Award dated 18.5.2012 passed by the Facilitation Council which was subsequently transferred to Commercial Court, Ranchi and was registered as Commercial Revocation (Arbitration) Case No. 04/2019. The preliminary objection filed by the Respondent before the learned Court below was dismissed vide order dated 25.07.2015 which was challenged in a writ petition being WPC No. 5988 of 2015 and was dismissed vide order dated 06.12.2018. The letters Patent Appeal being L.P.A. No. 124 of 2019 against the order dated 06.12.2018 was allowed vide order dated 06.12.2019 by referring to the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court Simplex Infrastructure Limited Vs. Union of India (2019) 2 SCC 455 and liberty was given to the respondent to agitate the issue of limitation before the learned Court below. The said Commercial Revocation (Arbitration) Case No. 04/2019 was dismissed vide judgment dt. 31.1.2020 on the ground that the application filed under section 34 was barred by limitation. \n9. The perusal of the writ record shows that on 27.02.2020 the appellant applied for certified copy of the order dated 31.01.2020 passed in Commercial Revocation (Arbitration) Case No. 04/2019. The certified copy was made available to the appellant on 29th February 2020. On 09th September 2020, the appellant filed writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India being WPC no. 2638/2020 challenging: the Judgment dt. 31.1.2020 passed in Commercial Revocation (Arbitration) Case No. 04/2019 rejecting the petition filed under section 34 of the Arbitration Act as barred by Limitation. Vide affidavit dated 19.09.2022, appellant filed petition seeking amendment of the writ petition being I.A No. 8887 of 2022 challenging the Arbitral Award dt. 18.5.12 on the ground that the award has been passed by a Panel of 9 Arbitrators and such panel was contrary to section 21 of the MSMED Act and while explaining the delay in challenging the award on such ground it has been stated that the appellant had applied for Certified Copy of the Entire Order Sheet of CASE NO. JHSEFC 07/11 vide application dt. 23.8.22 and same was supplied on 14.9.22 manifesting for the first time that award has been rendered by 9 members. The writ petition was dismissed on 30th November 2022 by the impugned order and the aforesaid I.A No. 8887 of 2022 along with other pending I.As were closed. With regard to the challenge of the arbitral award, the present proceedings is the second round of writ petition. \n10. The appellant did not file any appeal under section 37 of the Arbitration Act against the order impugned in the writ proceedings. The appellant further challenged the award alleging it to be nullity by filing a petition for amendment of the writ petition. \nArguments of the Appellant 11. The learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the arbitral award involved in the present case is a nullity in the eyes of law as the constitution of arbitral tribunal was contrary to and in direct conflict with section 21 of the MSMED Act. \n12. It has been submitted that the arbitral tribunal constituted under Jharkhand Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Rules, 2007 (for the sake of brevity herein after referred as \"Rules of 2007\") and the Rules of 2007 were contrary to section 21 of the MSMED Act. As per section 21, the minimum number of members of Council could be 3 and maximum member could be 5 but as per the Rules of 2007, the minimum member of Council could be 5 and maximum member could be 9. He submits that the position was rectified vide new rules framed in the year 2017 which was brought in consonance with the provisions of section 21 of the MSMED Act. \n13. He submits that the award was challenged by filing Interlocutory Application under Article 226 of the Constitution of India being I.A. No. 8887 of 2022 and consequently, the award as well as the order rejecting petition under section 34 of the Arbitration Act were under challenge in the writ proceedings.\n14. He submits that the award being a nullity, the rejection of the petition filed under section 34 of the Arbitration Act dated 31.01.2020 by the Presiding officer, Commercial Court, Ranchi on the ground of limitation and also the award dated 18.05.2012 ought to have set-aside by the learned writ Court. \n15. The learned counsel submits that the learned writ Court was not justified in refusing to interfere with the award on the ground that the challenge to the award under section 34 of the Arbitration Act was rejected being barred by limitation. \n16. The only question which has been raised by the learned counsel for the appellant to challenge the order dated 31.01.2020 passed by learned Presiding Officer, Commercial Court, Ranchi rejecting the petition filed under section 34 of the Arbitration Act and, in turn, the award dated 18th May 2012/19th June 2012 delivered by the Jharkhand Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council is- Whether the award dated 18th May 2012/19th June 2012 delivered by the Facilitation Council constituting 9 members has been rendered a nullity on account of improper constitution of the Facilitation Council, contrary to section 21 of the MSMED, Act? \n17 . In support of his submission, the learned counsel has relied on a judgment by a Division Bench of this Court delivered in \"Heavy Engineering Corporation Ltd. Vs. State of Jharkhand and others\"\n2022 SCC OnLine Jhar 843 which has followed the earlier judgement passed by Division Bench of this Court in the case of Electrosteel Steels Ltd. Vs. State of Jharkhand and others passed in W.P.(C) No. 3699 of 2015 & analogous cases. \n18 . The learned counsel has also relied on the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gujarat State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited Vs. Mahakali Foods Private Limited and another (2023) 6 SCC 401, to submit that section 16 of the Arbitration Act has no applicability to the arbitral proceedings by the Facilitation Council constituted under the MSMED Act. He submits that it has been held that the MSMED Act will have over-riding effect on the Arbitration Act. \n19. On behalf of the appellant the following judgements have been relied on: -\ni. The judgment passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in Gujarat State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited Vs. Mahakali Foods Private Limited and another (2023) 6 SCC 401, paragraph nos. 38 to 40, to submit that the Facilitation Council is a statutory forum and a special procedure has been prescribed to be followed after reference is made to it by any party to the dispute as per section 24 of the MSMED Act, 2006, the provisions of sections 16 to 23 have an effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being enforce. The MSMED Act, 2006 and the provisions of sections 15 to 23 are special law and overrides the general law of Arbitration Act and also overrides on the ground of subsequent legislation. ii. Judgement passed in Electrosteel Steels Ltd. Vs. State of Jharkhand and others passed in W.P.(C) No. 3699 of 2015 & analogous cases paragraph nos. 24 and 26, to submit that Rule 4 of JMSMEFC Rules, 2007 declared ultra-virus to section 21 of the MSMED Act, 2006. Rule 4 provided Constitution of Council of members not less than five and not more than nine which was contrary to the composition under section 21 of the Act, 2006. He has further referred to the judgment reported in Heavy Engineering Corporation Ltd. Vs. State of Jharkhand and others 2022 SCC OnLine Jhar 843 paragraph nos. 26, 40, 43, 44, 48 and 49, to submit that the Constitution/Coram of the Facilitation Council contrary to the mandate of section 21 of the MSMED Act, 2006 lacks inherent jurisdiction, which goes to the root of the authority to pass an award and thus is rendered without jurisdiction, non-est and void-ab-initio. iii. Judgment of Balvant N. Viswamitra and others Vs. Yadav Sadashiv Mule (Dead) through Lrs.\" (2004) 8 SCC 706 paragraph nos. 9 to 14, to submit that it was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that where Court lacks inherent jurisdiction in passing decree or order then such decree or order would be rendered without jurisdiction non-est, void- ab-initio as the same strikes at the very authority to the Court to pass any decree and invalidity and nullity could be set-up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied on.\niv . Judgment reported in Sarup Singh & another Vs. Union of India and another (2011) 11 SCC 198 paragraph nos. 20, 22, 23 and 24, to submit that a decree which is a nullity or Tribunal of a limited jurisdiction erroneously assumes jurisdiction by ignoring statutory provision then its decision is a nullity and can be set-up in collateral proceeding as well. A defect of jurisdiction which goes to the root of the matter and strikes at the very authority of Court to pass a decree is basic and fundamental and such validity can be challenged at any stage, even in execution or collateral proceedings. \nv. Judgement reported in Lion Engineering Consultants Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and others (2018) 16 SCC 758 paragraph nos. 5 to 7, to submit that it has been held that the observations in paras 16 and 17 of MSP Infrastructure Ltd. Vs. MP Road Development Corporation Ltd. (2015) 13 SCC 713 do not lay down correct law and thus the decision rendered in MSP Infrastructure Ltd, especially paragraph nos. 16 and 17 thereof, has been overruled.\nvi. Judgment reported in Jogendrasinhji Vijaysinghji Vs. State of Gujarat & others (2015) 9 SCC 1 paragraph no.30, to submit that the maintainability of Letters Patent Appeal would depend upon pleadings in writ petition, nature and character of order passed by Hon'ble Single Judge, the type of direction issued having regard to jurisdiction perspectives in Constitutional context. Thus, it cannot be said that a writ can only lie only under Art. 227 of Constitution from orders of Tribunal as orders passed by learned Single Judge can be construed as an order under both Articles 226 and 227 or only under Article 226 and it would depend upon nature, contour and character of order. vii. Judgment reported in Shakti Tubes Ltd. Vs. State of Bihar and others (2009) 1 SCC 786 paragraph nos. 2, 19 to 23, to submit that it has been held that the provisions of section 14 of the Limitation Act have been held to be applicable in a proceeding arising under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and writ remedy under Article 226 of Constitution of India would fall within the purport of words employed \"other cause of like nature\" under section 14 of the Limitation Act. \n20. The learned counsel submits that the award passed by the Facilitation Council as well as the order of the Commercial Court rejecting the petition filed under section 34 of the Arbitration Act be set- aside. \nArguments of the Respondent 21. Mr. Vikas Pandey, the learned counsel submits that it is well settled that arbitral tribunal is competent to rule on its own jurisdiction as contemplated under section 16 of the Arbitration Act. The said principal will apply on Institutional Arbitration including the Facilitation Council under MSME Act. The Facilitation Council has all powers to decide the disputes referred to it as if such arbitration was in pursuance of the arbitration agreement referred to in sub-section (1) of section 7 the Arbitration Act and all the trappings of the Arbitration Act applies to such arbitration by the Facilitation Council acting an arbitral tribunal and such tribunal would also be competent to rule on its own jurisdiction like any other arbitral tribunal appointed under the Arbitration Act as contemplated under section 16 of the said Act. It is submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgement reported in (2023) 6 SCC 401 (supra) and relied on by the appellant also, has held in paragraph no. 48, that the Facilitation Council is the arbitral tribunal constituted under section 7(1) of the Arbitration Act and section 16 of the Arbitration Act would apply. \n22. It is submitted that challenge to Composition of Tribunal could have been raised by the appellant before the Facilitation Council but despite notice the appellant did not appear before the Facilitation Council. The challenge to Composition of Tribunal is well within the scope of section 16 which is evident from the Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Limited versus Bhadra Projects (2018) 2 SCC 534 wherein it has been held in paragraph no. 20 that jurisdiction mentioned in section 16 of the Arbitration Act has reference to three things including, whether the arbitral tribunal is properly constituted. \n23. Therefore, it is deemed that the appellant waived its right to challenge the constitution of the arbitral tribunal i.e the Facilitation Council, hence the appellant is not entitled to any relief under Writ Jurisdiction, that too when the time to challenge the Award under section 34 of the Arbitration Act had already expired well before filing of the First Writ Petition being W.P.(C) No. 6876 of 2012 arising out of the same award. \n24. The learned counsel has relied on the following judgements:\n(i) The Union of India and another vs. Ekta Telecommunication System & others dated 29.04.2013 passed in W.P.(C) No. 6876 of 2012 in the case arising out of the same award involved in this case.\n(ii) P. Bandopadhya and others Vs. Union of India and others (2019) 13 SCC 42 (iii) Balvant N. Viswamitra and others Vs. Yadav Sadashiv Mule (Dead) through Lrs. and others (2004) 8 SCC 706, paragraph nos. 19 and 20.\n(iv) Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Limited Vs. Bhadra Products (2018) 2 SCC 534, paragraph no. 20.\n(v) Narayan Prasad Lohia Vs. Nikunj Kumar Lohia and others (2002) 3 SCC 572. \n(vi) Quippo Construction Equipment Limited Vs. Janardan Nirman Private Limited (2020) 18 SCC 277 (vii) Bhaven Construction Vs. Executive Engineer, Sadar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited and another (2022) 1 SCC 75 (viii) Simplex Infrastructure Limited Vs. Union of India (2019) 2 SCC 455, paragraph no. 18. \n(ix) GPT Infra Projects Limited Vs. M/s. Miki Wire Works Pvt.\nLtd. passed by Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in C.O. 1078 of 2019. \nFindings of this Court 25. The sequence of events has already been given in paragraph no. 5 of this judgement. \n1st point which arises for consideration is as to whether section 16 of the Arbitration Act has any applicability to the arbitral proceedings before the Facilitation Council constituted under the MSMED Act. \n26. It has been argued by the appellant that Section 16 of the Arbitration Act does not apply and on the other hand the respondent has argued that section 16 of the Arbitration Act is applicable to the arbitral proceedings before the Facilitation Council constituted under the MSMED Act. Both the parties have relied on the recent judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gujarat State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited Vs. Mahakali Foods Private Limited and another (2023) 6 SCC 401 which specifically deals with arbitral proceedings before the Facilitation Council under the MSMED Act. \n27. While interpreting section 16 of the Arbitration Act, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Limited versus Bhadra Projects (2018) 2 SCC 534, it has been held in paragraph no. 20 of the judgement that jurisdiction mentioned in section 16 of the Arbitration Act has reference to three issues related to jurisdiction. Paragraph no. 20 of the judgment is quoted as under: -\n\"20. These sections make it clear that the Kompetenz principle, which is also followed by the English Arbitration Act of 1996, is that the \"jurisdiction\" mentioned in Section 16 has reference to three things: (1) as to whether there is the existence of a valid arbitration agreement; (2) whether the arbitral tribunal is properly constituted; and (3) matters submitted to arbitration should be in accordance with the arbitration agreement.\" (emphasis supplied) \n28. In the judgement of Gujarat State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited Vs. Mahakali Foods Private Limited and another (2023) 6 SCC 401 the following questions of law were formulated in paragraph no. 11 of the judgement: -\n\"11. In the background of afore stated spectrum of cases, the following common questions of law arise for consideration:\n11.1. (i) Whether the provisions of Chapter V of the Msmed Act, 2006 would have an effect overriding the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1996? \n11.2. (ii) Whether any party to a dispute with regard to any amount due under Section 17 of the Msmed Act, 2006 would be precluded from making a reference to the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council under sub-section (1) of Section 18 of the said Act, if an independent arbitration agreement existed between the parties as contemplated in Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 1996? \n11.3. (iii) Whether the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council, itself could take up the dispute for arbitration and act as an arbitrator, when the Council itself had conducted the conciliation proceedings under sub-section (2) of Section 18 of the Msmed Act, 2006 in view of the bar contained in Section 80 of the Arbitration Act, 1996?\"\n29. The Hon'ble Supreme Court examined the scheme of the MSMED Act and recorded the salient features in paragraph no. 40 as under: -\n\"40. Having regard to the purpose, intention and objects as also the scheme of the MSMED Act, 2006 and having regard to the unambiguous expressions used in Chapter V thereof, following salient features emerge:\n40.1. Chapter V is \"party-specific\", inasmuch as the party i.e. the \"buyer\"\nand the \"supplier\" as defined in Sections 2(d) and 2(n), respectively are covered under the said Chapter. \n40.2. A specific provision is made fastening a liability on the buyer to make payment of the dues to the supplier in respect of the goods supplied or services rendered to the buyer, as also a liability to pay compound interest at three times of the bank rate notified by the Reserve Bank, if the buyer fails to make payment within the prescribed time-limit. The said liability to pay compound interest is irrespective of any agreement between the parties or of any law for the time being in force. \n40.3. A dedicated statutory forum i.e. Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council is provided to enable any party to a dispute with regard to any amount due under Section 17, to make reference to such Council. \n40.4. A specific procedure has been prescribed to be followed by the Facilitation Council after the reference is made to it by any party to the dispute. \n40.5. The Facilitation Council or the centres providing alternative dispute resolution services have been conferred with the jurisdiction to act as an arbitrator or conciliator under Section 18(4), notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, in a dispute between the suppliers located within its jurisdiction. \n40.6. The provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1996 have been made applicable to the dispute only after the conciliation initiated under sub- section (2) does not succeed and stands terminated without any settlement between the parties. \n40.7. Sub-section (1) and sub-section (4) of Section 18 starting with non obstante clauses have an effect overriding the other laws for the time being in force. \n40.8. As per Section 24, the provisions of Sections 15 to 23 have an effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force.\" \n30. Thereafter, in paragraph nos. 41 and 42 of the judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that having regard to the entire scheme of the Arbitration Act it appears that it is a general law relating to the domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration and for conciliation. It does not specify any specific dispute or specific class or category of persons to which the Act shall apply, as has been specified in the MSMED Act, 2006. It has been further held that even if the Arbitration Act is treated as a special law, then also the MSMED Act, 2006 having been enacted subsequently in point of time i.e. in 2006, it would have an overriding effect, more particularly in view of section 24 of the MSMED Act, 2006 which specifically gives an effect to the provisions of sections 15 to 23 of the Act over any other law for the time being in force, which would also include the Arbitration Act. \n31. The interplay between the Arbitration Act and the MSMED Act has been dealt with in paragraph no. 43 onwards. Paragraph nos. 43 to 48, are quoted as under: -\n\"43. The Court also cannot lose sight of the specific non obstante clauses contained in sub-sections (1) and (4) of Section 18 which have an effect overriding any other law for the time being in force. When the Msmed Act, 2006 was being enacted in 2006, the legislature was aware of its previously enacted Arbitration Act of 1996, and therefore, it is presumed that the legislature had consciously made applicable the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1996 to the disputes under the Msmed Act, 2006 at a stage when the conciliation process initiated under sub-section (2) of Section 18 of the Msmed Act, 2006 fails and when the Facilitation Council itself takes up the disputes for arbitration or refers it to any institution or centre for such arbitration. It is also significant to note that a deeming legal fiction is created in Section 18(3) by using the expression \"as if\" for the purpose of treating such arbitration as if it was in pursuance of an arbitration agreement referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. As held in K. Prabhakaran v. P. Jayarajan [K. Prabhakaran v. P. Jayarajan, (2005) 1 SCC 754 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 451] , a legal fiction presupposes the existence of the state of facts which may not exist and then works out the consequences which flow from that state of facts. Thus, considering the overall purpose, objects and scheme of the Msmed Act, 2006 and the unambiguous expressions used therein, this Court has no hesitation in holding that the provisions of Chapter V of the Msmed Act, 2006 have an effect overriding the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1996. \n44. The submissions made on behalf of the counsel for the buyers that a conscious omission of the word \"agreement\" in sub-section (1) of Section 18, which otherwise finds mention in Section 16 of the Msmed Act, 2006 implies that the arbitration agreement independently entered into between the parties as contemplated under Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was not intended to be superseded by the provisions contained under Section 18 of the Msmed Act, 2006 also cannot be accepted. A private agreement between the parties cannot obliterate the statutory provisions. \nOnce the statutory mechanism under sub-section (1) of Section 18 is triggered by any party, it would override any other agreement independently entered into between the parties, in view of the non obstante clauses contained in sub-sections (1) and (4) of Section 18. The provisions of Sections 15 to 23 have also overriding effect as contemplated in Section 24 of the Msmed Act, 2006 when anything inconsistent is contained in any other law for the time being in force. It cannot be gainsaid that while interpretating a statute, if two interpretations are possible, the one which enhances the object of the Act should be preferred than the one which would frustrate the object of the Act. If submission made by the learned counsel for the buyers that the party to a dispute covered under the Msmed Act, 2006 cannot avail the remedy available under Section 18(1) of the Msmed Act, 2006 when an independent arbitration agreement between the parties exists is accepted, the very purpose of enacting the Msmed Act, 2006 would get frustrated. \n45. There cannot be any disagreement to the proposition of law laid down in various decisions of this Court, relied upon by the learned counsel for the buyers that the Court has to read the agreement as it is and cannot rewrite or create a new one, and that the parties to an arbitration agreement have an autonomy to decide not only on the procedural law to be followed but also on the substantive law, however, it is equally settled legal position that no agreement entered into between the parties could be given primacy over the statutory provisions. When the Special Act i.e. the Msmed Act, 2006 has been created for ensuring timely and smooth payment to the suppliers who are the micro and small enterprises, and to provide a legal framework for resolving the dispute with regard to the recovery of dues between the parties under the Act, also providing an overriding effect to the said law over any other law for the time being in force, any interpretation in derogation thereof would frustrate the very object of the Act. \n46. The submission therefore that an independent arbitration agreement entered into between the parties under the Arbitration Act, 1996 would prevail over the statutory provisions of the Msmed Act, 2006 cannot be countenanced. As such, sub-section (1) of Section 18 of the Msmed Act, 2006 is an enabling provision which gives the party to a dispute covered under Section 17 thereof, a choice to approach the Facilitation Council, despite an arbitration agreement existing between the parties. Absence of the word \"agreement\" in the said provision could neither be construed as casus omissus in the statute nor be construed as a preclusion against the party to a dispute covered under Section 17 to approach the Facilitation Council, on the ground that there is an arbitration agreement existing between the parties. In fact, it is a substantial right created in favour of the party under the said provision. It is therefore held that no party to a dispute covered under Section 17 of the Msmed Act, 2006 would be precluded from making a reference to the Facilitation Council under Section 18(1) thereof, merely because there is an arbitration agreement existing between the parties. \n47. The aforesaid legal position also dispels the arguments advanced on behalf of the counsel for the buyers that the Facilitation Council having acted as a Conciliator under Section 18(2) of the Msmed Act, 2006 itself cannot take up the dispute for arbitration and act as an arbitrator. Though it is true that Section 80 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 contains a bar that the Conciliator shall not act as an arbitrator in any arbitral proceedings in respect of a dispute that is subject of conciliation proceedings, the said bar stands superseded by the provisions contained in Section 18 read with Section 24 of the Msmed Act, 2006. As held earlier, the provisions contained in Chapter V of the Msmed Act, 2006 have an effect overriding the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1996. The provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1996 would apply to the proceedings conducted by the Facilitation Council only after the process of conciliation initiated by the Council under Section 18(2) fails and the Council either itself takes up the dispute for arbitration or refers to it to any institute or centre for such arbitration as contemplated under Section 18(3) of the Msmed Act, 2006. \n48. When the Facilitation Council or the institution or the centre acts as an arbitrator, it shall have all powers to decide the disputes referred to it as if such arbitration was in pursuance of the arbitration agreement referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 and then all the trappings of the Arbitration Act, 1996 would apply to such arbitration. It is needless to say that such Facilitation Council/institution/centre acting as an Arbitral Tribunal would also be competent to rule on its own jurisdiction like any other Arbitral Tribunal appointed under the Arbitration Act, 1996 would have, as contemplated in Section 16 thereof.\" \n32. Thus, it has been clearly held in paragraph no. 48 of the judgment reported in (2023) 6 SCC 401 (supra) that the Facilitation Council is the arbitral tribunal constituted under section 7(1) of the Arbitration Act and section 16 of the Arbitration Act would apply. It has been further held that the Facilitation Council shall have all the powers to decide the disputes referred to it as if such arbitration was in pursuance of the arbitration agreement referred to in sub-section (1) of section 7 of the Arbitration Act and then all the trappings of the Arbitration Act would apply to such arbitration. It has also been held that such Facilitation Council, acting as an arbitral tribunal, would also be competent to rule on its own jurisdiction like any other arbitral tribunal appointed under the Arbitration Act would have, as contemplated in section 16 thereof. Meaning thereby that section 16 of the Arbitration Act shall be fully applicable to arbitral proceedings before the Facilitation Council constituted under the MSMED Act. \n33. Accordingly, all the three natures of objections as enumerated in paragraph no. 20 of the judgement reported in (2018) 2 SCC 534 (supra) as quoted above are available to be taken before the Facilitation Council in terms of section 16 of the Arbitration Act. \n34. Thus, the arguments of the learned counsel for the appellant that applicability of section 16 of the Arbitration Act has been excluded in the arbitral proceedings before the Facilitation Council constituted under the MSMED Act is not acceptable and hence, rejected. The 1st point formulated above is accordingly answered in favour of the respondent and against the appellant. \n2nd point for consideration is whether the learned writ Court was justified in dismissing the writ petition and refusing to interfere with the arbitral award as well as the order passed by the learned Court below rejecting the application filed under section 34 of the Arbitration Act. \n35. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the respondent that objection to composition of Arbitral Tribunal is derogable, and hence objection to composition of tribunal having not been taken before the Facilitation Council under section 16 of the Arbitration Act is deemed to have been waived by the appellant. On the other hand, it has been argued by the appellant that the objection to jurisdiction regarding composition of the Facilitation Council goes to the root of the jurisdiction of the Facilitation Council being violative of section 21 of the MSMED Act and consequently the award passed by the Facilitation Council is void-ab-initio and hence a nullity in the eyes of law. The learned counsel has relied on the judgements passed in Electrosteel Steels Ltd. Vs. State of Jharkhand and others passed in W.P.(C) No. 3699 of 2015 & analogous cases and Heavy Engineering Corporation Ltd. Vs. State of Jharkhand and others 2022 SCC OnLine Jhar 843.\n36. With regard to the nature of objection under section 16 of the Arbitration Act, and whether it can be waived, the respondent has relied on the judgement rendered by three judges Bench by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Narayan Prasad Lohia Vs. Nikunj Kumar Lohia and others (2002) 3 SCC 572. The factual background was that the applications for setting aside the arbitral award were filed on the ground that the arbitration was by two arbitrators whereas under the Arbitration Act there cannot be an even number of arbitrators. It was contended that arbitration by two arbitrators was against the Arbitration Act itself and therefore void and invalid and consequently the award was unenforceable and not binding on the parties. \nA 3-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment reported in (2002) 3 SCC 572 (Narayan Prasad Lohia v. Nikunj Kumar Lohia & Others) specifically dealt with the point regarding waiver of right to object to composition of arbitral tribunal under the provisions of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Section 10 of the Arbitration Act clearly provides that the number of arbitrators shall not be an even number. The question for consideration was whether section 10 is a non- derogable provision. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the answer to the aforesaid question would depend on the question as to whether under the Arbitration Act a party has a right to object to the composition of the arbitral tribunal, if such composition is not in accordance with the Arbitration Act and if so at what stage. The Hon'ble Supreme Court was of the view that the question involved important question of law likely to arise in future cases. The question was formulated as under:\n\"At this stage, we are only deciding the question of law referred i.e. whether a mandatory provision of the said Act can be waived by the parties.\"\n37. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Narayan Prasad Lohia (supra) considered sections 4, 5, 10, 11, 16 and 34 of the Arbitration Act and particularly section 4 dealing with waiver of right, section 10 providing the number of arbitrator and section 16 dealing with competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction and 34 dealing with the Application for setting aside arbitral award and section 34(2)(a) (v). In the case of Narayan Prasad Lohia (supra), it has been clearly held that even if the composition of the arbitral tribunal is contrary to section 10 of the Arbitration Act, the same is a derogable provision and therefore objection to composition of the arbitral tribunal can be waived and it is required to be taken under section 16 of the Arbitration Act and can be a ground for challenge under section 34(2)(a)(v) of the Arbitration Act. \n38. In Narayan Prasad Lohia (supra) the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal in terms of the agreement was in violation of section 10 of the Arbitration Act i.e the arbitration tribunal was consisting of even number of arbitrators. However, in the present case, the objection to the jurisdiction with regard to composition of the arbitral tribunal i.e the Facilitation Council, is that the composition was in conflict with section 21 of the MSMED Act, though it was constituted in terms of the Rules of 2007 framed by the State of Jharkhand in exercise of powers under the MSMED Act. The two coordinate benches of this Court in the judgements rendered in Electrosteel Steels Ltd. Vs. State of Jharkhand and others passed in W.P.(C) No. 3699 of 2015 & analogous cases and Heavy Engineering Corporation Ltd. Vs. State of Jharkhand and others 2022 SCC OnLine Jhar 843 having held that such award rendered by the Facilitation Council constituted under the Rules of 2007 framed by the State of Jharkhand were void-ab-initio on the ground that the arbitral tribunal i.e the Facilitation Council was constituted in violation of section 21 with regard to the number of Arbitrators in the Facilitation Council. The said two judgements being binding on this Court, we are not inclined to take a different view. However, in spite of the aforesaid two judgements rendered by Coordinate Benches of this Court, the appellant is not entitled to any relief considering the facts and circumstances of this case. \n39. The writ proceedings involved in the present case is the 2nd round of writ petition and letters patent appeal by the appellant, challenging the arbitral award involved in the present case. The earlier round was in W.P.(C) No. 6876/2012 which was dismissed vide order dt. 29.04.2013 followed by LPA No. 200/2013 which was disposed of on 25.03.2014 with liberty and observations to move under section 34 of the Arbitration Act read with section 19 of the MSMED Act before the Competent Trial Court. \n40. The records of earlier writ petition being W.P(C) No. 6876 of 2012, wherein the decision of the Facilitation Council dated 18th May 2012/19th June 2012 was challenged for the first time in writ jurisdiction, reveals that the writ petition was filed on 07th November 2012 and instituted on 09th November 2012 which reveals that even on the day the writ petition was filed before this Court, the prescribed time period for filing petition under section 34 of the Arbitration Act had elapsed. \n41. This Court finds that the earlier writ petition being W.P(C) No. 6876 of 2012 was dismissed by clearly recording that the challenge to the award under writ petition was filed after the expiry of the prescribed period to challenge the arbitral award. The relevant portions of Order dated 29th April 2013 passed in W.P.(C) No. 6876 of 2012 are quoted as under:\n\"The petitioners had an alternative remedy of appeal under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 against the impugned award. However, the writ petition was filed after the time limit for filing of such application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996, had expired. The writ petitioners have taken a plea that the order has been passed by the Council without opportunity of proper hearing to it as no copy of the application was served upon it in order to enable it to defend itself in a proper manner in the said proceeding. \nA perusal of the impugned order dated 19th June, 2012, however, indicates that the copy of the application was sent to it on 24th March, 2012 by registered post. The Council has held its meeting on 24th February, 2012, 27th April, 2012 and 18th May, 2012, but the petitioners had remained absent. The petitioners have tried to make out a case that the notice was served without a copy of application in respect of which Annexure- 8 is being referred dated 29th February, 2012. However, from perusal of the impugned order itself, it appears that after 29th February, 2012 the matter had been adjourned on 27th April, 2012 and 18th May 2012, but the petitioners perhaps kept on taking plea that the copy of the application was not served upon it, although it was sent on 24th March, 2012 by registered post. Therefore, the ground for violation of principle of natural justice, do not appear to have been made out. The petitioners had adequate opportunity to defend themselves and the notice sent to it also contained the copy of the application. Perusal of Annexure- 8 dated 29th February, 2012 also indicates that in the said letter the petitioners had taken a plea that the parties were bound by the conditions of the contract as per para 2900 whereunder arbitration is to be undertaken on any dispute arising between the parties. \n....... \n.....The impugned order, therefore, does not appear to suffer on merits as well and no grounds are made out for interference in the impugned order on the part of the petitioners. Though the petitioners had an alternative remedy of appeal and preliminary objection was taken by the private respondent on that score, but this Court though it proper to entertain the writ petition, as the petitioners had tried to make out a case of violation of principle of natural justice and lack of proper notice in the decision- making process by the Facilitation Council. On facts, however, they have failed to establish that the order has been passed without notice on adequate opportunity of hearing to them. \nIn the totality of circumstances, therefore, no grounds for interference is made out on the part of the petitioners in the impugned order. The petitioners have deposited a Bank Draft of Rs. 4,41,931/- being 50% of the principal amount as per the order dated 1st March, 2013 passed by this Court as a condition precedent. In view of the fact that the writ petitioners have failed to make out a case for interference in the writ petition, the aforesaid Demand Draft deposited earlier in the name of the Registrar General of this Court, however, shall be returned to the petitioners. The petitioners would ensure the payment of the awarded amount as per the orders of the Facilitation Council in accordance with law. \nAccordingly, the writ petition is dismissed.\" (emphasis supplied) \n42. Against the aforesaid judgement passed in the writ petition, LPA No. 200 of 2013 was filed and decided on 25th March 2014. The order passed in the L.P.A. is quoted as under:\n\"1. This Letters Patent Appeal has been preferred by the appellant (original petitioner) against the judgment and order delivered by the learned Single Judge on 29.04.2013 passed in W.P.(C) No. 6876 of 2012.\n2. The present appellant (original petitioner) had preferred W.P.(C) No. 6876 of 2012 against an award passed by the Jharkhand Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council's order dated 19.06.2012 (Annexure-5 to this memo of Letters Patent Appeal. \n3. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that in pursuance to Section 18 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, 2006 for the sake of brevity) was passed by the Council. Initially, for conciliation proceeding, the reference was made thereafter, an award has been given by the Council as an arbitrator. This is an ex-parte award and there are several violations of the provisions of the Act, 2006, as well as of the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, 1996 for the sake of brevity). \n4. Nonetheless, counsel for the appellants fairly submitted that the appellants are having efficacious remedy to challenge the said award under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 to be read with Section 19 of the Act, 2006. Application shall be preferred for setting aside an arbitral award before the learned trial court within a period of 8 weeks, from the date of receipt of copy of this order. Let suitable direction be given to the learned trial court/ competent court to dispose of the said application, within stipulated time, in accordance with law. \n5. We have heard learned counsel for the respondents, who have no objection if this application is rendering before the learned trial court to prefer an application for setting aside the arbitral award, which is given by the Jharkhand Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council, order dated 19.06.2012 but, it is submitted that as per Section 19 of the Act, 2006, the applicants shall have to deposit 75% off the amount in terms of the decree or award.\n6. Having heard both the counsels and looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, it appears that the present respondents had supplied the goods thereafter, bills were raised, thus, bills remained unpaid and the claim was lodged by the respondents for the payment of the money, and still it is unpaid, and therefore, it appears that reference was made to Jharkhand Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council on 20.05.2011 for realization of Rs. 39,34,112/- and thereafter the Council has passed an award on 19.06.2012. Learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that there was contract to supply 304 Uninterrupted Power Supply (U.P.S.), out of which, 282 U.P.S. were installed, for which amount has already been paid and only for 22 U.P.S. dispute is going on. \n7. The appellants now want to challenge this award before the learned trial court by way of an application for setting aside the arbitral award under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 to be read with Section 19 of the Act , 2006. If such application is preferred by the appellants before the competent trial court within a period of 8 weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, the said competent trial court shall decide the application under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 to be read with Section 19 of the Act, 2006 and if any application is preferred under Section 9 of the Act, 1996, the same will be decided as early as possible, preferably within 12 weeks thereafter, in accordance with law and at least adequate opportunity of hearing be given to the respondents. \n8. This Letters Patent Appeal is disposed of in view of the aforesaid efficacious remedy to be availed by the respondents.\" \n43. Pursuant to the order of LPA Court, the appellant filed the application under section 34 of the Arbitration Act before the sub-judge, Ranchi for setting aside the Arbitral Award dt. 18.5.2012 which was subsequently transferred to the Commercial Court, Ranchi and was registered as Commercial Revocation (Arbitration) Case No. 04/2019. The preliminary objection filed by the Respondent was dismissed which was challenged in the writ petition being WPC No. 5988 of 2015 but the writ petition was dismissed vide order dated 06.12.2018. The letters Patent Appeal being L.P.A. No. 124 of 2019 was allowed vide order dated 06.12.2019 by referring to the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court Simplex Infrastructure Limited Vs. Union of India (2019) 2 SCC 455, paragraph no. 18 and liberty was given to the respondent to agitate the issue of limitation before the learned Court below. \n44. The said Commercial Revocation (Arbitration) Case No. 04/2019 was dismissed vide judgment dt. 31.1.2020 on the ground that the application filed under section 34 was barred by limitation. \n45. Upon perusal of the order passed by the Commercial Court, it is apparent that the Council published the award on 18th May 2012 and the learned Court below has taken note of the fact that this Court while dismissing the writ petition vide order dated 29th April 2013 had observed that, \"However, the writ petition was filed after the time limit for filing such application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996, had expired.\" \nMeaning thereby, the writ petition was itself filed beyond the period of limitation as prescribed under section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The findings of the learned Court below are quoted from paragraph nos. 15 to 20, which are as under:\n\"15. Coming to the issue of Limitation, I find that the Council published its award on 18/05/2012 which was challenged by the petitioners before the Hon'ble Court by filing W.P. (C) No. 6876 of 2012. The Hon'ble Court while dismissing the Writ Petition vide its order dated 29/04/2013 observed at para 2; \"However, the writ petition was filed after the time limit for filing such application under Section 34 of the Act of 1996, had explained\". Meaning thereby the writ petition was also filed beyond the period of limitation as prescribed U/s 34(3) of the Arbitration and Concilitation Act. \n16. From perusal of order dated 25/07/2015 of the learned Trial Court, I find that the claimant raised a specific objection that thereha been delay of more than one year and eleven months in filing the case for setting aside the award but the objection was found not sustainable in view of the order of the Hon'ble Court passed in L.P.A. No. 200 of 2013 dated 25/03/2014. \n17. Further the Hon'ble Court while disposing of the Letters Patent Appeal no. 124 of 2019 dated 17/07/20198 has been pleased to give a direction at para 11, \"we hereby, clarify that the appellant shall be free to re-agitate the point before the Trial Court below, and the Trial Court below shall be at liberty to decide all the issues, including the issue of Limitation, raised by the appellant, without being guided/prejudiced/bound by the earlier orders on this issue, of the High Court, passed either in exercise of writ jurisdiction or in the L.P.A. jurisdiction, or its own order dated 25/07/2015.\" \n18. From above discussion it is abundantly clear that the present case for setting aside the Award has been filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation as envisaged U/s (3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. \n19. The Hon'ble Apex Court in Simplex Infrastructure Ltd. Case (supra) has held that the period of limitation prescribed for preferring a petition to set aside an award U/s 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act cannot be extended and if extended it will amount to breach of clear statutory mandate.\n20. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case and the discussions made in the foregoing paragraphs and considering the judicial pronouncement of the Hon'ble Apex Court, I find that the present case filed by the petitioner under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act is barred by limitation and not maintainable and therefore it is fit to be dismissed. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed being barred by Limitation as prescribed U/s 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. O/c is directed to consign the record in the record room as per Rules.\" \n46. The learned writ Court while dismissing the writ petition held as under: -\n\"16. The short question that falls for consideration is that the issue of composition of the MSEFC can be raised at this stage after having submitted the statement of claim before the M.S.E.F.C.?\n17. It is relevant to mention that the opposite party was allowed to raise the point of limitation before the Commercial Court, Ranchi by order dated 17.07.2019 passed in LPA no.124 of 2019. In view of the ratio decided by the Hon'ble Apex Court, in Simplex Infrastructure Ltd. (supra) the learned court below held that appeal was time barred under Section 34 (3) of the Act and dismissed the revocation case. \n18. Quite interestingly, now the petitioner has nothing to say with respect to the dismissal of the revocation case on the ground of limitation. \nIn the teeth of the ratio laid down by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in Simplex case, the petitioner appears to have abandoned the challenge to award under Section 34(2) of the Act and has innovated a new ground of challenge namely the composition of the MSEFC. This court is of the view that this belated plea of jurisdiction of the M.S.E.F.C. on ground of its composition cannot be raised in view of the ratio decided in MSP Infrastructure Ltd. v. M.P. Road Development Corpn. Ltd., (2015) 13 SCC 713. The ratio of the judgement is that in view of Section 16(2) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 a plea that the Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction cannot be raised later than the submission of the statement of defence. There is an express prohibition on the party from raising a plea that the tribunal does not have jurisdiction after the party has submitted its statement of defence. \nThe petitioner is trying to raise jurisdictional issue in a time-barred matter which will not be permissible. \nThe writ petition, accordingly, stands dismissed. Consequently, I.A. Nos. 131/2021, 861/2021, 5467/2021, 8887/2022 and 8888/2022 stand disposed of.\" \n47. The learned writ Court has rightly dismissed the writ petition by observing that the petitioner is trying to raise jurisdictional issue in a time-barred matter which will not be permissible. \n48. It has been argued that the judgement relied on by the learned Court below i.e MSP Infrastructure Ltd. v. M.P. Road Development Corpn. Ltd., (2015) 13 SCC 713 has been overruled in the judgement reported in (2018) 16 SCC 758, Lion Engineering Consultants (supra).\n49. This Court finds that only the observations made in paragraph nos. 16 and 17 of the judgement passed in MSP Infrastructure Ltd (supra) were overruled vide judgment passed in Lion Engineering Consultants (supra). The observations made in paragraph nos. 16 and 17 of the judgement passed in MSP Infrastructure Ltd (supra) are quoted as follows:-\n\" 16. It is not possible to accept this submission. In the first place, there is nothing to warrant the inference that all objections to the jurisdiction of the tribunal cannot be raised under Section 16 and that the tribunal does not have power to rule on its own jurisdiction. Secondly, Parliament has employed a different phraseology in clause (b) of Section 34. That phraseology is \"the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration\". This phrase does not necessarily refer to an objection to \"jurisdiction\" as the term is well known. In fact, it refers to a situation where the dispute referred for arbitration, by reason of its subject-matter is not capable of settlement by arbitration at all. Examples of such cases have been referred to by the Supreme Court in Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc. v. SBI Home Finance Ltd.3 This Court observed as follows: (SCC pp. 546-47, para 36) \"36. The well-recognised examples of non-arbitrable disputes are: (i) disputes relating to rights and liabilities which give rise to or arise out of criminal offences; (ii) matrimonial disputes relating to divorce, judicial separation, restitution of conjugal rights, child custody; (iii) guardianship matters; (iv) insolvency and winding-up matters; (v) testamentary matters (grants of probate, letters of administration and succession certificate);\nand (vi) eviction or tenancy matters governed by special statutes where the tenant enjoys statutory protection against eviction and only the specified courts are conferred jurisdiction to grant eviction or decide the disputes.\"\nThe scheme of the Act is thus clear. All objections to jurisdiction of whatever nature must be taken at the stage of the submission of the statement of defence, and must be dealt with under Section 16 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. However, if one of the parties seeks to contend that the subject-matter of the dispute is such as cannot be dealt with by arbitration, it may be dealt under Section 34 by the Court. \n17. It was also contended by Shri Divan, that the newly added ground that the tribunal under the Arbitration Act, 1996 had no jurisdiction to decide the dispute in question because the jurisdiction lay with the tribunal under the M.P. Act of 1983, was a question which can be agitated under sub- clause (ii) of clause (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. This provision enables the court to set aside an award which is in conflict with the public policy of India. Therefore, it is contended that the amendment had been rightly allowed and it cannot be said that what was raised was only a question which pertained to jurisdiction and ought to have been raised exclusively under Section 16 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, but in fact was a question which could also have been raised under Section 34 before the Court, as has been done by the respondent. This submission must be rejected. The contention that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India cannot be equated with the contention that the tribunal under the Central Act does not have jurisdiction and the tribunal under the State Act, has jurisdiction to decide upon the dispute. Furthermore, it was stated that this contention might have been raised under the head that the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India. In other words, it was submitted that it is the public policy of India that arbitrations should be held under the appropriate law. It was contended that unless the arbitration was held under the State law i.e. the M.P. Act that it would be a violation of the public policy of India. This contention is misconceived since the intention of providing that the award should not be in conflict with the public policy of India is referable to the public policy of India as a whole i.e. the policy of the Union of India and not merely the policy of an individual State. Though, it cannot be said that the upholding of a State law would not be part of the public policy of India, much depends on the context. Where the question arises out of a conflict between an action under a State law and an action under a Central law, the term public policy of India must necessarily be understood as being referable to the policy of the Union. It is well known, vide Article 1 of the Constitution, the name \"India\" is the name of the Union of States and its territories include those of the States. \n18. We have thus no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the amendment application raised a ground which was contrary to law and ought not to have been allowed by the High Court. We, accordingly, set aside the judgment and order of the High Court. There shall be no order as to costs.\" \n50. The said judgement of Lion Engineering does not apply to the facts and circumstances of this case on account of two reasons:\n(a) The aforesaid two paragraph nos. 16 and 17 of MSP Infrastructure Ltd. (supra) overruled in Lion Engineering (supra) were relating to ground mentioned under section 34 (2) (b) which enables the Court to set aside an award when the Court finds that (i) the subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration or (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with Public Policy of India. Apparently, the point involved in the present case relates to objection regarding composition of arbitral tribunal and such ground is specifically covered under section 34 (2) (a) (v) and does not fall under section 34 (2) (b). \n(b) In the said case the petition filed under section 34 of the Arbitration Act was still pending before the learned Court below and a petition seeking amendment of grounds to challenge the award was rejected by the concerned Court but the amendment petition was allowed by the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India . The order of the High Court allowing the amendment to section 34 petition was under challenge before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The observations made in paragraph nos. 16 and 17 of the judgement passed in MSP Infrastructure Ltd (supra) were overruled and further the Hon'ble Supreme Court disagreed with the observation that the public policy of India does not refer to state law but only refers to an all India Law. \n51. In the present case, the appellant challenged the arbitral award by seeking amendment, questioning jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal with regards to its constitution, in a pending writ petition which was filed challenging the order dismissing the petition under section 34 on the ground of limitation. The award was also unsuccessfully challenged earlier in another writ petition being WPC No. 6876 of 2012. \n52. Upon perusal of the writ petition, this Court finds that the timelines as mentioned in the order passed by the learned Commercial Court to hold that the petition under section 34 of the Arbitration Act is not under challenge in the writ records. This Court also finds apparently, no petition in terms of section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 seeking exclusion of time spent in pursuing the case before this Court in the earlier writ petition being WPC No. 6876 of 2012 and in LPA No. 200 of 2013 was ever filed before the learned Court below and the appellant simply relied on the observations made by Hon'ble Division Bench in LPA No. 200 of 2013 wherein liberty was granted to prefer the application under section 34 of the Arbitration Act with 8 weeks which was to be decided as early as possible. In the present case no petition for condonation of delay in terms of section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act was ever filed by the appellant, though it permits condonation of delay only to the extent of 30 days on showing sufficient cause. The appellant also failed to take into account that in the order dated 06.12.2019 passed in LPA No. 124 of 2019 arising out of WPC No. 5988 of 2015 filed by the respondent herein, liberty was given to the respondent to agitate the point of limitation in terms of the judgement passed in the case of Simplex Infrastructure Limited Vs. Union of India (supra).\n53. This Court is of the considered view that merely because the LPA Court had given liberty to file the petition under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, the same by itself cannot be taken to have given an extended period of limitation to challenge the award beyond what has been prescribed under section 34 (3) of the Arbitration Act. It is not in dispute that on the day when the 1st writ petition being WPC No. 6876 of 2012 was filed challenging the award, the remedy under section 34 was already barred by limitation and clear finding to this effect was recorded in the order dismissing the writ petition being W.P.(C). No.6876 of 2012. In such circumstances, the appellant cannot even take any advantage of section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 for exclusion of the period spent in pursuing the litigation against the arbitral award in the High Court. Such course of action as argued by the appellant would be in direct conflict with the judgment passed in the case of Simplex Infrastructure Limited Vs. Union of India (supra) wherein it has been held in paragraph no. 18 that a plain reading of sub-section (3) along with the proviso to Section 34 of the 1996 Act, shows that the application for setting aside the award on the grounds mentioned in Section 34 (2) could be made within three months and the period can only be extended for a further period of thirty days on showing sufficient cause and not thereafter. It was found in the said case that even if the benefit of section 14 of the limitation Act was given, the petition remained barred by limitation which was beyond the strict timelines prescribed in sub-section (3) read along with the proviso to Section 34 of the 1996 Act. Paragraph no. 18 of the said judgment is quoted as under:\n\"18. A plain reading of sub-section (3) along with the proviso to Section 34 of the 1996 Act, shows that the application for setting aside the award on the grounds mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 34 could be made within three months and the period can only be extended for a further period of thirty days on showing sufficient cause and not thereafter. The use of the words \"but not thereafter\" in the proviso makes it clear that the extension cannot be beyond thirty days. Even if the benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act is given to the respondent, there will still be a delay of 131 days in filing the application. That is beyond the strict timelines prescribed in sub-section (3) read along with the proviso to Section 34 of the 1996 Act. The delay of 131 days cannot be condoned. To do so, as the High Court did, is to breach a clear statutory mandate.\" \n54. It would be useful to refer to the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court dealing with writ jurisdiction in the matter of arbitral awards reported in (2022) 1 SCC 75 (supra) wherein it has been held in paragraph no. 21 that the arbitral process is strictly conditioned upon time limitation and modelled on the \"principle of unbreakability\"\nand if the Courts are allowed to interfere with the arbitral process beyond the ambit of the enactment, then the efficiency of the process will be diminished.\n55. In the present case, the appellant has already failed to get the award set-aside in 1st round of the writ petition and was ultimately relegated to avail remedy under section 34 and after having failed to succeed under section 34, has again challenged the same award in the pending W.P.(C). No.2638 of 2020 wherein the challenge to the order passed under section 34 was pending. Repeated challenge to the same award by filing writ petitions, one after another, on one or the other ground neither fits into the scheme of the Arbitration Act which is a self- contained code nor is permissible under law. \n56. The learned writ Court was justified in refusing to interfere with the arbitral award as well as the order passed by the learned Court below rejecting the application filed under section 34 of the Arbitration Act and was justified in dismissing the writ petition. The 2nd point formulated above is accordingly answered in favour of the respondent and against the appellant. \n57. As a cumulative effect of the aforesaid findings, there is no illegality or perversity in the impugned order passed by the learned Court below or in the impugned order passed by the learned writ Court dismissing the writ petition challenging the order passed under section 34 of the Arbitration Act and also challenging the award passed by the Facilitation Council under the MSMED Act. \n58. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed. \n59. Pending interlocutory application, if any, is closed. \n(Shree Chandrashekhar, J.) I Agree. \n(Shree Chandrashekhar, J.) (Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)

sessions judge, (exclusive dedicated commercial court) at bengaluru (cch.88) in comm.ex.2673/2018 at annexure-a. this petition, coming on for dictating orders, this day, the court made the following: order this petition is directed against the impugned order dated 21.01.2023 passed on i.a.no.2 in commercial execution no.2673/2018 on the file of the lxxxvii addl. city civil judge, (exclusive dedicated commercial court), bengaluru (for short ' the nc: 2024:khc:28312 commercial court'), whereby the said application filed by the 1st respondent decree holder under section 151 cpc seeking attachment of a sum of rs.95 lakhs deposited in o.s.no.6229/2017 before the city civil court, bangalore, was allowed by the commercial court. 2. heard sri. m.n. sheshadri, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, learned counsel for respondent no.1 ksfc and perused the material on record. since no relief is sought for as against respondents 2 to 6, notice to them has been dispensed with in the present petition. 3. brief facts leading to the case are as under: respondent no.1-karnataka state financial corporation (ksfc) instituted the instant commercial execution proceedings before the commercial court to implement and enforce the judgment and order dated 25.11.2015 passed in misc.no.521/2004. the petitioner herein is arrayed as judgment debtor no.6 to the said execution proceedings, in which, respondent nos.2 to 6 are arrayed as judgment debtor nos.1 to 5. 3.1 in the first instance, the said execution proceedings were instituted by the 1st respondent ksfc before the xxxvii nc: 2024:khc:28312 addl.city civil and sessions judge, bangalore (cch-38), in ex.no.2673/2018 and the same were pending adjudication. after establishment of the commercial courts in bangalore city, the city civil court , bangalore, issued a notification dated 17.08.2020 invoking section 5(2) of the bangalore city civil court act, 1979, r/w section 24 cpc for the purpose of equal distribution of cases among commercial courts, the instant ex.no.2673/2018 was transferred to the commercial court, i.e., the court of the lxxxiii addl.city civil and sessions judge, bangalore (cch-84) and renumbered as com.ex.no.2673/2018. 3.2 subsequently, the city civil court, bangalore, issued one more notification invoking section 5(2) of the bangalore city civil court act, 1979, for administrative purposes and transferred the aforesaid com.ex.no.2683/2018 from the court of the lxxxiii addl.city civil and sessions judge, bangalore (cch-84), to the court of the lxxxvii addl. city civil judge, (exclusive dedicated commercial court), bengaluru, which passed the order impugned in the present petition. 3.3 meanwhile, the petitioner had instituted a suit in o.s.no.6229/2017 before the i addl.city civil judge, bangalore, for ejectment and other reliefs against her tenants, in which, the nc: 2024:khc:28312 trial court passed an order directing the said tenants to deposit a sum of rs.95 lakhs by way of arrears of rent payable to the petitioner. in pursuance of the said order, the 1st respondent ksfc filed an application i.a.no.2 seeking order of attachment of an amount of rs.95 lakhs to be paid to the petitioner herein. 3.4 on 30.06.2021, the commercial court allowed i.a.no.2, thereby directing attachment of the aforesaid deposited amount of rs.95,00,000/-. subsequently, the petitioner herein filed i.a.no.3 seeking recalling of the attachment order. the said application having been opposed by respondent no.1, the commercial court proceeded to dismiss the said application i.a.no.3 filed by the petitioner. aggrieved by the impugned order passed on i.a.nos.2 and 3, the petitioner-judgment debtor no.6 approached this court in w.p.no.13079/2021 which was contested by the 1st respondent and disposed of vide final order dated 06.01.2023, whereby this court set aside the orders passed on i.a.nos. 2 and 3 and remitted the matter back to the commercial court for reconsideration of i.a.no.2 afresh in accordance with law. pursuant to the said remand order, the commercial court once again took up i.a.2 and allowed the same by passing the impugned order, which is assailed in the present petition. nc: 2024:khc:28312 4. in addition to reiterating the various contentions urged in the petition and referring to the documents produced by the petitioner, learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that both execution proceedings as well as i.a.no.2 are not maintainable and the same are liable to be dismissed. in this context, it is submitted that the execution proceedings seeking to enforce and implement the judgment and order passed in misc.521/2004 is not maintainable before the commercial court constituted under the commercial courts act, 2015 (for short 'the said act of 2015') and on this ground alone, the execution proceedings are liable to be dismissed. it is also submitted that the instant execution proceedings are neither a suit nor an application in relation to a commercial dispute as defined under section 2(c) of the said act of 2015 and having regard to the provisions contained in section 6, the commercial court did not have jurisdiction or authority of law to entertain or adjudicate upon the instant execution proceedings, since the same were instituted only for the purpose of implementing, enforcing and executing the order passed in misc.no.521/2004, subsequent to which, there was no dispute, much less commercial dispute within the meaning of nc: 2024:khc:28312 section 2(c) of the said act of 2015 which would fall within the scope and jurisdiction of the said act of 2015. 4.1 it was also submitted that the application, i.a.no.2 filed by respondent no.1 seeking attachment by placing reliance upon the collateral security agreement dated 08.06.2002, which was not the subject matter of misc. no.521/2004 was not maintainable. further, it is pointed out that the collateral security agreement is dated 08.06.2002, while the present application i.a.no.2 having been filed after a lapse of 19 years is hopelessly barred by limitation and the same is not maintainable and liable to be dismissed. 4.2 it is also contended that section 34 of the securitization and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest act, 2002 (for short \"the sarfaesi act\") bars both the suit and proceedings in relation to any action taken by respondent no.1 including issuance of notice under section 13(2) of the sarfaesi act. in this context, it is submitted that in view of the notice dated 20.02.2018 having been issued by respondent no.1-ksfc much prior to institution of execution proceedings on 11.07.2018, the jurisdiction of the commercial court is expressly barred under section 34 of the sarfaesi act and consequently, nc: 2024:khc:28312 i.a.no.2 would also necessarily have to be dismissed on this score also. in support of his submissions, reliance is placed on the following judgments:(i) balawant n.vishwamitra vs. yadav sadashiv mule (2004) 8 scc 706; (ii) associated power co. ltd., vs. ram taran roy air 1970 cal 75; (iii)

placed reliance upon the following judgments:nc: 2024:khc:28312 (i) m.d. frozen foods exports pvt. ltd. & others vs. hero fincorp ltd. civil appeal no. 15147 of 2017 dated 21.09.2017; (ii) transcore

6. i have given my anxious consideration to the rival submissions and perused the material on record. 7. before adverting to the rival contentions, it is necessary to state that it is an undisputed fact that the 1st respondent decree holder instituted the instant execution proceedings seeking to enforce and implement the judgment and order dated 25.11.2015 passed in misc.no.521/2004 in its favour against the petitioner and others and that the petitioner is arrayed as respondent no.6 to the execution proceedings. meanwhile, the petitioner instituted a suit in o.s.no.6229/2017 against her tenants, in which, the application i.a.no.8 filed by her for a direction to the 11 nc: 2024:khc:28312 defendants tenants was allowed by the trial court on 22.09.2020, thereby directing them to deposit rs.95 lakhs before the trial court. in pursuance of the same, the aforesaid tenants have deposited the said amount of rs.95 lakhs before the trial court in the said o.s.no.6229/2017 and before the said amount was disbursed in favour of the petitioner plaintiff, the 1st respondent decree holder filed the instant i.a.2 seeking attachment of the said amount and restraining disbursement of the same in favour of the petitioner and the said application was allowed by the commercial court by passing the impugned order. 8. the material on record also discloses that initially the said execution proceedings were filed before the city civil court, bangalore, and were pending before the court of xxxvii addl.city civil judge, (cch-38), bangalore, till the same were transferred initially to the court of the lxxxiii city civil judge, bangalore, (cch-84), which was designated as 'commercial court' and thereafter to the newly established exclusive dedicated commercial court which is the lxxxvii addl.city civil and sessions judge, bangalore (cch-88), which has passed the impugned order. 12 nc: 2024:khc:28312 9. the contention urged by the petitioner that the commercial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain or adjudicate upon the execution proceedings since the same did not relate to a commercial dispute within the meaning of section 2(c)(i) of the said act of 2015 was rejected by the commercial court by holding as under; \"20. looking to the above rival contentions of the parties, it is admitted fact that the instant petition was transferred to this court as per the notification no. admn-i-a/812/2020 dated 22.12.2020 passed by the additional city civil and sessions judge in its order dated 29.12.2020 for disposal according to law. it is one of the specific contention of the jdr is that the dispute is not a commercial dispute with in the meaning of section2 (c) (f) of the commercial court 2015 and the jurisdiction of the commercial court is barred under sec. 6 of the act. sec. 6 deals with \"the commercial courts shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value arising out of the entire territory of the state over which it has been vested territorial jurisdiction\" so, the said section is applicable to only for suit instead of execution petitions.sec.2(c) of the commercial court act deals with \"including enforcement\". enforcement means to execute the decree or order either by the court which passed it or by the court to which it is sent for execution as per 13 nc: 2024:khc:28312 section 38 of cpc. the order in misc. no. 521/2004 passed by the cch-38 discloses that the plaintiff-ksfc sanctioned loan of rs 240 lakhs to the respondent no.1 company for development of software solutions for educational institutions and respondents executed necessary loan documents and respondent no.6-jdr no.6 herein appeared through her counsel in the said suit and filed her objections by denying the contents of the petition, after considering the material and contentions on both side, the order passed by the court in 521/2004 on 25.11.2015.so the said order is delivered by the court on merits. it is also noticed that till today the said order is not at all challenged by any of the respondents including this jdr. therefore, the order under the petition is coming within the meaning of sec. 2(c) of commercial court act and sec. 38 of cpc and sec. 32 (8) of state financial corporation act, 1951, this court has got right to entertain the present petition. therefore, the objection raised by the learned senior counsel for jdr no.2 regarding the dispute is not a commercial dispute, it is barred under sec. 6 of the act and sec. 31 r/w 32 of state financial corporation act, 1951 cannot be accepted.\" 10. in this context, it is relevant to extract section 2(c)(i) of the said act of 2015, reads as under:2. definitions. (c) \"commercial dispute\" means a dispute arising out of 14 nc: 2024:khc:28312 (i) ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents, including enforcement and interpretation of such documents; so also, section 6 of the said act of 2015, reads as under:6. jurisdiction of commercial court. the commercial court shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value arising out of the entire territory of the state over which it has been vested territorial jurisdiction. explanation.--for the purposes of this section, a commercial dispute shall be considered to arise out of the entire territory of the state over which a commercial court has been vested jurisdiction, if the suit or application relating to such commercial dispute has been instituted as per the provisions of sections 16 to 20 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908). 11. there is no gainsaying the fact that a commercial court would have jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate upon the instant execution proceedings, only if there existed a commercial dispute within the meaning of section 2(c) of the said act of 2015. while dealing with this aspect, the commercial court came to the conclusion that the expression \"including enforcement and interpretation of such documents\" includes the instant execution 15 nc: 2024:khc:28312 proceedings seeking to enforce the order passed by the trial court in misc.521/2004l; in my considered opinion, a plain reading of section 2(c)(i) of the said act of 2015, will clearly indicate that it contemplates commercial dispute as to mean a dispute arising out of ordinary transaction of merchants, bankers, financiers and traders, such as those relating to mercantile documents including enforcement and interpretation of such documents; the said provision merely contemplates enforcement of mercantile documents and clearly does not contemplate enforcement of decrees / judgments / orders or execution proceedings; in other words, the instant execution proceedings cannot be construed, treated or interpreted as \"enforcement of mercantile documents\" within the meaning of section 2(c)(i) of the said act of 2015 and consequently, the said finding recorded by the commercial court in order to reject the claim of the petitioner deserves to be set aside. 12. the material on record discloses that the instant execution proceedings seeks to enforce the order dated 25.01.2015 passed in favour of the 1st respondent in misc.no.521/2004 under section 31(1) and 32 of the state financial corporations act and the said order was passed after 16 nc: 2024:khc:28312 contest by the petitioner who was arrayed as 6th respondent in the said misc. proceedings. upon passing of the said order, by the trial court, the dispute between the petitioner and 1st respondent culminated in the said order and the execution proceedings cannot be said to involve a commercial dispute, since the same was restricted to enforcement and implementation of the order already passed by the trial court; further, the scope and ambit of the proceedings before the commercial court was merely to enforce and implement the order passed by the trial court and not to adjudicate upon the commercial dispute; in other words, after the trial court passed an order in misc.521/2004, there did not remain any 'live / pending lis' or 'live / pending dispute' between the parties which could be described as a 'commercial dispute' coming within the jurisdiction of the exclusive dedicated commercial court as contemplated under section 6 of the said act of 2015. 13. as stated supra, an application for execution seeks to merely enforce and implement a decree / order passed by a court; in the instant case, it is needless to state that the dispute between the petitioner and 1st respondent ended and culminated by virtue of the order dated 25.11.2015 passed in misc.521/2004 and pursuant 17 nc: 2024:khc:28312 thereto, there did not remain any lis / dispute between them which could be categorized or described as a pending commercial dispute requiring adjudication at the hands of the commercial court; so long as the dispute between the petitioner and 1st respondent had culminated and ended in the aforesaid order, the question of adjudication of the dispute once again before the commercial court by way of execution clearly did not arise in the facts and circumstances of the instant case and on this ground also, the commercial court did not have jurisdiction or authority of law to entertain or try a dispute which had already stood concluded / ended / culminated in the order passed in misc.521/2004 and there was no dispute between the petitioner and 1st respondent which was capable of being adjudicated upon in execution proceedings by the commercial court and consequently, the impugned order deserves to be set aside on this ground also. 14. the issue / question can be viewed from yet another angle; in this context, the statement of objects and reasons to the said act of 2015, clearly indicate that the intent of the act was to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes, which involve complex fact and questions of law necessitating a 18 nc: 2024:khc:28312 need to provide for an independent mechanism for their early resolution which would create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive legal system; the preamble to the act also states that the act of 2015 was an act for adjudicating commercial disputes of a specified value and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto; it is therefore clear that the intent and object of the act was to provide for speedy adjudication of existing disputes and not for enforcement / implementation of the same by the process of execution; in other words, since the dispute between the parties comes to an end after adjudication, in the light of the undisputed fact that the dispute had already ended / culminated before the city civil court prior to the commercial court being constituted, enforcing / implementing the said order passed in misc.521/2004 cannot be described / construed / treated as 'adjudication of a dispute' which was the sole and paramount purpose of enacting the said act of 2015. under these circumstances, i am of the view that the instant execution proceedings which were undisputedly instituted prior to the constitution of the commercial courts could not have been transferred to the commercial court which passed the impugned order since the commercial court did not have jurisdiction or 19 nc: 2024:khc:28312 authority of law to entertain or adjudicate upon an application for execution under the provisions contained in order 21 cpc. 15. in this regard, it is relevant to extract section 15 of the said act of 2015, which reads as under:15. transfer of pending cases.-(1) all suits and applications, including applications under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in a high court where a commercial division has been constituted, shall be transferred to the commercial division. (2) all suits and applications, including applications under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a commercial court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such commercial court: provided that no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the court prior to the constitution of the commercial division or the commercial court shall be transferred either under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2). (3) where any suit or application, including an application under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of specified 20 nc: 2024:khc:28312 value shall stand transferred to the commercial division or commercial court under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the provisions of this act shall apply to those procedures that were not complete at the time of transfer. (4) the commercial division or commercial court, as the case may be, may hold case management hearings in respect of such transferred suit or application in order to prescribe new timelines or issue such further directions as may be necessary for a speedy and efficacious disposal of such suit or application in accordance 3 [with order xv-a] of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908): provided that the proviso to sub-rule (1) of rule 1 of order v of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall not apply to such transferred suit or application and the court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which the written statement shall be filed. (5) in the event that such suit or application is not transferred in the manner specified in sub-section (1), subsection (2) or sub-section (3), the commercial appellate division of the high court may, on the application of any of the parties to the suit, withdraw such suit or application from the court before which it is pending and transfer the same for trial or disposal to the commercial division or commercial court, as the case may be, having territorial jurisdiction over such suit, and such order of transfer shall be final and binding. 21 nc: 2024:khc:28312 16. the word \"application\" contained in section 15(2) of the said act of 2015, came up for consideration / interpretation before the kerala high court in the case of shaji augustine vs. chitra woods manners welfare association (2021) scc online ker 9840, wherein it was held that the expression \"application\" did not include an execution application as under:22. the next interesting question is whether the district court is divested of its power to 25 execute arbitral awards after the introduction of the commercial courts act. section 2(e) of the arbitration act defines 'court' to be the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in the district and excludes civil courts of grade inferior to such principal civil court. interpreting the provision the honourable supreme court in atlanta limited (supra) held as follows; \"24.2. secondly, the provisions of the arbitration act, leave no room for any doubt, that it is the superior-most court exercising original civil jurisdiction, which had been chosen to adjudicate disputes arising out of arbitration agreements, arbitral proceedings and arbitral awards. undoubtedly, a \"principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district\", is the superior-most court exercising original civil jurisdiction in the district over which its jurisdiction extends. it is clear that section 2(1)(e) of the arbitration act having vested jurisdiction in the \"principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district\", did not rest the choice of jurisdiction on courts subordinate to that of the district judge. likewise, \"the high court in exercise of its ordinary original jurisdiction\", is the superior-most court exercising original civil jurisdiction, within the ambit of its original civil jurisdiction. on the same analogy and for the same reasons, the choice of jurisdiction will clearly fall in the realm of the high court, wherever a high court exercises \"ordinary original civil jurisdiction\". 22 nc: 2024:khc:28312 23. inasmuch as the high court of kerala is not vested with ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the district court is the jurisdictional court to deal with matters arising out of arbitration. as per section 10(3) of the commercial courts act, applications or appeal arising out of an arbitration under the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation act would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district and shall be filed and heard and disposed of by the commercial court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration. section 15(2) stipulates that all suits and applications, including applications under the arbitration and conciliation act relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a commercial court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such commercial court. for easy reference, section 15 is extracted below; \"15. transfer of pending cases.--(1) all suits and applications, including applications under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in a high court where a commercial division has been constituted, shall be transferred to the commercial division. (2) all suits and applications, including applications under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a commercial court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such commercial court: provided that no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the court prior to the constitution of the commercial division or the commercial court shall be transferred either under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2). (3) where any suit or application, including an application under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 23 nc: 2024:khc:28312 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of specified value shall stand transferred to the commercial division or commercial court under subsection (1) or sub-section (2), the provisions of this act shall apply to those procedures that were not complete at the time of transfer. (4) the commercial division or commercial court, as the case may be, may hold case management hearings in respect of such transferred suit or application in order to prescribe new timelines or issue such further directions as may be necessary for a speedy and efficacious disposal of such suit or application in accordance 22[with order xv-a] of the civil procedure code, 1908 (5 of 1908): provided that the proviso to sub-rule (1) of rule 1 of order v of the civil procedure code, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall not apply to such transferred suit or application and the court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which the written statement shall be filed. (5) in the event that such suit or application is not transferred in the manner specified in sub-section (1), subsection (2) or sub-section (3), the commercial appellate division of the high court may, on the application of any of the parties to the suit, withdraw such suit or application from the court before which it is pending and transfer the same for trial or disposal to the commercial division or commercial court, as the case may be, having territorial jurisdiction over such suit, and such order of transfer shall be final and binding.\" 24. the proviso to section 15(2) makes it clear that no suit or application, where the final judgment has been reserved by the civil court prior to the constitution of a commercial court, need be transferred. as per sub-section (3) of section 15, once a suit or application is transferred to the commercial court, the provisions of the commercial courts act will apply to the procedures that are incomplete. to understand the relevance of this provision reference ought to be made to section 16 of the act, which reads as under; 24 nc: 2024:khc:28312 \"16. amendments to the civil procedure code, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes.--(1) the provisions of the civil procedure code, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the schedule. (2) the commercial division and commercial court shall follow the provisions of the civil procedure code, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value. (3) where any provision of any rule of the jurisdictional high court or any amendment to the civil procedure code, 1908, by the state government is in conflict with the provisions of the civil procedure code, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this act, the provisions of the code of civil procedure as amended by this act shall prevail.\" 25. thus, the provisions of the code of civil procedure have been amended in its application to suits in respect of commercial disputes, with the objective of speedy disposal of cases by the commercial courts. interestingly, there is no amendment to the provisions under order xxi cpc, dealing with execution of decrees. therefore, as far as execution is concerned, litigants still have to resort to the cumbersome and time consuming process under order xxi cpc. 26. in josekutty joseph (supra) the division bench interpreted the meaning, scope and ambit of sections 8 and 18 of the family courts act, section 8 excludes the jurisdiction of all other courts in respect of suits or proceedings falling within the jurisdiction of family courts under section 7, and section 18 stipulates that a decree or an order passed by a family court shall have the same force 25 nc: 2024:khc:28312 and effect as a decree or order of a civil court. the relevant paragraph of the judgment is extracted hereunder; \"7. it is true that by virtue of the provisions contained in sec. 7(1)(a) of the act, the family court shall have the power to exercise all the jurisdiction that was hitherto exercised by the civil court in respect of suits and proceedings of the nature referred to in the explanation. this means that whatever powers (including execution) which the civil court could have exercised in respect of such suits or proceedings stand vested in the family court upon its establishment. but the family court can exercise such powers (including execution) only in respect of a suit or proceeding which comes before it either by way of a statutory transfer or by way of fresh institution as contemplated by sec. 8 of the act. when the suit or proceeding referred to in the explanation to section 7(1) of the act can only be a suit or proceeding of an original nature instituted for the purpose of getting a decree, order or declaration as envisaged therein and which cannot necessarily include an execution petition, there cannot be a transfer under section 8(c)(i) of the act of a petition for executing a decree pending before the civil court on the date of establishment of the family court. it is one thing to say that the family court can exercise all the powers including execution in respect of such suit or proceeding by virtue of section 7(1)(a) of the act, but it is another thing to say that the statutory transfer under sec. 8(c) of the act takes within its sweep even petitions for execution of decrees already passed by the civil court and pending before such civil court on the date of establishment of the family court for the area concerned. section 18 of the act pertains only to decrees or orders passed by the family court and subsection (1) thereof only enacts a fiction by which a decree or order passed by the family court is deemed to be one passed by the civil court for the purpose of execution. it is significant in this context to note that there is no corresponding provision in the act treating the decree passed by the civil court as one passed by the family court. we are unable, in this connection, to accept the petitioner's contention that the deeming provision under section 7(1)(b) of the act is to treat the civil courts' decrees as one passed by the family court. in our view, the deeming provision thereunder is only to enable the family court to 26 nc: 2024:khc:28312 exercise the jurisdiction in such manner as the civil court would have exercised in a suit or other proceeding of such nature. the deeming provision is intended to indicate the procedure to be followed while dealing with such suit or proceeding and nothing else. as along as the decree passed by the civil court prior to the establishment of the family court is not deemed to be one passed by the family court, section 18 of the act which only deals with the execution of the decrees and orders passed by the family court, cannot have any application. if so, the only provision which can be applied to such a decree passed by the civil court is order 21, rule 10, c.p.c. which reads as under:-\"application for execution-where the holder of a decree desires to execute it, he shall apply to the court which passed the decree or to the officer (if any) appointed in this behalf, or if the decree has been sent under the provisions hereinbefore contained to another court, then to such court or to the proper officer thereof. thus, it is the court which passed the decree which is to be approached for executing the decree. indisputably, the court which passed the decree in this case is the subordinate judges' court. pala where the execution petition (e.p. 19/1997) was pending on the date of establishment of the family court for the area. e.p. 19/1997 not being an original proceeding-does not attract the statutory transfer under sec. 8(c) of the act. resultantly, the sub court, pala continues to have jurisdiction to deal with e.p. 19/1997 and bring it to a logical conclusion, notwithstanding the establishment of the family court for the area.\" 27. as observed earlier, the procedure for execution is not mentioned anywhere in the commercial courts act and there is nothing to indicate that the jurisdiction of other courts with respect to pending execution matters stands excluded. the absence of provision regarding execution or specific 27 nc: 2024:khc:28312 exclusion of jurisdiction of other courts with respect to execution procedures and the conscious omission to amend order xxi cpc for hastening the process of execution can only lead to the conclusion that the word \"application\" in section 15(1) does not include an 'execution application/petition' and the words, 'those procedures that are not complete at the time of transfer' in section 15(3) of the commercial courts act does not take in procedure relating to execution of decrees/awards. for the aforementioned reasons, i respectfully disagree with the dictum laid down by the gujarat high court in jagmohan bel (supra), insofar as it holds that the commercial court at the district level constituted under sub-section (1) of section 3 of the commercial courts act would be the court competent to execute awards declared under section 34 of the arbitration act. the aforesaid judgment was confirmed by the apex court in slp no.17433/2021 dated 01.12.2023. 17. similarly, the high court of chattisgarh in the case of south eastern coal fields ltd., vs. m/s.tirupathi constructions 2018 scc online chh 63, held as under:1. this is an application for transfer of pending execution application before the civil court to the commercial court under section 15(5) of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015 (for short the act, 2015) on the ground that under section 15(2) of the act, 2015 all 28 nc: 2024:khc:28312 suits and applications, including applications under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a commercial court has been constituted is required to be transferred to such commercial court, therefore, the present proceedings which is an application under section 36 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (for short the act, 1996) should be transferred to the commercial court. 2. having heard learned counsel for the applicant, it is to be seen that the word \"commercial dispute\" has been defined under section 2(1)(c) of the act, 2015 within which the present dispute between the parties is covered. however, even it is a commercial dispute, by virtue of proviso to sub-section (2) of section 15 no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the court prior to the constitution of commercial division or the commercial court shall be transferred either under subsection (1) and sub-section (2). 3. in the case at hand, the award was passed on 26.09.2003 and thereafter appeal against the said award preferred by the present applicant has also been dismissed. at present, execution case no. 7a of 2015 is pending before the district court in the form of an application under section 36 of the act, 1996. even if the word application is mentioned in sub-section (2) of section 15, it would mean an original application and not an application for execution of the award which is preferred after the award has been delivered. 4. it is not disputed before us that, at present, after dismissal of the applicant's appeal against the award, no further proceedings are pending before any court. however, learned counsel would inform that the process of preferring a slp before the supreme court is under way. 5. be that as it may, once the award has been rendered, the proceedings, at this stage, has become final 29 nc: 2024:khc:28312 and an application under section 36 of the act, 1996 for execution of award cannot be treated as an original or independent application de hors the main arbitration proceedings in which final award has already been rendered. 6. in our considered opinion, in view of the proviso, to subsection (2) of section 15, the execution application cannot be transferred to commercial court. the district judge has not committed any illegality while rejecting the applicant's application for transfer of the execution case to the commercial court. 7. accordingly, application is dismissed. the aforesaid judgment was confirmed by the apex court in slp no.3388/2019 dated 04.02.2019. 18. as held in the aforesaid judgments, the expression 'application' referred to in sections 6 and 15 of the said act of 2015, refers to original applications and not applications for execution as in the instant case; it is therefore clear that an application for execution under order 21 cpc which arises only after adjudication / completion / culmination of a dispute cannot be treated or construed as a commercial dispute which is capable of being entertained or warranting adjudication by a commercial court and as such, the impugned order passed by the commercial court holding that it has jurisdiction to try the instant execution 30 nc: 2024:khc:28312 proceedings instituted by the 1st respondent is clearly erroneous and deserves to be set aside. 19. a perusal of the proviso to section 15(2) of the said act of 2015 will indicate that once a final judgment is reserved by the civil court prior to constitution of the commercial court, such cases shall not be transferred to the commercial court; further the scheme of the act of 2015 including sections 15(3) and 15(4) are also a pointer to the position that the procedures, timelines etc., provided under the said act of 2015, were introduced for the purpose of adjudication of the proceedings / dispute on the original side and not at the stage of execution proceedings which undisputedly arise after completion/ adjudication / culmination of the proceedings and consequently, on this score also, the instant execution applications could not have been entertained / adjudicated upon by the commercial court as wrongly held in the impugned order. 20. a perusal of section 16 to the said act of 2015 will indicate that the same provides for amendments to the code of civil procedure, 1908, in its application to commercial disputes. the amendments to cpc pursuant to section 16 are set out in the schedule to the said act of 2015 which commences with 31 nc: 2024:khc:28312 amendments to section 26 cpc and ends at order 20 cpc; interestingly, provisions relating to execution proceedings viz., neither sections 38 to 54 nor order 21 cpc find a place in the schedule to the said act of 2015, which is yet another circumstance to come to the conclusion that the commercial court does not have jurisdiction or authority of law to adjudicate upon the instant execution proceedings and the impugned order deserves to be set aside on this ground also. 21. the respondents contend that the usage of the expression \"relating to a commercial dispute\" contained in both sections 6 and 15 of the said act of 2015, indicate that the commercial court would have jurisdiction to try execution proceedings also since the same relate to a commercial dispute and the commercial court was justified in passing the impugned order. the said contention urged by the 1st respondent cannot be accepted in as much as the aim and object of the said act of 2015 was to provide for speedy adjudication of commercial disputes on their original side prior to the same being concluded / completed by a judgment, decree or order; the expression \"in relation to a commercial dispute\" would necessarily have to be interpreted, 32 nc: 2024:khc:28312 construed and treated as a live / pending dispute prior to its adjudication by a court and requiring determination of the lis between the parties; the commercial dispute between the parties after adjudication by passing of a judgment, decree or order, no longer remains a live / pending dispute requiring adjudication, since the same already stands crystallized and fructified by the said judgment, decree or order, no longer requiring any further adjudication for the purpose of treating it as a pending commercial dispute or in relation to a commercial dispute requiring adjudication. under these circumstances, merely because the expression \"in relation to a commercial dispute\" is used / employed in sections 6 and 15 of the said act of 2015, the said circumstance cannot be made the basis by the 1st respondent ksfc to contend that the commercial court has jurisdiction to try execution proceedings also and consequently, even this contention urged by the 1st respondent cannot be accepted. 22. the respondents further contend that though the instant execution proceedings in ex.no.2673/2018 were originally filed before the city civil court, bangalore (cch-38), upon constitution of the commercial courts vide notification dated 17.08.2020, the same 33 nc: 2024:khc:28312 were transferred to the newly constituted commercial court, cch84, subsequent to which, one more notification dated 22.12.2020 was issued constituting an exclusive dedicated commercial court (cch-88), to which, the instant execution proceedings were transferred and since there were other execution cases also transferred from the civil court to the commercial court under the aforesaid notifications, the commercial court possessed necessary jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the instant execution proceedings also. the said contention of the respondents cannot be accepted, since a perusal of the aforesaid notifications dated 17.08.2020 and 22.12.2020 will clearly indicate that the same were not issued under section 15(2) of the said act of 2015; on the other hand, the said notifications invoke section 5(2) of the bangalore city civil courts act, 1979 r/w section 24 cpc for administrative purposes and for equal distribution of cases amongst commercial courts; the said notifications at any rate are not issued under section 15(2) and the same cannot be construed or treated as vesting jurisdiction in the commercial courts which otherwise does not have jurisdiction or authority of law to entertain or adjudicate the instant execution proceedings; to put it differently, the notifications could not confer jurisdiction upon the commercial court, particularly when there was 34 nc: 2024:khc:28312 inherent lack of jurisdiction on the part of the commercial court to adjudicate or entertain the instant execution proceedings and consequently, the impugned order deserves to be set aside. 23. a perusal of section 6 of the said act of 2015 will indicate that the commercial court shall have jurisdiction to try suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value; section 12 provides for determination of specified value and in this context, it would be profitable to extract section 12 of the said act of 2015, which reads as under:12. determination of specified value.--(1) the specified value of the subject-matter of the commercial dispute in a suit, appeal or application shall be determined in the following manner:-(a) where the relief sought in a suit or application is for recovery of money, the money sought to be recovered in the suit or application inclusive of interest, if any, computed up to the date of filing of the suit or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining such specified value; (b) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to movable property or to a right therein, the market value of the movable property as on the date of filing of the suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, 35 nc: 2024:khc:28312 shall be taken into account for determining such specified value; (c) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to immovable property or to a right therein, the market value of the immovable property, as on the date of filing of the suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining specified value; 1 [and] (d) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to any other intangible right, the market value of the said rights as estimated by the plaintiff shall be taken into account for determining specified value; 2[***] 3[* * *] (2) the aggregate value of the claim and counterclaim, if any as set out in the statement of claim and the counterclaim, if any, in an arbitration of a commercial dispute shall be the basis for determining whether such arbitration is subject to the jurisdiction of a commercial division, commercial appellate division or commercial court, as the case may be. (3) no appeal or civil revision application under section 115 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as the case may be, shall lie from an order of a commercial division or commercial court finding that it has jurisdiction to hear a commercial dispute under this act. 36 nc: 2024:khc:28312 24. a plain reading of section 12(1)(a) supra, will indicate that determination of specified value is based on the money sought to be recovered by the applicant in an application for recovery of money; it follows therefrom that what is contemplated is an original application for recovery of money and not an application which has fructified / crystallized into a decree / order which is put into execution for the purpose of implementation or enforcement; in other words, the specified value is dependent on the amount claimed by the applicant in the original application, which is an nonadjudicated and undetermined amount which has not fructified or crystallized into a decree or order; the moment the claim gets fructified and crystallized into a decree or order, the same no longer remains an amount sought to be recovered by the applicant for determining such specified value and consequently, an execution proceedings pursuant to a determined / adjudicated / crystallized / fructified claim cannot partake the nature of a commercial dispute capable of being entertained or adjudicated upon under section 6 of the said act of 2015. viewed from this angle also, the impugned order passed by the trial court deserves to be set aside. 37 nc: 2024:khc:28312 25. according to the petitioner, the execution proceedings have been instituted by the 1st respondent to enforce and implement the order dated 25.11.2015 passed in misc.521/2004 under sections 31 and 32 of the state financial corporations act, 1951 (for short 'the sfc act'). it is contended that in the instant execution proceedings, the application i.a.2 filed by the 1st respondent under section 151 cpc was not maintainable and the same was liable to be dismissed on this ground alone. 26. per contra, 1st respondent contends that due to oversight and inadvertence, order 21 rule 52 cpc which is the correct provision was not invoked by the 1st respondent in i.a.2 and the said application is to be treated as one filed under order 21 rule 52 cpc which empowers the executing court to attach the amount deposited in o.s.no.6229/2017 filed by the petitioner plaintiff as stated supra and the commercial court was fully justified in allowing the said application by passing the impugned order. 27. a perusal of the material on record and the judgments relied upon by both sides will indicate that though certain provisions of order 21 may be applicable to execution proceedings instituted pursuant to the order dated 25.11.2015 passed in misc.521/2004 38 nc: 2024:khc:28312 under sections 31 and 32 of the sfc act, in the absence of any statutory provision or any precedent to the effect that order 21 rule 52 would also apply and be applicable to the instant execution proceedings instituted pursuant to the aforesaid order, i am of the considered opinion that the application i.a.2 filed by the 1st respondent, albeit construed / treated as an application under order 21 rule 52 cpc was not maintainable and on this ground also, the said application was liable to be dismissed and failure to appreciate this, has resulted in erroneous conclusion. 28. a perusal of sections 36 to 54 cpc, in particular, section 38 will indicate that the facts of the instant case do not pertain to transfer of the order dated 25.11.2015 in misc.521/2004 passed by the city civil court to the commercial court under any of the aforesaid provisions; to put it differently, the contention of the 1st respondent that by virtue of section 38 cpc, the said order can either be executed by the very same court (city civil court), which passed the order or by the commercial court, to which the execution proceedings got transferred completely is clearly misconceived and untenable in the light of the undisputed fact that the instant ex.no.2673/2018 was not transferred from the city civil 39 nc: 2024:khc:28312 court to the commercial court under any of the provisions contained in section 36 to 54 cpc and on the other hand, the execution proceedings were transferred by invoking section 5(2) of the bangalore city civil courts act r/w section 24 cpc for administrative purposes and arrangement of cases, which is purely a ministerial act and as such, even this contention urged by the 1st respondent cannot be accepted. 29. it is well settled that if a suit / proceeding is before a court / forum without jurisdiction or authority of law, the question of entertaining any interlocutory application or passing any interlocutory order in such a suit / proceeding does not arise; as stated hereinbefore, i have already come to the conclusion that the commercial court does not have jurisdiction or authority of law to entertain or adjudicate upon the instant execution proceedings in com.ex.no.2673/2018 and consequently, the application i.a.2 which was allowed by the commercial court by the impugned order was not maintainable and the commercial court clearly misdirected itself in allowing the application warranting interference in the present petition. 40 nc: 2024:khc:28312 30. insofar as the various other judgments relied upon by both sides are concerned, in the factual matrix obtaining in the instant case, the said judgments are not referred to in detail for the purpose of the present order. 31. in the result, i pass the following: order (i) petition is hereby allowed. (ii) the impugned order dated 21.01.2023 passed on i.a.no.2 in commercial execution no.2673/2018 by the lxxxvii addl. city civil judge, (exclusive dedicated commercial court), bengaluru is hereby set aside. (iii) consequently, i.a.2 filed by the 1st respondent stands dismissed. sd/(s.r.krishna kumar) judge srl."
