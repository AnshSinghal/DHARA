Heard Sri Jaideep Narain Mathur Senior Advocate assisted by Sri Suyash Gupta Advocate, the learned Counsel for the petitioner and Shri Indu Prakash Singh, learned counsel for the respondent No.1 - Construction and Design Services, U.P. Jal Nigam and respondent no. 2 - U.P. Jal Nigam and Sri Pankaj Srivastava, the learned counsel for the respondent No.3 - Municipal Corporation, Meerut. \n2. By means of the instant petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the petitioner has sought a direction for expeditious disposal of Arbitration Case No.831 of 2019 pending in Commercial Court No. 2, Lucknow. The aforesaid case is an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act which was filed by the respondent no. 1 and 2 on 11.09.2019 challenging an Arbitration Award dated 29.05.2019 passed in favour of the petitioner. \n3. A copy of the entire order sheet of the proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act has been annexed with the petition. A copy of an order dated 10.07.2023 passed by this Court sitting at Allahabad in Transfer Application No.278 of 2021 has also been annexed with the petition. The said Transfer Application was filed by Meerut Municipal Corporation (respondent No.3 in this petition) seeking transfer of Case No. Nil of 2019 in the Court of the District Judge, Meerut, which was an application under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act filed by the respondent no. 3 on 05.10.2019 challenging the same arbitration award dated 29.05.2019. The Transfer Application was allowed by means of an order dated 10.07.2023 and the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 filed by the respondent no. 3 at Meerut was transferred to Lucknow and it was directed that that the same shall be heard along with Arbitration Case No.831 of 2019. After being transferred to Commercial Court - 2, Lucknow, the application under Section 34 filed by the respondent no. 3 has been registered as Arbitration Case No. 133 of 2023.\n4. When the case was taken up as fresh on 27.04.2024, the learned counsel for the respondent Nos.1 and 2 had sought two days' time to seek instructions in the matter. On 01.05.2009, the learned counsel for the respondent No.3 filed an application under Section 340 Cr.P.C. and the learned counsel for respondent No.1 and 2 filed counter affidavit/objections against the petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Subsequently, the respondent Nos.1 and 2 have also filed a counter affidavit. \n5. It is relevant to note that Section 34 (6) of Arbitration and Conciliation Act contains a statutory mandate that an application under this Section shall be disposed of expeditiously and in any event, within a period of one year from the date on which notice referred to in Sub Section (5) is served upon the other party. This statutory mandate cannot be altogether ignored by the Commercial Court and by this Court. \n6. The application under Section 34 is pending before a Commercial Court, which has been constituted under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The statement of objects and reasons of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 states that: -\n\"The proposal to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes has been under consideration of the Government for quite some time. The high value commercial disputes involve complex facts and question of law. Therefore, there is a need to provide for an independent mechanism for their early resolution. Early resolution of commercial disputes shall create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive Indian legal system.\"\n7. The object of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015, was inter alia, to amend the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as applicable to the Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions which shall prevail over the existing High Courts Rules and other provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases and to accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the Indian Justice delivery system, and the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation. \n8. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of Amendment Act 28 of 2018 states that \"The global economic environment has since become increasingly competitive and to attract business at international level, India needs to further improve its ranking in the World Bank 'Doing Business Report' which, inter alia, considers the dispute resolution environment in the country as one of the parameters for doing business. Further, the tremendous economic development has ushered in enormous commercial activities in the country including foreign direct investments, public private partnership, etc., which has prompted initiating legislative measures for speedy settlement of commercial disputes, widen the scope of the courts to deal with commercial disputes and facilitate ease of doing business. Needless to say that early resolution of commercial disputes of even lesser value creates a positive image amongst the investors about the strong and responsive Indian legal system. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015. \n9. The object of enactment of Commercial Court Act, 2015 shows that the legislature was concerned about the image of the Indian justice delivery system and the legal culture of the nation, which unfortunately is that the proceedings are not decided expeditiously in the courts in India. \n10. Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 provides as follows: -\n\"16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes.--(1) The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule.\n(2) The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value.\n(3) Where any provision of any Rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail.\"\n11. By means of Entry 6 of the Schedule appended to the Commercial Courts Act 2015, which is referred to in Section 16 (1), Chapter Xv-A has been inserted in C.P.C. applicable to the Commercial Courts, which contains provisions for holding a case management hearing. Rules 1, 2 and 3 of Order Xv-A C.P.C. applicable to the Commecial Courts provide as follows: -\n\"Order Xv-A Case Management Hearing\n1. First Case Management Hearing.--The court shall hold the first Case Management Hearing, not later than four weeks from the date of filing of affidavit of admission or  denial of documents by all parties to the suit . \n2. Orders to be passed in a Case Management Hearing.--In a Case Management Hearing, after hearing the parties, and once it finds that there are issues of fact and law which require to be tried, the court may pass an order-- (a) framing the issues between the parties in accordance with Order XIV of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) after examining pleadings, documents and documents produced before it, and on examination conducted by the court under Rule 2 of Order X, if required;\n(b) listing witnesses to be examined by the parties;\n(c) fixing the date by which affidavit of evidence to be filed by parties;\n(d) fixing the date on which evidence of the witnesses of the parties to be recorded;\n(e) fixing the date by which written arguments are to be filed before the court by the parties;\n(f) fixing the date on which oral arguments are to be heard by the court; and (g) setting time limits for parties and their advocates to address oral arguments. \n3. Time limit for the completion of a trial.--In fixing dates or setting time limits for the purposes of Rule 2 of this order, the court shall ensure that the arguments are closed not later than six months from the date of the first Case Management Hearing.\"\n12. The Commercial Court as well as this Court cannot ignore the provision contained in Section 34 (6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and the object of enactment of Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and the provisions of Order XV-A C.P.C. applicable to the Commercial Courts. \n13. The petitioner has approached this Court with a prayer for issuance of a direction for expeditious disposal of the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act in respect of an arbitration award passed way back on 29.05.2019. This Court cannot appreciate the opposition of the respondent No.3 against issuance of such a direction, when the arbitration award directs the respondents to pay a sum of Rs.Six Crores alongwith 18% interest, and the amount of interest is increasing with each passing day and it will be a burden on the public exchequer in case the outcome of the application under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act is not favourable to the respondents. \n14. The learned counsel for the petitioner has placed Reliance on an order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M/S Chopra Fabricators and Manufacturers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Bharat Pumps and Compressors Ltd. and another: (2023) 2 SCC 481, where in the Hon'ble Supreme Court expressed its serious concern about the delays in disposal of execution cases filed in the state of Uttar Pradesh for execution of arbitration awards. The Hon'ble Supreme Court had called for a report, which was submitted and after perusing the report, the Supreme Court observed that: - \n\"The statement, so placed before this Court, shows a very sorry state of affairs insofar as the disputes under the 1940 Act and under the 1996 Act are concerned. From the statement it appears that, 30,154 execution petitions are pending with various District Courts/regular courts in the State of U.P. and the oldest one is of the year 1981. Similarly, in the Commercial Courts, in the State of Uttar Pradesh, 13,367 execution petitions/applications are reported to be pending and the oldest one seems to be of the year 2002.\" \n15. The Hon'ble Supreme Court called for a response from the Chief Justice of this Court as to how this High Court proposes to deal with the pendency of the execution petitions / applications under Section 34 of the 1996 Act at the earliest and within some stipulated time period. The Chief Justice was requested to constitute a special arrears Committee of the judges of the High Court and invite suggestions and formulate a mechanism to tackle with the problem of arrears. \n16. The issue was addressed by this Court and certain steps were taken. Thereafter, a comparative status of pendency of arbitration matters was placed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which was taken into consideration in an order dated 21.01.2024 passed in the aforesaid case, which indicated that pendency of arbitration cases had reduced significantly after this Court addressed the issue of delay in disposal of execution cases relating to arbitration award. The Hon'ble Supreme Court expressed satisfaction with the steps taken by this High Court and observed that \"The steps taken by the High Court and the other courts may be continued in order to bring about a further reduction in the pendency of arbitration cases in Uttar Pradesh. \n17. The aforesaid direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court to continue efforts to bring about reduction in pendency of arbitration cases in Uttar Pradesh is to be honoured by this Court as also by the Commercial Court Lucknow. \n18. Shri Indu Prakash Singh, learned counsel for the respondent Nos.1 and 2 submitted that the petitioner is seeking expeditious disposal of Case No. 831 of 2019, which is the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act filed by the respondent No.1 and 2 only whereas the other application - Arbitration Case No. 133 of 2023 filed by the respondent no. 3 is also pending in same Court and it has also to be decided along with Case No. 831 of 2019. Therefore, he requests that in case a direction is issued for expeditious disposal of Case No. 831 of 2019, the same should be issued in respect of Arbitration Case No. 133 of 2023 also. \n19. Shri Pankaj Srivastava, learned counsel for the respondent No.3 Municipal Corporation Meerut, has seriously opposed the petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. It is interesting to note that the case which is sought to be expedited by the petitioner and which is being opposed by the respondent no. 3, has been filed by the respondent nos. 1 and 2 for setting aside an arbitration award passed in favour of the petitioner and the respondent no. 3 is merely a proforma respondent in this case.\n20. The learned Counsel for the respondent no. 3 has submitted that the petition has been filed concealing the fact that the proceedings of Case No. 831 of 2019 had been stayed by means of an order dated 05.07.2021 passed by this Court sitting at Allahabad in Transfer Application (Civil) No.278 of 2021. Therefore, the Commercial Court could not have proceeded with the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act till the Transfer Application was finally decided by means of the order dated 10.07.2023. He has submitted that the petition is liable to be dismissed as the petitioner has not approached this Court with clean hands. \n21. The respondent no. 3 has filed an application under Section 340 Cr.P.C. read with Article 215 of the Constitution of India filed, which has been titled as 'Perjury Application'. The prayer made in the application is to prosecute and suitably punish the petitioner and Sri Yuvraj Sharma the deponent of the affidavit filed in support of the petitioner under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, for committing the offence of perjury by suppressing true and correct facts and swearing false affidavit before this Court. \n22. A perusal of the Arbitration award, from which the proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act arises, indicates that the petitioner had filed an arbitration claim against the respondent Nos.1, 2 and 3 in the year 2012/2013. The arbitration award was passed on 29.05.2019 directing the respondents to pay amounts under various heads to the petitioner, aggregating to about Rs. 66 Crores, along with 18 % Simple Interest per annum. The liability of interest is increasing day by day and the delay in final disposal of the matter would not be in the interest of the respondent no. 3 also, yet the respondent no. 3 is strongly opposing the petition filed for seeking a direction of expeditious disposal of the matter. \n23. Although the arbitration proceedings were held at Lucknow, the arbitration award was passed at Lucknow on 29.05.2019 and the respondent Nos.1 and 2 had filed an application under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act bearing Arbitration Case No. 831 of 2019 in the Commercial Court No. 2, Lucknow on 11.09.2019 , the respondent No. 3 filed an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act challenging the same award before the District Judge, Meerut on 05.10.2019. \n24. Section 42 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act provides that where with respect to an arbitration agreement any application under Part-I of the Act has been made in a court, that court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that court and in no other court. Apparently, after an application under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act having been filed in Commercial Court at Lucknow on 11.09.2019, no subsequent application could be filed before any other court. Yet, the respondent No.3 filed the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act at Meerut on 05.10.2019.\n25. After expiry of about 1 year and 9 months since filing of the application at Meerut, on 24.06.2021 the respondent no. 3 filed Transfer Application (Civil) No. 278 of 2021 before this Court at Allahabad for transfer of the case from Meerut to Lucknow. An interim order dated 05.07.2021 was passed in the Transfer Application staying the proceedings of application under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act filed at Meerut as also the Arbitration Case No.831 of 2019 in the Commercial Court at Lucknow. \n26. When there is an arbitration award operating against the respondent Nos.1 to 3, all of whom are State Authorities and there is an award for payment of interest at the rate of 18 % on the awarded amount, the action of the respondent No.3 in first filing an application under Section 34 at Meerut, whereas a previous application had already been filed at Lucknow and the court at Meerut had no jurisdiction in view of the provision contained in Section 42 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, and thereafter filing an application for transfer of the case from Meerut to Lucknow after about 1 year and 9 months and then getting the proceedings under Section 34 pending at Lucknow also stayed for over two years, cannot be appreciated by the Court. This approach is against the interest of justice as also against the interests of the State, as any delay in disposal of the application under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act is in no way beneficial to the State. For the same reason, the action of the respondent No.3 in raising a serious objection and opposing the petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India seeking a direction for expeditious disposal of the proceedings under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, also cannot be appreciated. \n27. While opposing the petition, the learned counsel for the respondent No.3 has submitted that numerous arbitration proceedings were initiated by the petitioner in respect of various contracts of similar nature. In two other matters, proceedings had been expedited by this Court and thereafter the District Judge / Commercial Court started fixing short dates in the matter even though record of the arbitrator had not been received and some orders were passed in these matters, which were detrimental to the interest of the respondents. He has further submitted that the arbitrator's record has been summoned by the Commercial Court, Lucknow, which has not been received till date. In response to a specific query, the learned Counsel for the respondent no. 3 answered that the respondent no. 3 is not a party to any such proceedings in which the alleged orders have been passed. \n28. Merely because some other order passed in some other petition for expeditious disposal of this court has resulted in early dates being fixed in some other proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, wherein record has not been received, cannot be a ground to decline the prayer for expeditious disposal of proceedings under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act in accordance with the law. \n29. Regarding the apprehension of the learned Counsel for the respondent no. 3 that in case the proceedings are expedited, the Commercial Court will conclude the same without receipt of the record of the arbitrator and in violation of law, the Commercial Court will be bound to decide the case in accordance with the law only and this apprehension cannot be a ground to decline issuance of a direction for expeditious disposal of the application under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, more particularly when the direction would certainly include a direction to the court to proceed with the application \"in accordance with the law\". \n30. Keeping in view the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, the petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is allowed. A direction is issued to the learned Commercial Court No. 2, Lucknow to proceed with Arbitration Case No. 831 of 2019 and Arbitration Case No. 133 of 2023 expeditiously without granting any unnecessary adjournments to any of the parties, in accordance with law, particularly keeping in view the provisions contained in Section 34 (6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, the object of establishment of the Commercial Courts and the provisions contained in Section 16 read with Article 6 of the Schedule appended to the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \nOrder on Application filed under 340 Cr.P.C. read with Article 215 of the Constitution of India: -\n31. This is an application under Section 340 Cr.P.C. read with Article 215 of the Constitution of India filed by the respondent No.3-Municipal Corporation Meerut, which has been titled as 'Perjury Application'. The prayer made in the application is to prosecute and suitably punish the petitioner and Shri Yuvraj Sharma the deponent of the affidavit filed in support of the application, for committing offence of perjury by suppressing the fact that the proceedings of Arbitration case No. 831 of 2019 had remained pending since 05.07.2021 till 10.07.2023.\n32. Before commencement of submissions of this application Sri Jaideep Narain Mathur Senior Advocate, stated that the petitioner has committed an error in not disclosing the fact of proceedings having been stayed by this Court sitting at Allahabad in the petition filed under Article 227 of the constitution of India and he tenders unconditional apology for this mistake. However, he stated that the petitioner has disclosed the fact that the respondent no. 3 had filed Transfer Application (Civil) No. 278 of 2021 and he has annexed a copy of the order dated 10.07.2023 passed in that case. He has submitted that the mistake committed by the petitioner, regarding which an unconditional apology has been submitted, does not make out a case for prosecution under Section 340 Cr.P.C. and in case the learned counsel for respondent No. 3 agrees not to press this application, precious time of this Court may be saved so that it can be utilized for some more fruitful purpose but the learned counsel for respondent No.3 insisted that he will establish that a case for prosecution of the petitioner is made out and he would press his application under Section 340 Cr.P.C. Therefore, the Court had to proceed to hear submissions in support of the application and against it also and to pass an order thereon. \n33. The learned Counsel for the applicant submitted that Section 340 Cr.P.C. makes a reference to offences referred to in Clause B of sub-Section 1 of Section 195 Cr.P.C. Section 195 (1) (b) Cr.P.C. refers to the offences under Section 193 to 196, 199, 200, 205 to 211, 228, 463, 471, 475 and 476. He submitted that although he does not defend the mistake of the petitioner in not disclosing the complete facts before this Court, the aforesaid omission does not in any manner make out any of the offences enumerated in Section 195 (1)(b) Cr.P.C.\n34. The only ground on which the application under Section 340 Cr.P.C. has been filed is omission to disclose a stay order that was operating for a period 05.07.2021 to 10.07.2023. The learned Counsel for the respondent no. 3 has placed reliance on the provisions contained in Section 8 of the Oath's Act 1969, which provides that \"Every person giving evidence on any subject before any court or person hereby authorized to administer oaths and affirmations shall be bound to state the truth on such subject.\"\n35. Learned counsel for respondent No.3 has referred to Chapter4 Rule 17 of a Allahabad High Court Rules 1952 which provides as follows: -\n\"17. Oath or affirmation by deponent :- The person administering an oath or affirmation to the person making an affidavit, shall follow the provisions of the Indian Oaths Act, 1873. \nThe following forms are prescribed, namely-- Oath I swear that this my declaration is true; that it conceals nothing; and that no part of it is false. So help me God. \nAffirmation I solemnly affirm that this my declaration is true; that it conceals nothing; and that no part of it is false.\"\n36. However, the Oaths Act does not contain any provision which may make a person who omits to state the complete truth liable to be prosecuted under Section 340.\n37. The Court put a specific question to the learned counsel for respondent No.2 as to which of the offences enumerated under Section 195 (1)(b) Cr.P.C. is made out from the omission of the petitioner to disclose the proceedings having remain stayed by means of an stay order passed by this Court at Allahabad, but the Learned counsel for respondent No.3 could not point out any single offence mentioned in Section 195 Cr.P.C. which attracted in the present case. \n38. Section 191 I.P.C. provides as follows:-\n\"Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to give false evidence.\"\n39. Section 191 makes 'making any statement which is false'a punishable offence. The learned counsel for respondent No.3 had submitted that omitting to state complete truth also amount to making a false statement and, therefore, the omission of the petitioner in not stating about the stay order passed by this Court sitting at Allahabad, amounts to making a false statement. \n40. It is a well settled principle of interpretation of statutes that while interpreting a statute, the Court should give plain and simple meaning to the words used by the legislature and the Courts can neither add any word nor subtract any word from the words used by the legislature. \n41. The penal laws are required to be interpreted strictly. While interpreting a penal provision, the Court cannot enlarge the scope of the words used by the legislature. When the legislature did not make omission of stating any relevant fact to be an offence under Section 191, the petitioners cannot be punished for the omission to disclose the stay order, which omission would not affect the outcome of this petition in any manner. \n42. The learned Counsel for the respondent no. 3 has relied upon the decisions in the case of Dhananjay Sharma Vs. State of Haryana and Others (1995) 3 SCC 757, S. P. Chengal Varaya Naidu Vs. Jagannath and Others (1994) 1 SCC 1, Hamza Haji Vs. State of Kerala (2006) 7 SCC 416, K. D. Sharma Vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd. and Others (2008) 12 SCC 481 and ABCD Vs.Union of India and Others (2020) 2 SCC 52.\n43. In Dhananjay Sharma v. State of Haryana, (1995) 3 SCC 757 it was held that: -\n\"38. ... The swearing of false affidavits in judicial proceedings not only has the tendency of causing obstruction in the due course of judicial proceedings but has also the tendency to impede, obstruct and interfere with the administration of justice. The filing of false affidavits in judicial proceedings in any court of law exposes the intention of the party concerned in perverting the course of justice. The due process of law cannot be permitted to be slighted nor the majesty of law be made a mockery of by such acts or conduct on the part of the parties to the litigation or even while appearing as witnesses. Anyone who makes an attempt to impede or undermine or obstruct the free flow of the unsoiled stream of justice by resorting to the filing of false evidence, commits criminal contempt of the court and renders himself liable to be dealt with in accordance with the Act. Filing of false affidavits or making false statement on oath in courts aims at striking a blow at the rule of law and no court can ignore such conduct which has the tendency to shake public confidence in the judicial institutions because the very structure of an ordered life is put at stake. It would be a great public disaster if the fountain of justice is allowed to be poisoned by anyone resorting to filing of false affidavits or giving of false statements and fabricating false evidence in a court of law. The stream of justice has to be kept clear and pure and anyone soiling its purity must be dealt with sternly so that the message percolates loud and clear that no one can be permitted to undermine the dignity of the court and interfere with the due course of judicial proceedings or the administration of justice....\" \n44. In S. P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath, (1994) 1 SCC 1, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that: -\n\"1.Fraud avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical or temporal\" observed Chief Justice Edward Coke of England about three centuries ago. It is the settled proposition of law that a judgment or decree obtained by playing fraud on the court is a nullity and non est in the eyes of law. Such a judgment/decree -- by the first court or by the highest court -- has to be treated as a nullity by every court, whether superior or inferior. It can be challenged in any court even in collateral proceedings. \n* * *\n5... The courts of law are meant for imparting justice between the parties. One who comes to the court, must come with clean hands. We are constrained to say that more often than not, process of the court is being abused. Property-grabbers, tax- evaders, bank-loan-dodgers and other unscrupulous persons from all walks of life find the court-process a convenient lever to retain the illegal gains indefinitely. We have no hesitation to say that a person, who's case is based on falsehood, has no right to approach the court. He can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation.\" \n45. S. P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (Supra) was followed in Hamza Haji Vs. State of Kerala (Supra). \n46. In K.D. Sharma v. SAIL, (2008) 12 SCC 481, it was reiterated that: - \n\"34. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 32 and of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution is extraordinary, equitable and discretionary. Prerogative writs mentioned therein are issued for doing substantial justice. It is, therefore, of utmost necessity that the petitioner approaching the writ court must come with clean hands, put forward all the facts before the court without concealing or suppressing anything and seek an appropriate relief. If there is no candid disclosure of relevant and material facts or the petitioner is guilty of misleading the court, his petition may be dismissed at the threshold without considering the merits of the claim.\"\n47. S. P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (Supra) was followed in Hamza Haji Vs. State of Kerala (Supra). The Hon'ble Supreme Court did not discuss the provisions of Section 340 Cr.P.C. or Article 215 of the Constitution of India in any of the aforesaid cases. \n48. In ABCD v. Union of India, (2020) 2 SCC 52, it was held that: -\n\"15. Making a false statement on oath is an offence punishable under Section 181 of the IPC while furnishing false information with intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person is punishable under Section 182 IPC. These offences by virtue of Section 195(1)(a)(i) of the Code can be taken cognizance of by any court only upon a proper complaint in writing as stated in said section.\" \n49. In none of the cases cited by the learned Counsel for the respondent no. 3, an order for prosecution under Section 340 Cr.P.C. was passed. It is settled law that a judgment is an authority for what it actually decides and not for what can be deduced from it. In a Constitution Bench judgment in the case of P. S. Sathappan v. Andhra Bank Ltd., (2004) 11 SCC 672, it was held that:--\n\"118. ...It is well known that a judgment is an authority for what it decides and not what may even logically be deduced therefrom. \n* * *\n144. While analysing different decisions rendered by this Court, an attempt has been made to read the judgments as should be read under the rule of precedents. A decision, it is trite, should not be read as a statute. \n145. A decision is an authority for the questions of law determined by it. While applying the ratio, the court may not pick out a word or a sentence from the judgment divorced from the context in which the said question arose for consideration. A judgment, as is well known, must be read in its entirety and the observations made therein should receive consideration in the light of the questions raised before it. [See Haryana Financial Corpn. v. Jagdamba Oil Mills (2002) 3 SCC 496, Union of India v. Dhanwanti Devi (1996) 6 SCC 44, Nalini Mahajan (Dr.) v. Director of Income Tax (Investigation) (2002) 257 ITR 123 (Del) State of U.P. v. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. (1991) 4 SCC 139, A-One Granites v. State of U.P. (2001) 3 SCC 537, and Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd. (2003) 2 SCC 111],\n146. Although decisions are galore on this point, we may refer to a recent one in State of Gujarat v. Akhil Gujarat Pravasi V.S. Mahamandal (2004) 5 SCC 155, wherein this Court held:\n\"It is trite that any observation made during the course of reasoning in a judgment should not be read divorced from the context in which it was used.\"\n147. It is further well settled that a decision is not an authority for the proposition which did not fall for its consideration.\" \n50. Again, in Amrendra Pratap Singh versus Tej Bahadur Prajapati: (2004) 10 SCC 65, the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated that:--\n\"A judicial decision is an authority for what it actually decides and not for what can be read into it by implication or by assigning an assumed intention to the judges, and inferring from it a proposition of law which the judges have not specifically laid down in the pronouncement.\" \n51. Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner has placed reliance upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Sasikala Pushpa and Others Vs. State of Tamil Nadu (2019) 6 SCC 477, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that:-\n\"10. It is fairly well settled that before lodging of the complaint, it is necessary that the court must be satisfied that it was expedient in the interest of justice to lodge the complaint. It is not necessary that the court must use the actual words of Section 340 CrPC; but the court should record a finding indicating its satisfaction that it is expedient in the interest of justice that an enquiry should be made. Observing that under Section 340 CrPC, the prosecution is to be launched only if it is expedient in the interest of justice and not on mere allegations or to vindicate personal vendetta. In Iqbal Singh Marwah v. Meenakshi Marwah (2005) 4 SCC 370, this Court held as under:\n\"23. In view of the language used in Section 340 CrPC the court is not bound to make a complaint regarding commission of an offence referred to in Section 195(1)(b), as the section is conditioned by the words 'court is of opinion that it is expedient in the interests of justice'. This shows that such a course will be adopted only if the interest of justice requires and not in every case. Before filing of the complaint, the court may hold a preliminary enquiry and record a finding to the effect that it is expedient in the interests of justice that enquiry should be made into any of the offences referred to in Section 195(1)(b). This expediency will normally be judged by the court by weighing not the magnitude of injury suffered by the person affected by such forgery or forged document, but having regard to the effect or impact, such commission of offence has upon administration of justice. It is possible that such forged document or forgery may cause a very serious or substantial injury to a person in the sense that it may deprive him of a very valuable property or status or the like, but such document may be just a piece of evidence produced or given in evidence in court, where voluminous evidence may have been adduced and the effect of such piece of evidence on the broad concept of administration of justice may be minimal. In such circumstances, the court may not consider it expedient in the interest of justice to make a complaint.\" \n(Emphasis added) \n52. The petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India has been filed for issuance of a direction for expeditious disposal of the application under Section 34 of the arbitration Act, 1996, which in any case has to be decided expeditiously keeping in view the provisions contained in Section 34 (6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, the object of establishment of the Commercial Courts and the provisions contained in Section 16 read with Article 6 of the Schedule appended to the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The omission of the petitioner to state the fact of the stay order dated 05.07.2021 would not affect the decision of this petition and, therefore, this omission does not in any manner adversely affects the administration of justice. \n53. Although this fact would otherwise not be relevant for decision of the application under Section 340 Cr.P.C. but when the learned counsel for respondent No.3 has vehemently opposed the issuance of a direction for expeditious disposal of proceeding under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, it becomes relevant to notice the conduct of the respondent No.3. The respondent Nos.1 and 2 have filed an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act challenging the arbitration award on 11.09.2019. After that respondent No.3 filed another application under Section 34 for setting aside the same arbitration award at Meerut on 05.10.2019 whereas as per Section 42 of the Arbitration Act, the application could be filed at Lucknow only. Even after getting knowledge about the proceeding under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act pending at Lucknow, the respondent No.3 did not promptly take any steps for transfer of the application to appropriate Court and it filed Transfer Application No.278 of 2021 at Allahabad on 24.06.2021 and by means of an interim order passed in that transfer application filed by the respondent No.3 regarding the proceedings at Meerut, the proceedings of Arbitration Case No.831 of 2019 Lucknow were also stayed on 05.07.2021, which stay order continued till 10.7.2023 thereby causing a delay of more than 2 years in disposal of the application under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act. This conduct of the State Authorities when the arbitration award includes a direction for payment of 18% interest on the awarded amount, is detrimental to the public Ex-chequer and in turn to the public at large. Therefore, it appears that the respondent no. 3 itself is interfering in administration of justice by creating unwarranted obstacles in expeditious dispensation of justice. \n54. As neither there is averment in the application under Section 340 Cr.P.C. or in the affidavit filed in its support, nor the learned counsel for the petitioner could make it out in his submissions that the petitioner has committed any act which may amount to commission of an offence under Section 191 I.P.C., the application under Section 340 Cr.P.C. is misconceived and the same is accordingly dismissed.\n. \n(Subhash Vidyarthi J.)

(ii) even accepting that the appeal is barred by limitation then also the same is fit to be condoned in view of the provision of section 14 of the limitation act, 1963 which provides that the period consumed in the pending proceeding will have to be excluded from the period of limitation. 7. in support of his contention, he has relied upon the following judgments :page 3 (i) m/s mppkvv co. ltd. v. the commissioner (wp-54522018) [high court of madhya pradesh] (ii) m/s mppkvv co. ltd. v. the commissioner & others (writ petition no.-6363-2019) [high court of madhya pradesh] (iii) mppkvv co. ltd. v. goods and services tax and central excise commissioner, 2024 scc online sc 486 (iv) plasopan engineers (india) private limited v. commissioner of central excise, delhi (2015) 14 scc 667.

(viii) state of west bengal and ors. v. committee for protection of democratic rights, west bengal and ors. [(2010) 3 scc 571]. argument advanced on behalf of the respondent 8. while on the other hand, mr. prashant pallav, learned counsel appearing for the respondent, has vehemently opposed the submission made on behalf of the appellant by page 4 raising the grounds in dismissing the appeal on the ground of limitation. 9. it has been contended by referring to the provision of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 wherein statutory period has been provided for filing the appeal, i.e., within a period of 60 days. 10. it has been contended that the aforesaid provision of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 has been interpreted by hon'ble apex court in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited [(2021) 6 scc 460] wherein the consideration has been given regarding the applicability of the provision of section 5 of the limitation act, 1963. 11. learned counsel for the respondent, in order to strengthen his augment, has relied upon a judgment rendered by the hon'ble apex court in government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer) vs. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) wherein the hon'ble apex court while stretching the period of limitation in exceptional circumstances has observed that the limitation is to be condoned by way of exception and not by way of rule, page 5 i.e., only in case where a party has otherwise acted bona fide and not in a negligent manner. 12. it has been contended basing upon the aforesaid proposition of law as has been settled by hon'ble apex court in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) that in the matter of commercial disputes, where the primary object is to have the expeditious disposal of the disputes and that is the reason the statutory period has been provided under the provision of section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 to file appeal within a period of 60 days. 13. therefore, the power has been conferred to the court for condoning the delay in exceptional cases by allowing the application filed under section 5 of the limitation act, 1963 and in the rarest of rare cases, the said power can be exercised. 14. hence, according to the learned counsel, in the instant case if the litigant is able to show the sufficient cause which caused delay in filing the appeal, then only in exceptional circumstances the delay in filing the instant appeal can be condoned. 15. it has been submitted by referring to the factual aspect of the present case that the suit was filed before the page 6 commercial court having its jurisdiction and the defendant has filed a petition under order vii rule 11 of the c.p.c. for rejection of the plaint which has been allowed by rejecting the plaint. 16. the appellant preferred an appeal before this court being commercial appeal no.08 of 2022 but the relevant documents since were not filed, as such, the coordinate division bench of this court has dismissed the said appeal, however, with the liberty to the appellant to file a fresh commercial appeal with proper averments and documents annexed therewith within a period of 30 days, if so advised. 17. the submission, therefore, has been made that the limitation cannot be counted from the date of order passed by the coordinate division bench whereby and whereunder liberty has been granted to file appeal within a period of 30 days, rather, the period of 30 days has only been given for the purpose of filing appeal and, as such, it cannot be presumed that the limitation will be counted from the date of passing of the order by the coordinate bench in commercial appeal no.08 of 2022. 18. the reference of the provision of order xxiii rule 2 of the c.p.c. has also been made whereby and whereunder it has been provided that in any fresh suit instituted on permission granted under the last preceding rule, the page 7 plaintiff shall be bound by the law of limitation in the same manner as if the first suit had not been instituted. 19. the office, based upon the aforesaid provision of law, as provided under rule xxiii rule 2 of the c.p.c., has pointed out the limitation, then in such circumstances, it cannot be said that the said office note is improper and not acceptable. 20. the \"sufficient cause\" has also been taken into consideration in the judgment rendered in government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) whereby and whereunder it has been dealt with that the \"sufficient cause\" will only be said to be sufficient cause if the party concerned without any negligent approach has followed the legal procedure in filing the appeal with all due diligence. 21. herein, it cannot be said that the appellant has not shown the negligent attitude since, the very document upon which the reliance was placed by pointing out before the coordinate division bench and the very ground upon which the appeal was dismissed with a liberty to file a fresh one itself show that the appellant had not approached the court with all due diligence, rather, the appellant had approached this court in a very negligent manner. page 8 22. the argument, therefore, has been advanced that in such circumstances if the period of limitation will be waived to be counted from the date of the liberty so granted by the court of law, then the very purpose and object of the commercial courts act, 2015 will be frustrated. 23. the further argument has been advanced regarding the judgment upon which the reliance has been placed by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant with respect to the applicability of section 14 of the limitation act, 1963 is concerned, there is no dispute about the proposition of law regarding the applicability of section 14 of the limitation act, 1963 since section 14 is made to be applicable in a case where the litigant has approached the wrong forum after filing the appeal within statutory period and in such circumstances, the period consumed in pending litigation before the incorrect forum is to be excluded but that is not the factual aspect herein, rather, here the question of negligent approach and due diligence is the matter of concern since, the appellant had approached to the correct forum but in a negligent manner and without due diligence by not annexing the relevant document based upon that the said commercial appeal was dismissed with a liberty to file a fresh one. 24. thus, the instant case is neither the case of pending litigation before incorrect forum, rather, the forum was page 9 correct but certain documents were not filed which suggests the negligent approach of the appellant and the lack of diligence in pursuing the remedy of appeal. 25. the learned counsel, based upon the aforesaid ground, has submitted that since the delay is of 356 days and based upon the aforesaid reasons, the instant interlocutory application is fit to be dismissed. analysis and consideration 26. we have heard learned counsel for the parties, gone across the explanation shown in the instant interlocutory application as also the provision of law and the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the respective parties. 27. this court, before appreciating the rival submissions made on behalf of the parties, is of the view that the issue of limitation is to be dealt with herein for the purpose of showing the sufficient cause. 28. the consideration of meaning of 'sufficient cause' has been made in basawaraj & anr. vrs. spl. land acquisition officer, [(2013) 14 scc 81], wherein, it has been held at paragraphs 9 to 15 which read hereunder as:\"9. sufficient cause is the cause for which the defendant could not be blamed for his absence. the meaning of the word \"sufficient\" is \"adequate\" or \"enough\", inasmuch as may be necessary to answer the purpose intended. therefore, the word \"sufficient\" embraces no more than that which provides a platitude, which when the act done suffices to accomplish the purpose intended in the facts and page 10 circumstances existing in a case, duly examined from the viewpoint of a reasonable standard of a cautious man. in this context, \"sufficient cause\" means that the party should not have acted in a negligent manner or there was a want of bona fide on its part in view of the facts and circumstances of a case or it cannot be alleged that the party has \"not acted diligently\" or \"remained inactive\". however, the facts and circumstances of each case must afford sufficient ground to enable the court concerned to exercise discretion for the reason that whenever the court exercises discretion, it has to be exercised judiciously. the applicant must satisfy the court that he was prevented by any \"sufficient cause\" from prosecuting his case, and unless a satisfactory explanation is furnished, the court should not allow the application for condonation of delay. the court has to examine whether the mistake is bona fide or was merely a device to cover an ulterior purpose. (see manindra land and building corpn. ltd. v. bhutnath banerjee [air 1964 sc 1336], mata din v. a. narayanan [(1969) 2 scc 770 : air 1970 sc 1953] , parimal v. veena [(2011) 3 scc 545 : (2011) 2 scc (civ) 1 : air 2011 sc 1150] and maniben devraj shah v. municipal corpn. of brihan mumbai [(2012) 5 scc 157 : (2012) 3 scc (civ) 24 : air 2012 sc 1629] .) 10. in arjun singh v. mohindra kumar [air 1964 sc 993] this court explained the difference between a \"good cause\" and a \"sufficient cause\" and observed that every \"sufficient cause\" is a good cause and vice versa. however, if any difference exists it can only be that the requirement of good cause is complied with on a lesser degree of proof than that of \"sufficient cause\". 11. the expression \"sufficient cause\" should be given a liberal interpretation to ensure that substantial justice is done, but only so long as negligence, inaction or lack of bona fides cannot be imputed to the party concerned, whether or not sufficient cause has been page 11 furnished, can be decided on the facts of a particular case and no straitjacket formula is possible. (vide madanlal v. shyamlal [(2002) 1 scc 535 : air 2002 sc 100] and ram nath sao v. gobardhan sao [(2002) 3 scc 195 : air 2002 sc 1201] .) 12. it is a settled legal proposition that law of limitation may harshly affect a particular party but it has to be applied with all its rigour when the statute so prescribes. the court has no power to extend the period of limitation on equitable grounds. \"a result flowing from a statutory provision is never an evil. a court has no power to ignore that provision to relieve what it considers a distress resulting from its operation.\" the statutory provision may cause hardship or inconvenience to a particular party but the court has no choice but to enforce it giving full effect to the same. the legal maxim dura lex sed lex which means \"the law is hard but it is the law\", stands attracted in such a situation. it has consistently been held that, \"inconvenience is not\" a decisive factor to be considered while interpreting a statute. 13. the statute of limitation is founded on public policy, its aim being to secure peace in the community, to suppress fraud and perjury, to quicken diligence and to prevent oppression. it seeks to bury all acts of the past which have not been agitated unexplainably and have from lapse of time become stale. according to halsbury's laws of england, vol. 28, p. 266: \"605. policy of the limitation acts.--the courts have expressed at least three differing reasons supporting the existence of statutes of limitations namely, (1) that long dormant claims have more of cruelty than justice in them, (2) that a defendant might have lost the evidence to disprove a stale claim, and (3) that persons with good causes of actions should pursue them with reasonable diligence.\" an unlimited limitation would lead to a sense of insecurity and uncertainty, and therefore, limitation prevents disturbance or page 12 deprivation of what may have been acquired in equity and justice by long enjoyment or what may have been lost by a party's own inaction, negligence or laches. (see popat and kotecha property v. sbi staff assn. [(2005) 7 scc 510] , rajender singh v. santa singh [(1973) 2 scc 705 : air 1973 sc 2537] and pundlik jalam patil v. jalgaon medium project [(2008) 17 scc 448 : (2009) 5 scc (civ) 907] .) 14. in p. ramachandra rao v. state of karnataka [(2002) 4 scc 578 : 2002 scc (cri) 830 : air 2002 sc 1856] this court held that judicially engrafting principles of limitation amounts to legislating and would fly in the face of law laid down by the constitution bench in abdul rehman antulay v. r.s. nayak [(1992) 1 scc 225 : 1992 scc (cri) 93 : air 1992 sc 1701] . 15. the law on the issue can be summarised to the effect that where a case has been presented in the court beyond limitation, the applicant has to explain the court as to what was the \"sufficient cause\" which means an adequate and enough reason which prevented him to approach the court within limitation. in case a party is found to be negligent, or for want of bona fide on his part in the facts and circumstances of the case, or found to have not acted diligently or remained inactive, there cannot be a justified ground to condone the delay. no court could be justified in condoning such an inordinate delay by imposing any condition whatsoever. the application is to be decided only within the parameters laid down by this court in regard to the condonation of delay. in case there was no sufficient cause to prevent a litigant to approach the court on time condoning the delay without any justification, putting any condition whatsoever, amounts to passing an order in violation of the statutory provisions and it tantamounts to showing utter disregard to the legislature.\" page 13 29. thus, it is evident that the sufficient cause means that the party should not have acted in a negligent manner or there was a want of bona fide on its part in view of the facts and circumstances of a case or it cannot be alleged that the party has \"not acted deliberately\" or \"remained inactive\". however, the facts and circumstances of each case must afford sufficient ground to enable the court concerned to exercise discretion for the reason that whenever the court exercises discretion, it has to be exercised judiciously. the applicant must satisfy the court that he was prevented by any \"sufficient cause\" from prosecuting his case, and unless a satisfactory explanation is furnished, the court should not allow the application for condonation of delay. 30. it is thus evident from the aforesaid proposition of law that the said judgment has been passed on consideration of the issue of condonation of delay while entertaining the application under section 5 of the limitation act, 1963. 31. thus, it is evident that the aforesaid judgment has considered the applicability of section 5 of the limitation act to be made applicable in a case where the delay is to be condoned depending upon the sufficient cause if shown by the concerned litigant that is the general principle of applicability of section 5 of the limitation act. page 14 32. herein, section 14 of the limitation act is also required to be dealt with, for ready reference the same is referred herein:\"14. exclusion of time of proceeding bona fide in court without jurisdiction.--(1) in computing the period of limitation for any suit the time during which the plaintiff has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance or of appeal or revision, against the defendant shall be excluded, where the proceeding relates to the same matter in issue and is prosecuted in good faith in a court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it. (2) in computing the period of limitation for any application, the time during which the applicant has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance or of appeal or revision, against the same party for the same relief shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it. (3) notwithstanding anything contained in rule 2 of order xxiii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), the provisions of sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to a fresh suit instituted on permission granted by the court under rule 1 of that order, where such permission is granted on the ground that the first suit must fail by reason of a defect in the jurisdiction of the court or other cause of a like nature. explanation.--for the purposes of this section,-(a) in excluding the time during which a former civil proceeding was pending, the day on which that proceeding was instituted and page 15 the day on which it ended shall both be counted; (b) a plaintiff or an applicant resisting an appeal shall be deemed to be prosecuting a proceeding; (c) misjoinder of parties or of causes of action shall be deemed to be a cause of a like nature with defect of jurisdiction.\" 33. it is evident from the provision of section 14 of the limitation act that the period in approaching the appellate forum even after the due diligence of the concerned litigant if the appeal has been filed before incorrect forum and subsequently the same has not been entertained and liberty if granted to approach the appropriate forum, then the pending proceeding before the incorrect forum is to be excluded. 34. the word \"diligence\" is having bearing over the applicability of section 14 of the limitation act, 1963 which means that if the party has approached with due diligence but not before the correct forum, rather, before the incorrect forum, in such circumstances, the period consumed in pending litigation before the incorrect forum is to be excluded. 35. the judgment upon which the reliance has been placed regarding the applicability of section 14 of the limitation act, i.e., m/s laxmi srinivasa r and p boiled rice mill v. the state of andhra pradesh & anr. (supra), and purni devi page 16 & anr. v. babu ram & anr. (supra), speaks about the said principle. 36. but we are here dealing with a special enactment, i.e., commercial courts act, 2015. therefore, the basic object of the commercial courts act, 2015 is to be taken into consideration which is mainly for the purpose of expeditious disposal of the commercial disputes. 37. the commercial courts act, 2015 has been brought into force even though the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 was in vogue the day when the commercial courts act, 2015 was enacted. but, under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, there was no rigid principle has been made applicable in condoning the delay and that is the reason the commercial courts act, 2015 has been enacted by carving out a forum as under section 13 thereof, for ready reference section 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015 is being quoted hereunder as :\"13. appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions.--(1) 1 [any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court below the level of a district judge may appeal to the commercial appellate court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order. (1a) any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court at the level of district judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that page 17 high court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order: provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996).] (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\" 38. it is evident from the provision of section 13 that the appeal is to be filed before the high court having appellate jurisdiction within a period of 60 days from the date of judgment/decree. 39. the aforesaid provision does not refer about the applicability of section 5 of the limitation act, as per the original enactment. however, the hon'ble apex court in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) has taken into consideration the aforesaid issue by taking into consideration the fact that the rigid principle of section 5 of the limitation act is not applicable in the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 but the applicability of section 5 of the limitation act, 1996 has been made applicable with all rigidity if the provision of section 13 of the page 18 commercial courts act, 2015 will be taken into consideration. 40. the hon'ble apex court, by taking into consideration the very object and intent of the commercial courts act, 2015 as under the relevant paragraph has considered the issue of applicability to condone the delay whereby and whereunder the application of section 5 of the limitation act has been held to be acceptable but with the condition that the same is to be applied with all circumspection in a case where there is delay if caused in filing the appeal by taking into consideration the bona fide approach of the litigant concerned and it is not in the negligent manner. 41. this court since has referred the judgment rendered by the hon'ble apex court in government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer) vs. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) wherein the prayer for condonation of delay of 131 days was there for which explanation was furnished of file pushing and administrative exigency; further while refusing to condone the delay of 75 days due to the procedural approval and the ground since the appellant is a public entity under the energy department of the state government the delay caused in filing the appeal has been said to be bona fide and as such deserves to be condoned but such explanation, does not find the same as sufficient page 19 ground for condonation of delay. even the delay of 200 days in filing the appeal was refused to be condoned while passing order in s.l.p. (c) no. 18079 of 2020, for ready reference, paragraphs 53,58, 63 and 64 of the aforesaid judgment are being quoted herein: \"53. however, the matter does not end here. the question still arises as to the application of section 5 of the limitation act to appeals which are governed by a uniform 60-day period of limitation. at one extreme, we have the judgment in n.v. international [n.v. international v. state of assam, (2020) 2 scc 109 : (2020) 1 scc (civ) 275] which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and at the other extreme, we have an open-ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown. it is between these two extremes that we have to steer a middle course. 58. given the object sought to be achieved under both the arbitration act and the commercial courts act, that is, the speedy resolution of disputes, the expression \"sufficient cause\" is not elastic enough to cover long delays beyond the period provided by the appeal provision itself. besides, the expression \"sufficient cause\" is not itself a loose panacea for the ill of pressing negligent and stale claims. . 63. given the aforesaid and the object of speedy disposal sought to be achieved both under the arbitration act and the commercial courts act, for appeals filed under section 37 of the arbitration act that are governed by articles 116 and 117 of the limitation act or section 13(1-a) of the commercial courts act, a delay beyond 90 days, 30 days or 60 days, respectively, is to be condoned by way of exception and not by way of rule. in a fit case in page 20 which a party has otherwise acted bona fide and not in a negligent manner, a short delay beyond such period can, in the discretion of the court, be condoned, always bearing in mind that the other side of the picture is that the opposite party may have acquired both in equity and justice, what may now be lost by the first party's inaction, negligence or laches. 64. coming to the facts of the appeals before us, in the civil appeal arising out of slp (c) no. 665 of 2021, the impugned judgment of the high court of bombay, dated 17-12-2020 [state of maharashtra v. borse bros. engineers & contractors (p) ltd., 2020 scc online bom 10453] , has found that the government of maharashtra had not approached the court bona fide, as follows : (borse brothers case [state of maharashtra v. borse bros. engineers & contractors (p) ltd., 2020 scc online bom 10453] , scc online bom para 7) \"7. i have carefully gone through the papers. there can be no doubt in view of the documentary evidence in the form of copy of the application tendered by the advocate representing the applicant for obtaining a certified copy (ext. r-1) that in fact, after pronouncement of the judgment and order in the proceeding under section 34 of the act, the advocate concerned had applied for certified copy on 14-5-2019. the endorsement further reads that it was to be handed over to mr a.d. patil of the irrigation department, dhule, who is a staff from the office of the applicant. the further endorsements also clearly show that the certified copy was ready and was to be delivered on 27-52019. inspite of such a stand and document, the applicant has not controverted this or has not come up with any other stand touching this aspect. it is therefore apparent that the applicant is not coming to the court with clean hands even page 21 while seeking the discretionary relief of condonation of delay. 66. in the civil appeal arising out of slp (c) no. 15278 of 2020, the impugned judgment of the high court of madhya pradesh dated 27-12020 [m.p. poorv kshetra vidyut vitran co. ltd. v. swastik wires, 2020 scc online mp 3003] relies upon consolidated engg. [consolidated engg. enterprises v. irrigation deptt., (2008) 7 scc 169] and thereby states that the judgment of this court in n.v. international [n.v. international v. state of assam, (2020) 2 scc 109 : (2020) 1 scc (civ) 275] would not apply. the judgment of the high court is wholly incorrect inasmuch as consolidated engg. [consolidated engg. enterprises v. irrigation deptt., (2008) 7 scc 169] was a judgment which applied the provisions of section 14 of the limitation act and had nothing to do with the application of section 5 of the limitation act. n.v. international [n.v. international v. state of assam, (2020) 2 scc 109 : (2020) 1 scc (civ) 275] was a direct judgment which applied the provisions of section 5 of the limitation act and then held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days. the high court was bound to follow n.v. international [n.v. international v. state of assam, (2020) 2 scc 109 : (2020) 1 scc (civ) 275] , as on the date of the judgment of the high court, n.v. international [n.v. international v. state of assam, (2020) 2 scc 109 : (2020) 1 scc (civ) 275] was a judgment of the two learned judges of the supreme court binding upon the high court by virtue of article 141 of the constitution. on this score, the impugned judgment of the high court deserves to be set aside. 67. that apart, on the facts of this appeal, there is a long delay of 75 days beyond the period of 60 page 22 days provided by the commercial courts act. despite the fact that a certified copy of the district court's judgment was obtained by the respondent on 27-4-2019, the appeal was filed only on 9-9-2019, the explanation for delay being: \"2. that, the certified copy of the order dated 1-4-2013 was received by the appellant on 27-4-2019. thereafter the matter was placed before the cgm purchase mppkvvcl for the compliance of the order. the same was then sent to the law officer, mppkvvcl for opinion. 3. that after taking opinion for appeal, and approval of the authorities concerned, the officer-in-charge was appointed vide order dated 23-7-2019. 4. that, thereafter due to bulky records of the case and for procurement of the necessary documents some delay has been caused however, the appeal has been prepared and filed pursuant to the same and further delay. 5. that due to the aforesaid procedural approval and since the appellant is a public entity formed under the energy department of page 8 of 20 commercial appeal no. 20 of 2019 the state government, the delay caused in filing the appeal is bona fide and which deserve[s] to be condoned.\" 68. this explanation falls woefully short of making out any sufficient cause. this appeal is therefore allowed and the condonation of delay is set aside on this score also. 69. in the civil appeal arising out of slp (c) diary no. 18079 of 2020, there is a huge delay of 227 days in filing the appeal, and a 200-day delay in refiling. the facts of this case also show that page 23 there was no sufficient cause whatsoever to condone such a long delay. the impugned judgment of the high court of delhi dated 15-102019 [union of india v. associated construction co., 2019 scc online del 10797] cannot be faulted on this score and this appeal is consequently dismissed.\" 42. the reference is also required to be made of the provision of order xxiii rule 2 of the code of civil procedure wherein it has been provided that the liberty can be granted by the concerned court but while granting liberty, the limitation is to be counted as if the subsequent suit is the first one, i.e., from the date of original judgment, for ready reference, rule xxiii rule 2 is being quoted herein :\"2. limitation law not affected by first suit.--in any fresh suit instituted on permission granted under the last preceding rule, the plaintiff shall be bound by the law of limitation in the same manner as if the first suit had not been instituted.\" 43. adverting to the factual aspect of the present case, herein the case was filed by the appellant/plaintiff but one petition was filed by the defendant under order vii rule 11 of the c.p.c. for rejection of the plaint. the plaint was rejected vide order dated 15.03.2022. the said order was challenged before this court by filing appeal being commercial appeal no.08 of 2022. submission was made before the coordinate division bench that due to non-filing of certain documents the appeal is not fit to be argued otherwise it will cause prejudice and the prayer for page 24 withdrawal of the appeal was made with a liberty to file a fresh one along with the copy of documents and proper pleadings. 44. the coordinate division bench of this court vide order dated 06.04.2023 has acceded to the submission and dismissed the appeal however, with liberty to file afresh within a period of 30 days, for ready reference the order dated 06.04.2023 is being quoted hereunder :\"the order dated 15th march 2022 passed in commercial case no. 63 of 2020 has been challenged by mongia steel limited primarily on the ground that in the previous proceeding vide order dated 29th september 2020 the application under order xxiii rule 1(3) of the code of civil procedure filed by the appellant who was the plaintiff was allowed, with consent of the defendant. notwithstanding that, commercial case no. 63 of 2020 has been dismissed as barred in law under order vii rule 11 of the code of civil procedure. surprisingly, the pleading of title suit no. 06 of 2015 and the proceedings therein including the order dated 29th september 2020 have not been brought on record. while so this commercial appeal is dismissed with liberty to the appellant to file a fresh commercial appeal with proper averments and documents annexed therewith within a period of thirty days, if so advised.\" 45. the interpretation which is being given by the learned counsel for the appellant by placing the order passed by the coordinate division bench that since the liberty was granted to the appellant to file appeal within a period of 30 days, page 25 hence, the appeal was to be filed within the period of 30 days and accordingly, the instant appeal has been filed within the period of 30 days and, therefore, it is not the case where the limitation is to be counted. 46. this court is not in agreement with the aforesaid interpretation of the order dated 06.04.2023 in view of the fact the coordinate division bench has simply granted liberty by giving maximum time to prefer appeal, i.e., within the period of 30 days, that does not mean while granting such liberty the provision under order xxiii rule 2 is given a go bye. 47. granting liberty to file an appeal within the period of 30 days does not mean that the limitation will not be the issue if the appeal will be filed within the period of 30 days. 48. the provision of c.p.c. since contains a provision that the period of limitation is to be counted in case of liberty having been granted to approach the court and the period of limitation will be counted from the date of judgment/decree. otherwise, keeping into consideration the very object and intent of commercial courts act, 2015 in the present facts of the case, the object of the said act will be redundant which is mainly for the expeditious disposal of the commercial disputes. if such thing will be allowed to be carried out, then the party concerned will be indulged in such practice which will ultimately lead to lingering of the commercial disputes page 26 and will ultimately frustrate the very object and intent of the commercial courts act, 2015. 49. therefore, the aforesaid object has been taken into consideration by the hon'ble apex court also in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) as per the paragraphs which have been referred hereinabove wherein also the object of the commercial courts act, 2015 has been taken into consideration based upon that the hon'ble apex court has laid down the proposition that although the section 5 of the limitation act has limited applicability under the statutory provision as contained in the commercial courts act, 2015 but conferring discretionary power to the concerned court in the rarest of rare case to condone the delay of a very shorter period depending upon the sufficient cause as also if there is no negligent approach of the party concerned. 50. the negligent approach has been taken into consideration and the due diligence said to be the sufficient cause for condoning the delay is the two parameters for the purpose of condoning the delay as per the judgment passed by hon'ble apex court in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented page 27 by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra). 51. sufficient cause has also been interpreted by hon'ble apex court in the judgment referred hereinabove and if the spirit of the judgments will be taken into consideration in the context of the commercial courts act, 2015, it would be evident that for the purpose of expeditious disposal, it is the bounden duty of the concerned court that in the rarest of rare case the principle is to be made applicable in view of the judgment rendered in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra), as such, the conduct of the party concerned is to be taken into consideration so as to reach to the conclusion as to whether the conduct of the parties is in negligent manner or any due diligence is there or not. 52. herein, it is the admitted case of the appellant that due to the non-filing of the documents and proper pleadings, the appeal was sought to be withdrawn and accordingly the court has granted such leave, however with the liberty to file commercial appeal afresh. 53. thus, filing of appeal without documents cannot be said to be diligent approach of the appellant concerned, rather, it will be said to be negligent approach. page 28 54. herein, taking into consideration the admitted case of the appellant that two documents were not filed and there was no proper pleading at the time of filing of the appeal at the first instance, i.e. commercial appeal no.08 of 2022, therefore, according to our considered view, it cannot come under the fold of rarest of rare case. 55. further, the period of delay is also of 356 days, the hon'ble apex court, in the government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) has refused to condone the delay of 75 days, 131 days and 200 days. 56. the learned counsel for the appellant however has tried to impress upon the court by applying the provision of section 14 of the limitation act, 1963. 57. but the applicability of section 14 of the limitation act is not in dispute, rather, the applicability of section 14 is to be taken into consideration in the light of the judgment rendered by hon'ble apex court in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra) where the specific act, i.e., commercial courts act, 2015 has been taken into consideration. page 29 58. further, it is not the case herein that incorrect forum was approached by the litigant concerned/appellant, rather, the forum was correct but the pleading was not proper and the documents were not appended with the memo of appeal, therefore, in that view of the matter also, it is not a case where the principle laid down under section 14 of the limitation act is to be made applicable. 59. the period of delay is 356 days in the present case and the explanation so furnished by the applicant is that the appeal since has been filed within the period of 30 days, hence, the appeal cannot be said to be barred by limitation of 356 days, save and except that, there is no explanation. 60. since we have already dealt with that the limitation is to be counted in view of the provision as contained under the commercial courts act, 2015 from the date of judgment and the appeal to be filed within the period of 60 days. 61. the office by taking into consideration the aforesaid statutory provision, since has pointed out the delay of 356 days, but there is no explanation save and except the explanation that the appeal has been filed within the period of 30 days from the date of order passed by the coordinate division bench of this court on 06.04.2023 in commercial appeal no.08 of 2022. 62. the law is settled that the things are to be done strictly in accordance with the statutory provision and there cannot page 30 be interpretation beyond the statutory provision. reference in this regard may be taken from the judgments rendered by the hon'ble apex court in state of uttar pradesh vs. singhara singh and ors., air (1964) sc 358 (para-25), babu verghese and ors. vs. bar council of kerala and ors., (1999) 3 scc 422 (para-31,32), commissioner of income tax, mumbai vs. anjum m.h. ghaswala & ors., (2002) 1 scc 633 (para-27), state of jharkhand & ors. vs. ambay cements & anr., (2005) 1 scc 368 (para-26) and zuari cement ltd. vs. regional direction esic hyderabad & ors., (2015) 7 scc 690 (para-14,26). 63. the order passed by the coordinate division bench if taken into consideration the principle of harmonious interpretation of the statutory provision as contained under section 13 of the act 2015, it would be evident that the purport of the order passed by the coordinate division bench is only to file the appeal within the period of 30 days which does not mean that the statutory mandate to file appeal within the period of 60 days from the date of decree/judgment is to be waived out. 64. this court, taking into consideration the aforesaid reasons, is of the view that the instant interlocutory application is not fit to be allowed due to the absence of the sufficient explanation as also in view of the discussion made by referring the provision of rule xxiii rule 2 c.p.c. and the page 31 principle laid down by hon'ble apex court in the case of government of maharashtra (water resources department) represented by executive engineer v. borse brothers engineers and contractors private limited (supra). 65. accordingly, the instant interlocutory application deserves to be dismissed and the same is hereby dismissed. commercial appeal no.08 of 2023 66. due to dismissal of the i.a. no.11047 of 2023 on the ground of limitation, the instant commercial appeal also stands dismissed. i agree (b.r.sarangi, c.j.)
