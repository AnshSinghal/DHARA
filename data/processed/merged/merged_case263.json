Heard the learned counsel Sri.Joshua Hudson Samuel for petitioner/defendant and learned counsel Ms.Tamarra Sequeira for Caveator/respondent. Perused the entire writ petition papers. \n3. Brief facts of the case are that petitioner initiated arbitration proceedings against respondent in CMP No.345/2017. The Arbitrator was appointed to resolve the dispute between the petitioner and respondent. It is stated that Arbitrator conducted proceedings in A.C.No.92/2018 and passed interim award dated 14.11.2018 and final award dated 30.09.2019 directing the respondent to furnish bank guarantee for Rs.2 Crores under interim award and directed the respondent to pay a sum of USD 7,92,369 with 18% interest under the final award. The said award dated 30.09.2019 was challenged under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, 'Arbitration Act') before the Commercial Court, Bengaluru by respondent herein in A.P.No.1/2020. The petitioner also challenged portion of the award under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act in A.S.No.182/2019.\n4. In A.P.No.1/2020 filed by respondent herein, the Commercial Court on application by the respondent herein passed an interim order dated 17.03.2020 staying the execution of award, subject to the respondent depositing 60% of the award amount and on furnishing security for the balance 40% by way of bank guarantee. The respondent in pursuance to interim order dated 17.03.2020, deposited a sum of Rs.4,80,02,855/- before the Registrar, City Civil Court and also furnished bank guarantee for a sum of Rs.3,20,01,903/- in the name of the Registrar, City Civil Court, Bengaluru. Thereafter, both the proceedings initiated under Section 34 of Arbitration Act by the petitioner as well as respondent were heard and dismissed. The Commercial Court while dismissing A.P.No.1/2020 directed that 60% of the award amount in deposit be released in favour of the petitioner herein who was respondent before the Commercial Court. No order was passed in respect of the bank guarantee furnished to the Court. The petitioner's A.S.No.182/2019 was dismissed under judgment dated 30.10.2021, against which Commercial Appeal No.7/2021 is pending before this Court. \n5. On dismissal of A.P.No.1/2020 filed by respondent herein by judgment dated 30.10.2021, the petitioner herein filed application dated 18.05.2022 under Section 151 of CPC seeking a direction to the Registrar, City Civil Court, Bengaluru to invoke bank guarantee dated 07.10.2021 and disburse the amount to the petitioner, since bank guarantee was offered as security for the award amount under Order dated 17.03.2020. The said application was opposed by respondent by filing objections contending that the Court had become functus officio and as such the Court would not get jurisdiction to entertain the application. It is also contended that bank guarantee was in the nature of security and was never intended to be disbursed to the respondent. It is also stated that when the petitioner had preferred Commercial Appeal No.7/2022 before this Court praying to set aside the award, the petitioner cannot seek for enforcement of bank guarantee. It is also stated in the objections that petitioner's claim has not attained finality and petitioner is required to initiate execution proceedings in respect of any amount which it claims. \n6. The bank guarantee was extended from time to time and it was extended till 31.07.2023. The Commercial Court by order dated 26.07.2022, dismissed the application filed under Section 151 of CPC by the petitioner, which had sought a direction to invoke the bank guarantee on the ground that the bank guarantee was taken at the time of passing order of stay of the operation of award and it is open for the petitioner herein to take steps for execution of the award. The said order dated 26.07.2022 dismissing application of the petitioner was the subject matter of writ petition before this Court in W.P.No.22221/2022. This Court by order dated 08.06.2023, allowed the writ petition, set aside the order dated 26.07.2022, remitted the matter back to the Commercial Court for re-consideration by treating the application as Review Petition/application and to pass appropriate orders in accordance with law. \n7. The respondent herein filed Review Petition No.282/2023 against the order dated 08.06.2023 in W.P.No.22221/2022 and the said Review Petition was disposed of by order dated 22.06.2023 making it clear that all rival contentions on all aspects of the application including maintainability/non-maintainability are kept open to be decided by the Commercial Court, without expressing any opinion. Thereafter, the Commercial Court on re-consideration of the application, passed the impugned order dated 15.07.2023 rejecting the application of the petitioner filed under Section 151 of CPC seeking invocation of bank guarantee dated 07.10.2021 on the ground that as the Arbitration Act does not provide for review of order passed under Section 34 of Arbitration Act, the provisions of Section 47 and Section 114 of CPC cannot be applied and the Review Petition would not be maintainable. Further, it also observed that Section 34 Petition cannot be converted as petition under Section 36 for enforcement of award, that too without paying the stamp duty on the award. Aggrieved by the said order, petitioner is before this Court in this writ petition. \n8. Learned counsel Sri.Joshua Hudson Samuel has contended that,\n(i) bank guarantee was furnished by respondent as security in terms of interim order dated 17.03.2020 in A.P.No.1/2020. On dismissal of A.P.No.1/2020 filed by respondent herein, the Commercial Court ought to have invoked bank guarantee given as security and ought to have directed payment to the petitioner towards the amount due under award. \n(ii) The Commercial Court having directed the amount in deposit be paid to the petitioner, failed to invoke bank guarantee. The security furnished in the form of bank guarantee was towards the award under challenge and when the challenge to award by respondent was dismissed, the Commercial Court in exercise of its power ought to have directed invocation of bank guarantee. \n(iii) The Commercial Court having released the amount in deposit which was also directed to be deposited as security to the award and on the same analogy, the Commercial Court should have directed invocation of bank guarantee. Both the cash deposit and bank guarantee stand on the same footing and while realizing, they cannot be treated as different. \n(iv) The Commercial Court failed to note that the security obtained by way of bank guarantee was to protect the interest of the petitioner under the award which was challenged under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. \n(v) Observation of the Commercial Court that bank guarantee was given as security during pendency of challenge to award under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act and not for enforcement of award under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act is erroneous and would not stand to reasons. The Commercial Court by way of interim order directed the respondent to furnish security by way of bank guarantee. \n(vi) There is no security available to realize the fruits of the award as the bank guarantee furnished by respondent herein has expired. Therefore, he pleads difficulty in executing the award in terms of Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. To substantiate the same, he has referred to the letter dated 01.08.2023 and submitted that bank guarantee was extended up to 31.05.2024 and was submitted to the Registrar, City Civil Court, but on verifying it is found that no such guarantee is available in the file of Com.A.P.No.1/2020, which is clear from the above stated letter issued by the Sheristedar, City Civil Court (Commercial Court), Bengaluru. In that regard, learned counsel would request for passing appropriate order. \n(vii) That the purpose and object of arbitration is speedy and expeditious disposal of the disputes. Therefore, there is no need to go through the process of execution proceedings when security is available before the Court. \n(viii) The observations of the Commercial Court that to avoid payment of stamp duty, the petitioner is seeking invocation of bank guarantee given as security, was uncalled for since the Commercial Court could have called upon the petitioner to pay stamp duty on the award and thereafter could have invoked the bank guarantee. Thus, he prays for allowing the writ petition and to direct the Commercial Court to invoke bank guarantee furnished as security by the respondent. \n9. Learned counsel Sri.Joshua Hudson Samuel initially also argued on the point of power of review of the Commercial Court, but when this Court pointed out that same would be academic in the present writ petition, learned counsel submitted that said question may be kept open to be decided in any other appropriate proceedings. \n10. Per contra, learned counsel Ms.Tamarra Sequeira for Caveator/respondent would support the order of the Commercial Court and would submit that,\n(i) Once the proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is disposed of, Commercial Court would not get jurisdiction to issue further direction on the application filed by the petitioner. \n(ii) The only course open for the petitioner is to file execution petition under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. \n(iii) The petitioner filed application under Section 151 of CPC seeking for a direction to invoke bank guarantee only to avoid payment of stamp duty on the award. \n(iv) The petitioner has challenged the award in Com.A.P.No.7/2022 before this Court and having challenged the award, it is not open for the petitioner to put the said award for execution that too by way of an application under Section 151 of CPC. \n(v) The bank guarantee was given as security during pendency of Section 34 proceedings and the bank guarantee is not submitted to enforce the award in Section 34 proceedings. \n(vi) The bank guarantee is not submitted for discharge of the dues insofar as the award is concerned, but it is given as security during Section 34 proceedings. As such, the petitioner cannot claim any right over the bank guarantee. \n(vii) In a proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, the Court could examine as to whether the award on the ground stated under Section 34 requires interference and Section 34 would not empower the Commercial Court to enforce the award. To enforce the award, one has to invoke Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. \nTherefore, learned counsel would submit that the Commercial Court was justified in rejecting IA filed under Section 151 of CPC to invoke bank guarantee. Thus, learned counsel would pray for dismissal of the writ petition. \n11. On hearing the learned counsel appearing for the parties and on perusal of the writ petition papers, the only point which falls for consideration is as to, \"Whether the Commercial Court is justified in rejecting I.A filed under Section 151 of CPC seeking direction to invoke bank guarantee, in the facts and circumstances of the case?\" \nThe answer to the above point would be in the Affirmative and the Trial Court is justified in rejecting I.A filed under Section 151 of CPC for the following reasons:\n12. The petitioner is before this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, this Court would exercise supervisory jurisdiction and would not act as Appellate Court. Further, it would not re-appreciate or re-evaluate the evidence or facts upon which the Trial Court has come to a conclusion, if it is supported by reasons. Supervisory jurisdiction is not to correct every error, fact or even a legal flaw. Supervisory jurisdiction would be exercised sparingly in appropriate cases. If a person who approaches the Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, establishes that the finding of the Trial Court is so perverse that no reasonable person can possibly come to such a conclusion that the Court has come to, then the Court would exercise Supervisory jurisdiction. Moreover, if the petitioner could avail any other remedy, the Court would not exercise its jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. In other words, to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, one of the essential pre-requisite would be that petitioner should be remediless. The Hon'ble Apex Court in a decision in GARMENT CRAFT V/S. PRAKASH CHAND GOEL1 has laid down and explained under what circumstances, power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India could be exercised. Relevant paragraphs 15 and 16 reads as follows:\n\"15. Having heard the counsel for the parties, we are clearly of the view that the impugned order [Prakash Chand Goel v. Garment Craft, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 11943] is contrary to law and cannot be sustained for several reasons, but primarily for deviation from the limited jurisdiction exercised by the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The High Court exercising supervisory jurisdiction does not act as a court of first appeal to reappreciate, reweigh the evidence or facts upon which the determination under challenge is based. \nSupervisory jurisdiction is not to correct (2022) 4 SCC 181 every error of fact or even a legal flaw when the final finding is justified or can be supported. The High Court is not to substitute its own decision on facts and conclusion, for that of the inferior court or tribunal. [Celina Coelho Pereira v. Ulhas Mahabaleshwar Kholkar, (2010) 1 SCC 217 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 69] The jurisdiction exercised is in the nature of correctional jurisdiction to set right grave dereliction of duty or flagrant abuse, violation of fundamental principles of law or justice. The power under Article 227 is exercised sparingly in appropriate cases, like when there is no evidence at all to justify, or the finding is so perverse that no reasonable person can possibly come to such a conclusion that the court or tribunal has come to. It is axiomatic that such discretionary relief must be exercised to ensure there is no miscarriage of justice. \n16. Explaining the scope of jurisdiction under Article 227, this Court in Estralla Rubber v. Dass Estate (P) Ltd. [Estralla Rubber v. Dass Estate (P) Ltd., (2001) 8 SCC 97] has observed : (SCC pp. 101-102, para 6) \"6. The scope and ambit of exercise of power and jurisdiction by a High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is examined and explained in a number of decisions of this Court. The exercise of power under this article involves a duty on the High Court to keep inferior courts and tribunals within the bounds of their authority and to see that they do the duty expected or required of them in a legal manner. The High Court is not vested with any unlimited prerogative to correct all kinds of hardship or wrong decisions made within the limits of the jurisdiction of the subordinate courts or tribunals. Exercise of this power and interfering with the orders of the courts or tribunals is restricted to cases of serious dereliction of duty and flagrant violation of fundamental principles of law or justice, where if the High Court does not interfere, a grave injustice remains uncorrected. It is also well settled that the High Court while acting under this Article cannot exercise its power as an appellate court or substitute its own judgment in place of that of the subordinate court to correct an error, which is not apparent on the face of the record. The High Court can set aside or ignore the findings of facts of an inferior court or tribunal, if there is no evidence at all to justify or the finding is so perverse, that no reasonable person can possibly come to such a conclusion, which the court or tribunal has come to.\"\" \nIn the background of above legal position, I proceed to examine the facts of the present case:\n13. The petitioner in A.P.No.1/2020 before the Commercial Court questioned award dated 30.09.2018 under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act and prayed to set aside the said award. The petitioner herein also challenged part of the said award dated 30.09.2018 in A.S.No.182/2019. Both the proceedings initiated under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act came to be dismissed under judgment dated 30.10.2021. The petitioner herein filed appeal against the said judgment dated 30.10.2021 insofar as dismissal of the challenge to part of the award, but insofar as dismissal of A.P.No.1/2020 filed by respondent it has become final and binding on the parties. The operative portion of the judgment in A.P.No.1/2020 reads as follows:\n\"Petition U/s. 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act filed by the petitioner is dismissed.\nIn the circumstances of the case, there is no order as to costs. \nRs.4,80,02,855/- deposited in this case by the respondent (petitioner in this petition), which is kept in FD, be released to the Claimant along with accrued interest, after appeal period is over.\"\n14. No doubt, by interim order dated 17.03.2020 in Com.A.P.No.1/2020, the Commercial Court had stayed the award under challenge, subject to respondent herein depositing 60% of the award amount and providing security for rest of the 40% of the award amount. While dismissing Com.Appeal No.1/2020, the Commercial Court directed to release the amount in deposit in favour of the petitioner herein along with accrued interest. No order was passed in respect of the bank guarantee which was furnished by respondent herein in pursuance to the interim order dated 17.03.2020, apparently because the said bank guarantee was provided as security during pendency of Section 34 proceedings. \n15. The impugned order is not perverse or unreasonable, but it is supported by reasons. Further, the finding of the Commercial Court cannot be said that no reasonable person can possibly come to such a conclusion that the Court has not arrived at. The Commercial Court has rightly come to the conclusion that bank guarantee in pursuance to interim order dated 17.03.2020 was furnished as security during the proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. \n16. Once Section 34 proceedings is dismissed, it is always open for the petitioner to enforce the award. The petitioner cannot convert Section 34 proceedings into Section 36 proceedings for enforcement of award by means of an I.A. When the Arbitration Act provides for enforcement of award under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act, the petitioner shall have to resort to the procedure prescribed under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. \n17. Moreover, without paying stamp duty on the award amount, it is not open for the petitioner to seek enforcement of the award. As rightly observed by the Commercial Court, objection regarding non-payment of stamp duty on the award cannot be raised in a proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. While enforcing the award under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act, the award could be executed only if stamp duty is paid and Executing Court would not be in a position to execute the award unless it is stamped and registered. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of M.ANASUYA DEVI AND ANOTHER V/S. M.MANIK REDDY AND OTHERS2 with regard to stamping and registration and the stage at which objection regarding the same could be raised has been discussed in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 which reads as follows:\n\"2. The Principal Sub-Judge, Hyderabad, by an order dated 4-8-2000 (2003) 8 SCC 565 rejected the said petitions. Aggrieved, the respondents filed the appeals before the High Court of Judicature at Andhra Pradesh under Section 37(1)(b) of the Act. The High Court was of the view that since the award was not stamped and registered, it was, therefore, invalid and without jurisdiction. It is against the said judgment of the High Court, the appellants are in appeal before us. \n3. Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants urged that a perusal of the award would show that it has not created any right or liability in favour of any party, but it requires a subsequent documentation by the parties. He submitted, in that view of the matter, the award was not required to be stamped and registered and in fact, subsequent documentation would definitely require stamping and registration. However, Shri V.R. Reddy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents, urged that the award did create rights in favour of the parties and as such it required registration and the view taken by the High Court is in conformity with law. \n4. After we heard the matter, we are of the view that in the present case this issue was not required to be gone into at the stage of the proceedings under Section 34 of the Act. In fact, this issue was premature at that stage. Section 34 of the Act provides for setting aside of the award on the grounds enumerated therein. It is not in dispute that an application for setting aside the award would not lie on any other ground, which is not enumerated in Section 34 of the Act. The question as to whether the award is required to be stamped and registered, would be relevant only when the parties would file the award for its enforcement under Section 36 of the Act. It is at this stage the parties can raise objections regarding its admissibility on account of non-registration and non-stamping under Section 17 of the Registration Act. In that view of the matter, the exercise undertaken to decide the said issue by the civil court as also by the High Court was entirely an exercise in futility. The question whether an award requires stamping and registration is within the ambit of Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure and not covered by Section 34 of the Act.\"\n18. The Commercial Court has rightly observed that bank guarantee is given as security and not given for payment of the award amount. Further, it rightly observed that if it requires payment of stamp duty, when award holder have to enforce the award, the respondent may have to comply with the same and cannot seek enforcement in other way by invoking bank guarantee which is given to the Court. Admittedly, the bank guarantee was valid or in currency till 31.07.2023. The petitioner instead of filing application under Section 151 of CPC for invoking bank guarantee, had filed application under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act for enforcement and in the said petition if the petitioner had sought direction to invoke the bank guarantee, by this time, the petitioner would have enjoyed the fruits of the award. But, it appears that with an intention to save the stamp duty, the petitioner appears to have filed application under Section 151 of CPC for a direction to invoke the bank guarantee in a disposed-off Section 34 Proceedings. Having not filed an application for enforcement of award under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act before expiry of the bank guarantee, it is not open for the petitioner to contend that there is no security to enforce the award. \n19. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that amount in FD was released but the Commercial Court failed to invoke the bank guarantee while dismissing Section 34 petition of the respondent herein. The Commercial Court at paragraph 21 has assigned reason for not invoking bank guarantee. Paragraph 21 of the Commercial Court's order reads as follows:\n\"21. Invocation of bank guarantee has several consequences and may affect their commercial understandings and creditworthiness of the party and even their business prospects. When bank guarantee is given to the court, unless specified event mentioned in the bank guarantee has arisen or particular condition in the bank guarantee is violated, bank guarantee cannot be invoked. Invocation of bank guarantee cannot be equated with payment of FD amount. Since the bank guarantee is given to the court, court would invoke the bank guarantee only if, situation which compel the court to invoke the bank guarantee arises. When such situation is not placed before the court, there was no occasion for this court to order for invoking of bank guarantee while passing judgment on petition under Section 34. Hence, not invoking bank guarantee while passing order under Section 34, cannot be considered as an error apparent on the face of record. Even if another contrary view is also possible view of the court cannot be changed subsequently, as rightly argued by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner, as such change of view is beyond the scope of Review.\" \nThe Commercial Court has assigned reason as to why it has not invoked bank guarantee. As stated above, this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is not sitting in appeal and would not go into the correctness of the reason. Moreover, when the petitioner has remedy of enforcing the Award under Section 36 of 1996 Act, the Trial Court is justified in refusing to invoke the bank guarantee. Moreover, the bank guarantee as observed above was to protect the interest of the petitioner during the pendency of Section 34 proceedings. During the pendency of Section 34 proceedings, there was no occasion or contingency so as to invoke the bank guarantee. Learned counsel for the petitioner by referring to letter dated 01.08.2023 of Sheristedar, City Civil Court (Commercial Court), Bengaluru submitted that bank guarantee extended up to 31.05.2024 is not available. Order sheet of the proceedings would not indicate submission of such bank guarantee up to the period of 31.05.2024. Order sheet would indicate availability of bank guarantee which was valid till 31.07.2023. In terms of the interim order passed in Section 34 proceedings, respondent was expected to extend the bank guarantee till disposal of the proceedings and not beyond that. \n20. For the reasons recorded above, I decline to enterain the writ petition and accordingly, writ petition stands rejected. \nSD/-\nJUDGE NC CT:bms",

mediation by the respondent as regards the alleged dispute took place between the parties, the present suit is hit by adhering to the requirement of section 12-a of the act. further he stated that without filing a statement of truth, despite this court directed by the respondent, the respondent has not at all invoked provision under order vi rule 15 a and order xi rule 2 of cpc (amended act for the commercial courts act 2015) and therefore, the present suit is not maintainable and not in accordance with law and on facts of the present case. further it was stated that without reference to nature of the use of the suit properties in trade or commerce as on the date of the present suit/on the alleged cause of action of the present, the present suit does not come under section 2 (c ) (vii) of the commercial courts act, 2015 because the suit properties were under the custody of hypothecation and not under the custody of the respondent, till date. besides, the alleged agreement between the parties cannot be said to be an agreement of trade or for any commercial purpose and therefore, in view of the hon'ble apex court judgement rendered in (ambalal sarabha enterprises ltd., vs. k.s. infraspace llp & ano), the court has no jurisdiction or whatsoever to try the present suit, which is laid by the respondent/plaintiff under commercial courts act, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 2015, much less as alleged by the respondent/plaintiff in their plaint. 3. the contention of the plaintiff was that the plaintiff is the registered partnership firm, first defendant is the private limited company and the second defendant is the managing director of the first defendant company. the first defendant represented by its managing director mr.l. navaneethakrishnan/second defendant purchased the suit properties as a vacant land under sale deed dated 11.10.2010 and thereafter he put up compound wall around the lands so purchased and also constructed industrial buildings for its business purposes and commenced its business activities and he availed credit facilities from tamil nadu industrial investment corporation( hereinafter referred as '' tiic'') for its business purposes and by way of security for the credit facilities so availed, the first defendant deposited its title deeds concerning its properties measuring an extent of 5.333 acres with an intention to create equitable mortgage over the same. apart from tiic, the first defendant also availed credit facilities with indian overseas bank(hereinafter referred as iob), dr. nanjappa road branch, coimbatore. the first defendant by securing these credit facilities created a second charge over the said extent of 5.333 acres besides created first charge in respect of another extent of 1.35 acres by depositing the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis original title deed with iob. the defendant were unable to adhere the repayment schedule as agreed by them while availing the credit facilities from tiic and iob, instead committed default. in view of their breach tiic started proceedings against the defendants under state financial corporation act by bringing the secured property for sale. during this period iob classified the accounts of the 1st defendant as non performing asset and initiated proceedings under the provisions of the securitisation & reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest act, 2002 and also advertised for auctioning of the mortgaged properties. due to the said financial crisis, the defendants decided to sell the properties and approached the plaintiff in or about the month of june 2020 and offered to sell the suit properties and handed over the xerox copies of the aforesaid sale deeds and rectification deeds to the plaintiff to show their title with regard to the suit properties and narrated the aforesaid facts. thereafter elaborate discussions and negotiations between the defendants and the plaintiff, and mr. t. narendran for the the purpose of fixing the sale consideration. during the negotiations the second defendant furnished a letter signed by him and his wife, with regard to the shareholders details of the first defendant. the said letter revealed that the second defendant and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis his wife mrs.n.ranjitham alone are the shareholders and directors of the first defendant. the said original undated letter furnished by the second defendant. after various discussions the plaintiff and the defendants reached a conclusive agreement orally and decided the sale price of the suit properties as rs.25,00,00,000/on 20.07.2022 and same was recorded in writing on the same day under written document as memorandum of understanding (hereinafter referred as ''mou''). the second defendant being the managing director of the first defendant signed the said mou on behalf of the first defendant. the vice president (finance & administration) by name mr.t.narendran signed the said mou on behalf of the plaintiff. the plaintiff and the defendants bound by the said mou. accordingly, the defendant settled the loan due to the tiic and also to the iob the said payment was made through cheque issued by the plaintiff to that effect he filed the details of the cheque. therefore, on various payments the plaintiff paid total sum of rs. 19,52,05,899/to the defendants by way of part sale consideration out of the agreed sale consideration of rs. 25,00,00,000/-. the balance amount payable by the plaintiff is only rs.5,47,94,1010/and the plaintiff/respondent herein is also always ready and wiling to pay the same and to get the sale deed executed and registered including delivery of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis vacant possession of the suit properties. but the defendants committed breach on their part intentionally. the defendants till date failed to furnish proof that they have settled the dues in full i.e settlement of all the arrears payable by them to tangedco, appanaickenpatty panchayat and tnpcb. thus, it is clear that the defendants committed breach of their part of contract. as per mou, the plaintiff are entitled to collect the original deeds concerning the suit properties from tiic and iob after settling the dues payable by the defendants in full, by the plaintiff. by the defendants in breach of the terms of the said mou somehow collected all the original title deeds from those financial institutions and failed to hand over the same. the custody of those documents on the part of the defendants in breach of the mou dated 20.07.2022 and the defendants are bound to hand over those original title deeds to the plaintiff. the failure in handing over the title deeds also clear breach on the part of the defendants as per the said mou. further, the plaintiff all along hoping that the defendants are going to settle it dues payable to tangedco, appanaickenpatty panchayat and tnpcb. but whenever asked, the defendants stated that they are in the process of getting some waiver. in the meantime, the defendant started pestering the plaintiff to purchase the machineries in the suit properties. the suit property https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis contained heavy and big machineries that had been installed by the defendants and despite substantial payments by the plaintiff the defendants had not removed the same and failed to take any preparatory measures for removing the same. since the defendants are bound to deliver the vacant possession of the property to the plaintiff but he failed. having received the part of sale consideration, the defendants failed to execute the sale deed despite readiness on the part of the plaintiff the plaintiff with balance sale consideration. having committed breach of the terms of mou, the defendants attempted to create encumbrance over the suit property in favour of the third parties and also demanded higher amount which is contrary to the terms. therefore, the necessity arose for the plaintiff to rush to the court and obtained interim order in order to prevent the defendant to create third party interest in the suit property and also contend that suit come within the scope of the commercial court act. further the suit filed for urgent relief, the plaintiff can exist remedy pre-mediation as per section 12 a of the commercial court, act accordingly summarised the cause of action arose for the suit. hence he prayed to dismiss the petition filed by them for rejection of plaint. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 4. considering the submissions on either side, the court below held that the suit property was used for commercial purpose till 2008 and the machineries are still available in suit property, even though the respondent is not going to purchase the said machineries or factory and also not going to run the said factory, the dispute is in respect of immovable property over which factories is available or commerce or trade or business activity were conducted or the petitioners used the same, which is commercial in nature, it is not necessary that the respondent should purchase or enter into a agreement in respect of running factory or is going to run the same factory. further, he held that machineries used in the factory had already been hyphothecated with iob and no recovery proceedings under section 14 of the drt act. therefore, the jurisdiction with commercial court is maintainable. in respect of invoking section 12 a of the commercial courts act, the trial court held that dispute between the parties are commercial in nature and necessary leave was granted by this court to present the suit by over looking section 12 a of the commercial courts act. in view of urgency contemplated in the case, the application to reject claim as per section 12a and issuing notice to the petitioners for premeditation does not https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis arise. thereby, no separate application under section 12a of the said act is also necessary and the respondent need not to be directed to appear before the drt also, accordingly dismissed the petition. challenging the same, the petitioner filed this civil revision petition. 5. the learned counsel for the petitioners/defendants submitted that the court below failed to appreciate the fact that the claim in the suit is not commercial dispute, so also, not fall under section 2 (1 ) (c ) (vii) of the commercial courts act, 2015. further he submitted that as per section 2 (1) ( c) (7) of the commercial court act, means that the immovable property that is the subject matter of the dispute shall be used exclusively in trade or commerce at the time of entering into the agreement. the learned judge failed to see that the suit property was not used for the commercial purposes on the date of entering into mou. commercial property was immovable property was ceased to be used for commercial purposes on the date of alleged mou. further, he would submit that the plaintiff has violated section 12 a which granted pre institution and mediation: was made; notwithstanding the fact that there is no existing commercial dispute between the parties. further he would submitted that the trial court failed to appreciate that the plaintiff averment which does not contemplate any https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis actual urgent interim relief. the factual background for which the plaintiff was in violation of section 12 a of the act, the plaintiff simply pleaded that they are apprehending that the defendants/petitioners herein would encumber the property to overcome the mandate under secttion 12 a on bare reading of the plaint averment that there was no dispute between the parties the court ought to have rejected the plaint. further, the court below failed to appreciate the discussion with regard to modification in the terms of mou on 26.01.2012 which increased sale consideration as rs.30,00,00,000/including sale of machinery of the first petitioner company. hence, there is no cause of action for the suit as alleged by the plaintiff but the court below failed to reject the plaint. hence he prayed to allow this petition. 6. by way of reply, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted the agreement relating to immovable property used exaclusively in trade or commerce it comes under the commercial dispute filed under section 2 (1) (c( vii) of the act to that effect he the relied the ratio laid down in the case of ambalal sarabhai enterprises limited vs k.s infraspace llp reported in 2020 15 scc 585: 37. a dispute relating to immovable property per se may not be a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis commercial dispute. but it becomes a commercial dispute, if it falls under sub-clause (vii) of section 2(1)(c) of the act viz. the agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in the trade or commerce. the works ''used exclusively in trade or commerce'' are to be interpreted purposefully. the word ''used'' denotes ''actually used'' and it cannot be either ''really for use'' or ''likely to be used'' or ''to be used''. it should be ''áctually used''. 7.thereby he contend that though mou was entered to purchase the immovable property which was used by the first defendant for industrial purposes so the trial judge rightly dismissed the petition. further, he submitted that in respect of section 12 a of the commercial court act, if the suit is filed for urgent interim relief, then, the question of relegating the plaintiff to exhaust the remedy of pre-institution mediation as contemplated under section 12 a of the commercial courts act, 2015, since the plaintiff filed suit with prayer for urgent interim relief before the commercial court can satisfy that whether there are limits which prime facie indicates that suit may contemplate the urgent interim relief irrespective of the fact as to whether the plaintiff evidentially succeed in getting interim relief. if the plaintiff contemplates the urgent relief pleading on record as https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis established sufficiently in such circumstances it is not necessary for the plaintiff to enter into pre institution and mediation by invoking section 12 a of the commercial court act too that effect he relied the judgment of the court in the case of m/s patil automation private ltd and others vs rakheja engineers private ltd, reported in manu sc 1004 (2022) ''63. in section 12a also, the bar of intitution of the suit is applicable only in a case in which the plaintiff does not contemplate urgent interim relief.'' 8. by relying above judgement the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the trial court rightly dismissed the petition for rejecting the plaint which needs no interference. 9. considering the submission on either side and also on records, the fact reveals that on 20.07.2003 mou was said to be entered between the parties in respect of suit properties wherein, the defendants agreed to sell the property for total sale consideration of rs. 25,00,00,000/with other terms. accordingly, the plaintiff also agreed to settle the long dues with tiic and iob and others. as per the plaint avernments, as on date plaintiff paid rs.19,52,05,899/and ready to pay the balance amount to get the sale deed. but as per the contract, till date, the defendants/petitioners herein not paid dues to tangedco. beside, the petitioners herein/defendants https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis attempted to alienate the suit property with third parties. hence the plaintiff approached the court for the relief of specific performance. immediately the defendant filed application to reject the plaint stating that there is no cause of action arose since because it is not commercial dispute but the trial court observed that the subject in issue is immovable property which was used by the defendants for commercial purposes and till date machineries are in the suit property. therefore, commercial court is having jurisdiction and also held that on considering the relief claimed by the plaintiff contemplate the urgent interim relief and the question of relegating the plaintiff the existing remedy on pre institution mediation is not contemplate under section 12 a of the commercial court act, , the said act can be invoked only wherein if the plaintiff not plead any emergency relief, the plaintiff filed i.a no. 2 of 2023 for urgent interim relief along with suit thereby court found prime facie case in favour of the plaintiffs. moreover, the defendants not denied the execution of mou with plaintiff as per the affidavit filed in i.a no. 4 of 2023. further, they also admits that they gave draft supplemental mou insisting the plaintiff to purchase the machineries by paying additional amount of ten crores totally thirty five crores, the same has not been accepted by the plaintiff. therefore, as per the terms the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis plaintiff paid 85 % of the amount as agreed in mou to the iob and tiic to settle the dues as directed by the defendants. on the other hand, the defendants wanted to purchase the machineries hence the dispute arose between the parties. as per the plaint, it reveals that after settling the issue title deed is now under the hands of the defendants. so, the plaintiff apprehends that the defendants may create encumbrance over the suit property and they also the petitioners herein/defendants admitted to create third party interest over the property so they approached the court with urgent relief. the trial judge rightly appreciated all the facts and circumstances of the cases as well as the urgent relief claimed by the plaintiff. further, as rightly pointed by the plaintiffs counsel the plaintiff's apprehension that the defendants may create encumbrance over the suit properties hence he approached the court with urgent interim relief, it prime facie satisfied by the contact of the parties, the trial judge rightly take the case on file, hence non-issuance of pre-suit mediation notice is not fatal to the proceedings. in view of the above and for the reasons stated above, this court does not find any infirmity in the order dated 17.07.2023 passed by the commercial court (district judge cadre), coimbatore in i.a no. 4 of 2023 in c.o.s no. 110 of 2023. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 10. in result, this petition is dismissed. no cost. consequentially connected miscellaneous petition is closed. 09.11.2023 pbl to 1. the commercial court (district judge cadre), coimbatore. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis t.v.thamilselvi,j. pbl 09.11.2023 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis"
