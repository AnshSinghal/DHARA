Heard the learned Senior counsel for appellant and the learned Additional Government Advocate for the respondent and perused the material on record. \n3. The material on record discloses that the appellant - claimant filed a claim petition before the Arbitral Tribunal putting forth various monetary claims against the respondent under various heads, in all, amounting to a sum of Rs.560,86,85,717/- towards losses suffered by the appellant - claimant together with interest and for other reliefs. The details of the claims put forth by the appellant as detailed in the claim petition are as under:-\n           CLAIMS    AMOUNT IN RS.

Before    the   Arbitral   Tribunal,   the   respondent appeared and contested the claim and filed its statement of defence, to which the appellant - claimant filed its rejoinder, pursuant to which, both sides adduced oral and documentary evidence. After hearing the parties, the Tribunal allowed the claims of the appellant in part as hereunder; \n       CLAIMS        AMOUNT IN RS.

THEREAFTER. \n        COSTS           5,00,00,000 5. Aggrieved by the impugned award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal insofar as it related to rejecting the claim of the appellant in full in respect of claims F, G, and H and allowing the same only in part in respect of claims D, E and I, the appellant herein filed the aforesaid suit against the respondent herein under Section 34 of the said Act of 1996. \n6. So also, the respondent also filed an arbitration suit in A.S.No.57/2019. The said suit was dismissed by the Commercial court vide judgment and order dated 25.10.2021. Learned Additional Government Advocate appearing for the respondent submitted that the respondent has not challenged the aforesaid judgment and order dated 25.10.2021 passed in A.S.No.57/2019 and consequently, the same has attained finality and as such, the arbitral award has attained finality insofar as the respondent is concerned. \n7. The suit in Commercial A.S.No.62/2019 was contested by the respondent herein. By the impugned judgment and order, the commercial court dismissed the said suit filed by the appellant herein thereby confirming the arbitral award. Aggrieved by the impugned arbitral award as well as the impugned judgment and order of the commercial court passed in Commercial A.S.No.62/2019, the appellant is before this Court by way of the present appeal. \n8. In addition to reiterating the various contentions urged in the appeal and referring to the material on record, learned Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the commercial court failed to appreciate that the appellant was entitled to the entire amounts put forth in claims - D, E, F, G, H and I by him; that the reasoning and findings recorded by the Arbitral Tribunal and confirmed by the commercial court which allowed the said claims only partly and rejected the remaining portions / part of the said claims were patently illegal and erroneous and without properly considering or appreciating the material on record. It was also contended that the arbitral award contained several patent illegalities and that the same was in contravention of the fundamental policy of the Indian law apart from being opposed to principles of morality and justice and contrary to public policy. It is therefore contended that the impugned arbitral award as well as the impugned judgment and order of the commercial court deserve to be set aside. \n9. Per contra, learned Additional Government Advocate for the respondent submits that there is no merit in the appeal and having regard to the limited and restricted scope of interference under Sections 34 and 37 of the said Act of 1996, there is no merit in the appeal and the same is liable to be dismissed. \n10. A perusal of the arbitral award will indicate that the Arbitral Tribunal has partly allowed the claim of the appellant in respect of claims D, E, and I and has rejected claims F, G and H. In this context, the details of the said claims are as under:\nI. Claim 'D' - This claim relates to the loss of profit said to have been suffered by the appellant on account of the respondent illegally restraining the MSPCs from procuring raw materials from the claimant, which has been quantified at 10% amounting to Rs.168,67,00,000/-; as against this amount claimed by the appellant, the Arbitral Tribunal awarded Rs. 39,74,68,000/-. \nII. Claim 'E' - This claim relates to the compensation sought for by the appellant for the loss caused to the appellant on account of illegal termination of the agreements by the respondent, which has been quantified as Rs.64,36,93,378/-; as against this amount claimed by the appellant, the Arbitral Tribunal awarded Rs.16,00,00,000/-.\nIII. Claim 'I' - This claim relates to the compensation sought for by the appellant on account of loss of reputation and mental agony and harassment due to illegal termination by the respondent, which has been quantified as Rs.50,00,00,000/-; as against this amount claimed by the appellant, Arbitral Tribunal awarded Rs.10,00,00,000/-. \nIV. Claim 'F' - This claim relates to the claim for compensation put forth by the appellant towards alleged loss sustained by it due to illegal termination of its contracts by the appellant resulting in failure on the part of the appellant to obtain the tenders and earn profit which has been quantified as Rs.10,30,00,000/-; this claim was rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal.\nV. Claim 'G' - This claim relates to the claim for compensation put forth by the appellant towards alleged loss sustained by it due to illegal termination of its contracts by the appellant resulting in failure on the part of the appellant to obtain the tenders and earn profit which has been quantified as Rs.31,40,00,000/-; this claim was rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal.\nVI. Claim 'H' - This claim relates to the claim for compensation put forth by the appellant towards alleged loss sustained by it due to illegal termination of its contracts by the appellant resulting in failure on the part of the appellant to obtain the tenders and earn profit which has been quantified as Rs.1335 crores; this claim was rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n11. The question with regard to the limited scope of interference under Section 34 of the said Act of 1996 is no longer res integra; the Apex Court as well as this Court has repeatedly held that the Court dealing with Section 34 application / petition does not act like an appellate court and cannot be re-appreciate / re-evaluate evidence on the merits of the matter and arrive at a different conclusion than that of the Arbitral Tribunal in view of the scheme of the said Act of 1996. \n12. In the case of South East Asia Marine Engineering Constructions Limited Vs. Oil India Limited reported in (2020) 5 SCC 164 , a three Judge Bench of the Apex Court held as under:\n12. It is a settled position that a court can set aside the award only on the grounds as provided in the Arbitration Act as interpreted by the courts. Recently, this Court in Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd. [Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd., (2019) 20 SCC 1 : 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1656] laid down the scope of such interference. This Court observed as follows : (SCC pp. 11-12, para 24) \"24. There is no dispute that Section 34 of the Arbitration Act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various Courts. We need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the Court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. Section 34 is different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. The mandate under Section 34 is to respect the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. If the Courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated.\" \n13. It is also settled law that where two views are possible, the Court cannot interfere in the plausible view taken by the arbitrator supported by reasoning. This Court in Dyna Technologies [Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd., (2019) 20 SCC 1 : 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1656] observed as under : (SCC p. 12, para 25) \"25. Moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this Court have categorically held that the Courts should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. The Courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.\"\n14. However, the question in the present case is whether the interpretation provided to the contract in the award of the Tribunal was reasonable and fair, so that the - 10 - same passes the muster under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act? \n15. In the present case, the respondent has argued that the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal was not even a possible interpretation, therefore the award being unreasonable and unfair suffers from perversity. Hence, the respondent has pleaded that the award ought to be set aside. In this context, we may state that usually the Court is not required to examine the merits of the interpretation provided in the award by the arbitrator, if it comes to a conclusion that such an interpretation was reasonably possible. \n13. In the case of Project Director Vs. M. Hakeem and another reported in (2021) 9 SCC 1, it was held as under:\n22. Thus, under the scheme of the old Act, an award may be remitted, modified or otherwise set aside given the grounds contained in Section 30 of the 1940 Act, which are broader than the grounds contained in Section 34 of the 1996 Act.\n23. It is settled law that a Section 34 proceeding does not contain any challenge on the merits of the award. \nThis has been decided in MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd. [MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd., (2019) 4 SCC 163 :\n(2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 293] , as follows : (SCC p. 167, para 14)\n\"14. As far as interference with an order made under Section 34, as per Section 37, is concerned, it cannot be disputed that such - 11 - interference under Section 37 cannot travel beyond the restrictions laid down under Section 34. In other words, the court cannot undertake an independent assessment of the merits of the award, and must only ascertain that the exercise of power by the court under Section 34 has not exceeded the scope of the provision. Thus, it is evident that in case an arbitral award has been confirmed by the court under Section 34 and by the court in an appeal under Section 37, this Court must be extremely cautious and slow to disturb such concurrent findings.\" \n24. Likewise, in Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI [Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, (2019) 15 SCC 131 : (2020) 2 SCC (Civ) 213] , this Court under the caption \"Section 34(2)(a) does not entail a challenge to an arbitral award on merits\"\nreferred to this Court's judgment in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] , the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958 (\"the New York Convention\") and various other authorities to conclude that there could be no challenge on merits under the grounds mentioned in Section 34 -- (see paras 34 to 48). This Court also held, in Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. v. Datar Switchgear Ltd. [Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. v. Datar Switchgear Ltd., (2018) 3 SCC 133 : (2018) 2 SCC (Civ) 65] (at p. 170), that the court hearing a Section 34 petition does not sit in appeal (see para 51).\n- 12 - 25. As a matter of fact, the point raised in the appeals stands concluded in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] , where this Court held : (SCC p. 208, paras 51-52) \"51. After the 1996 Act came into force, under Section 16 of the Act the party questioning the jurisdiction of the arbitrator has an obligation to raise the said question before the arbitrator. Such a question of jurisdiction could be raised if it is beyond the scope of his authority. It was required to be raised during arbitration proceedings or soon after initiation thereof. The jurisdictional question is required to be determined as a preliminary ground. A decision taken thereupon by the arbitrator would be the subject-matter of challenge under Section 34 of the Act. In the event the arbitrator opined that he had no jurisdiction in relation thereto an appeal thereagainst was provided for under Section 37 of the Act. \n52. The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. So, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum - 13 - level and this can be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it.\" \n26. This statement of the law was followed in Kinnari Mullick v. Ghanshyam Das Damani [Kinnari Mullick v. Ghanshyam Das Damani, (2018) 11 SCC 328 :\n(2018) 5 SCC (Civ) 106] at p. 334 (see para 15). \n27. Also, in Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd. [Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd., (2019) 20 SCC 1] , this Court held : (SCC p. 15, paras 36-37) \"36. At this juncture it must be noted that the legislative intention of providing Section 34(4) in the Arbitration Act was to make the award enforceable, after giving an opportunity to the Tribunal to undo the curable defects. This provision cannot be brushed aside and the High Court [Crompton Greaves Ltd. v. Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd., 2007 SCC OnLine Mad 427] could not have proceeded further to determine the issue on merits. \n37. In case of absence of reasoning the utility has been provided under Section 34(4) of the Arbitration Act to cure such defects. When there is complete perversity in the reasoning then only it can be challenged under the provisions of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. The power vested under Section 34(4) of the Arbitration Act to cure defects can be utilised in cases where the - 14 - arbitral award does not provide any reasoning or if the award has some gap in the reasoning or otherwise and that can be cured so as to avoid a challenge based on the aforesaid curable defects under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. However, in this case such remand to the Tribunal would not be beneficial as this case has taken more than 25 years for its adjudication. It is in this state of affairs that we lament that the purpose of arbitration as an effective and expeditious forum itself stands effaced.\" \n28. Some of the judgments of the High Courts are also instructive. A learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in Cybernetics Network (P) Ltd. v. Bisquare Technologies (P) Ltd. [Cybernetics Network (P) Ltd. v. Bisquare Technologies (P) Ltd., 2012 SCC OnLine Del 1155] , held : (SCC OnLine Del paras 47-51) \"47. The next question that arises is whether the above claims as mentioned in para 44 that have been erroneously rejected by the learned arbitrator can be allowed by this Court in exercise of its powers under Section 34(4) of the Act? \n48. Under Section 34(4) of the Act, the Court while deciding a challenge to an arbitral award, can either 'adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the Arbitral Tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award'. This necessarily envisages the - 15 - Court having to remit the matter to the Arbitral Tribunal. This is subject to the Court finding it appropriate to do so and a party requesting it to do so. \n49. In Union of India v. Arctic India [Union of India v. Arctic India, 2007 SCC OnLine Bom 409 :\n(2007) 4 Arb LR 524] , a learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court opined that the Court can modify the award even if there is no express provision in the Act permitting it. The Court followed the decision of the Supreme Court in Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. v. Harischandra Reddy [Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. v. Harischandra Reddy, (2007) 2 SCC 720] . A similar view has been taken by a learned Single Judge of this Court in Union of India v. Modern Laminators Ltd. [Union of India v. Modern Laminators Ltd., 2008 SCC OnLine Del 956 : (2008) 3 Arb LR 489] There the question was whether in light of the arbitrator having failed to decide the counterclaim of the respondent in that case the Court could itself decide the counterclaim. After discussing the case law, the Court concluded that it could modify the award but only to a limited extent. It held (Arb LR p. 496) : (Modern Laminators Ltd. case [Union of India v. Modern Laminators Ltd., 2008 SCC OnLine Del 956 : (2008) 3 Arb LR 489] , SCC OnLine Del para 22) '22. ... Such modification of award will be a species of \"setting aside\" only and would be \"setting aside to a limited extent\". However, if the - 16 - courts were to find that they cannot within the confines of interference permissible or on the material before the arbitrator are unable to modify and if the same would include further fact finding or adjudication of intricate questions of law, the parties ought to be left to the forum of their choice i.e. to be relegated under Section 34(4) of the Act to further arbitration or other civil remedies.'\n50. However, none of the above decisions categorically hold that where certain claims have been erroneously rejected by the arbitrator, the Court can in exercise of its powers under Section 34(4) of the Act itself decide those claims. The Allahabad High Court has in U.P. State Handloom Corpn. Ltd. v. Asha Lata Talwar [U.P. State Handloom Corpn. Ltd. v. Asha Lata Talwar, 2009 SCC OnLine All 624 : (2009) 4 All LJ 397] , held that while exercising the powers to set aside an award under Section 34 of the Act the Court does not have the jurisdiction to grant the original relief which was prayed for before the arbitrator. The Allahabad High Court referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] , where it was observed (SCC p. 208):\n***\n51. The view of the Allahabad High Court in U.P. State Handloom Corpn. Ltd. v. Asha Lata Talwar [U.P. State Handloom Corpn. Ltd. v. Asha - 17 - Lata Talwar, 2009 SCC OnLine All 624 : (2009) 4 All LJ 397] appears to be consistent with the scheme of the Act, and in particular Section 34 thereof which is a departure from the scheme of Section 16 of the 1940 Act which perhaps gave the Court a wider amplitude of powers. Under Section 34(2) of the Act, the Court is empowered to set aside an arbitral award on the grounds specified therein. The remand to the arbitrator under Section 34(4) is to a limited extent of requiring the Arbitral Tribunal 'to eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award'. There is no specific power granted to the court to itself allow the claims originally made before the Arbitral Tribunal where it finds the Arbitral Tribunal erred in rejecting such claims. If such a power is recognised as falling within the ambit of Section 34(4) of the Act, then the court will be acting no different from an appellate court which would be contrary to the legislative intent behind Section 34 of the Act. Accordingly, this Court declines to itself decide the claims of CNPL that have been wrongly rejected by the learned arbitrator.\" \n29. The Delhi High Court in Nussli Switzerland Ltd. v. Organizing Committee, Commonwealth Games, 2010 [Nussli Switzerland Ltd. v. Organizing Committee, Commonwealth Games, 2010, 2014 SCC OnLine Del 4834] , held : (SCC OnLine Del para 34) \"34. A party like the Organising Committee which has its claims rejected, except a part, but which subsumes into the larger amount awarded - 18 - in favour of the opposite party, even if succeeds in the objections to the award would at best have the award set aside for the reason the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 as distinct from the power of the court under the Arbitration Act, 1940, does not empower the court to modify an award. If a claim which has been rejected by an Arbitral Tribunal is found to be faulty, the court seized of the objections under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has to set aside the award and leave the matter at that. It would be open to the party concerned to commence fresh proceedings (including arbitration) and for this view one may for purposes of convenience refer to sub-section (4) of Section 43 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. It reads:\n'43. Limitations.--(1)-\n(3) * * * (4) Where the Court orders that an arbitral award be set aside, the period between the commencement of the arbitration and the date of the order of the Court shall be excluded in computing the time prescribed by the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), for the commencement of the proceedings (including arbitration) with respect to the dispute so submitted.' \" \n30. An instructive judgment of the Delhi High Court in Puri Construction (P) Ltd. v. Larsen & Toubro Ltd. [Puri Construction (P) Ltd. v. Larsen & Toubro Ltd., 2015 SCC OnLine Del 9126] deals with the authorities of the Madras - 19 - and Calcutta High Courts on the one hand and the other High Courts dealing with this problem as follows : (SCC OnLine Del paras 115-16 & 118) \"115. In these circumstances, this Court holds that the reliefs granted by the Tribunal cannot be sustained and are hereby set aside. The question that follows is whether this Court, exercising jurisdiction under Section 37 read with Section 34 of the Act, can modify, vary or remit the award. At the outset, it is noticed that there are divergent views on this issue. Here, the Court notices a somewhat divergent approach of various High Courts. The case law is discussed in the following part of the judgment. \nAuthorities in Favour of the Power to Modify, Vary or Remit the award 116. A learned Single Judge of this Court in Bhasin Associates v. N.B.C.C. [Bhasin Associates v. N.B.C.C., 2005 SCC OnLine Del 689 : ILR (2005) 2 Del 88] held that 'the power to set aside an award when exercised by the court would leave a vacuum if the said power was not understood to include the power to remand the matter back to the arbitrator'. This view was subsequently adopted in Single Bench decisions in Union of India v. Modern Laminators Ltd. [Union of India v. Modern Laminators Ltd., 2008 SCC OnLine Del 956 : (2008) 3 Arb LR 489] (in the context of modification of the award), IFFCO-Tokio General Insurance Co.\nLtd. v. Indo-Rama Synthetics Ltd. [IFFCO-Tokio General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Indo-Rama - 20 - Synthetics Ltd., 2015 SCC OnLine Del 6669] (decided on 20-1-2015) and Canara Bank v. BSNL [Canara Bank v. BSNL, 2015 SCC OnLine Del 8379] (decided on 26-3-2015) . In Modern Laminators [Union of India v. Modern Laminators Ltd., 2008 SCC OnLine Del 956 :\n(2008) 3 Arb LR 489] , the Court relied upon the Supreme Court's decision in Numaligarh Refinery Ltd. v. Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd. [Numaligarh Refinery Ltd. v. Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd., (2007) 8 SCC 466] , noting that the Court therein had modified the award in terms of its findings; and the decision in Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. v. G. Harischandra Reddy [Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. v. Harischandra Reddy, (2007) 2 SCC 720] , where the interest rate awarded by the arbitrator was modified. The learned Single Judge in Canara Bank relied upon a decision of a Single Judge of the Madras High Court in Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd. [Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Mad 6568 : \n(2015) 1 Mad LJ 5] The Court in Gayatri Balaswamy [Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Mad 6568 : (2015) 1 Mad LJ 5] examined the issue in significant [sic] and held as follows : (Gayatri Balaswamy case [Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Mad 6568 : (2015) 1 Mad LJ 5] , SCC OnLine Mad para 52)\n- 21 - '52. Therefore, in my considered view, the expression \"recourse to a court against an arbitral award\" appearing in Section 34(1) cannot be construed to mean only a right to seek the setting aside of an award. Recourse against an arbitral award could be either for setting aside or for modifying or for enhancing or for varying or for revising an award. The expression \"application for setting aside such an award\" appearing in Sections 34(2) and (3) merely prescribes the form, in which, a person can seek recourse against an arbitral award. The form, in which an application has to be made, cannot curtail the substantial right conferred by the statute. In other words, the right to have recourse to a court, is a substantial right and that right is not liable to be curtailed, by the form in which the right has to be enforced or exercised. Hence, in my considered view, the power under Section 34(1) includes, within its ambit, the power to modify, vary or revise.' The same view had been adopted earlier by Single Bench decisions of the Bombay High Court in Axios Navigation Co. Ltd. v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. [Axios Navigation Co. Ltd. v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd., 2012 SCC OnLine Bom 4 : (2012) 114 (1) Bom LR 392] and Angerlehner Structurals & Civil Engg. Co. v. Municipal Corpn. of Greater Mumbai [Angerlehner Structurals & Civil Engg. Co. v. Municipal Corpn. of Greater Mumbai, 2012 SCC OnLine Bom 1454 : (2013) 7 Bom CR 83] and a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court - 22 - in W.B. Electronics Industries Development Corpn. Ltd. v. Snehasis Bhowmick [W.B. Electronics Industries Development Corpn. Ltd. v. Snehasis Bhowmick, 2012 SCC OnLine Cal 10262] .\nAuthorities holding there is no power to Modify, Vary or Remit the award ***\n118. This Court is inclined to follow the decisions in Central Warehousing Corpn. [Central Warehousing Corpn. v. A.S.A. Transport, 2007 SCC OnLine Mad 972] , DDA [DDA v. Bhardwaj Bros., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 1581] , State Trading Corpn. of India Ltd. [State Trading Corpn. of India Ltd. v. Toepfer International Asia PTE Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 3426] , Bharti Cellular Ltd. [Bharti Cellular Ltd. v. Deptt. of Telecommunications, 2012 SCC OnLine Del 4846] , Cybernetics Network (P) Ltd. [Cybernetics Network (P) Ltd. v. Bisquare Technologies (P) Ltd., 2012 SCC OnLine Del 1155] and Asha Talwar [U.P. State Handloom Corpn. Ltd. v. Asha Lata Talwar, 2009 SCC OnLine All 624 : (2009) 4 All LJ 397] . The guiding principle on this issue was laid down by the Supreme Court in McDermott International Inc. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] , where the Court held :\n(McDermott International Inc. case [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] , SCC p. 208, para 52)\n- 23 - '52. The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. So, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it.' Although the Madras High Court in Gayatri Balaswamy [Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Mad 6568 :\n(2015) 1 Mad LJ 5] appropriately noted that these observations in McDermott International Inc. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] were not in the context of the specific issue being dealt herewith , this Court is of the opinion that it is determinative of the Court's approach in an enquiry under Section 34 of the Act. Indeed, a court, while modifying or varying the award would be doing nothing else but \"correct[ing] the errors of the arbitrators\". This is expressly against the diktat ofMcDermottInternational Inc. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn - 24 - Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] Further, if the power to remit the matter to the arbitrator is read into Section 34, it would render inexplicable the deliberate omission by Parliament of a provision analogous to Section 16 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 in the present Act. Section 16 of the 1940 Act specifically armed courts with the power to remit the matter to arbitration. Noticeably, the scope of remission under the present Act is confined to that prescribed in sub- section (4) of Section 34. Besides the Division Bench rulings of this Court in DDA [DDA v. Bhardwaj Bros., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 1581] , State Trading Corpn. of India Ltd. [State Trading Corpn. of India Ltd. v. Toepfer International Asia PTE Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 3426] , this was also noted by a Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in R.S. Jiwani v. Ircon International Ltd. [R.S. Jiwani v. Ircon International Ltd., 2009 SCC OnLine Bom 2021 :\n(2010) 1 Bom CR 529] , where the Court held :\n(R.S. Jiwani case [R.S. Jiwani v. Ircon International Ltd., 2009 SCC OnLine Bom 2021 : (2010) 1 Bom CR 529] , SCC OnLine Bom paras 28 & 35) '28. ... An award can only be set aside under the provisions of Section 34 as there is no other provision except Section 33 which permits the Arbitral Tribunal to correct or interpret the award or pass additional award, that too, on limited grounds stated in Section 33. ... \n***\n- 25 - 35. ... It is also true that there are no pari materia provisions like Sections 15 and 16 of the Act of 1940 in the 1996 Act but still the provisions of Section 34 read together, sufficiently indicate vesting of vast powers in the court to set aside an award and even to adjourn a matter and such acts and deeds by the Arbitral Tribunal at the instance of the party which would help in removing the grounds of attack for setting aside the arbitral award.' On the other hand, the Calcutta High Court in Snehasis Bhowmick [W.B. Electronics Industries Development Corpn. Ltd. v. Snehasis Bhowmick, 2012 SCC OnLine Cal 10262] did not analyse this distinction, or the specific observations of the Supreme Court in McDermott International Inc. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] quoted above. Further, the decisions in Numaligarh Refinery [Numaligarh Refinery Ltd. v. Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd., (2007) 8 SCC 466] and Harischandra Reddy [Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. v. Harischandra Reddy, (2007) 2 SCC 720] did not discuss the Court's power to modify, vary or remit the award under Section 34 of the Act. Therefore, in light of the dictum in McDermott International Inc. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] and the difference in provisions of the 1940 Act and the present Act, this Court holds that the power to - 26 - modify, vary or remit the award does not exist under Section 34 of the Act.\" \n14. So also, in the case of Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited Vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited reported in (2022) 1 SCC 131, it was held as under:\n28. This Court has in several other judgments interpreted Section 34 of the 1996 Act to stress on the restraint to be shown by Courts while examining the validity of the arbitral awards. The limited grounds available to Courts for annulment of arbitral awards are well known to legally trained minds. However, the difficulty arises in applying the well-established principles for interference to the facts of each case that come up before the Courts. There is a disturbing tendency of Courts setting aside arbitral awards, after dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases to come to a conclusion that the award needs intervention and thereafter, dubbing the award to be vitiated by either perversity or patent illegality, apart from the other grounds available for annulment of the award. This approach would lead to corrosion of the object of the 1996 Act and the endeavours made to preserve this object, which is minimal judicial interference with arbitral awards. That apart, several judicial pronouncements of this Court would become a dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by categorising them as perverse or patently illegal without appreciating the contours of the said expressions. \n- 27 - 29. Patent illegality should be illegality which goes to the root of the matter. In other words, every error of law committed by the Arbitral Tribunal would not fall within the expression \"patent illegality\". Likewise, erroneous application of law cannot be categorised as patent illegality. In addition, contravention of law not linked to public policy or public interest is beyond the scope of the expression \"patent illegality\". What is prohibited is for Courts to reappreciate evidence to conclude that the award suffers from patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, as Courts do not sit in appeal against the arbitral award. The permissible grounds for interference with a domestic award under Section 34(2-A) on the ground of patent illegality is when the arbitrator takes a view which is not even a possible one, or interprets a clause in the contract in such a manner which no fair- minded or reasonable person would, or if the arbitrator commits an error of jurisdiction by wandering outside the contract and dealing with matters not allotted to them. An arbitral award stating no reasons for its findings would make itself susceptible to challenge on this account. The conclusions of the arbitrator which are based on no evidence or have been arrived at by ignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. Also, consideration of documents which are not supplied to the other party is a facet of perversity falling within the expression \"patent illegality\".\n30. Section 34(2)(b) refers to the other grounds on which a court can set aside an arbitral award. If a dispute which is not capable of settlement by arbitration is the subject-matter of the award or if the award is in conflict - 28 - with public policy of India, the award is liable to be set aside. Explanation (1), amended by the 2015 Amendment Act, clarified the expression \"public policy of India\" and its connotations for the purposes of reviewing arbitral awards. It has been made clear that an award would be in conflict with public policy of India only when it is induced or affected by fraud or corruption or is in violation of Section 75 or Section 81 of the 1996 Act, if it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law or if it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice. \n31. In Ssangyong [Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, (2019) 15 SCC 131 : (2020) 2 SCC (Civ) 213] , this Court held that the meaning of the expression \"fundamental policy of Indian law\" would be in accordance with the understanding of this Court in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] . In Renusagar [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] , this Court observed that violation of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, a statute enacted for the \"national economic interest\", and disregarding the superior Courts in India would be antithetical to the fundamental policy of Indian law. Contravention of a statute not linked to public policy or public interest cannot be a ground to set at naught an arbitral award as being discordant with the fundamental policy of Indian law and neither can it be brought within the confines of \"patent illegality\" as discussed above. In other words, contravention of a statute only if it is linked to public policy or public interest is cause for setting aside the - 29 - award as being at odds with the fundamental policy of Indian law. If an arbitral award shocks the conscience of the court, it can be set aside as being in conflict with the most basic notions of justice. The ground of morality in this context has been interpreted by this Court to encompass awards involving elements of sexual morality, such as prostitution, or awards seeking to validate agreements which are not illegal but would not be enforced given the prevailing mores of the day. [Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, (2019) 15 SCC 131 : (2020) 2 SCC (Civ) 213]\n15 . Similarly, in the case of Wellspun Speciality Solutions Limited Vs. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited reported in (2022) 2 SCC 382, it was held as under:\n22. Before we analyse the award, we need to first ascertain the scope of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, before the 2015 amendment, which provided for certain specific grounds for challenge. Section 34, as it existed, reads as under:\n\"34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.--(1) Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3).\n(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if-- ***\n- 30 - (b) the Court finds that-- (i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force, or (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India.\" \n(emphasis supplied) \n23. The limited grounds provided under Section 34 of the Act, has been interpreted by this Court on numerous occasions. In this case at hand, the challenge of award is based on the fact that the same is against the public policy and patent illegality. Public policy as a ground of challenge has always been met with certain scepticism. The phrase \"public policy\" does not indicate \"a catch-all provision\" to challenge awards before an appellate forum on infinite grounds. However, the ambit of the same is so diversly interpreted that in some cases, the purpose of limiting the Section 34 jurisdiction is lost. This Court's jurisprudence also shows that Section 34(2)(b) has undergone a lot of churning and continue to evolve. The purpose of Section 34 is to strike a balance between the court's appellate powers and integrity of the arbitral process. \n24. The first case, which expounded on the scope of \"public policy\" was Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] , which inter alia provided that a foreign award may not be enforced under the said Act, if the court dealing with the case is satisfied that the enforcement of the award will be contrary to the public policy. After elaborate discussion, the Court arrived at the - 31 - conclusion that public policy comprehended in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961 is the \"public policy of India\" and does not cover the public policy of any other country. \n25. For giving meaning to the term \"public policy\", the Court observed thus : (Renusagar Power case [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] , SCC p. 682, para 66) \"66. Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention of 1958 and Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act do not postulate refusal of recognition and enforcement of a foreign award on the ground that it is contrary to the law of the country of enforcement and the ground of challenge is confined to the recognition and enforcement being contrary to the public policy of the country in which the award is set to be enforced. There is nothing to indicate that the expression \"public policy\" in Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention and Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act is not used in the same sense in which it was used in Article I(c) of the Geneva Convention, 1927 and Section 7(1) of the Protocol and Convention Act, 1937. This would mean that \"public policy\" in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) has been used in a narrower sense and in order to attract the bar of public policy the enforcement of the award must invoke something more than the violation of the law of India. Since the Foreign Awards Act is concerned with recognition and enforcement of foreign awards which are - 32 - governed by the principles of private international law, the expression \"public policy\" in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act must necessarily be construed in the sense the doctrine of public policy is applied in the field of private international law. Applying the said criteria it must be held that the enforcement of a foreign award would be refused on the ground that it is contrary to public policy if such enforcement would be contrary to (i) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (ii) the interests of India; or (iii) justice or morality.\" \n26. In ONGC v. Saw Pipes Ltd. [ONGC v. Saw Pipes Ltd., (2003) 5 SCC 705] , the scope of Section 34 was expanded to include patent illegality as a ground for challenging the award and held as under : (SCC pp. 727- 28 & 744-45, paras 31 & 74) \"31. Therefore, in our view, the phrase \"public policy of India\" used in Section 34 in context is required to be given a wider meaning. It can be stated that the concept of public policy connotes some matter which concerns public good and the public interest. What is for public good or in public interest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public good or public interest has varied from time to time. However, the award which is, on the face of it, patently in violation of statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public interest. Such award/judgment/decision is likely to adversely affect the administration of justice. Hence, in our view in addition to narrower - 33 - meaning given to the term \"public policy\"\nin Renusagar case [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] it is required to be held that the award could be set aside if it is patently illegal. The result would be--award could be set aside if it is contrary to:\n(a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (b) the interest of India; or (c) justice or morality, or (d) in addition, if it is patently illegal. \nIllegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality is of trivial nature it cannot be held that award is against the public policy. Award could also be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of the court. Such award is opposed to public policy and is required to be adjudged void. \n***\n74. In the result, it is held that:\n(A)(1) The court can set aside the arbitral award under Section 34(2) of the Act if the party making the application furnishes proof that:\n(i) a party was under some incapacity, or (ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or - 34 - (iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration. \n(2) The court may set aside the award:\n(i)(a) if the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties,\n(b) failing such agreement, the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal was not in accordance with Part I of the Act. \n(ii) if the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with:\n(a) the agreement of the parties, or (b) failing such agreement, the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with Part I of the Act. \nHowever, exception for setting aside the award on the ground of composition of Arbitral Tribunal or illegality of arbitral procedure is that the agreement should not be in conflict with the provisions of Part I - 35 - of the Act from which parties cannot derogate. \n(c) If the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal is in contravention of the provisions of the Act or any other substantive law governing the parties or is against the terms of the contract. \n(3) The award could be set aside if it is against the public policy of India, that is to say, if it is contrary to:\n(a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (b) the interest of India; or (c) justice or morality; or (d) if it is patently illegal. \n(4) It could be challenged:\n(a) as provided under Section 13(5); and (b) Section 16(6) of the Act.\" \n27. Eventually, a three-Judge Bench in ONGC v. Western Geco International Ltd. [ONGC v. Western Geco International Ltd., (2014) 9 SCC 263 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 12] , while upholding Saw Pipes case [ONGC v. Saw Pipes Ltd., (2003) 5 SCC 705] , noted that \"illegality\" of the award must go to root of the matter. Illegality of a trivial nature could not be held to violate the public policy. \n28. In Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd. [Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd., (2019) 20 SCC 1] , this Court held : (SCC p. 12, paras 24-25)\n- 36 - \"24. There is no dispute that Section 34 of the Arbitration Act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various Courts. We need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the Court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. Section 34 is different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. The mandate under Section 34 is to respect the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. If the Courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated. \n25. Moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this Court have categorically held that the Courts should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. The Courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.\"\n- 37 - 16. In the case of U.H.L. Power Company Limited Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh reported in (2022) SCC ONLINE SC 19, the limited and narrow scope of Section 34 of the said Act of 1996 was reiterated by another three Judge Bench of the Apex Court as under:\n16. As it is, the jurisdiction conferred on Courts under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is fairly narrow, when it comes to the scope of an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, the jurisdiction of an Appellate Court in examining an order, setting aside or refusing to set aside an award, is all the more circumscribed. In MMTC Limited v. Vedanta Limited7, the reasons for vesting such a limited jurisdiction on the High Court in exercise of powers under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act has been explained in the following words: \n\"11. As far as Section 34 is concerned, the position is well-settled by now that the Court does not sit in appeal over the arbitral award and may interfere on merits on the limited ground provided under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) i.e. if the award is against the public policy of India. As per the legal position clarified through decisions of this Court prior to the amendments to the 1996 Act in 2015, a violation of Indian public policy, in turn, includes a violation of the fundamental policy of Indian law, a violation of the interest of India, conflict with justice or morality, and the existence of patent illegality in the arbitral award. Additionally, the concept of the \"fundamental policy of Indian law\" would cover compliance with - 38 - statutes and judicial precedents, adopting a judicial approach, compliance with the principles of natural justice, and Wednesbury [Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corpn., [1948] 1 K.B. 223 (CA)] reasonableness. Furthermore, \"patent illegality\" itself has been held to mean contravention of the substantive law of India, contravention of the 1996 Act, and contravention of the terms of the contract.\"\n17. A similar view, as stated above, has been taken by this Court in K. Sugumar v. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. , where it has been observed as follows:\n\"2. The contours of the power of the Court under Section 34 of the Act are too well established to require any reiteration. Even a bare reading of Section 34 of the Act indicates the highly constricted power of the civil court to interfere with an arbitral award. The reason for this is obvious. When parties have chosen to avail an alternate mechanism for dispute resolution, they must be left to reconcile themselves to the wisdom of the decision of the arbitrator and the role of the court should be restricted to the bare minimum. Interference will be justified only in cases of commission of misconduct by the arbitrator which can find manifestation in different forms including exercise of legal perversity by the arbitrator.\" \n18. It has also been held time and again by this Court that if there are two plausible interpretations of the terms and conditions of the contract, then no fault can be found,\n- 39 - if the learned Arbitrator proceeds to accept one interpretation as against the other. In Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd.9, the limitations on the Court while exercising powers under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act has been highlighted thus:\n\"24. There is no dispute that Section 34 of the Arbitration Act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various Courts. We need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the Court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. Section 34 is different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. The mandate under Section 34 is to respect the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. If the Courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated.\"\n19. In Parsa Kente Collieries Limited v. Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited10, adverting to the previous decisions of this Court in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co.\nLtd. and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. v. Dewan Chand Ram Saran12, wherein it has been observed that an - 40 - Arbitral Tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract, but if a term of the contract has been construed in a reasonable manner, then the award ought not to be set aside on this ground, it has been held thus:\n\"9.1 ...........It is further observed and held that construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an Arbitrator to decide unless the Arbitrator construes the contract in such a way that it could be said to be something that no fair-minded or reasonable person could do. It is further observed by this Court in the aforesaid decision in paragraph 33 that when a court is applying the \"public policy\" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court of appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. A possible view by the Arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the Arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. It is further observed that thus an award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be invalid on this score. \n9.2 Similar is the view taken by this Court in NHAI v. ITD Cementation (India) Ltd., (2015) 14 SCC 21, para 25 and SAIL v. Gupta Brother Steel Tubes Ltd., (2009) 10 SCC 63, para 29.\" \n20. In Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. (supra), the view taken above has been reiterated in the following words:\n- 41 - \"25. Moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this Court have categorically held that the courts should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. The courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.\"\n21. An identical line of reasoning has been adopted in South East Asia Marine Engg. & Constructions Ltd. [SEAMAC Limited] v. Oil India Ltd.13 and it has been held as follows:\n\"12. It is a settled position that a court can set aside the award only on the grounds as provided in the Arbitration Act as interpreted by the courts. Recently, this Court in Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd. [Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd., (2019) 20 SCC 1 : 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1656] laid down the scope of such interference. This Court observed as follows :\n(SCC pp. 11-12, para 24) \"24. There is no dispute that Section 34 of the Arbitration Act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various Courts. We need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the Court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of - 42 - the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. Section 34 is different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. The mandate under Section 34 is to respect the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. If the Courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated.\" \n13. It is also settled law that where two views are possible, the Court cannot interfere in the plausible view taken by the arbitrator supported by reasoning. This Court in Dyna Technologies [Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd., (2019) 20 SCC 1 : 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1656] observed as under : (SCC p.12, para 25)\n25. Moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this Court have categorically held that the Court should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. The Courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.\"\n- 43 - 22. In the instant case, we are of the view that the interpretation of the relevant clauses of the Implementation Agreement, as arrived at by the learned Sole Arbitrator, are both, possible and plausible. Merely because another view could have been taken, can hardly be a ground for the learned Single Judge to have interfered with the arbitral award. In the given facts and circumstances of the case, the Appellate Court has rightly held that the learned Single Judge exceeded his jurisdiction in interfering with the award by questioning the interpretation given to the relevant clauses of the Implementation Agreement, as the reasons given are backed by logic. \n17. A perusal of the various contentions urged by the appellant before the commercial court as well as before this Court clearly indicate that the same are in the realm of appreciation of evidence which is clearly beyond the scope and ambit of the limited and restricted jurisdiction available under Sections 34 and 37 of the said Act of 1996. As stated supra, the grievance of the appellant who was the petitioner / applicant before the commercial court in Com.A.S.No.62/2019 is with regard to not allowing the entire claims -F, G and H and partly allowing claims - D, E and I put forth by the appellant who contends that the claims ought to have been allowed in favour of the - 44 - appellant and not only a part / portion of the claims as had been done by the Arbitral Tribunal; a perusal of the arbitral award will clearly indicate that the Arbitral Tribunal has carefully and properly considered and appreciated the pleadings and evidence of the parties in relation to all the claims and has come to the conclusion that though the appellant had sought several amounts in relation to the aforesaid claims - D to I, the appellant was entitled to only a part / portion of the claims and that the appellant had not adduced sufficient legal or acceptable evidence which would entitle him to the entire claim. Under these circumstances, having regard to the limited and restricted scope of interference with the arbitral award which was based on appreciation of evidence and not on account of any non- consideration of evidence nor based on no evidence, the commercial court was fully justified in dismissing the petition / application filed by the appellant under Section 34 of the said Act of 1996. \n18. It is equally well settled that the Court dealing with an application under Section 34 of the said Act of 1996 filed by the unsuccessful claimant cannot enhance or increase the amounts granted by the Arbitral Tribunal in - 45 - favour of the claimant nor can a claim be granted for the first time by the Section 34 Court by modifying, varying or correcting the arbitral award and the only option available to the Section 34 Court is to set aside the arbitral award, if permissible as stated supra and relegate the parties to fresh arbitration, if they so desire, as held by the Apex Court in the case of Mc. Dermott International INC Vs. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., & others reported in (2006) 11 SCC 181 and followed by Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Smt. Padma Mahadev and others Vs. M/s. Sierra Constructions passed in COMAP No.2/2021 dated 22.03.2021. In the instant case, the material on record discloses that while claims - A and B were fully allowed by the Arbitral Tribunal, claims - F, G and H were rejected and claims - C, D, E and I were allowed only in part, aggrieved by which the appellant filed the petition/application under Section 34 of the said Act of 1996. In view of the aforesaid well settled position of law stated supra that the Section 34 Court, muchless this Court in an appeal under Section 37 of the said Act of 1996 cannot pass an award granting a claim that was rejected in respect of claims - F , G and H nor grant the claim of the - 46 - appellant in full in relation to claims - C, D, E and I , we are of the considered opinion that the trial Court was fully justified in confirming the impugned Arbitral Award, which does not warrant interference on this ground also. \n19. On careful perusal of the material on record and after giving our anxious consideration to the rival submissions, we are of the considered opinion that the Arbitral Tribunal has rightly held that the termination of the agreement was illegal because the respondent failed to prove the grounds of termination, the termination was arbitrary and against the principles of natural justice. The Arbitral Tribunal had jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute as the agreements were statutory contracts executed under the provisions of Transparency in Public Procurements Act. \nThe award passed by the Tribunal is based on evidence and as such, no interference is required by the Court under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. \nThe Commercial Court has rightly rejected the cases filed under Section 34 of the said Act of 1996. The impugned award passed by the Tribunal as well as impugned judgment and order passed by the Commercial Court are correct and proper and they do not contain any illegality or - 47 - infirmity nor the same can be said to be perverse or capricious warranting interference by this Court in the present appeal under Section 37 of the said act of 1996. \n20. Accordingly, we do not find any merit in the appeal and the same is hereby dismissed. \nSd/-\nCHIEF JUSTICE Sd/-\nJUDGE Srl.",

(i) factual background: 2. the appellant is a company incorporated under the provisions of companies act, 1956 and is engaged in the business of manufacturing and brewing beer under several brands. the respondent is also a company under the provisions of companies act, 1956 incorporated with a view to cater to the needs of multinational companies in assisting, marketing, organizing and setting up of their businesses in india. an agreement viz., customer information and service provider agreement (cisp) was executed on 21.03.2012 between skol breweries limited (skol) and elios business solutions private limited (elios). under the aforesaid agreement, elios was engaged by skol for promotion of sale of its products in the erstwhile state of andhra pradesh. 3. first addendum to the agreement to aforesaid cisp agreement was executed on 03.06.2014. the parties by the aforesaid addendum agreed to rename skol as sabmiller and the cisp agreement was made applicable to the states of telangana and andhra pradesh pursuant to its bifurcation with effect from 02.06.2014. on 09.09.2015, sabmiller by a second addendum renewed the cisp agreement with elios for a period of 5 years with effect from 01.10.2015 till 31.08.2020. under the aforesaid addendum, the parties also agreed to extend the term of cisp and further agreed to assign the rights, duties and liabilities of elios under the cisp agreement to respondent herein. thereafter, sabmiller was acquired by the appellant in 2017. 4. clause 10.4 of the cisp agreement provides that if respondent breaches any of the terms of the agreement, the agreement can be terminated immediately without prior notice. clause 16, contains an arbitration clause. clause 17.2 requires the respondent to strictly comply with code of business conduct and ethics and policy on business hospitality and customer/supplier relations of the appellant and the respondents as well as all its associated parties including its, promoters were under an obligation to remain compliant with anti corruption laws applicable in india. clause 20a recorded the respondent's representations that neither the respondent nor any of its associated parties including the promoter has at any time admitted to having engaged in any corrupt act or similar conduct. the aforesaid clause further records the representation of the respondent that it has not at any time been investigated or been suspected in any jurisdiction in any corrupt act or similar act. under clause 20b, the respondent agreed that it would immediately notify the appellant if the representations made in clause 20a are no longer correct. 5. it is the case of the appellant that name of the director of the respondent prominently featured in first information report viz., fir no.rc224 2017 80001 dated 06.02.2017, which was filed against one mr.qureshi. the bbm chat data enclosed with the complaint included the communication exchanged between the director of the respondent viz., mr.sana and one mr.qureshi. thereafter, on 15.10.2018, a complaint was made by mr.sana viz., the director of respondent, in which he candidly admitted to engaging in corrupt acts of bribing public officials in order to attain a favorable outcome in the case registered by the cbi. according to the appellant, the director of the respondent did not comply with anti corruption laws, and had engaged in a corrupt practice of similar act and had been suspected of having been investigated for corrupt act or similar act. according to the appellant, the conduct of the respondent constituted breach of clauses 17.2, 20a and 20b of the cisp agreement, therefore, the appellant by an e-mail communication dated 05.03.2018, terminated the cisp agreement. 6. being aggrieved by termination notice dated 05.03.2018, the respondent issued a notice dated 08.03.2018 and invoked the arbitration clause. the respondent also filed an application under section 9 of the act seeking an interim protection, wherein on 14.03.2018 an interim order of status quo was passed. the aforesaid petition was disposed of on 05.03.2019 directing the parties to maintain status quo and the liberty was granted to the respondent to seek relief before the arbitral tribunal. 7. thereafter, an arbitral tribunal was constituted. the respondent filed statement of claim on 24.08.2018 wherein, the relief of declaration that termination notice is invalid was sought. the respondent also sought the relief of specific performance of the agreement and payment of outstanding dues to it. the appellant filed statement of defence on 29.10.2018. thereafter, the respondent on 24.02.2019 filed an application under section 23(3) of the act seeking permission to amend its statement of claim. the arguments were heard on application for amendment on 11.04.2019 and orders were reserved and next date in the proceeding was fixed as 06.05.2019. however, on 06.05.2019, the respondent withdrew the application for amendment with a liberty to file a fresh application. the application for amendment filed by the respondent was allowed by an order dated 28.05.2019, keeping the issue of jurisdiction of the tribunal to deal with amended prayers. 8. on 13.06.2019, the respondent filed its amended statement of claim, in which the respondent sought a declaration that termination is invalid and claims were made on account of unpaid invoices, damages for loss of revenue as well as loss of reputation, to the extent of rs.4.3 crores, rs.41 crores and rs.5 crores respectively. the appellant filed the amended statement of defence on 12.07.2019, to which the respondent filed the rejoinder on 27.07.2019. 9. on 18.10.2019, the respondent stated before the tribunal that it would not lead any oral evidence. the appellant also stated before the tribunal that it will also not lead any oral evidence. the appellant and respondent filed their respective affidavits of admission and denial of documents on 06 and 07.12.2019. the proceeding were fixed for 08.12.2019 and 09.12.2019 for final arguments. on 09.12.2019, the respondent while arguing the matter finally filed an affidavit along with additional documents. thereafter, the arguments were heard and the award was delivered on 02.11.2020. 10. the arbitral tribunal by majority (2:1) inter alia held that termination notice dated 05.03.2018 issued by the appellant terminating the services of respondent is bad in law and the same was set aside. the respondent was held entitled to a sum of rs.3,98,81,995/along with interest at the rate of 10% per annum from the date on which the amount became due till realization in respect of outstanding invoices as actual damages. the respondent was also held entitled to a sum of rs.16,04,41,281/along with interest at the rate of 10% per annum from the date of award till its realization, as notional damages for business loss to the respondent. the respondent was also held entitled to a sum of rs.2,03,71,475/towards cost of arbitration in addition to the stamp duty. 11. the appellant filed objections under section 34 of the act to the aforesaid award before the commercial court. the commercial court by judgment dated 24.06.2021 dismissed the objections preferred by the appellant and has held that in a proceeding under section 34 of the act, the commercial court cannot re appreciate the evidence and cannot set aside an award merely on an erroneous application of law. it was further held that no ground enumerated under section 34 of the act is made out for interference with the majority award passed by the arbitral tribunal. accordingly, the petition under section 34 of the act filed by the appellant was dismissed. in the aforesaid factual background, this appeal has been filed. (ii). submissions of appellant:12. learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the respondent sought reference of dispute in respect of two claims viz., termination of agreement and arrears of invoice. however, by way of an amendment additional relief for damages was sought. while referring to the statement of objection to the petition under section 9 of the act, it is pointed out that respondent has stated therein that contract has been terminated by the appellant and therefore, the claim for damages ought to have been made while seeking reference. it is also pointed out that an application for amendment was filed on 24.02.2019, however, the same was withdrawn and another application seeking amendment was filed. thus, it is contended that application for amendment was filed belatedly after a period of one year from the date of notice dated 08.03.2018 and the same was beyond the scope of reference. 13. it is also urged that parties are bound by rules framed by ica (indian council of arbitration), and in view of rule 15(i) and (ii)(b) of the rules an application seeking amendment could not have been filed and arbitral tribunal without addressing the issue with regard to delay in filing the application for amendment erroneously allowed the same and enlarged the scope of reference. it is also urged that in view of language employed in clause 16 of the agreement, which is an arbitration clause, 'a dispute' can be referred to the arbitral tribunal and therefore, the order allowing the application for amendment for additional claims amounts to permitting multiple disputes to be raised for adjudication, which is not permissible. it is also contended that the claim for amendment is in the nature of an additional claim, which was not raised in the notice seeking reference to the arbitration and the scope of arbitration cannot be enlarged beyond the dispute, which is sought to be referred for adjudication to the tribunal. it is argued that the application for amendment of reference petition is barred under order 2 rule 2 of code of civil procedure 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'the code' for short). 14. it is contended that concept of morality found in the act is also inbuilt in clause 20 of the agreement. it is urged that the tribunal ought to have appreciated that even suspicion of commission of an offence or even, an investigation into the matter by itself is enough to attract clauses 10.4 and 20 of the agreement to terminate the contract. it is argued that claim has been made by the respondent for nominal damages and not actual damages and there is a distinction between the 'actual damages' and 'nominal damages'. it is also urged that all nominal damages are small but all small damages are not nominal. it is also argued that the tribunal without there being any evidence with regard to the damages or the loss sustained by the respondent has awarded damages, which are in the nature of actual damages. 15. it is argued that in the absence of proof of disputed documents, the tribunal could not have passed an award in respect of claim of unpaid invoices. it is also pointed out that no material was produced in support of claim for award of cost and the award of cost to the extent of rs.2,03,71,475/is exorbitant and is excessive. it is also urged that the commercial court ought to have appreciated that the award cannot be sustained on the grounds under section 34(2)(iv), 34(2)(b)(ii) and section 34(2a) of the act. it is also contended that the commercial court has not considered the grounds raised by the appellants and has passed the judgment in a perfunctory manner. it is urged that the commercial court erred in holding that appellant ought to have led evidence to justify its stand specially in view of the fact that no evidence was adduced by respondent. it is also urged that the commercial court ought to have appreciated that the award of damages is contrary to section 74 of the indian contract act. in support of aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on decisions in 'taylor v oakes, roncoroni and co', (1922) all er rep ext 866, 'nune sivayya vs. maddu ranganayakulu', air 1935 pc 67, 'juggilal kamlapat vs. pratapmal rameshwar', (1978) 1 scc 69, 'm.lachia setty and sons ltd. vs. coffee board', (1980) 4 scc 636, 'associates builders vs. delhi development authority',

(iii) submissions of respondent: 16. on the other hand, learned senior counsel for the respondent invited the attention of this court to sections 34 and 37 of the act and contended that an arbitral award can be challenged only on limited grounds specified in section 34 and scope of challenge in an appeal under section 37, to correctness of the findings on a petition under section 34 of the act is narrow. it is further contended that appeal under section 37 of the act is in the nature of a second appeal under section 100 of the code, and there is no scope for reappreciation of evidence. it is also submitted that with regard to findings of fact, the arbitral tribunal is the final authority. 17. it is argued that in a case based on breach of contract, an aggrieved party has two remedies. firstly, either to sue for specific performance of contract or secondly to claim damages for the loss sustained on account of breach of contract. in this connection, reference has been made to section 21 of the specific relief act. it is stated that appellant, in the instant case, has given up the claim of specific performance of contract. it is also urged that the application seeking amendment was not an application for additional claim but for an application specifying actual damages claimed under different heads and was filed before the arbitral tribunal before commencement of the trial. it is also contended that cause of action to seek damages is available, the moment contract is breached. it is also urged that even, in a claim for specific performance of the contract without claiming damages, an application seeking damages can be filed subsequently and the same does not change the nature of original claim. it is also urged that the application for amendment was not filed belatedly. 18. it is also pointed out that arbitral tribunal has awarded only 38.5% of the amount claimed by the respondent and the remaining claim has been rejected for want of evidence. it is also urged that amount awarded by the tribunal towards damages is based on documentary evidence adduced by the respondent before the tribunal. it is also urged that claim for damages was made on the basis of statistics of sale for the year 2017 and the respondent had claimed 15% escalation, whereas the tribunal has awarded escalation @ 10% only. 19. it is also urged that claim relating to damages being a claim based on breach of contract is a dispute covered by the clause relating to arbitration and therefore, the claim of damages cannot be termed as beyond the scope of reference. it is also urged that the claim for damages is based on the documents which were not disputed by the appellant and the same is based on e-mails sent by the appellant to the respondent. it is also urged that clause 20 of the agreement does not impose a general moral obligation but incorporates the obligation to be adhered to while having business transaction, with the parties to the agreement. it is also contended that there is no material on record to indicate that the appellant had the knowledge about violation of clause 20 of the agreement at the time of issuing the notice terminating the contract. 20. it is also pointed out that in the first information report, no reference was made to the director of the respondent and second first information report was based on the complaint by the director of the respondent. it is urged that there is nothing on record to indicate that clause 20 of the agreement is violated. in support of aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the decisions in 'punjab state civil supplies corpn ltd and anr vs. ramesh kumar and company and others' civil appeal no.6832/2021, 'l.g.electronics india vs. dinesh kalra' (2018) scc online delhi 8367, 'mmtc limited vs. vedanta limited' (2019) 4 scc 163, 'jj engineers pvt. ltd. vs. union of india' (2011) 5 scc 758, 'mcdermat international ink vs. burn standard company' (2006) 11 scc 181, 'sail vs. gupta brothers steel tubes' (2009) 10 scc 63, 'ntpc vs. m/s. deconar services' in c.a.6483/2014, 'nayana technologies pvt. ltd. vs. crompton greaves' (2019) 20 scc 1, 'nhai vs. itd cementation' (2015) 14 scc 21, 'modular bux vs. union of india' (1969) 2 scc 554, 'ongc vs. saw pipes' (2003) 5 scc 705, 'juginal kamalpat vs. pratam pal rameshwar' (1978) 1 scc 69, 'unni sivaiah vs. muddu ranganayakalu', 'state of goa vs. praveen enterprises' (2012) 12 scc 581 and 'v.h.patel company vs. dhirubhai patel & ors' (2000) 4 scc 368. (iv) rejoinder submissions: 21. by way of rejoinder, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that respondent made a claim under section 21 of the specific relief act, 1963 in the original claim statement and by way of an amendment claim under section 73 of the indian contract act, 1872 was made. it is contended that aforesaid claims are entirely different and causes of action for filing the claims are different. it is argued that claim under section 21 of the specific relief act, 1963 can be awarded, only if contract between the parties is enforceable and in case, the court is not inclined to grant the relief of specific performance. it is also urged that since the claim of specific performance of the contract has been abandoned by way of an amendment, the damages under section 21 of the specific relief act, 1963 could not have been granted. it is urged that the damages have been awarded by the tribunal under section 73 of the indian contract act, which is beyond the scope of reference. it is pointed out that the tribunal erred in awarding damages on the basis of a document which was disputed by the appellant at the stage of admission and denial of documents. it is also urged that the document in question which is in the form of a chart, indicates projection of profit and the tribunal, without referring to statement of profit of the respondent for the financial years 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18, awarded huge amount in terms of damages. 22. it is pointed out that most of the judgments relied upon by respondent deal with pre-amended section 34 i.e., before introduction of section 34(2a) of the 1996 act. it is urged that the aforesaid provision enables the court to set aside an arbitral award in case the same is vitiated by patent illegality. it is also argued that section 34(2a) of the act which provides for an additional ground of challenge, has to be read along with section 28(3) of the act. it is also urged that appellant had knowledge about violation of clause 20 and had valid grounds to terminate the contract. it is also urged that commercial court neither dealt with the central issue of the case namely whether the termination of contract is valid or not nor has recorded any finding in this regard. it is also urged that tribunal ought to have appreciated that the cases on which reliance was placed by it are the cases pertaining to damages either under section 21 of the specific relief act, 1963, where the relief of specific performance was claimed or under section 73 of the indian contract act where a specific claim was made on the basis of termination of contract. it is therefore submitted that the order passed by the commercial court deserves to be set aside. in support of aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the decision rendered by learned single judge of bombay high court in 'board of control for cricket in india vs. deccan chronicle holdings ltd.' in commercial arbitration petition (l) no.4466/2020 dated 16.06.2021. however, it is fairly pointed out that against the aforesaid decision, an appeal is pending. reference is also been made to division bench of this court in 'larsen and toubro limited (construction division) vs. geodesic techniques private limited' decided on 21.10.2021 in comap no.31/2021. (v) relevant statutory provisions 23. before proceeding further, it is apposite to take note of relevant provisions of the act, the specific relief act, 1963 and the indian contract act, 1872. the relevant extract of section 23, 28, 34 and section 37 of the act read as under: 23.(3) unless otherwise agreed by the parties, either party may amend or supplement his claim or defence during the course of the arbitral proceedings, unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow the amendment or supplement having regard to the delay in making it.

(2a) an arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the court, if the court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. provided than an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence. 37. appealable orders.-(1) an appeal shall lie from the following orders (and from no others) to the court authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the court passing the order, namely:-(a) granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9; (b) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34.

(3) no second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or take away any right to appeal to the supreme court. the specific relief act, 1963: 24. section 21 of the act as it existed prior to its amendment with effect from 01.10.2018 reads as under: 21. power to award compensation in certain cases.(1) in a suit for specific performance of a contract, the plaintiff may also claim compensation for its breach, either in addition to, or in substitution of, such performance. (2) if, in any such suit, the court decides that specific performance ought not to be granted, but that there is a contract between the parties which has been broken by the defendant, and that the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for that breach, it shall award him such compensation accordingly. (3) if, in any such suit, the court decides that specific performance ought to be granted, but that it is not sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case, and that some compensation for breach of the contract should also be made to the plaintiff, it shall award him such compensation accordingly. (4) in determining the amount of any compensation awarded under this section, the court shall be guided by the principles specified in section in section 73 of the indian contract act, 1872 (9 of 1872). (5) no compensation shall be awarded under this section unless the plaintiff has claimed such compensation in his plaint: provided that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such compensation in the plaint the court shall, at any stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint, on such terms as may be just, for including a claim for such compensation. explanation. the circumstance that the contract has become incapable of specific performance does not preclude the court from exercising the jurisdiction conferred by this section. the amended section 21(1) reads as under: (1) in a suit for specific performance of a contract, the plaintiff may also claim compensation for its breach, either in addition to, or in substitution of, such performance. 25. it is pertinent to note that sub-sections (2) to (5) of section 21 remain as it is. however, by act no.18/2018 in sub-section (1) of section 21, the words 'either in addition to, or in substitution of' have been substituted by 'in addition to'. the indian contract act, 1872: 26. the relevant extract of section 73 reads as under: 73. compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of contract. when a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the contract, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of things from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach of it. such compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach. compensation for failure to discharge obligation resembling those created by contract: when an obligation resembling those created by contract has been incurred and has not been discharged, any person injured by the failure to discharge it is entitled to receive the same compensation from the party in default, as if such person had contracted to discharge it and had broken his contract. explanation: in estimating the loss or damage arising from a breach of contract, the means which existed of remedying the inconvenience caused by the non-performance of the contract must be taken into account. (vi) scope of section 34: 27. the scope and ambit of section 34 of the act is well delineated by catena of decisions of supreme court. the supreme court in ssangyong engineering and construction company limited supra while dealing with powers of the court, deciding application under section 34 of the act, took note of the amendments brought about to section 34 of the act by amendment act 2015, explained the ratio of the decisions of the supreme court in ongc vs. western geco international limited', (2014) 9 scc 263, associate builders vs. dda, (2015) 3 scc 49, post amendment to section 34 of the act and laid down following principles as mentioned in para 34 to para 41 of the judgment. (i) the interference by the court with an award on the ground that arbitrator has not adopted a judicial approach would tantamount to interference with merits of the award which cannot be permitted, post amendment of section 34 of the act. (ii) the ground for interference insofar as it concerns 'interests of india' has been deleted, therefore, it is no longer permissible to interfere with the award on the said ground. (iii) similarly, the ground for interference in the award on the basis that the same is in conflict with justice and morality, has to be understood as conflict with 'most basic notions of morality or justice'. (iv) the expression 'public policy of india' is now restricted to mean that a domestic award is contrary to fundamental policy of indian law and the ground for interference that such an award is against basic notions of justice or morality is done away with. (v) the exercise of re-appreciation of evidence, which the appellate court can undertake is not permitted on the ground of patent illegality in the award. (vi) mere contravention of substantive law of india by itself is no longer a ground available to set aside an arbitral award. (vii) the change made in section 28(3) by the amendment act follows that construction of terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide unless the arbitrator construes the contract in a manner that no fair minded or reasonable person would, in short that arbitrators' view is not even a possible view to take. if the arbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with the matter not allotted to him he commits an error of jurisdiction and this ground of challenge is covered under section34(2-a) of the act. (viii) a decision of the arbitral tribunal, which is perverse is though no longer a ground of challenge under 'public policy of india', would certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. (ix) thus a finding recorded by an arbitrator which is based on no evidence at all or an award which invokes vital evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse and is liable to be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. 28. the decision ssangyong engineering and construction company limited supra was considered by supreme court in delhi airport metro express pvt. ltd. vs. metro rail corporation ltd. (2021) scc online sc 695 and in para 26 & para 27 of the judgment, the parameters of interference with an arbitral award on the ground of patent illegality were explained inter alia as under: (i) the patent illegality should be an illegality which goes to the root of the matter and every error of law committed by an arbitral tribunal would not fall within the expression of 'patent illegality'. (ii) erroneous application of law cannot be categorized as patent illegality. (iii) contravention of law not linked to public policy or public interest is beyond the scope of expression 'patent illegality'. (iv) the courts are prohibited to re appreciate the evidence to conclude that award suffers from patent illegality appearing on face of it as court do not sit in appeal against an arbitral award. (v) an award can be interfered with on the ground of patent illegaility when an arbitrator takes a view which is not even a possible view and interprets a clause in the contract in such a manner that no fair minded or reasonable person would or if the arbitrator commits an error of jurisdiction by wandering outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to it. (vi) an arbitral award stating no reasons for its findings would make itself susceptible to challenge on the ground of patent illegality. (vii) the conclusions of an arbitrator which are based on no evidence or have been arrived at by ignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. similarly, the consideration of documents, which are not supplied to the other party would render a finding recorded by the arbitrator perverse and the same would fall within the expression 'patent illegality'. (viii) explanation (1) amended by 2015 amendment act clarifies the expression 'public policy of india' and its connotations for the purposes of reviewing arbitral awards. it has been made clear that an award in conflict with public policy of india only when it is induced or affected by fraud or corruption or is in violation of section 75 or section 81 of the 1996 act, if it is in contravention of fundamental policy of india law or if it is in conflict with most basic notions of morality or justice. (ix) the contravention of a statute only if is linked to public policy or public interest is ground for setting aside the award as being at odds with the fundamental policy of indian law. 29. the aforesaid decisions of the supreme court were referred to with the approval by a three judge bench of the supreme court in state of chhattisgarh and another vs sal udyog private limited (2021 scc online 1027). (vii) scope of section 37: 30. an appeal is continuation of an original proceeding [see: 'lachmeshwar prasad shukvi and others v. keshawar lal chandhari's ors', air 1941 fc 5]. it is equally well settled in law that in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary, power of appellate court is co-terminus with all plenary powers of the subordinate court [see: 'jute corpn. of india ltd. v. cit', 1991 supp (2) scc 744]. thus an appellate court exercising powers undue section 37 of the act, would interfere only if a ground undue section 34 is made out. the issue with regard to scope of appeal under section 37 of the act is also settled by a three judge bench decision in state of chattisgarh supra and in an appeal under section 37 of the act, and it has been held that the grounds on which an award can be set aside can also be raised in an appeal. thus, the court exercising jurisdiction under section 37 of the act has power akin to a court dealing with objections under section 34 of the act. therefore, it is evident that an appeal under section 37 of the act cannot be construed to be an appeal under section 100 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 as the scope of interference in an appeal under section 37 of the act and in an appeal under section 100 of the civil procedure are distinct and different in terms of the statutes. viii scope of reference: 31. at the outset, it is apposite to take note of clause 16 of the agreement, which is an arbitration clause. the aforesaid clause reads as under: 16. arbitration: in the event of a dispute or difference arising between the parties as to their respective rights or obligation in terms hereof or connected herewith or incidental hereto (including any dispute or difference as to the existence or validity hereof) or as to the interpretation of any of the terms hereof, such dispute or difference shall be referred to the indian council of arbitration for adjudication in accordance with the indian council of arbitration rules and the provisions of the indian arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 or any statutory modifications thereof for the time being in force. any such arbitration shall take place in the city of bangalore and the language of such arbitration proceedings shall be english. 32. the supreme court in state of goa vs. praveen enterprises while dealing with the question of reference to arbitration in para 11 has held as under: 11. reference to arbitration can be in respect of all disputes between the parties or all disputes regarding a contractor in respect of specific enumerated disputes. where 'all disputes' are referred, the arbitrator has the jurisdiction to decide all disputes raised in the pleadings (both claims and counter claims) subject to any limitations placed by the arbitration agreement. where the arbitration agreement provides that all disputes shall be settled by arbitration but excludes certain matters from arbitration, then, the arbitrator will exclude the expected matter and decided only those disputes which are arbitrable. but where the reference to the arbitrator is to decide specific disputes enumerated by the parties / court/ appointing authority, the arbitrator's jurisdiction is circumscribed by the specific reference and the arbitrator can decide only those specific disputes. 33. before proceeding further, it is apposite to take note of the reliefs claimed in the statement of claim as well as amended statement of claim, which are reproduced in the form of a chart for the facility of reference: relief in soc (pg.218-219) relief in asoc (pg. 312) (i) issue an order declaring the email (i) set aside the email communication communication dated 5 march 2018 dated 5th march, 2018 purporting to (document no.6) purporting to terminate the cisp agreeen, the first terminate the cisp agreement, the addendum and the second addendum first addendum and the second dated 21 march 2012, 3 june 2014 and addendum (documents no.1, 2 and 3) 9 september 2015 respectively by the dated 19 march 2012, 29 may 2014 respondent, by email communication and 9 september 2015 respectively, dated as 5 march, 2018 being without entered into between claimant and any cause, wrongful, bad in law and respondent is illegal and void and against the terms of the cisp against the terms of the covenants agreement. mutually agreed by the parties. (ii) issue an order declaring that the cisp agreement, the first addendum and the second addendum (document no.1, 2 and 3 ) dated 19 march 2012, 29 may 2014 and 9 september 2015 respectively, entered into between claimant and respondent continues to remain fully operational between the parties. (iii) issue an order directing the (ii) direct the respondent to pay in full respondent to paid n full a sum of inr a sum of rs.4,39,46,164/(rupees 11,89,05,886, towards outstanding four crores thirty nine lakhs forty six invoices till date coupled with interest thousand one hundred and sixty four at a rate that the tribunal deems fit; only) towards outstanding invoices due and payable as on the date of termination of the cisp agreement with interest at 18% per annum until the date of actual payment by the respondent; (iv) issue an order directing the (iii) direct the respondent to pay the respondent to pay to the claimant claimant rs.41,56,83,128/(rupees damages, which shall be proved during forty one crores fifty six lakhs eighty the stage of evidence for their attempts three thousand one hundred and at illegal termination of the cisp twenty eight only) towards the actual agreement (and its addendums) business loss of the claimant for the without cause; remainder term of the cisp agreement i.e., 5th march 2018 to 30th august 2020. (iv) direct the respondent to pay the claimant damages in a sum of rs.5,00,00,000/(rupees five crores only) as compensation for the wilful loss and damage caused as a result of the breach the cisp agreement; (v) issue an order directing the (v) issue an order directing the respondent to pay costs to the claimant respondent to pay costs to the claimant of this arbitral proceedings, as of this arbitral proceedings. quantified. (vi) grant any other relief / direction as (vi) grant any other relief / direction as deemed appropriate by this hon'ble deemed appropriate by this hon'ble tribunal to meet the ends of justice. tribunal to meet the ends of justice. 34. thus, respondent in the statement of claim, sought reliefs in respect of termination of contract, amount due on account of outstanding invoices as well as damages on account of illegal termination of contract. however, the amended statement of claim the amounts claimed have been quantified. the claims made in amended statement of claim arose out of and matter incidental to adjudication of termination of contract. the arbitration agreement does not exclude any matter from being referred to arbitration. the disputes referred to the arbitral tribunal were arbitrable and fall within the purview of clause 16 of the agreement. the expression 'dispute' or 'difference' used in clause 16 of the agreement is wide enough to include disputes pertaining to termination of contract and relief of damages, which could be granted to a party. the contention that only one dispute could be referred and multiple disputes have been referred is misconceived as reliefs for termination of contract and damages are intrinsically connected and were referred at first instance to the tribunal and are covered under clause 16. it is pertinent to note that it is not the case of the appellant that original dispute referred is beyond the scope of reference. in amended claim, only amount of damages was quantified. therefore, the disputes referred are within the scope and ambit of clause 16 of the agreement. the findings recorded by commercial court and the tribunal are affirmed. (ix) amendment of claim 35. section 23(3) of the act provides that either party to arbitration proceeding may supplement or amend his claim or defence unless arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow, having regard to delay in making it. rule 41 of rules of domestic commercial arbitration framed by indian council of arbitration deals with power of arbitral tribunal to grant amendment to statement of claim or defence. in the instant case, the respondent filed a statement of claim of 24.08.2018, wherein a relief of declaration / termination of notice was sought. the respondent also sought the relief of specific performance of the agreement and payment of outstanding amount to it. the respondent filed a statement of defence on 29.10.2018. 36. the respondent filed an application under section 23(3) of the act on 24.02.2019 seeking permission to amend its statement of claim. however, on 06.05.2019, the respondent withdrew the application for amendment with a liberty to file a fresh application. the respondent thereafter, filed an application for amendment which was allowed by an order dated 28.05.2019. from perusal of the original statement of claim as well as the amendment made thereto, it is evident that by amendment, the respondent has merely quantified the amount of damages. the general principle to deal with the prayer for amendment of a pleading is that it should be normally allowed unless it has caused any prejudice to the other side. both the parties knew the case of each other and even though the amendment could be said to be belated, yet it has not caused any prejudice to the appellant. the amendment of claim as sought by respondent was necessary for a fair and complete adjudication of the controversy involved in the case. therefore, in the facts of the case, the arbitral tribunal has rightly allowed the application for amendment. (x) repudiation of contract: 37. now we deal with the issue of repudiation of contract. admittedly, the cisp agreement has been terminated on the ground of violation of clause 20 of the agreement. clause 10.4 of cisp agreement deals with the power of the appellant to terminate the agreement, whereas, clause 20 which was incorporated by way of second addendum dated 09.09.2005 is an anti corruption clause. the aforesaid clauses which are relevant for the purposes of controversy involved in this appeal are reproduced below for the facility of reference: 10.4 notwithstanding anything contained in this clause, if skol finds any deficiency in the service standards of ibspl or ibspl breaches any of the terms of this agreement, then this agreement can be terminated immediately without any prior notice whatsoever. 20. a. ibspl is and will remain in compliance with all applicable anti corruption laws, including the laws of the country in which goods are produced and / or delivered and / or services are to be performed pursuant to the agreement ibspl will not, and nor will any of is associated parties, directly or indirectly, make or offer any payment, gift or other advantage with respect to any matters which are the subject of the agreement which (i) would violate any anti corruption laws or regulations applicable to ibspl or sabmiller india, (ii) is intended to, or does, influence or reward any person for acting in breach of an expectation of good faith, impartiality or trust, or which it would otherwise be improper for the recipient to accept (iii) is made to or for a pubic official with the intention of influencing them and obtaining or retaining an advantage in the conduct of business, or (iv) which a reasonable person would otherwise consider to be unethical, illegal or improper (\"corrupt act\"). ibspl undertakes not to seek, directly or indirectly, improperly or corruptly to influence or attempt to influence a public official, or an associated party of a sub contractor, to act to the advantage of ibspl or sabmiller india in connection with the supply of goods or services under the agreement, or otherwise to perform their duties improperly, and not to use any of the proceeds of any payments made under the agreement, directly or indirectly, for this purpose or otherwise for the purpose of or in connection with any corrupt act. for the purpose of this clause. \"pubic official\" includes, without limitation, any person holding or acting on behalf of a person holding legislative, administrative or judicial officer, including any person employed by or acting on behalf of a public agency, a state owned or public enterprise, a public international organization, any federal or regional government department or agency, any political party, or any candidate for political office, or a relative or associate of any such person. to the best of ibspl's knowledge and belief, and save as disclosed to sabmiller india, neither ibspl nor any of its associated parties: (a) has at any time been found by a court in any jurisdiction to have engaged in any corrupt act (or similar conduct) (b) has at any time admitted to having engaged in any corrupt act (or) similar conduct; (c) has at any time been investigated or been suspected in any jurisdiction or having engaged in any corrupt act (or similar conduct); or (d) are public officials or persons who might otherwise reasonably be considered likely to assert a corrupt or illegal influence on behalf of ibspl or sabmiller india. b. ibspl agrees that if, at any time, it becomes aware that any of the representations set out in this clause are no longer correct, it will notify the sabmiller india of this immediately in writing ibspl or its associated parties on behalf of sabmiller india, any other records and information in connection with the services to sabmiller india under the agreement or out of funds provided by the sabmiller india ('transaction records') (ii) provide the transaction records and / or any other such information as sabmiller india may reasonably require by notice in writing in order to monitor ibspl's compliance with its obligations under the agreement. for the purpose of this clause, \"books and records\" shall be deemed to include without limitation, corporate records, bank statements, books of account, supporting documentation and other records and documentation, whether in paper or other form. ibspl will promptly provide any information reasonably requested by sabmiller india in relation to ibspl's anti corruption programme and other controls related to corruption and cooperate fully in any investigation by sabmiller india of any suspected breach of above. if ibspl believes that provision of the services under the agreement has been or may be delayed because of demands for illegal payments from public officials or other third parties, ibspl must notify the sabmller india immediately of any such demands. ibspl will take all reasonable steps to complete provision of the services as quickly as possible without making illegal payments, but ibspl will not be in breach of delivery timing requirements under the agreement to the extent (and for the length) of any reasonable delay caused by ibspl's failure to make illegal payments, provide that the reason for, and extent of, such delay have been communicated to sabmiller india. 38. the agreement was terminated by e-mail communication dated 06.03.2018, the relevant extract of which reads as under: please be informed that we would like to discontinue taking services \"read with addendum dated september 9, 2015\". we are reconciling our books and will revert back with the statement of accounts with dues / outstanding on either side to close the accounts formally. meanwhile you can send us a list of final dues / outstanding on your side with proper supporting documentation. this is without prejudice to company's right to proceed legally to claim or reject any amounts under this contract or any other arrangement with your company / affiliates at any time. 39. in the majority award dated 02.11.2020, in para 4.2.11 and para 4.2.12, it was inter alia held that in order to justify the termination of cisp agreement, the appellant has to establish twin conditions. firstly, that the breach complained of must be in existence at the time of termination and the authority terminating the contract should have knowledge of breach while terminating the contract. it was further held that in the first, first information report the name of the promoter of the respondent was not specifically mentioned and the second, first information report came into existence after termination of contract. the majority award therefore concluded that the contract has been terminated in violation of clause 20 of the cisp agreement. 40. it is pertinent to note that the ist first information report was filed on 16.02.2017 in which the promoter of the respondent was not specifically named. however, in the blackberry chat messages annexed with the first information report contained ancillary allusions to his involvement. the contract was terminated on 05.03.2018, however, the ground of violation of clause 20 is not stated in the notice. thereafter, on the basis of complaint made by mr.sana viz., the promoter of the respondent, the 2nd, first information report was lodged. it is settled in law that a party is entitled to justify the repudiation of contract on any ground which existed at the time of repudiation [see: 'nune sivayya v. maddu ranganaya kulu', air 1935 pc 67 and juggilal kampkpat v. pratapmal rameshwar', (1978) 1 scc 69]. thus, even if the stand of appellant, that assertions made by director of the respondent in his complaint attract anti corruption is accepted clause viz., clause 20 of the agreement, the same could not have been made the basis for terminating the contract as the averments made in the complaint dated 15.10.2018 were not in existence at the time of termination of the contract, i.e., 05.03.2018. from the material on record, it is evident that the appellant has failed to establish the factum of existence of conditions constituting breach as well as knowledge about the contents of the first information report dated 16.02.2017. therefore, the arbitral tribunal on the basis of the material available on record has rightly concluded that the termination of the contract by the appellant is invalid. the aforesaid finding cannot be said to be perverse so as to be suffering from patent illegality and therefore, no interference is called for with the aforesaid finding, in this appeal. (xi) damages: 41. the respondent made a claim for damages of rs.4,39,46,164/along with interest at the rate of 18% towards outstanding invoices payable by the appellant on the date of agreement. the tribunal by majority has awarded the said claim to the extent of rs.3,98,81,995/along with interest at the rate of 10% from the date when amount become due till it is actually paid. we now examine, whether the award made by arbitral tribunal and the commercial court suffer from patent illegality, in so far it pertains to aforesaid claim. the principles of law on compensation for breach of contract is succinctly stated by supreme court in 'kailash nath associates v. delhi development authority', (2015) 4 scc 136, which are extracted below for facility of reference 43. on a conspectus of the above authorities, the law on compensation for breach of contract under section 74 can be stated to be as follows: 43.1 where a sum is named in a contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of damages, the party complaining of a breach can receive as reasonable compensation such liquidated amount only if it is a genuine preestimate of damages fixed by both parties and found to be such by the court. in other cases, where a sum is named in a contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of damages, only reasonable compensation can be awarded not exceeding the amount so stated. similarly, in cases where the amount fixed is in the nature of penalty, only reasonable can be awarded not exceeding the penalty so stated. in both cases, the liquidated amount or penalty is the upper limit beyond which the court cannot grant reasonable compensation. 43.2. reasonable compensation will be fixed on well known principles that are applicable to the law of contract, which are to be found inter alia in section 73 of the contract act. 43.3. since section 74 awards reasonable compensation for damage or loss caused by a breach of contract, damage or loss caused is a sine qua non for the applicability of the section. 43.4. the section applies whether a person is a plaintiff or defendant in a suit. 43.5. the sum spoken of may already be paid or be payable in future. 43.6.the expression \"whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby\" means that where it is possible to prove actual damage or loss, such proof is not dispensed with. it is only in cases where damage or loss is difficult or impossible to prove that the liquidated amount named in the contract, if a genuine pre-estimate of damage or loss can be awarded. 43.7.section 74 will apply to cases of forfeiture of earnest money under a contract. where, however, forfeiture takes place under the terms and conditions of a public auction before agreement is reached, section 74 would have no application. the aforesaid principles were referred to with approval in 'sudha gupta vs. delhi land finance limited, (2019) 14 scc 266. 42. thus in a case, it is possible to prove actual damages or loss such proof if not dispensed with and therefore, the evidence is required to be adduced by a claimant. it is settled in law that where loss in terms of money can be ascertained, the party claiming compensation has to prove the loss sustained by him. [see: 'maula bux vs. union of india 1969 (2) scc 554]. it is pertinent to note that the respondent has not adduced any oral evidence in support of its claim, however, in respect of claim for payment towards outstanding invoices, following documentary evidence has been produced, which reads as under: (i) doc no.4a attested copy of the ledger of the respondent as maintained by the claimant. (ii) doc 12a and 12b statement of outstanding invoices along with the copies of the invoices raised in connection with the entries made in doc 4a and 12a. (iii) doc no.20 collation of all email communication between the parties between nov 2017 until march 2018 in connection with the services under the subject agreement. 43. the aforesaid documents were denied by legal director of the appellant in the affidavit of admission and denial documents dated 06.12.2019 filed before the arbitral tribunal. the relevant extract of the tabular statement in para 3 of the affidavit, reads as under: i state that a tabular statement admitting / denying the documents filed by the claimant along with amended statement of claim is below: document particulars remark xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx document no.4 copy of the extract of the denied ledger of the claimant xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx document no.12 a copy of all pending invoices denied. and the mails sent to the respondent of the same. xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx document no.20 copy of all communications denied as between the parties in the these are months of the november emails which 2016 till march 2018 are not supported with a certificate under section 65b of the indian evidence act, 1872 44. however, despite the fact that the appellant had denied the aforesaid documents in the said affidavit dated 06.12.2019, the majority award in para 4.3.2. held as under: it is noteworthy that the respondent has not challenged or denied the veracity of these documents despite opportunity given in this regard. 45. the aforesaid finding is based on surmises and conjectures and is factually incorrect. even though subsequently the respondent filed certified copy of the aforesaid documents 4a, 12a, 12b, however, the fact remains that the appellant had denied the contents of the document in the affidavit dated 06.12.2019, therefore, it was necessary for the respondent to adduce evidence. the tribunal however, the majority award of the tribunal held that outstanding invoices were raised towards services rendered by respondent in the state of kerala on the basis of good faith and instructions of the appellant and therefore, the respondent is entitled to reimbursement of the expenses. it was further held that respondent was not entitled to claim amount towards trade investment scheme as no evidence was adduced. the majority award held the respondent entitled to a sum of rs.3,98,81,995/against outstanding invoices in addition to an interest of 10% from the date on which the amount fell due till actual payment is made. 46. the aforesaid findings of the majority award of the tribunal and the finding of the commercial court in affirming the same on the ground that respondent did not file any objection to the documents viz., document nos.4, 12, 15 and 16 are factually incorrect, perverse, erroneous and are based on no evidence, and therefore, covered under the expression 'patent illegality' under section 34(2-a) of the act. (xii) nominal damages: 47. the respondent had claimed a sum of rs.41,56,83,128/as loss of revenue arising from the premature termination of the cisp agreement from march 2018 till august 2020. the majority award has held that in the absence of critical evidence, it is constrained to award nominal damages and has awarded nominal damages to the extent of rs.16,04,41,281/crores along with interest at the rate of 10% from the date of the award till actual payment. now we advert to the issue, whether award made by arbitral tribunal and the commercial court, insofar as it grants the claim of nominal damages to the extent mentioned above, suffer from patent illegality. in pollock and mulla, the indian contract, 1872 14th edition at page no.1171, the principles with regard to nominal damages have been summarized which read as under: when the defendant is found liable for breach of contract, the plaintiff would be entitled to nominal damages even if no actual damage is proved. nominal damages are awarded when there is an infraction of a legal right, and though it gives no right to any real damages yet gives the right to a verdict because of the infringement the plaintiff is awarded nominal damages when: (i) the defendant's breach of contract has in fact caused no loss to the plaintiff. (ii) the defendant has committed a technical breach of contract and the plaintiff himself and no intention of performing his terms. (iii) the plaintiff fails to prove the loss, that he may have suffered from the breach of contract; (iv) he has suffered actual damage, which has arisen, not from the defendant's wrongful act, but from the conduct of the plaintiff himself, or an external event; (v) the plaintiff merely seeks to establish the infringement of his legal right, without being concerned about actual loss. where there is no basis for ascertainment of the amount. a small amount of gbp 5 may be awarded. the view that nominal damages do not connote a trifling amount is erroneous; nominal damages mean a small sum of money. nominal damages have been defined as a sum of money that may be spoken of, but that has no existence in point of quantity, or 'a mere peg on which to hang costs'. when the loss is small and quantifiable, the damages awarded, though small, are not nominal damages. 48. chitty on contracts in 28th edition while dealing with nominal damages in para 27-0007 has opined as under: nominal damages. wherever the defendant is liable for a breach of contract, the claimant is in general entitled to nominal damages although no actual damage is proved, the violation of a right at common law will usually entitle the claimant to nominal damages without proof of special damage. normally, this situation arises when the defendant's breach of contract has in fact caused no loss to the claimant, but it may also arise when the claimant, although he has suffered loss, fails to prove any loss flowing from the breach of contract, or fails to prove the actual amount of his loss. a regular use of nominal damages, however, is to establish the infringement of the claimant's right, and sometimes the award of nominal damages is \"a mere peg on which to hang costs.\" 49. thus, nominal damages are granted where a legal right of plaintiff is found to be infringed and there is no proof of actual loss. in such a case, a notional amount may be awarded as damages to plaintiff. the arbitral tribunal by majority while dealing with the aforesaid claim of the respondent in para 4.2.21 has held as under: in the absence of critical evidence forthcoming from both the parties, we are constrained to award nominal damages in favour of the claimant for loss of business between march 2018 and august 2020. 50. however, the majority award has proceeded to award a sum of rs.16,04,41,281/along with future interest at the rate of 10% from the date of award till actual payment. the relevant extract of the majority award reads as under: 4.4.23. in the light of the discussion above, we deem it appropriate to award a sum of rs.16,04,41,281/(rupees sixteen crores four lakhs forty one thousand two hundred and eighty one only) as damages for business losses in favour of the claimant herein with a future interest of 10% from the date of this award until date of actual payment. 4.4.24. the above quantum is computed on the touchstone of the law valid down in this regard by the apex court and in consideration of the primary sales in 2017 with an average annual sales growth rate of 10% (in consideration of the average sales growth rate of the beer market in india) while factoring the fixed and variable components of the revenue expenditure, probable gains made by the claimant as a result of not performing its side of contractual obligations and the form of the covid-19 pandemic between the months of april june 2020 etc. 51. the supreme court in 'kanchan udyog limited vs. united spirits limited', (2017) 8 scc 237 has held that a unilaterally projected profitability which is a mere assumption, cannot be the basis of assessment of damages. in the instant case, respondent has not provided any evidence to support is claim that sales would grow at a projection or 15% per annum between march 2018 and august 2020. there is no material on record to show average annual sales growth of 10% as assumed by tribunal, as well as commercial court. the aforesaid findings are based on no evidence. 52. the figure of rs.16,04,41,281/awarded under the head of nominal damages by taking into account of 10% annual sales growth for which no evidence is on record seems to actual damages and not notional damages. the award of 38.5% of the claim, as nominal damages is based on no evidence. therefore, the award to the aforesaid extent suffers from patent illegality under section 34(2-a) of the act. (xiii) award of costs of the proceeding before the arbitral tribunal 53. the majority award has awarded a sum of rs.2,03,71,475/-. the respondent in the written statement made a claim of rs.1,33,67,000/incurred towards professional fee and legal expenses. however, no evidence was adduced with regard to the same. in the written submissions, the respondent had stated that invoices and bills pertaining to the claim for costs from part of confidential record and that it would submit the same if directed by the tribunal. however, the tribunal did not issue any direction to the respondent. the respondent claimed actual costs without any evidence and the tribunal proceeded to award the claim of rs.2,03,71,475/without any evidence. the finding in this regard is based on no evidence and suffers from patent illegality under section 34(2-a) of the act. (xiv) conclusions: (i) the repudiation of the contract is not in accordance with terms of the contract and the finding of arbitral tribunal and commercial court is affirmed. (ii) the disputes raised by the respondent were within the ambit and scope of clause 16 of cisp agreement. (iii) the arbitral tribunal has rightly allowed the application for amendment of the claim in the facts of the case. (iv) the award insofar as it grants claim for damages on account of outstanding invoices awarded to the extent of rs.3,98,81,995/suffers from patent illegality, under section34(2-a) of the act. (v) the award insofar as it grants claim for damages on account of actual business loss between 5th march 2018 to 30th august 2020 awarded to the tune of rs.16,04,41,281/as nominal damages suffers from patent illegality under section 34(2-a) of the act. (vi) the award insofar as it deals with award of costs of the arbitration proceeding to the tune of rs.2,03,71,475/suffers from patent illegality under section34(2-a) of the act. in the result, impugned judgment dated 24.06.2021 passed by the commercial court as well as the award dated 02.11.2020, to the extent of grant of damages on account of outstanding invoices to the extent of rs.3,98,81,995/-, claim for a loss of actual business between 5th march 2018 to 30th august 2020 to the tune of rs.16,04,41,281/and to the extent of cost of arbitration proceeding to the extent of rs.2,03,71,475/-, are set aside. in the result, the appeal is allowed to the extent mentioned above along with costs. sd/judge sd/judge ss"
