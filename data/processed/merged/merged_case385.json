JUSTICE N.V.ANJARIA            and            HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE A.S. SUPEHIA                       Date : 18/03/2021                          CAV JUDGMENT (PER : HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE N.V.ANJARIA) The petitioner-judgment debtor has filed the present petition to seek the following prayers. \n            (i)             to set aside order dated 07th             January,        2011 passed below  application Exh.54 by court of learned Principal Senior Civil Judge, Jamnagar, in Commercial Execution Petition No.161 of 2019;\n(ii) to direct the court below to decide petitioner's application Exh.65 dated 12th October, 2020 challenging the jurisdiction of the court before proceeding further;\n(iii) in the alternative, it is prayed to direct petitioner's application Exh.65 along with the pending applications.\n2. The grievance of the petitioner-judgment debtor is in respect of the order passed by the executing court under Order XXI, Rule 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, whereby the petitioner is required to show cause as to why petitioner should not be committed to civil prison. \n3. The respondent-Ultrabulk A/S, a company incorporated under the laws of Denmark, happens to be the decree holder, in whose favour stands judgment and decree dated 09th November, 2017 passed by the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, Commercial Court of England & Wales, U.K. in the matter of Ultrabulk A/S v. Arun Kumar Jagatramka, for a sum of USD 5,062,462 equivalent to more than Rs.32.00 crores, in addition to the interest. \n3.1 It was to execute the said foreign decree that the execution proceedings and application Exh.54 therein was filed under Order XXI Rule 37, CPC. The Ministry of Law, Government of India, by issuing Notification dated 01st March, 1953 designated the United Kingdom, it was stated, to be the reciprocating territory under Section 44A of CPC, whereas High Court in England to be the superior court of that territory. Issuance of notice pursuant to application Exh.54 motivated the petitioner to approach this Court by way of the present petition. \n3.2 The case of the respondent-decree holder in its application Exh.54 was inter alia that the petitioner, rated as one of the richest individuals in India, had given a personal guarantee-cum-on demand bond on 02nd July, 2013 on behalf of Gujarat NRE Coke Limited in favour of the respondent . Thereby it was committed by the petitioner that his liability to make payment to the respondent herein of USD 4,259,395 would arise upon failure of the said NRE Coke Limited to make payment of the said amount on or before 31st December, 2013. The said company remitted only USD 2.3 million out of the total. Thereupon in view of the personal guarantee as above, the liability of the petitioner to make payment of USD 4.25 million was crystalised. It was further mentioned that around 01st January, 2014, the petitioner acted with dishonest intention to avoid the liability of payment and sold off the assets in favour of the third parties. \n3.3 The respondent therefore instituted the suit before the English High Court on 22nd June, 2015 against the petitioner to recover the amount on the basis of said personal guarantee-cum-on demand bond. It was stated that at no point of time the petitioner herein raised any objection as to the jurisdiction before the English High Court. The petitioner also instituted Civil Suit No.77 of 2017 on 07th March, 2017 before the Kolkata High Court seeking permanent injunction against the respondent from prosecuting his case before the English Court. This suit was withdrawn as the English High Court passed the decree rendering the petitioner indebted to the respondent company. \n3.4 The execution petition which was under Section 44A, CPC was initially filed on 28th April, 2018 before the Commercial Court at Rajkot, before which court the petitioner filed an application objecting to the jurisdiction on the ground that the dispute was not a commercial dispute. Thereafter the execution petition came to be transferred to Commercial Court at Jamnagar. The application of the petitioner questioning the jurisdiction was rejected by order dated 10th April, 2019. \n3.5 The aforesaid order dated 10th April, 2019 was sought to be challenged by the petitioner by filing Special Civil Application No.8334 of 2019 before this Court which was dismissed by Division Bench of this Court on 26th August, 2019. The petitioner has quoted certain observations made by this Court while dismissing the said petition as under. \n\"13..... On the contrary, the record indicates that having filed objections under section 13 of the CPC before the Commercial Court at Rajkot, only with an aim and object to delay the execution proceedings, the petitioner filed the present application exhibit 19 and on its dismissal, the present writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \n14..... It would not be out of place to record that having participated in the proceedings before the English Commercial Court, having given a guarantee and the Judgment of English Court having become final, only with a view to throw spanner in the execution of such decree, the present petition is filed only with a view to create hurdle and delay the execution proceedings, which is nothing but an abuse of the process of the Court. We confirm the findings of the Court below and the Commercial Court having jurisdiction, has jurisdiction to entertain the execution petition filed by the respondent. The petition is devoid of any merits and the same is liable to be dismissed and is hereby rejected in limine with cost of Rs. 25,000/ to be deposited by the petitioner within a period of one week with Gujarat High Court Legal Services Committee.\"\n3.6 Against the aforementioned order of this Court, Special Leave Petition was filed by the judgment debtor which was disposed of as per following order dated 29th September, 2020. \n\"The Commercial Execution Petition was filed in the Commercial Court, Rajkot for execution of decree passed on 09.11.2017 by the High Court of Justice, (Queen's Bench Division) Commercial Court of England and Wales. The petitioner raised a ground of maintainability of the execution petition which was rejected by the Commercial Court and upheld by the High Court aggrieved by which the above Special Leave Petition has been filed. \nMr. Sandeep Bajaj, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the commercial court does not have the jurisdiction to entertain an Execution Petition under the Commercial Courts Act. Liberty is given to the petitioner to raise this contention before the Execution Court. \nWith the above observation, the Special Leave petition is disposed of.\"\n3.7 In application Exh.54, the respondent-decree holder set out certain supportive facts and aspects, summarised hereunder. \n(i) as per the report of \"Financial Express\" dated 21st June, 2019, Serious Fraud Investigation Office has been investigating into the financial affairs of the Kolkata based Gujarat NRE Coke, \n(ii) by order passed in Special Civil Application No.18238 of 2019, this Court allowed the petitioner to travel abroad as the lookout circular was not served upon the petitioner. The said order dated 24th October, 2019 was quashed by Division Bench,\n(iii) the executing court required the judgment debtor to file affidavit under Order XXI Rule 41(2),\n(iv) the Kolkata High Court refused permission to the judgment debtor to travel to Brazil by order dated 08th November, 2019,\n(v) in Wollongong Coal Limited v. Gujarat NRE Properties Private Limited, the Supreme Court of New South Walse pronounced that the judgment debtor and his wife in capacity of Directors of the said Coke company, committed breach of fiduciary duties,\n(vi) the judgment debtor had still been travelling in different luxury cars of the value in lakhs,\n(vii) the personal website of judgment debtor showed his profile, that he was the Chairman of Gujarat NRE Group, one of the largest independent producers of metallurgical coke and wealth creator of India, that he is an active member of Confederation of Indian Industries, the Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry, that he was a prominent person in the field and the international fora etc. 3.8 The decree holder gave details of remuneration received by judgment debtor from Gujarat NRE for acting as Chairman & Managing Director, annexing financial statements of Gujarat NRE from Year 2004 to 2017. It was contended that if the judgment debtor's Affidavit of Assets was to be believed, he was liable to be declared insolvent and shown not to be having the means to honour the foreign decree of USD 5,062,462 in addition to interest. The conduct of the judgment debtor was highlighted to further plead that the judgment debtor was siphoning off monies, properties and assets with his wife, daughters and son with an intention to defeat the claims of the creditors. Also the mention was made that F.I.R. No.306 of 2018 dated 03rd December, 2018 in respect of offences alleged under Sections 408, 467, 468, 471, IPC, 1860 has been registered against the judgment debtor that the judgment debtor caused wrongful losses to an Australian coal company. \n3.9 It is to be mentioned that respondent- judgment debtor filed an application Exh.11 under Section 13, CPC before the executing court and questioned the conclusiveness of decree of English Court contending that the amount was not liable to be recovered. Another application Exh.45 was filed seeking consequential dismissal of the execution proceedings. Both these applications came to be dismissed on 29th September, 2020 by the executing court. Subsequent to the aforementioned order of the Apex Court dated 29th September, 2020, it appears that the petitioner filed application Exh.65 challenging the jurisdiction of the executing court. As per the averment made in paragraph-49 of affidavit-in-reply dated 30th January, 2021 of the respondent, the said application Exh.65 has been reserved for judgment by the court.\n4. Heard learned advocate Mr.Sandeep Bajaj with learned advocate Mr.Vivek Gupta for the petitioner and learned senior advocate Mr.Mihir Joshi assisted by learned advocates Mr.Aditya Krishnamurthy and Mr.Harsh Parekh for the respondent, at length. \n4.1 One of the main contentions on behalf of the petitioner raised by his learned advocate was that the court below has recorded certain premature and prejudicial findings of fact and thereby virtually decided the show-cause notice. It was submitted that in paragraph-29 of the impugned order \"it is brought on record that the judgment debtor has financial capacity to satisfy the deemed decree passed by this court but has deliberately chosen and failed to do so.\". It was next submitted that similarly in paragraph-31 the court below recorded that, \"conduct of the judgment debtor indicates his unwillingness to pay inspite of his means to pay. The judgment debtor having means to pay the decreetal amount has neglected his obligation under the decree.\". Learned advocate submitted that the notice under Order XXI, Rule 37 shall have to follow the procedure under Rule 40, CPC, yet the court below has by making such observations, prejudged the issue. \n4.2 Learned advocate for the petitioner next submitted that the decree holder was required to demonstrate as per Section 51, CPC, that the petitioner had after institution of the suit before the English Court, dishonestly transferred the property and that though the petitioner has since date of the decree the means to pay the decreetal amount, yet he has neglected to pay the same. The submissions were raised that irrelevant aspects were considered and further that the petitioner was not given reasonable opportunity to defend his case before issuing notice under Order XXI, Rule 37, CPC. It was also the submission on behalf of learned advocate for the petitioner that application Exh.65 challenging jurisdiction of the court below was pending which was filed pursuant to liberty granted by the Apex Court as per order dated 29th September, 2020 in SLP (C) No.11689 of 2020, yet the court below proceeded to consider the application under Order XXI Rule 37, CPC. It was submitted that the court below ought to have decided the application Exh.65 before deciding the application Exh.54, and that in not deciding the application challenging the jurisdiction of the court beforehand, the court has made it infructuous. \n4.3 Learned senior counsel for the respondent put forth his contentions on the basis of the contents of affidavit-in-reply filed by the respondent in response to the petition. The facts and circumstances stated in application Exh.54 were highlighted to submit that under Section 44A(1), CPC, decree could be executed in India and that by legal fiction the foreign decree was merged into a deemed decree of trial court, as applications Exh.11 and Exh.45 were dismissed. Respondent submitted that the civil suit before the Kolkata High Court was an attempt to stall the proceedings before the London Court. Referring to order dated 26th August, 2019 passed by tis Court in Special Civil Application No.8334 of 2019, it was emphasised that this Court observed that the judgment debtor had been acting \"to throw spanner in the execution\".\n4.4 It was submitted that but for the restrictive orders passed by the Court, judgment debtor had been attempting to leave the country, and that the banks and financial institutions have large claim against the petitioner. It was contended that order dated 29th February, 2020 was challenged in SLP (C) No.11689 of 2020 but the Supreme Court did not stay the execution proceedings nor stayed the order dated 29th February, 2020. It was submitted that mere raising of objection regarding jurisdiction cannot automatically result into stay of proceedings. Learned senior advocate submitted that the court below had issued only notice and the further inquiry is yet to succeed, wherein judgment debtor could adduce evidence in rebuttal. \n5. At this stage, a brief reference to the applicable relevant provisions may be made. Section 51, CPC provides for powers of the court to enforce the execution. Amongst the modes prescribed, it is provided as one of the recourses that upon application of the decree holder, the court may order execution of decree by arrest and detention of judgment debtor in prison. The Proviso attached thereto says that where the decree is for payment of money, the execution by detention in prison is not to be ordered unless reasonable opportunity of showing cause to the judgment debtor is extended and the court is satisfied that the conditions stated in the provision were fulfilled or met with. \n5.1 Operating supplementary to what is contemplated in the Proviso referred to above, Order XXI Rule 37, CPC provides as under.\n37. Discretionary power to permit judgment-debtor to show cause against detention in prison--(1) Notwithstanding anything in these rules, where an application is for the execution of a decree for the payment of money by the arrest and detention in the civil prison of a judgment-debtor who is liable to be arrested in pursuance of the application, the Court shall, instead of issuing a warrant for his arrest, issue a notice calling upon him to appear before the Court on a day to be specified in the notice and show cause why he should not be committed to the civil prison:\nProvided that such notice shall not be necessary if the Court is satisfied, by affidavit, or otherwise that, with the object or effect of delaying the execution of the decree, the judgment-debtor is likely to abscond or leave the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court. \n(2) Where appearance is not made in obedience to the notice, the Court shall, if the decree- holder so requires, issue a warrant for the arrest of the judgment-debtor. \n5.1.1 Order XXI Rule 37(1) envisages that the executing court, instead of issuing warrant of arrest of judgment debtor, issue a notice calling upon him to appear before the court on the specified date to show cause as to why he should not be committed to civil prison. On the face of it, the provision is for issuing a show cause notice only. As per sub-rule (2), where appearance is not made in obedience to the notice, it will be permissible for the court to issue a warrant for arrest of judgment debtor. What becomes clear is that it is obligatory on part of the court to issue a notice instead of issuing a arrest warrant of the judgment debtor straightway. \n5.1.2 Once the presence of the judgment debtor is secured by the court by exercising jurisdiction under Rule 37(2) above, the further procedure to be followed by the court is contemplated for in Rule 40 of Order XXI. Order XXI Rule 40 is as under. \n40. Proceedings on appearance of judgment-debtor in obedience to notice or after arrest--(1) When a judgment-debtor appears before the Court in obedience to a notice issued under rule 37, or is brought before the Court after being arrested in execution of a decree for the payment of money, the Court shall proceed to hear the decree-holder and take all such evidence as may be produced by him in support of his application for execution and shall then give the judgment-debtor an opportunity of showing cause why he should not be committed to the civil prison.\n(2) Pending the conclusion of the inquiry under sub-rule (1) the Court may, in its discretion, order the judgment-debtor to be detained in the custody of an officer of the Court or release him on his furnishing security to the satisfaction of the Court for his appearance when required.\n(3) Upon the conclusion of the inquiry under sub- rule (1) the Court may, subject to the provisions of section 51 and to the other provisions of the Code, make an order for the detention of the judgment-debtor in the civil prison and shall in that event cause him to be arrested if he is not already under arrest:\nProvided that in order to give the judgment- debtor an opportunity of satisfying the decree, the Court may, before making the order of detention, leave the judgment-debtor in the custody of an officer of the Court for a specified period not exceeding fifteen days or release him on his furnishing security to the satisfaction of the Court for his appearance at the expiration of the specified period if the decree be not sooner satisfied. \n(4) A judgment-debtor released under this rule may be re-arrested. \n(5) When the Court does not make an order of detention under sub-rule (3), it shall disallow the application and, if the judgment-debtor is under arrest, direct his release.\n5.1.3 The provision of Order XXI, Rule 40 above necessitates in law that before the final order could be passed, the executing court has to follow the procedure prescribed in the said Rule. As per this Rule after judgment debtor appears in obedience to the notice under Rule 37, it is provided that the court shall proceed to hear the decree holder. The court may take such evidence which may have been produced by the decree holder in support of his request for execution. Thereafter the court is duty- bound to give the judgment debtor an opportunity. It is only after the conclusion of inquiry under sub- rule (1) of Rule 40 that the court can make order for detention of judgment debtor in civil prison. Rule 40 is to be viewed not only procedural but mandatory in nature. \n5.2 The High Court of Andhra Pradesh in S. Ismail v. Agraseni Chit Funds [AIR 2005 AP 33] observed that expression of inquiry employed in Rule 40 means the inquiry with regard to the defence taken by the judgment debtor, and also inquiring into the averments made by the decree holder. This inquiry has to be undergone by the court before it could finally order sending the judgment debtor to civil prison. \n5.3 The impugned order of the executing court issuing notice has to be viewed in light of and in the context of working of the above provisions. While exercising powers under Order XXI, Rule 37, CPC, the court considered various aspects including making of observations about the judgment debtor having financial capacity. Also was taken into consideration by the court that the decree was for payment of money, the conduct of the judgment debtor with attendant aspects, to observe that they were indicative of unwillingness to pay. The court took note of the investigation commenced by Serious Fraud Investigation Office in the financial affairs of Gujarat NRE, the issuance of lookout circular against the judgment debtor and his immediate family members and the order passed by the Kolkata High Court rejecting judgment debtor's application for travelling abroad. The order dated 10th April, 2019 dismissing judgment debtor's application raising objections to the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, was mentioned and the aspect of filing of F.I.R. against judgment debtor was also referred to. It is not possible to say that the aspects noted by the executing court were not relevant. \n5.3.1 Attended and supported by the aspects broadly stated above, the following observations and reasoning became crux of the impugned order. \n\"28. The Decree Holder apprehends that the Judgment Debtor is concealing his assets by having the same ostensibly registered in the name of his immediate family members with a malicious intention of insulting the same from the claims of the creditors of the Judgment Debtor who are likely to inherit the property of the Judgment Debtor and would be personally liable for the foreign decree upto the value of the property which they would be inheriting from the Judgment Debtor. The Decree Holder has sought for issuance of show cause notice under Order XXI Rule 37 to the Judgment Debtor calling upon him to appear before the court and show cause why he should not be committed to the civil prison as envisaged under S.55 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\" \n5.4 Recording reasons while issuing notice in exercise of discretionary powers under Order XXI, Rule 37, CPC can be said to be a permissible exercise, for, the act of issuance of notice cannot be entirely a mechanical process. A decree holder would not be entitled to contend that notice under the said provision may be readily issued even without applying the basic facts and admitting to consideration the relevant aspects. Application of mind by the executing court for exercise of powers under Order XXI Rule 37, CPC, while issuing notice can indeed not be said to be foreign to the exercise. It is trite principle that wherever discretionary power is conferred on the court, such discretion has to be exercised judicially, on the basis of proper reasons and upon relevant facts and germane considerations. \n5.5 The submission of the petitioner was that application Exh.65 questioning the jurisdiction of the court has not been decided; prayer is also made to direct to decide the said application Exh.65 with other applications. Disposing of the said contention, it goes without saying and is to be observed that the executing court shall not proceed further till it renders decision on application Exh.65 of the judgment debtor. As recorded hereinabove and given out by respondent-decree holder in its reply, the said application Exh.65 is kept reserved for the judgment. In the facts of the case, interest of justice would be sub-served if the executing court is directed to decide the said application Exh.65 time- bound so that a clear picture emerges about the further proceedings. \n5.6 The inquiry to be undergone under Order XXI, Rule 40 is mandatory in nature. As the Section prescribes, it confers on the decree holder right to hearing. It is the stage where the decree holder shall be heard for his case on merits and the court will take all such evidence as may be produced by him in support of his application for execution. Order XXI, Rule 37 and Rule 40 conjointly operates, in which notice under Rule 37 has no conclusive value unless the decree holder establishes his case in accordance with law, in which the judgment debtor has the right to be heard to put forward his case. As the notice under Order XXI, Rule 37 is not an end in itself, what is recorded in the order issuing notice under the said provision has also no finality attached to it. The issuance of notice under Order XXI, Rule 37, once succeeds the inquiry by the court under Rule 40, may or may not result into detaining the judgment debtor into civil prison. Therefore, all the contentions canvassed by the petitioner herein are not tenable in view of operation of the interacting provisions mentioned above. \n5.7 Secondly, orally canvassed and reiterated in written submissions was the grievance that the executing court recorded findings of fact under the guise of issuance of notice, for which the observations made in paragraph Nos.29 and 31 of the impugned order, which are mentioned in paragraph No.4.1 hereinabove, were referred to. As noted above, the stage of inquiry under Rule 40 is yet not exhausted, at which material juncture, the judgment debtor will have right to rebut and to controvert. Even otherwise, the findings recorded and observations made at various places in the impugned order, are in the nature of tentative and prima facie observations having not conclusive value. It could not be said that they amount to prejudging or that they would prejudice the judgment debtor who will have a full opportunity in the inquiry under Order XXI, Rule 40, as may be held by the executing court. \n5.8 In any view, in order to allay the apprehension of the petitioner, this Court is inclined to clarify that any of the observations in the impugned order shall not be final and shall be subject to the findings which may be recorded in the subsequent stages including in the inquiry under Rule 40 as may have to be undertaken. \n6. In view of the foregoing reasons and discussion, the present petition is not liable to be entertained, however following directions shall govern. \n(i) The executing court shall render its decision on the application Exh.65 of the judgment debtor within fifteen days from the date of receipt of this order. This Court has not expressed any opinion on the merits thereof. Neither the impugned order nor the present order shall influence the decision to be taken by the executing court on application Exh.65; \n(ii) Any of the observations including those specifically referred to by the petitioner from Paragraph Nos.29 and 31 of the impugned order shall not be treated as final, they shall not become prejudicial to the judgment debtor in the further inquiry under Order XXI, Rule 40, CPC, if required to be undertaken after order below application Exh.65;\n(iii) In such inquiry, the judgment debtor will have right to rebut and defend his case. \n7. The present petition is dismissed subject to the aforesaid observations and directions. Notice is discharged. \n(N.V.ANJARIA, J) (A. S. SUPEHIA, J) ANUP",

and the respondents, who are the plaintiff and the defendants respectively in the original lawsuit [cs(comm) 2185/2021], are embroiled in a commercial dispute before the commercial court judge at tis hazari, central district, delhi. the core of the dispute revolves around the petitioner's plea for legal protection, primarily in the form of an injunction, to prevent the respondents from engaging in alleged unauthorized use of the petitioner's trademark \"amaze\" on the ground of passing off. 2. as it stands, the aforementioned suit is currently in the process of adjudication, with the conclusive judgment and the determination of an interlocutory injunction still pending. however, the focus of this present petition is a comprehensive order issued on 02nd august, 2022 passed by commercial court judge [hereinafter \"impugned order\"], dismissing two applications filed by the petitioner, both seeking leave to introduce additional documents. aggrieved by the same, petitioner has appealed to this court's supervisory jurisdiction, asserting that their right to a fair trial has been compromised, by a manifestly erroneous order. background of the dispute leading to the commencement of the present legal proceedings 3. the circumstances leading up to the filing of the present petition are succinctly outlined as follows: 3.1. the petitioner asserts that in july 2018, the respondents approached the petitioner seeking permission to utilize the petitioner's mark, \"amaze\". upon refusal, the respondent no. 2 filed an opposition to petitioner's trademark application for the mark \" \" under number 2424250 under class 9 dated 06th november, 2012. the petitioner countered this opposition, disputing the proprietary rights claimed by respondent no. 2 over the \"amaze\" mark and its variants. 3.2. in april, 2021, petitioner gained knowledge of respondents selling batteries under the deceptively similar mark \"amaze\". petitioner contends that the respondents' mark, which is structurally and phonetically identical to the petitioner's, was purportedly adopted with an intent to capitalize on the goodwill and reputation of the petitioner. 3.3. during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic in june-july 2021, the petitioner, invoked its common law rights in the \"amaze\" trademark and filed a lawsuit to seek restraining orders against the respondents from the use of the mark \"amaze\". due to certain inadvertent circumstances, some of the key documents were excluded. thus, on 01st september 2021, the petitioner filed the first application seeking permission to present additional documents [hereinafter \"first application\"]. following this, on 04th january 2022, a second application was made seeking permission to introduce further documents to counter the claims made by the respondents in their written statement [hereinafter \"second application\"]. both these applications [collectively, \"the applications\"] met strong resistance from the respondents and were ultimately adjudicated by the commercial court judge through the impugned order, leading to their dismissal. petitioner's case 4. ms. rajeshwari h., advocate, presents petitioner's case as follows: 4.1. petitioner adopted trademark \"amaze\" in the year 2008 and has been continuously, openly and extensively using the said mark since then. petitioner discovered that respondents had started selling batteries under the mark \"amaze\" without any consent/ permission from petitioner, despite denial of a specific request to use the same. as a result, petitioner filed a commercial suit to restrain them from using the said mark. the suit was filed online in june/july 2021, since counsel were working from home on account of restrictions as per covid-19 norms/ guidelines and moreover, covid-19 was in the aftermath of its peak. the suit came up for hearing on 08th july, 2021 when the court directed the petitioner to file physical paperbook of the suit. the first effective hearing took place on 05th august, 2021, through virtual mode. 4.2. petitioner, along with suit, produced all documents which they believed were in their power and possession. since the officers of petitioner and its counsel were working from their residence in light of covid-19, certain documents were inadvertently not filed along with the plaint. on 01st september, 2021, petitioner filed the first application under order xi rule 1(4) (inadvertently mentioned as rule 14) of the code of civil procedure, 1908 [hereinafter \"cpc\"] for filing additional documents which comprised of six invoices1 and online status of respondents' five trademark applications.2 4.3 on 15th september, 2021, written statement was filed by respondents, to which a replication was filed by petitioner in november, 2021. on 04th january, 2022, petitioner filed the second application under order xi rules 1(4) and 1(5) of cpc for producing additional documents in support of their pleadings to rebut the stand of respondents emerging from their written statement. 4.4. additional affidavits were filed by petitioner and petitioner's counsel on 31st january, 2022, in view of the commercial court judge's order dated 18th january, 2022, to explain reasons for not filing the documents along with the plaint. it was reiterated that the counsels were impacted by covid-19 norms/ guidelines. some of the counsels had even contracted covid-19 invoice nos. 129, 012, 013, 017, 472, 471 of the period from 2008-2010. e-status of respondents' trademark applications no. 2469374, 2469373, 2469372, 3723225 and 3723223. infection or were attending medical exigencies at home. copies of the medical reports of the counsel representing petitioner and other members of the counsel's office were filed along with affidavit dated 31st january, 2022 of ms. nupur goswami, advocate, in the original suit. further, petitioner's staff members and ca were also unavailable/ working from home, on account of covid-19, which is made out from petitioner's affidavit dated 31st january, 2022. the impugned order failed to take into account the medical certificates and reports filed by the petitioner, and exigencies pleaded by the petitioner and their counsel. 4.5. by way of the impugned order, the commercial court judge misapplied the provisions of law and rejected the applications on an erroneous interpretation of the relevant provisions. the commercial court judge concludes that no reason has been made out to justify 'non-disclosure of documents with the plaint' though reasons given by petitioner may be justified for 'non-filing of documents with the plaint'. this distinction of 'non-disclosure' and 'non-filing' is contrary to the mandate of order xi rule 1(5) of cpc. further, the commercial court judge has misapplied the ratio in the judgment of the supreme court in sudhir kumar v. vinay kumar g.b.3 to hold that documents ought to be disclosed with the plaint, failing which they cannot be produced at all. there is no such proscription in law. 4.6. documents filed along with the second application were necessary to rebut the stand of respondents in their written statement and hence, they fall within the ambit of order xi rule 1(1)(c)(ii) of cpc. it follows that the rigours of order xi rule 1(4) or 1(5) of cpc would not be attracted. the 2021 scc online sc 734. finding in the impugned order, that the petitioner was required to disclose the said documents, is erroneous. 4.7. all the documents sought to be relied upon are supported by pleadings either in the plaint or in the replication. there is no requirement of law to plead each and every document in the plaint, thus the finding of nondisclosure of documents is incorrect. to support the relief, reliance is placed upon orders passed in 12 cases by co-ordinate benches of this court allowing additional documents to be taken on record, wherein issues had not been framed. 4.8. petitioner had furnished a reasonable explanation for not filing the documents earlier, however the same was disregarded without any basis. judgments relied upon by petitioner were ignored and distinguished on erroneous grounds. the court failed to consider the extraordinary circumstances, on account of covid-19, faced by petitioner at the time of filing of suit that resulted in non-filing of the documents along with the plaint. respondent's submissions 5. per contra, mr. sanjeev sindhwani, senior counsel representing the respondents, strongly opposed the petition by making the following submissions:5.1. there is no error of jurisdiction or any other error warranting supervisory correction by this court in exercise of article 227 of the constitution of india. this court is not to sit in appeal or revision over the decision of the commercial court judge in a legitimate exercise of jurisdiction under article 227. reliance is placed upon decisions of this court in bela creation pvt. ltd. v. anuj textiles4 and m-power energy india (p) ltd. and anr. v. sumana mazumdar5. 5.2. as per order xi rule 1(1) of cpc, petitioner was required to file all documents which were in its power, possession, control or custody along with the plaint or within an extended period of thirty days, subject to leave as contemplated under rule 1(4). this requirement is in consonance with the object of the commercial courts act, 2015 and is a clear departure from the existing law relating to filing and production of documents/ additional documents. leave of the court to file additional documents not disclosed with the plaint can be sought only after establishing reasonable cause for nondisclosure along with the plaint, which has not been made out by petitioner. 5.3. additional documents sought to be filed along with the applications were in petitioner's power, possession, control and custody at the time of filing of the suit. petitioner, at the time of filing of the suit, has to give a declaration on oath6 (which was given in the present case) that all documents in the power, possession, control and custody of petitioner pertaining to the facts and circumstances of the case are disclosed and annexed with the plaint and petitioner does not have any other document with him. this declaration cannot be rendered meaningless. the additional documents, not so declared or filed, cannot be relied upon/ produced subsequently except in exceptional circumstances and on the basis of justifiable and reasonable grounds. any other interpretation and understanding of the commercial courts act, 2015 would be negating the very objective thereof. 2022 scc online del 1366. 2022 scc online del 3312. order xi rule 1(3) of cpc, as amended by commercial courts act, 2015. 5.4. in sudhir kumar (supra), the supreme court laid down that documents in power, possession, custody and control have to be filed with plaint or within extended period of 30 days, subject to seeking permission of the court at the time of filing of suit. otherwise, strict rigours of rule 1(5) will apply. 5.5. in bela creations (supra), the court applied stringent provisions envisaged under order xi of cpc and declined the plea of additional documents, including on covid-19 grounds. the court also refused interference on the basis of limited scope of jurisdiction under article 227. the \"statutory proscription\" for filing additional documents in commercial matters was reiterated in the great gatsby club v. mahesh prefab,7 where the ground of documents not having been collated was not accepted, and the court also noted that the rigour of provisions of order xi rule 1 of cpc cannot be diluted on any sympathetic or other considerations. 5.6. petitioner's claim of urgency in filing of the suit is equally misconceived as the petitioner has been aware of respondent's advertisement and use of the trademark 'amaze' at least since mid-2018. respondents had first filed a notice of opposition dated 14th august, 2018 against petitioner's application no. 2424250 and petitioner also acknowledged respondents' user in its counter statement filed on 10th october, 2018. therefore, the submission of petitioner that there was an urgency in filing the suit, is even otherwise, absolutely false. 5.7. with respect to plea of covid-19, it is further submitted that the suit was listed on various dates prior to issuance of summons on 05th august, 2021. petitioner was present on all dates and vehemently pressed for ex parte 2022 scc online del 2099. injunction. in fact, petitioner had been travelling to delhi for signing the court pleadings and notarization of affidavits. the suit has been vigorously prosecuted and thus, the plea premised on the impact of covid-19 plea is not sustainable. in this regard, respondents rely on the judgment in ht media and ors. v. brain link international inc. & ors.8 passed by this court, and further upheld by the supreme court.9 analysis 6. the commercial court judge remained unpersuaded by the explanations offered by the petitioner to justify their delay in filing the requisite documents alongside the plaint. he delved into the evolution of the provisions pertaining to the filing of documents along with the pleadings, and the consequences of non-submission, invoking precedents of this court and the supreme court. consequently, he framed three pivotal questions for adjudication, as outlined in paragraph 14 of the impugned order as follows: \"a). whether the documents sought to be filed by both the applications were in the power, possession, control or custody of plaintiff? b). if yes, whether plaintiff establishes a reasonable cause for non-disclosure of the same at the time of filing of the plaint as required under order xi rule 1(5) cpc. c). whether the additional documents are required to answer the case set up by the defendant in terms of order xi rule 1(c)(ii) cpc.\" 7. regarding the first question, the commercial court judge reached the conclusion that the disputed documents were indeed under petitioner's power, possession, control, and custody at the time of the filing of the plaint. having established this, he moved on to assess whether the petitioner could establish 2021 scc online del 5398. brainlink international inc. & anr. v. ht media limited & anr., petition for special leave to appeal c no. 3579/2022, order dated 14th march, 2022. a valid reason for not disclosing these documents at the time of filing the plaint, as mandated by order xi rule 1(5) of cpc. his judgement on this issue, crystallised as the second question, extracted above, is summarized as follows: \"21.1 bare perusal of both the applications of the plaintiff makes it clear that whatever reasons plaintiff has disclosed therein are to justify the reason for non filing of the same alongwith the plaint. for instance, in the first application, plaintiff avers that some documents were left out inadvertently; as officers of plaintiff and its counsels were working from home due to covid, certain documents were left out due to administrative error. similarly, in the second application, plaintiff alleges that since some documents being old documents were kept at different site, which could not be accessed due to lockdowns, plaintiff could not file the same along with the plaint. 21.2 needless to say that in order to seek leave of the court to file additional documents under order xi rule 1(5) cpc, plaintiff is required to establish a reasonable cause for non-disclosure of the same along with the plaint and not to establish a reasonable cause for non-filing of the same along with the plaint. there is a significant distinction between the reason for non-disclosure of a document at the time of filing of the plaint and the reason for non-filing of the same alongwith the plaint as the furnished reason may be reasonable for non-filing of the same, but the same reason may not be reasonable for non-disclosure of the same. for instance, lockdown may be a reasonable cause for non-filing of the same along with the plaint as due to lockdown plaintiff may not be in a position to collect the document from the particular place, but the same lockdown may not be reasonable cause for nondisclosing of the same as lockdown does not prevent the plaintiff to disclose the same at the time of filing of the plaint. but, in the instant case, plaintiff preferred not to disclose any reason for non-disclosure of the documents in question at the time of filing of plaint despite the fact that documents were in his power, possession, control or custody; rather he preferred to disclose the reasons for non-filing of the same, which is not sine qua non in order xi rule1(5) cpc. as the plaintiff failed to disclose any reasonable cause for non-disclosure of the documents in question at the time of filing of the plaint, i am of the view that plaintiff failed to fulfil the requisite mandatory condition of order xi rule 1(5) cpc to seek the leave of the court. 22. on january 18, 2022, learned counsel for the plaintiff sought leave of the court to file additional affidavit in support of both the applications to disclose when the additional documents were retrieved by the plaintiff, which was granted by the court. accordingly, plaintiff filed the affidavit on january 31, 2022. 22.1 in para 3 of the affidavit, plaintiff states, \"i signed the plaint and affidavit but could not notarize them. i sent a scanned copy to my counsel in around mid-june 2021.\" in para 4, plaintiff states that he traced out certain invoices (as mentioned in first application) in the last week of june 2021 and personally delivered at the office of his counsel on 29.06.21. in order words, it is admitted case of the plaintiff, he had traced out the documents mentioned in the first application prior to filing of the suit, which was admittedly filed online on 08.07.2021. in para 5 of the affidavit, plaintiff states that he visited delhi on 16.07.2021 for re-execution of documents and notarisation thereof but since he had to return aligarh quickly, he did not go through each and every document. admittedly, hard copy of the plaint was filed on 16.07.2021 and the statement of truth was got attested from oath commissioner of 16.07.2021 wherein he also declared on oath that he has disclosed and filed all the documents in his power, possession, control or custody. does plaintiff intend to say that he signed the plaint, affidavit and statement on truth without going through its contents? if yes, it is nothing but negligence of plaintiff, which cannot be considered a reasonable cause. 22.2 no doubt, covid 19 created unprecedented situation not only for individuals but also for institutions and even for all the organs of governments. but since necessity is the mother of invention, covid 19 also taught all of us, how to interact or communicate in such unprecedented situations. inter-net played a significant role to save the mankind, institutions from the catastrophic effects of covid 19 as peoples started to hold meetings through various online platforms. similarly, institutions started functioning online. indian judiciary also started online filing and online hearing which were unknown prior to covid 19. plaintiff himself in para 3 of his affidavit stated that he sent a scanned copy to his counsel in mid june 2021. thus, there was no such reason for the plaintiff even to come to delhi from aligarh just to deliver some invoices he could easily send the soft copy of the same to his counsel. further, it is just unbelievable that plaintiff would not inform or confirm from the office of his counsel that the invoices had been received or not. further, it was the duty of plaintiff to check whether the invoices were mentioned in the list of documents or not? if plaintiff preferred to sign the documents without going through it, then he can not take his lapse as a reasonable cause. if such plea is started to the considered as reasonable cause, it would defeat the object of enactment of commercial courts act. 22.3 in the light of above, i am of the view that even reason furnished in the affidavit qua documents mentioned in the first application are insufficient to establish a reasonable cause for non-disclosure of the documents at the time of filing of the plaint.\" [emphasis supplied] 8. the commercial court judge turned his attention next to petitioner's plea to introduce additional documents under order xi rule 1(1)(c)(ii) of the cpc, a situation contemplated in the third question. the second application, was also considered under the aforenoted provision, but was rejected as the petitioner could not support the same on facts. in this determination, the commercial court judge evaluated the jurisprudence presented by both parties and rejected the precedents referenced by the petitioner, noting that the governing judgement on the issue is the supreme court's ruling in sudhir kumar (supra). he emphasized the criticality of demonstrating a reasonable cause for non-disclosure of documents, concluding that without such a justification, the petitioner's contention lacked merit, thus precluding the belated introduction of documents. 9. as can be seen from the emphasised extracted portions of the impugned order, the commercial court judge has proceeded on the assumption of the necessity to establish a \"reasonable cause for non-disclosure of documents in the plaint\". a clear distinction is drawn by the commercial court judge between a reasonable cause for 'non-disclosure' vis-à-vis a reasonable cause for 'not filing' the documents along with the plaint, which he perceives as significant. on this premise, he asserts that the reasons for non-disclosure of documents at the time of filing the plaint and the reasons for not filing the same are two separate and distinct concepts. he further holds that while a reason might be deemed reasonable for not filing the documents at the time of filing of plaint, it may not meet the requisite threshold of reasonableness for non-disclosure of the same. 10. the aforementioned distinction forming the bedrock of the impugned order is not explicitly evident from the perusal of order xi rule 1(5) of cpc. the commercial court judge's emphasis on the disclosure of documents that are within the power, possession, control, and custody of the petitioner is indeed accurate. however, the drawn distinction between 'non-filing' and 'non-disclosure' appears to be contrived. under order xi rule 1(1) of cpc, the plaintiff is obliged to file a list of all documents and photocopies of all documents within its power, possession, control or custody relating to the suit, including the documents the plaintiff references and relies upon in the plaint. in addition, order xi rule 1(3) of cpc imposes an additional obligation on plaintiff to declare on oath that all documents within the plaintiff's power, possession, control, and custody pertaining to the facts and circumstances of the proceedings initiated have been disclosed and their copies annexed with the plaint. therefore, the law demands not only a disclosure but also filing of documents along with the plaint, thus, creating a 'dual requirement'. order xi rule 1(5) underscores the importance of this requirement by prohibiting the plaintiff from relying on documents not disclosed along with the plaint. hence, the legal imperative is that if a document is within the plaintiff's power, possession, control, or custody, it should not only be disclosed but also filed along with the plaint. however, the commercial court judge proceeds on the assumption that there is no disclosure by the petitioner regarding the additional documents, thereby rendering the reason for non-filing irrelevant. his understanding is evident from the illustration in the impugned order, which notes \"for instance, lockdown may be a reasonable cause for nonfiling of the same along with the plaint as due to lockdown plaintiff may not be in a position to collect the document from the particular place, but the same lockdown may not be a reasonable cause for non-disclosing of the same as lockdown does not prevent the plaintiff to disclose the same at the time of filing of the plaint.\" in the opinion of this court, this principle has been erroneously applied to the facts of the present case. therefore, the commercial court judge's distinction between the reasons for 'nondisclosure' and 'non-filing' is rendered artificial. the lockdown induced by covid-19 surely constitutes a reasonable cause for both non-disclosure and non-filing, subject to the satisfaction of the circumstances and the discretion of the court. 11. in addition, the commercial court judge has returned a definitive finding against the petitioner for failing to disclose the documents, at the time of filing the plaint. this finding is not backed by any fact-checking. subject matter of the first application were six invoices (from the period of 2008 to 2010) and the online status of respondents' five trademark applications, as noted in the background facts above. on a perusal of the plaint, it is made out that a corresponding disclosure was made for the said invoices pertaining to petitioner's use of their trademark 'amaze', in paragraph 4 of the plaint to the following effect:\".the plaintiff has been using the mark amaze written in stylized manner \"amaze source of infinitve power\" since 2008. the plaintiff has been openly, continuously and extensively using the mark amaze on the said goods as their essential feature since its adoption in 2008.\" 12. likewise, a disclosure and averments pertaining to respondents' five trademark applications, which relate to the documents containing the online status of marks, find mention in paragraph 18 and 19 of the plaint, extracted as under:paragraph 18 \"the investigation trial also lead to the marks applied for registration by the defendant which is summarized in the table below.\" paragraph 19 \"it is pertinent to note that all marks are filed on 'proposed to be used' basis giving an impression that products under the mark amaze are yet to be launched in the market. all marks of defendant are pending except tm except tm no. 3861216 which is registered against which the plaintiff has filed rectification.\" 13. thus, there is a disclosure in the pleadings qua documents which form the subject matter of the first application. furthermore, keeping the legal principles of pleadings in mind, it must be noted that a plaintiff is not obligated to furnish a detailed disclosure of each document in the plaint itself. the law on this subject as evident from precedents mandates disclosure of material facts, not an exhaustive cataloguing of all documents in possession, in the plaint. the core of a pleading lies in the enunciation of material facts and not the amplification of every document that supports those facts. under order xi of cpc, a duty is imposed upon the parties to a suit to disclose all relevant documents that are within their power, possession, control or custody, at the earliest opportunity. therefore, while the law requires a basic level of transparency qua critical documents, it does not insist on any exhaustive specification of every single document in the pleadings. we must understand that this requirement of disclosure serves to streamline the issues and prevent surprises at the stage of trial. the objective is to provide the opposite party, a fair notice of the case they need to meet, rather than to provide them with an exhaustive disclosure of each document in the plaint. moreover, the express provision under order xi of cpc to take on record additional documents filed belatedly, with the leave of the court, indicates the legislative acknowledgment of potential circumstances that could arise leading to delayed disclosure or submission of some documents on justifiable reasons. the restriction under order xi rule 1(5) of cpc against filing of additional documents is not absolute, but conditional, allowing for their inclusion with permission of the court. given the existence of a pleading that supports the documents in the first application, the court must now determine if there was a justifiable reason for the delayed submission of these documents. 14. the petitioner justified the late submission of documents through affidavits dated 31st january, 2022, stating that the additional documents were located in a different premises under lockdown due to the covid-19 pandemic and/or the technical staff not being available to retrieve the same, making them inaccessible until after the filing of the suit. although the commercial court judge recognized the compelling circumstances owing to the covid-19 pandemic, yet the impugned order was passed on the premise that the lack of disclosure in the initial pleadings barred the subsequent submission of these documents. however, this court is of the view that petitioner's reasons relating to covid-19 lockdown and the linked unavailability of staff should have been considered as a valid cause for not filing the said documents with the plaint. we find the commercial court judge's dismissal of these reasons to be erroneous in such circumstances. 15. it is noteworthy that the commercial court judge primarily relied on the judgment in sudhir kumar (supra) to disallow the applications. however, in court's view, the failure to contextualize the specific facts and circumstances of the present case has led to a misapplication of this precedent. in sudhir kumar's case, the first suit was filed in october 2018 and later withdrawn in july 2019, granting liberty to file a fresh suit. the second suit was instituted in august 2019, and an application for filing additional documents under order vii rule 14(3) of cpc was moved thereafter, which was dismissed by the trial court and subsequently confirmed by the high court. the supreme court, in appeal, noted the absence of any urgency at the time of the second suit filing, and thus, concluded that the sheer volume of documents could not qualify as a reasonable cause for their delayed submission. a co-ordinate bench of this court has also held in bennett coleman & co. ltd. v. arg outlier media pvt. ltd.10 that the judgment in sudhir kumar (supra) does not put any fetters on a court from permitting additional documents to be taken on record if a party adduces satisfactory reasons for not filing the same with the plaint. in the case at hand, the filing was made at the height of the covid-19 pandemic a reality that was unforeseen and presented unique challenges and extraordinarily extreme circumstances affecting all walks of life. the supreme court in various judgements, such as prakash corporates v. dee vee projects,11 as well as this court in various judgments, have consistently advocated a more flexible stance while dealing with filings during the covid-19 pandemic. the supreme court's view in prakash corporates (supra), excluded the period between 15th march, 2020 and 02nd october, 2021, when covid-19 pandemic was ongoing, from computing the extended period of limitation of 120 days in filing the written statement. respondents place reliance on ht media (supra) to contend that the petitioner's plea of being impacted by covid-19 does not hold ground. this view is rendered per incuriam, in light of the supreme court's authoritative view in prakash corporates (supra) of taking a liberal approach on filings during covid-19, as also, the facts of the present case, wherein the non-filing of the documents in-question has been sufficiently linked to covid-19, and even acknowledged in the impugned order. it is thus neutral citation no. 2023:dhc:001726. 2022 scc online sc 180. difficult to agree with the finding in the impugned order that prakash corporates (supra) does not come to the aid of the petitioner. 16. in the light of the exceptional challenges posed by the covid-19 pandemic, it becomes incumbent on this court to eschew a strict interpretation and embrace a more lenient outlook in the matter at hand. as delineated earlier, the provisions of order xi rule 1(5) of cpc do erect a stringent boundary, but in the given scenario, the explanation tendered by the petitioner sufficiently justifies the belated introduction of additional documents. notwithstanding this, it is important to acknowledge that the suit is still at a nascent stage, with issues yet to be framed and the interim injunction application of the petitioner still pending adjudication. the adage that 'procedure is the handmaid of justice' must guide our deliberations. while the essence of order xi of cpc is to instil a sense of urgency in commercial proceedings, it should not be interpreted in a manner that hampers the pursuit of justice or enables one party to clinch victory on mere technical grounds before the matter has been thoroughly scrutinized at trial. indeed, as pointed out by the petitioner, co-ordinate benches of this court have allowed for additional documents to be filed in matters where issues had not been framed. that said, each case has to turn on its own facts and circumstance, which, as discussed above are compelling enough for exercise of the court's discretion, as provided in law. 17. let's now turn our attention to the documents under scrutiny in the second application. documents no. 31 to 42, which form subject matter of the second application, comprise of photocopies of petitioner's advertisements in newspapers/ magazines, printouts relating to petitioner's website and third-party websites showcasing petitioner's products, petitioner's social media activity, copies of its other promotional activities/ material, details of awards, ca certificate of sale/expenses, and invoices, in relation to the mark \"amaze.\" additionally, documents no. 43 to 47, in the second application, are copies of respondent's video clips of the launch of their products along with printouts of screenshots of the same and respondent's promotional activities along with printouts of news articles with coverage of respondent's products from 2018. said documents support petitioner's contention regarding falsity of respondent's claim of prior user of the mark \"amaze\". thus, while the logic delineated above for documents that form part of the first application would hold true for documents under the second application, it is also imperative to acknowledge the validity of the petitioner's claim that they are entitled to introduce these documents to refute the respondent's assertion of prior use. indeed, documents, even if available in the public domain, may be filed when the need arises on account of a stand taken by a defendant in the written statement.12 18. the petitioner has consistently argued that they are the bona fide and prior adopter and user of the mark since 2008, while the respondents only recently entered the market. this assertion has been disputed by the respondent, necessitating the petitioner to counter this claim by producing the aforementioned additional documents. through these documents, the petitioner intends to demonstrate their extensive prior use of the mark and the respondent's subsequent passing off. the petitioner has utilized copies of newspapers/ magazine advertisements, invoices and other documents, that bennett coleman & co. ltd (supra). were not accessible during the initial suit filing. in the opinion of the court, aforesaid documents would be relevant in determining the issue of prior use urged by the parties. consequently, the commercial court judge's ruling cannot sustain upon this ground either, and the petitioner is indeed entitled to avail themselves of the provisions under order xi rule 1(1)(c)(ii) of cpc. 19. lastly, the court must observe that the arguments put forth by mr. sindhwani regarding the jurisdiction of this court under article 227 of the constitution of india hold merit and are well-grounded, however, it is important to explore the implications thereof in the current context. article 227 imbues the high court with the supervisory jurisdiction over all courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction. this supervisory role serves to, ensure the correct application of law, uphold justice, and prevent miscarriage of the same. in the case at hand, upon thorough review, it is evident that the trial court's perspective bears a manifest error. consequently, this becomes an apt scenario for this court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction, endowed by article 227 of the constitution of india. it is the responsibility of this court, under the tenets of said provision, to correct such palpable errors. therefore, this court, while being cognizant of its jurisdiction, deems it fit to intervene in the current matter. 20. furthermore, in the interest of fairness and with an aim to balance the scales of justice, it is essential to take into account the delay in the prosecution of the suit due to the belated filing of documents by the petitioner. in such circumstances, it is deemed appropriate to impose costs upon the petitioner as a way to redress this delay. 21. in addition, an opportunity should be extended to the respondents to present any additional documents they may wish to submit. the respondents are thus given a period of two weeks from the date of release of this judgment to file any such documents with the trial court, thereby ensuring that no party is disadvantaged, and the process remains equitable. 22. in view of the above, the present petition is allowed with following directions: 22.1. impugned order dated 02nd august, 2022 is set aside. 22.2. additional documents forming subject matter of impugned order are permitted to be taken on record, subject to just exceptions. 22.3. cost of inr 50,000/is imposed on petitioner which is directed to be paid to respondents within a period of one week from the date of release of this judgment. 23. disposed of along with other pending applications. sanjeev narula, j july 03, 2023 d.negi"
