This appeal, preferred under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Commercial Courts Act\"), read with Order Xliii and Section 151 of the  Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (\"the CPC\"), assails order, dated 3rd July, 2019, of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Original Appeal (OA) 58/2019, in CS (COMM) 665/2017. The appellant before us is the defendant in CS (COMM) 665/2017, and the appellant in OA 58/2019. \nFacts 2. CS (COMM) 665/2017 was filed by the respondent, against the appellant, seeking permanent injunction, against the appellant, from infringing the Trade Mark SUPERON, of the respondent. The respondent contended, in the suit, that it was part of a group, which included M/s Stanvac Chemicals India Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \"Stanvac\"), who were pioneers in the import and distribution of high- quality maintenance consumables since 1994. While admitting that the respondent itself was incorporated only in 2004, the plaint averred that the respondent was only supporting the import and maintenance activities of Stanvac and that, by the time the plaintiff came to be filed, the respondent was engaged in manufacture of conventional welding electrodes, under license from M/s Oerlikon Schweistechnik AG, Switzerland. With effect from 2004, averred the plaint, the trademark SUPERON came to be adopted by the respondent, with respect to the trade and business of manufacturing, marketing and exporting of welding electrodes, being undertaken by it. It was pointed out that the word Superon has no dictionary meaning, and formed an integral part of the tradename of the respondent. It was further averred, in the plaint, that, at the time of its adoption, no trademark, or label, SUPERON, was registered with the Registrar of Trade Marks. It was further contended, in the plaint, that the respondents SUPERON mark had a distinctive and unique trade dress, involving black lettering on a yellow background. In view thereof, it was contended that the respondent was the registered proprietor of the trademark/label SUPERON in relation to welding electrodes and alike goods. It was also contended that the respondent had applied for registration of copyright in respect of the artistic work involved in the label SUPERON. As such, the plaint contended, SUPERON was a distinctive and well-known trademark/name/label of the respondent within the meaning of clause (zg) of Section 2, read with Section 11 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Trade Marks Act\").\n3. The respondent claimed, in the plaint, to be aggrieved by the adoption and user, by the appellant, of the trademark SUPERCROME, in respect of welding electrodes manufactured by it. The plaint contended that the appellant could not claim to be the proprietor of the trademark/label SUPERCROME, and could not, legally, use the said trademark without the leave and licence of the respondent, as, in the respondents submission, the trademark SUPERCROME was deceptively similar to the respondents trademark SUPERON phonetically, visually and structurally. It was also sought to be contended, in this regard, that the appellant had copied the colour combination and placement of words in the label SUPERON, of the respondent. Inasmuch as the respondent was using several trademarks and labels, containing the Super prefix, such as SUPERMICRO, SUPERTIG, SUPERMIG and SUPERSTAINLESS, the plaint averred that there was every likelihood of the trademark SUPERCROME being confused as belonging to the respondent. In view thereof, the plaint alleged that the appellant had infringed the respondents trademark and was passing off its goods as those of the respondent. It was also pointed out, in this regard, that, on 20th February, 2017, the appellant had filed an application, before the Registrar of Trade Marks, for registration of the SUPERCROME trademark. Asserting that the goods manufactured by the appellant, under the SUPERCROME trademark were the same as those manufactured by the respondent under its SUPERON trademark, albeit of inferior quality, the plaint averred that the respondent was entitled to an injunction, against the appellant, from using its SUPERCROME trademark. \n4. Following on the above averments, CS (COMM) 665/2017, filed by the respondent against the appellant, contained the following prayers:\n\"36. The plaintiff, under the above stated facts and circumstances, prays: -\n(a). For a decree of permanent injunction restraining the defendant by themselves as also through ; their directors, proprietors, individual proprietor, partners (if any), agents, servants, assigns, representatives, successors, distributors and all others acting for and on their behalf from using, selling, offering, for sale, advertising or displaying directly or indirectly or dealing in any other manner or mode in welding electrodes and all allied and cognate goods/products under the impugned trademark/label SUPERCROME or any other trademark /label dress identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiffs trade mark/name/lable amounting to or resulting in:-\n(i) Infringement of the plaintiffs said trade mark/name/lable SUPERON;\n(ii) Passing off and violation of the plaintiffs said trade mark/name/lable SUPERON;\n(iii) Infringement or otherwise violation by way of passing off of the plaintiffs said copyright involved in the said trade mark/name/label SUPERON;\n(b) For an order for delivery up of all the defendant impugned goods and business bearing the impugned trade mark/lable/packaging including packing material, pouches, carton boxes, carry bags, finished and unfinished goods, boxes, stickers, or any other incriminating material including display boards and sign boards and trade literature to the plaintiff for the purpose of destructions/erasure. \n(c) For an order of rendition of account of the defendant by their aforesaid impugned trade activities and a decree to the plaintiff on the amount so ascertained.\n(d) In alternative to accounts for a decree for grants of damages of Rs.1,00,000,001/- (Rupees One Crore one) from the defendant, jointly and severally to the plaintiff.\n(e) For such further order as this Honble Court may deed fit and proper in the circumstances of the case and in the interest of justice.\"\n5. Consequent to issuance of summons in the aforesaid suit, the appellant, being the defendant therein, filed its written statement by way of response thereto. Emphatically denying all averments in the plaint, the appellant contended that it had neither infringed any trademark of the respondent, nor sought to pass off its goods as those of the respondent. The appellant averred, in its written statement, that it was, in fact, the prior user of the SUPERCROME trademark, since 1st April, 2001. In fact, contended the written statement, the appellant was using other trademarks, too, involving the Super prefix, since as far back as 1992, such as SUPERCR, SUPERMO, SUPERNI, SUPERCU, SUPERLH and SUPERSSS. As against this, pointed out the written statement, the respondent was incorporated only in 2004. The appellant contended, in its written statement, therefore, that it was the prior user of the SUPERCROME trademark, and its user was, therefore, protected by Section 34 of the Trade Marks Act. \n6. On 3rd August, 2018, the respondent filed IA 10990/2018, under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, seeking to amend its plaint, specifically para 8 thereof, which the respondent desired to amend to read thus:\n\"8. That with the advent of the plaintiff company in the year 2004, the trademark/name/label SUPERON came to be adopted. However, the trademark SUPERON has been originally adopted by the plaintiff group through Stanvac Chemicals India Limited, a sister concern of plaintiff in 1994 and has been used since then up to 2004 when the plaintiff company came to have been incorporated and started using the said trademark along with all the artistic features including colour combination of mustard yellow (in the background) and black with the swirl device engulfing the trademark SUPERON. The plaintiff coined, conceived and adopted the trademark/label and distinctive trademark without having any connection or connotation with regard to the trade and business of manufacturing, marketing, exporting of stainless steel welding electrodes, series of welding electrodes, stainless steel wires, stainless steel pickling products, maintenance and repair welding electrodes (hereinafter referred to as said goods). The trademark SUPERON of the plaintiff is having no dictionary meaning at all and the trademark/label formed integral part of the trade name of the plaintiff. At the time of adoption there was no such trademark or label existing in the register of the Trade Mark. Hence, the trademark/label/name of the plaintiff is arbitrary and fanciful. (Plaintiff hereinafter means and includes its group and sister concern.)\" \nThe italicised words, in the afore-extracted para 8, were sought to be added by way of amendment. An amended plaint was also annexed with the application for amendment. \n7. The appellant filed a reply to IA 10990/2018, as well as a written statement, by way of response to the amended plaint, in both of which the prayer, of the respondent, for permission to amend the plaint, was seriously contested. The appellant submitted that the proposed amendment was being introduced clearly by way of hindsight, so as to overcome the contentions advanced, by the appellant in its written statement, filed in response to the plaint which, submitted the appellant, otherwise served to non-suit, entirely, the respondent. It was pointed out that, by the proposed amendment, the respondent was seeking to advance the initial date of use of the contested trademark to 1994, so as to set up an entirely new case of \"prior usage\". It was pleaded that the proposed amendment, if allowed, would change the very crux of the case set up by the respondent, and would result in grave prejudice to the appellant, and its defence to the suit filed by the respondent, and would also affect the appellant in the other suits pending between the appellant and the respondent. \n8. The aforesaid IA 10990/2018, preferred by the respondent under Order VI Rule 17, CPC, was allowed, by the learned Joint Registrar (Judicial) (hereinafter referred to as \"the learned Joint Registrar\") of this Court, by a detailed order dated 25 th April, 2019, which we deem appropriate to reproduce, in extenso, thus:\n\"1. By way of this order I shall dispose of the present application filed by the plaintiff for amendment of the plaint.\n2. The brief facts of the case necessary to dispose of the present application are that as per the plaintiff, there is a group of companies which includes one Stanvac Chemicals India Limited. It is stated that the plaintiffs company was incorporated in the year 2004. The plaintiff claimed that it is using the trademark/label/packaging/trade-dress SUPERON for the purposes of its trade. It is alleged that the defendant has imitated identical/deceptively similar trademark/label SUPERCROME. It is further stated by the plaintiff that they have came to know from the website of Trademark Registry that the defendant had applied for registration of the impugned trademark SUPERCROME. \n3. It is prayed in the present matter that the defendant be permanently restrained from infringing the SUPERON mark and to passoff its goods under a similar trade name (SUPERCROME) as that of plaintiff SUPERON. Other ancillary reliefs were also sought by plaintiff. \n4. The defendant had filed the written statement stating that the plaintiff company came into existence in 2004 only but the defendant is using the name SUPERCROME or other similar names with suffix SUPER (as mentioned in para-A- 1 of preliminary objections) since 2001. It is further stated that the registration of plaintiffs device is under Classes 9 and 35 but not under class 7 and the defendants goods pertains to the class 7 and thus there cannot be any passing off. It is further stated that even the goods of the plaintiff have no registered trademark in classes 9 and 35. It is further stated that since the word SUPER is a dictionary word, there cannot be any exclusive claim on this word. It is further stated that the defendant is using the word SUPERCROME since 2001. \n5. The plaintiff has filed the replication and has denied the facts of the written statement and reiterated and reaffirmed that of its plaint. It was denied that the defendant was using the word SUPERCROME since 2001. However, it is stated that the defendant has started using the SUPERCROME in the year 2007 itself. \n6. By way of this application, the plaintiff has sought amendment to the fact that inadvertently it could not incorporate some facts regarding the duration of usage of the word SUPERON. It is stated that the word SUPERON is used by the group of companies (of which the plaintiff is also one of the companies) since 1994. It is stated that one another group of company i.e. Stanvac Chemicals India Limited is using the word SUPERON since 1994 and plaintiff wants to delete/amend paragraph 8 of the plaint to incorporate these facts (in terms of paragraph 6 of the application).\n7. The defendant in its reply and in arguments to this application, has stated that no document has been placed on record which connects the present plaintiff with Stanvac Chemicals India Limited. It is further stated that no assignment deed has been placed on record which shows the usage of the alleged word SUPERON assigned to the present plaintiff. It is further stated that due to this reason the present amendment cannot be allowed. \n8. The plaintiffs had filed a rejoinder and reiterated and reaffirmed the facts of application and denied those of reply filed by the defendant. \n9. I have gone through the record and the submissions forwarded by learned counsels for the parties. \n10. Till date issues have not been framed in the present matter and by way of this application, the plaintiff wants to bring on record the fact regarding the duration since when the word SUPERON used by the plaintiff or its other group of companies. This could not cause any prejudice to the defendant as it has every right and opportunity to rebut the fact. On the other hand, this fact will bring the clarity before the court to decide the real controversy. \n11. The plaintiff has relied on the judgments titled Bright Electrical v. Ramesh Kumar Patel, passed in CS (OS) No. 267/2008 dated 03.09.2009, Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal & Ors. v. K. K. Modi & Ors, AIR 2006 SC 1647 and Ramesh Kumar Agarwal v. Rajmala Exports Pvt. Ltd. & Ors., MANU/SC/0252/2012. The defendant has also relied on the judgments titled Revajeetu Builders and Developers v. Narayanaswamy & Sons & Ors passed in Civil Appeal No. 691/2009 dated 09.10.2009 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, Jai Jai Ram Manohar Lal v. National Building Material Supply, Gurgaon, AIR 1267, 1970 SCR (i) 22 and Mohinder Kumar Mehra v. Roop Rani Mehra & Ors. passed in Civil Appeal No. 19977/2017 dated 11.12.2017 of Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n12. As far as the judgment relied by the defendant i.e. Revajeetu (supra), the same is not applicable in the present matter because by way of this amendment, the plaintiff is not setting up a new case as it had already discussed this fact on Stanvac Chemicals India Limited in para-2 of its original plaint. The second judgment i.e. Jai Jai Ram Manohar Lal (supra) also does not apply in the present matter since by way of this amendment no prejudice is caused to the defendant as the trial has not begun. Moreover, this amendment is only sought by the plaintiff to put forward the case regarding duration period of trademark SUPERON. Similarly the third judgment i.e. Mohinder Kumar Mehra (supra) does not aid the plaintiff, but on the contrary lays down the principle which governs the amendment in the pleadings. As per these principles which are mentioned in para-8 of this judgement, present amendment can be allowed. \n13. In view of the above discussions, the application is accordingly allowed. However, since this fact could have known to the plaintiff from the very beginning and is not a subsequent event, the delay caused by the plaintiff is compensated by imposition of cost of Rs. 25,000/- which shall be paid to the defendant through counsel. Amended plaint is already on record.\" \n(Emphasis supplied) \n9. The appellant appealed, against the above order, dated 25 th April, 2019, whereby the learned Joint Registrar allowed IA 10990/2018, by way of a statutory appeal before the learned Single Judge on the Original Side of this Court, under Rule 5 in Chapter II of the Delhi High Court Rules (Original Side), 2018 (hereinafter referred to as \"the 2018 Original Side Rules\"). The learned Single Judge has noted the submissions, advanced before him by the appellant, in para 4 of the impugned order and has, thereafter, in paras 5 to 8 thereof, proceeded to return his findings thereon. Paras 4 to 8 of the impugned order may be reproduced, for ready reference, thus:\n\"4. Learned counsel for the appellant/defendant vehemently argued that the proposed amendment causes grave prejudice to the appellant/defendant inasmuch as the date of user of the trademark SUPERON by the plaintiff is sought to be changed by the proposed amendment. In the original place the user of the trademark is said to be since 2004 whereas the proposed amendment now seeks to argue that the user from 1994. She further states that the plaintiffs had failed to show as to whether they have any authority from Stanvac Chemicals India Limited to make the present application and to claim that the said Stanvac Chemicals India Limited is a parent group of the plaintiff company and that the user by the Stanvac Chemicals India Limited of the trademark SUPERON can also be claimed as a user by the plaintiff. She also states that there is no legal or financial relationship between the plaintiff and Stanvac Chemicals India Limited. She also states that the defendants/parent company has been using the trademark SUPERCROME and experience since 1985. She also states the invoices since 1990 to have been placed on record. She also states that the plaintiff has initiated other legal proceedings also against the defendants subsequent to the present suit where again there is no reference to the user of the trademark SUPERON by Stanvac Chemicals India Limited. \n5. In my view there is no error or infirmity in the impugned order. The suit is at the initial stage. Appellant/defendant merely seeks to place on record the fact that a company by the name of Stanvac Chemicals India Ltd which is said to be the parent company has been using the trademark SUPERCROME since 1994 prior to the incorporation of the appellant/respondent company. As to whether this alleged user by a company Stanvac Chemicals India Ltd in any manner enhance the merits of the case of the plaintiff are issues which will be gone into at the time of adjudication of the case. At this stage, while considering application for settlement the merits of the elements which are sought to be incorporated have not to be gone into by the court. Reference in this context may be hard to the judgement of the Supreme Court in Rajesh Kumar Agarwal and others vs. K. K. Modi and others, (2006) 4 SCC 385 where the Supreme Court held as follows: -\n\"19. While considering whether an application for amendment should or should not be allowed, the Court should not go into the correctness of falsity of the case of the amendment. Likewise, it should not record a finding on the merits of the amendment and the merits of the amendment sought to be incorporated by way of amendment or not to be adjudged at the stage of allowing the prayer for amendment. This cardinal principle has not been followed by the High Court in the instant case.\" \nSimilarly, in Lakha Ram Sharma vs. Balar Marketing Private limited, (2008) 17 SCC 671 the Supreme Court held as follows: -\n\"4. It is settled law that while considering whether the amendment is to be granted or not, the court does not go into the merits of the matter and decide whether or not the claim made therein is bona fide or not. That is a question which can only be decided at the trial of the suit...\" \n6. Clearly, the defence sought to be raised by the appellant cannot be adjudicated upon at this stage as it deals with the merits of the proposed amendment. \n7. In my opinion, further the amendment sought cannot said to be mala fide. Reference may be had to Revajeetu Builders and Developers v. Narayanaswamy and Sons and Others, MANU/SC/1724/2009 the Supreme Court held as follows: -\n\"67. On critically analysing both the English and Indian cases, some basic principles emerge which ought to be taken into consideration while allowing of rejecting the application for amendment. \n(1) Whether the amendment sought is imperative for proper and effective adjudication of the case? \n(2) Whether the application for amendment is bona fide or mala fide? \n(3) The amendment should not cause such prejudice to the other side which cannot be compensated adequately in terms of money;\n(4) Refusing amendment would infact leads to injustice or lead to multiple litigation;\n(5) Whether the proposed amendment Constitutionally or fundamentally changes the nature and character of the case? And (6) As a general rule, the court should decline amendments if a fresh suit or the appended claims would be barred by limitation on the date of application.\"\n8. There is accordingly no merit in the appeal. Same is dismissed.\"\n10. The present appeal impugns the aforesaid order/judgement, dated 3rd July, 2019, of the learned Single Judge in OA 58/2019. \nRival submissions - as pleaded and argued 11. While we would be referring, in greater detail, to the rival submissions, advanced by learned Counsel, we may note, at this stage, that, for the first time, the appellant has sought to contend, in the rejoinder filed before us, that the learned Joint Registrar was not competent to adjudicate on the amendment application of the respondent, as the amendment sought was not formal in nature. Having noted this, we proceed to allude, in greater detail, to the rival submissions of learned Counsel, before us. \n12. We have heard, at length, Ms Girija Krishna Varma, learned Counsel for the appellant and Mr. Sanjeev Sindhwani, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent. \n13. Ms. Varma submits that, by the amendment proposed in para 8 of the plaint, the respondent was altering the very character of the suit. To drive home this point, she submitted thus:\n(i) In the plaint, the respondents contention was that the date of incorporation of the respondent-Company was the date, from which the respondent was using the SUPERON trademark. Stanvac figured only by way of a passing reference, in para 2 of the plaint. With the plaint, no invoices, or other material evidencing use, by the respondent, of the SUPERON trademark, from 2004, were filed. Additional documents were now being sought to be introduced along with the amendment to the plaint. \n(ii) The claim of user, from 1994, now sought to be introduced by amendment, was based only on photocopies. All relevant documents showed the date of first user, by the respondent, of the SUPERON trademark, as 2004. \n(iii) In its written statement, filed by way of response to the plaint of the respondent, the appellant had clearly pleaded that it was in the business of welding electrodes since 1965, and had itself been incorporated on 30th March, 1985, along with proof showing user, by it, of the SUPERCROME trademark from 1992. Original invoices had been placed, on record, by the appellant, to justify its stand. Specifically for the SUPERCROME trademark, the date of prior user, by the appellant, was 1st April, 2001. \n(iv) On 8th May, 2018, the appellant filed CS (COMM) 851/2018, against the respondent, alleging infringement, by the respondent, of the registered trademarks SUPERTIG and SUPERMIG of the appellant. In the said suit, too, the appellant had placed, on record, original invoices, by way of evidence of prior user. \n(v) Even in the plaint as amended, the respondent had not produced any proof to show that Stanvac was dealing in welding electrodes and welding wires. Apparently, Stanvac was being used to somehow pre-date the user, by the respondent, of the SUPERON trademark. No authority, from Stanvac, had been placed on record. In fact, the very introduction of Stanvac was fraudulent, as the respondent and Stanvac were engaged in different, and distinct, activities, though they had common directors. \n(vi) The application for amendment of the plaint was filed only after the filing of CS (COMM) 851/2018, with a view, somehow, to defeat the said suit. \n(vii) On 3rd October, 2017, the respondent filed an application, before the Registrar of Trade Marks for registration of the SUPERON wordmark in Class 7 for welding electrodes, showing its date of user as 1st June, 2004. No application, for change of user date had been preferred, before the Registrar of Trademarks, by the respondent, till date. Other similar applications, for registration of trademark in respect of welding electrodes, had also been filed by the respondent. \n(viii) By trying to change the date of user, by it, of the SUPERON trade mark, to a date prior to that declared in the suit, the respondent was substantially changing the nature of the suit. This was a clear attempt to circumvent the defence of the appellant, which already stood disclosed in the written statement filed by it in response to the respondents plaint. \n(ix) Advancement, of the date of use, by the respondent, of the SUPERON trademark to 1994, in place of 2004 (as declared in the plaint as originally filed) not only changed the nature of the suit, but nullified, in its entirety, the appellants defence. \n(x) The introduction of Stanvac, at this stage of the proceedings, was unjustified. Stanvac was in the business of chemicals, whereas the respondent was manufacturing and trading in electrodes and welding wires. The only commonality, between Stanvac and the respondent, was that they had the same Directors. \nMs. Varma also sought to contend that the learned Joint Registrar was not competent to adjudicate IA 10990/2018, as the amendment sought, by the respondent, in the said application, could not be regarded as formal in nature. The learned Joint Registrar having acted in excess of its jurisdiction, Ms. Varma would seek to submit that, consequently, the impugned judgement, of the learned Single Judge, also stood vitiated. \n14. Various other submissions, on the merits of the claim of the respondent, have been advanced in the appeal before us; however, as we are not adjudicating the suit, which is pending before the learned Single Judge, we do not deem it necessary to make any reference thereto. \n15. Arguing per contra, Mr. Sindhwani submits, at the outset, that the appeal, of the appellant, was not maintainable, in view of the proviso to Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Commercial Courts Act\"), read with the judgements of this Court in HPL (India) Ltd v. QRG Enterprises1 and Samsung Leasing Ltd v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd2. Apropos the jurisdiction of the learned Joint Registrar to adjudicate IA 10990/2017, Mr. Sindhwani would, even while forbearing from seriously contesting this claim of Ms. Varma, seek to submit that the issue did not survive for consideration, as the learned Single Judge, adjudicating OA 58/2019, was effectively exercising original, rather than appellate, jurisdiction. Even if, therefore, the learned Joint Registrar were to be assumed not to have possessed the jurisdiction to decide IA 10990/2018, Mr. Sindhwani would submit that the learned Single Judge could, in any event, have decided the said application and that, therefore, the issue of jurisdiction of the learned Joint MANU/DE/0347/2017 MANU/DE/2107/2017 Registrar did not really survive. For the proposition that the learned Single Judge was, while deciding OA 58/2019, exercising original, rather than appellate, jurisdiction, Mr. Sindhwani would place reliance on the judgement, of a Division Bench of this Court, in Rahul Gupta v. Pratap Singh3.\n16. On merits, Mr. Sindhwani would submit that the reasons, cited by the learned Single Judge in the impugned order, dated 3 rd July, 2019, for allowing the respondents prayer for amendment of its plaint, were unexceptionable, and could not be said to merit interference by this Court. \nAnalysis Re. Maintainability of the present appeal 17. The submission, of Mr. Sindhwani, that the present appeal is not maintainable, which is based on the decisions of this Court (rendered, in each case, by a Division Bench) in HPL (India) Ltd1, Samsung Leasing Ltd2 and Rahul Gupta3, deserves serious consideration. \n18. Premised, as this submission is, on Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, it would be appropriate to reproduce the said provision, thus:\n\"13. Appeals from decrease of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions. -\n206 (2014) DLT 188 (1) Any person aggrieved by the judgement or order of a Commercial Court below the level of a District Judge may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Court within a period of 60 days from the date of judgement or order. \n(1A) Any person aggrieved by the judgement or order of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period 60 days from the date of the judgement or order:\nProvided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1980 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996).\n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\"\n19. Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act, it may be noted, confers overriding application, to the said Act, over any other law for the time being in force. \n20. The submission of Mr. Sindhwani is that, in HPL (India) Ltd1, it has been held that the proviso, to Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, operated to exclude the appellate jurisdiction, of the Division Bench of this Court, over the decisions rendered by the learned Single Judge acting as a Commercial Court, in all cases, save and except those which found specific enumeration in Order XLIII of the CPC. Following, and adopting, this decision, Samsung Leasing Ltd2 held that orders, passed by the learned Single Judge, exercising jurisdiction as a Commercial Court, adjudicating applications for amendment under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, were not appealable to the Division Bench, as orders passed on applications under Order VI Rule 17 were not among those which find enumeration in Order XLIII of the CPC. \n21. On a plain reading, the proviso to Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act is an enabling, rather than a disabling, provision. There is nothing, in the said proviso, which would seem to indicate that it dilutes the effect of sub-section (1A) of Section 13. If we were to read the said proviso as excluding, from the jurisdiction of the appellate court, all orders, passed by a Commercial Court, save and except those which find specific enumeration in Order XLIII of the CPC, it may amount to rewriting the proviso to read \"Provided that no appeal shall lie, except from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or the Commercial Court as are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996).\" We are not convinced that the province of our jurisdiction, in the present case, allows us to so legislate. To our mind, therefore, sub-section (1A) of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act allows appeals to be preferred against all judgements and orders of the Commercial Division of the High Court, to the Commercial Appellate Division thereof, and the proviso, to the said sub-section merely clarifies that, in the case of orders specifically enumerated in Order XLIII of the CPC, such appeals shall lie. \n22. Though he has not articulated the proposition in so many words, the submissions of Mr. Sindhwani would seem to indicate that the decisions of this Court in HPL (India) Ltd1, Samsung Leasing Ltd2 and Rahul Gupta3 rule otherwise. \n23. We do not think so. \n24. In our view, these decisions, whether seen in isolation or in conjunction, would not militate against the maintainability of the present appeal, before us. \n25. HPL (India) Ltd1 addressed the issue of maintainability of an appeal, passed by the learned Single Judge as a Commercial Court, on an application, by the plaintiffs, for taking, on record, new documents, filed along with affidavits by way of examination-in-chief of new witnesses, whom the plaintiffs desired to co-opt in evidence. The learned Single Judge, of this Court, permitted the documents to be taken on record and, consequently, allowed the Interlocutory Application (IA) filed for the said purpose. Aggrieved thereby, the defendants carried the matter, by way of appeal, to the Division Bench of this Court. The maintainability of the appeal was contested, by the original plaintiffs, on the ground that the order, of the learned Single Judge, was not amongst those enumerated in Order XLIII of the CPC and that, therefore, no appeal, thereagainst, would lie before the Division Bench of this Court, in view of the proviso to Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act. The Division Bench of this Court accepted the submission, and held the appeal, preferred by the original defendants, not to be maintainable. In so holding, the Division Bench proceeded on the premise that the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act were required to be read in conjunction with the CPC and that, as the right to appeal, under Section 104 of the CPC, was limited to orders enumerated under Order XLIII thereof, an order which, though passed under the CPC, was not amongst the orders enumerated in Order XLIII, was not amenable to appeal under Section 104 of the CPC and, consequently, was equally not amenable to appeal under the proviso to Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act. \n26. Samsung Leasing Ltd2 dealt with an intra-Court appeal, preferred against an order of the learned Single Judge, allowing an application for amendment, under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, in a commercial dispute. The learned Division Bench held that, as orders passed on applications for amendment, under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, were not among the orders enumerated in Order XLIII thereof, no intra-Court appeal would lie, in view of the proviso to Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, as interpreted in HPL India Ltd1.\n27. Mr. Sindhwani laid particular emphasis on the decision in Samsung Leasing Ltd2, contending that, as that case, too, dealt with the maintainability of appeal against an order allowing amendment of the plaint, the law laid down, therein, applies, to the present case, on all fours.\n28. We regret our inability to agree. The distinction, sure, though subtle, between Samsung Leasing Ltd2 and the present case, lies in the fact that while, in Samsung Leasing Ltd2, this Court was concerned with the maintainability of an appeal against an order, passed by the learned Single Judge exercising commercial jurisdiction, under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, we are concerned with the challenge to an order, not passed under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, but, rather, under Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules. For ready reference, Rule 5, in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules may be reproduced, thus:\n\"5. Appeal against the Registrars orders. - Any person aggrieved by any order made by the Registrar, under Rule 3 of this Chapter, may, within 15 days of such order, appeal against the same to the Judge in Chambers. The appeal shall be in the form of a petitioner bearing court fees of  2.65.\" \nClause (2) in Rule 3 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules empowers the Registrar to decide any \"application to amend the plaint, petition, written statement, the application or subsequent proceedings where the amendment sought is formal\". It was ostensibly in exercise of the powers conferred by this clause that the learned Joint Registrar passed the order, dated 25th April, 2019, disposing of IA 10990/2018, against which OA 58/2019 came to be filed by the appellant. That being so, OA 58/2019 was relatable to Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules, extracted supra. The present appeal, before us, emanates, therefore, not from an order passed under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, but under Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules.\n29. HPL India Ltd1 and Samsung Leasing Ltd2, therefore, adjudicated on the maintainability of an appeal, under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, against an order, passed by the learned Single Judge in exercise of commercial jurisdiction, under one or the other provision of the CPC. We are not concerned with such a challenge. The challenge, before us, is against an order, of the learned Single Judge, passed under Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules. Samsung Leasing Ltd2, therefore, in our considered opinion, does not apply. \n30. Mr. Sindhwani would, however, seek to submit that this distinction would make no difference to the maintainability of the present appeal, or even to the applicability, to the present case, of the law laid down in Samsung Leasing Ltd2, in view of Rahul Gupta3, which involved, as in the present case, a challenge, by way of intra- Court appeal, to an order, of the learned Single Judge, passed in exercise of the powers conferred by Rule 4 in Chapter II of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1967 (hereinafter referred to as \"the 1967 Original Side Rules\"). In other words, Mr. Sindhwani would, essentially, seek to submit that, if we read Samsung Leasing Ltd2 and Rahul Gupta3 in conjunction, the inescapable sequitur would be that the present appeal is not maintainable. \n31. We, therefore, proceed to Rahul Gupta3. \n32. In Rahul Gupta3, an application, preferred under Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the CPC, seeking impleadment as a defendant in the suit, came to be rejected by the learned Joint Registrar by an order dated 14th December, 2010, against which an appeal (OA 19/2011) was preferred to the learned Single Judge under Rule 4 of Chapter II of the the 1967 Original Side Rules, which was in pari materia and in haec verba with Rule 5 of Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules. The appeal was allowed by the learned Single Judge vide order dated 5th February, 2013, against which the original plaintiff appealed to the Division Bench. \n33. The respondent before the Division Bench, i.e. the original defendant, advanced a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the appeal of the plaintiff, contending that, as the order, dated 5th February, 2013, of the learned Single Judge, had not been passed in exercise of ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the appeal, before the Division Bench, was barred by Section 100A of the CPC. For ready reference, Section 100A of the CPC may be reproduced, thus:\n\"100A. No further appeal in certain cases. - Notwithstanding anything contained in any Letters Patent for any High Court or in any instrument having the force of law or any other law for the time being in force, where any appeal from an original or appellate decree or order is heard and decided by a single Judge of the High Court, no further appeal shall lie from the judgement and decree of such single Judge.\" \nThe contention of the defendant-respondent, before the Division Bench in Rahul Gupta3 was, therefore, that, as the jurisdiction exercised by the learned Single Judge, while adjudicating OA 19/2011, was appellate in nature, no second appeal lay thereagainst, in view of the proscription contained in Section 100A of the CPC. \n34. The contention, thus advanced by the respondent-defendant before the Division Bench, appears, to us, to have been attractive, and, facially at least, in line with the statutory dispensation contained in Rule 4 of Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules and Section 100A of the CPC. Read plainly, Section 100A of the CPC expressly barred a second appeal, from an order passed by a single Judge of the High Court, in an appeal from an original or appellate decree or order. Treating the order, dated 14th December, 2010, passed by the learned Joint Registrar, as an original order, the learned Single Judge, in passing his order dated 5th February, 2013 in OA 19/2011, was exercising jurisdiction under Rule 4 of Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules, which expressly dealt with appeals against the Registrars orders. If, as a plain reading of Rule 4 in Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules, were to suggest, the learned Single Judge was, in passing his order dated 5th February, 2013, thus exercising appellate jurisdiction, a second appeal, to the Division Bench, thereagainst, was expressly barred by Section 100A of the CPC. Facially, therefore, this objection, as advanced before the Division Bench by the original defendant in Rahul Gupta3, was attractive. \n35. To buttress its submission regarding non-maintainability of the appeal, before the Division Bench of this Court, the defendant- respondent, in Rahul Gupta3, also drew attention to Section 10 of the Delhi High Court Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Delhi High Court Act\"), whereunder the appeal had been preferred. It was contended that Section 10 provided for an appeal, only against the judgement of the Single Judge passed in exercise of original civil jurisdiction. The order, dated 5th February, 2013, in OA 19/2011, having been passed by the learned Single Judge in exercise of appellate jurisdiction, it was contended, by the defendant-respondent, that no appeal, against the said order, would lie before the Division Bench under Section 10 of the Delhi High Court Act. This submission, too, was, undoubtedly, attractive. \n36. The Division Bench, however, proceeded to reject the objection, to maintainability of the appeal before it, by holding, following a somewhat involved reasoning, that the jurisdiction exercised by the learned Single Judge, under Rule 4 in Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules, was not, in fact, appellate, but original, and that the use of the word \"appeal\", in Rule 4, was actually a misnomer, viz. that (i) the Original Side Rules of this Court, having been framed in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 122 and 129 of the CPC, had to be read in conjunction with Sections 122, 128 and 129 of the CPC,\n(ii) Rule 1 of Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules required every suit, coming before this Court in its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, to be tried and heard by a Single Judge,\n(iii) Rule 3 of Chapter II of the Original Side Rules provided that the powers of the Court, in relation to certain matters specified therein, would be exercised by the Registrar,\n(iv) the Registrar, while exercising such powers, under Rule 3 of Chapter II of the Original Side Rules was, therefore, acting as a delegate of the Court, i.e. of the learned Single Judge,\n(v) the order of the Registrar, under Rule 3 of the 1967 Original Side Rules was, therefore, an order passed by the Registrar in his capacity as delegate, which, in effect, was an order of the Court exercising original jurisdiction,\n(vi) the appeal, provided under Rule 4 of Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules was, therefore, in effect an appeal from the order of the delegate, to the delegator,\n(vi) the learned Single Judge, as delegator was, therefore, while examining an appeal thereagainst, in fact examining an order which was passed in discharge of his own functions, albeit by his delegate,\n(viii) the exercise of jurisdiction by the learned Single Judge under Rule 4 of Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules was, in effect, therefore, in exercise of examination, by the principal, of an order passed by his delegate, in exercise of the powers originally vested with the principal,\n(ix) there was, therefore, \"complete identity of the powers exercised by the Registrar in matters specified in Rule 3 of Chapter II of the Original Side Rules and the jurisdiction vested with the Single Judge\",\n(x) as an ordinary rule, exercise of powers, vested in the principal, by his delegate, did not denude the principal of his authority to exercise the same powers,\n(xi) viewed thus, the exercise of powers, by the learned Single Judge, under Rule 4 of Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules was not, in actual fact, exercise of appellate jurisdiction, as an authority could not sit in appeal against an order passed in exercise of the jurisdiction vested in the authority itself, albeit by its delegate,\n(xii) at best, therefore, the power exercised by the learned Single Judge under Rule 4 in Chapter II of the Original Side Rules, was a power to review and re-examine the order passed by the Registrar, and (xiii) the expression \"appeal\", as employed in Rule 4 in Chapter II of the Original Side Rules was, therefore, a misnomer, as the Rule envisaged a mere re-examination, or review, by the delegator-Single Judge, of the order passed by the delegate-Registrar.\n37. The attention of the Division Bench, hearing Rahul Gupta3, was also invited to an earlier decision, again rendered by a Division Bench of this Court, in Akash Gupta v. Frankfinn Institute of Air Hostess Training4. In the said case, the Division Bench of this Court was adjudicating a reference, made by a learned Single Judge, of the following two questions, for determination:\n\"1. Whether an appeal would lie under Rule 4 of the Rules against any order made by the Registrar under Rule 3 on an AIR 2006 Delhi 325: 127 (2006) DLT 188 application/matter against which no appeal is provided under the Code of Civil Procedure, Delhi High Court Act, 1966 or the Letters Patent of this Court', and 2. If the answer to above question is in negative, whether Rule 4 needs to be retained in the Rules or needs to be suitably amended so as to bring the said rule in conformity with the Code and Act\"\n38. Paras 11 to 15 of the report decided these issues, thus:\n\"11. Rule 3 as quoted above gives certain powers to a Registrar to pass orders on specified applications/questions. A Registrar is competent to pass orders in respect of the matters specified in Rule 3 and not others. Rule 4 provides for appeal by a person aggrieved by the order made by the Registrar under Rule 3. If both the Rules are read harmoniously it will be incorrect to state that Rule 4 merely provides for a forum of appeal and does not provide for a right to appeal. Right to appeal is also specifically provided for and mentioned in Rule 4. All orders made under Rule 3 by a Registrar can be made subject matter of appeal under Rule 4. We, Therefore, need not refer to Order XLIII Rule 1 of the Code for deciding whether an appeal is maintainable under Rule 4 of the Rules. It may also be stated here that the Registrar is not competent to decide any dispute or applications that have been specified in Order XLIII Rule 1 of the Code, under Rule 3 of the Rules. \n12. Section 10 of the Act provides for an appeal against a 'judgment' to a Division Bench but this in no manner curtails or prevents the High Court to frame Rules under Section 7 in respect of matters pertaining to all proceedings of original side and also provide for an appeal against an order passed by a Registrar of this Court to a Judge in Chamber. It cannot be held that Rules 3 and 4 framed under Section 7 of the Act are in any manner contrary to the appellate jurisdiction as provided in Section 10 of the Act. Sections 7 and 10 of the Act have to be read harmoniously. Statute has to be read as a whole and every provision of the statute must be construed to make a consistent enactment. No provision should be left meaningless or otiose. Section 10 only deals with appeals against orders of a single Judge to a Division Bench in the High Court. It does not deal with or states that no appeal will lie against an order passed by a Registrar before a Judge in Chamber. Rule 4 of the Rules is not contrary to or inconsistent with Section 10 of the Act. \n13. Section 7 empowers Delhi High Court to make rules in respect of practice and procedure before it for the exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction. The words practice and procedure are very wide and will include the power to regulate and specify the method by which the Court will conduct its proceedings, while dealing with and disposing of various applications. Practice and procedure will also include providing for an appeal against an order passed by a Registrar under Rule 3 as provided in Rule 4. In any case, virus of Rule 4 has not been questioned and challenged. \n14. It may also be mentioned here that in case it is held that an order passed by the Registrar under Rule 3 is not appealable under Rule 4 to a Judge in Chamber, an aggrieved person may be required to file a Special Leave Petition, if it is not a judgment. Such interpretation in our opinion should be avoided. \n15. In view of the above findings, we are of the view that question No. 1 as framed and extracted above has to be answered in affirmative and it has to be held that appeal would lie under Rule 4 of the Rules against any order made by the Registrar under Rule 3, irrespective of fact whether any appeal has been provided under Code or the Act. Accordingly, we hold that the appeal is maintainable against all orders passed by the Registrar under Section 3 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1967 under Rule 4 to a Judge in Chamber. In view of the above conclusion and answer to question No. 1, we need not answer question No. 2. The above reference is disposed of.\" \n(Italics and underscoring supplied)\n39. The Division Bench, in Rahul Gupta3, however, distinguished the decision in Akash Gupta4 thus:\n\"24. In the case of Akash Gupta v. Frankfinn Institute of Air Hostess Training & Anr.: MANU/DE/0456/2006 : AIR 2006 Delhi 325 (DB), the question that arose for consideration was whether an appeal would lie under Rule 4 of Chapter II of the O.S. Rules against any order made by the Registrar under Rule 3 of Chapter II of the said Rules, even if no appeal was provided under the Code, the Act or the Letters Patent. The Court held that Rule 4 of Chapter II of the O.S. Rules provided not only a forum but also the right of appeal and all orders made under Rule 3 of Chapter II of the O.S. Rules could be made subject matter of an appeal under Rule 4 of Chapter II of the O.S. Rules. Reference to Order 43 Rule 1 of the Code was not required, to examine whether an appeal under Rule 4 of Chapter II of the O.S. Rules was maintainable or not. This decision also does not further the case of the respondent. The controversy in that case related to whether all orders of the Registrar were subject to an appeal under Rule 4 of the O.S. Rules. Indisputably, an order passed in exercise of powers under said Rule 3 by a Registrar of this Court can be made a subject matter of challenge under Rule 4 of Chapter II of the O.S. Rules. The issue whether the powers exercised under said Rule 4 was appellate power or not was not a subject matter of consideration in that case.\"\n(Emphasis supplied)\n40. With greatest respect to the Division Bench that decided Rahul Gupta3, for the members of which we have the highest regard, we are unable to subscribe to the above reasoning. It appears, to us, that, the interpretation of Rule 4 in Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules, accorded by the Division Bench in Rahul Gupta3, would effectively amount to rewriting Rule 4.\n41. It is not, ordinarily, permissible for the court to term an expression used in a legislative instrument - even if the legislation is subordinate in nature - as a \"misnomer\". Courts can neither legislate, nor regard legislation as having been loosely drafted.5 The 1967 Original Side Rules were drafted in exercise of the powers vested by Section 122 of the CPC and were entitled, therefore, to be accorded V. K Naswa v. Home Secretary, Union of India, (2012) 2 SCC 542; B. Premanand v. Mohan Koikal, (2011) 4 SCC 266; District Mining officers v. Tata Iron and Steel Co., (2001) 7 SCC 358; Union of India v. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal, AIR 1992 SC 96 due sanctity. If, therefore, Rule 4 in Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules referred to an appeal, against the order of the Registrar, to the learned Single Judge, in our view, the jurisdiction, exercised by the learned Single Judge, could not but be regarded as appellate. Treating the said jurisdiction as original in nature, and as a mere exercise of \"review\", or \"re-examination\", by the learned Single Judge, of the decision of his delegate, in our view, does violence to the scheme of Rules 3 and 4 in Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules. \n42. We are, however, spared the necessity of referring this issue to a Larger Bench, for two reasons. \n43. Firstly, as already noticed by us hereinabove, Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules, with which we are concerned in the present case, provides, once again, for an \"appeal\" against the order of the Registrar, passed under Rule 3. With the enactment of Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules, in our considered opinion, the view expressed in Rahul Gupta3 can no longer be followed, for the simple reason that, if it were to be followed, it would imply that the legislators of the 2018 Original Side Rules once again employed, in Rule 5 of Chapter II therein, the \"misnomer\" of appeal. If it is difficult to presume that the legislature erred once, it is impossible to presume that the legislature erred twice over. The framers of the 2018 Original Side Rules must be deemed to have been cognizant of the view expressed in Rahul Gupta3 (See Sakal Deep Sahai Srivastava v. U.O.I.6). Were, as the Division Bench in Rahul Gupta3 held, the (1974) 1 SCC 338 at 343. \nreference to an \"appeal\", in Rule 4 in Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules, a misnomer, it is reasonable to expect that the \"misnomer\" would not be repeated, once again, in Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules. The fact that Rule 5, in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules is a verbatim reproduction of Rule 4 in Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules, in our view, indicates that the use of the word \"appeal\", in the said Rule, is certainly not a misnomer. We, therefore, are clearly of the opinion that the jurisdiction, exercised by the learned Single Judge, under Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules, was appellate in nature, as is expressly stated in the said Rule, and that the use of the word \"appeal\" in Rule 5 of Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules cannot be regarded as a misnomer. \n44. Secondly, in Rahul Gupta3, the Commercial Courts Act did not arise for consideration at all. The appeal, in that case, was filed under Section 10 of the Delhi High Courts Act. In the present case, the appeal, before us, has been preferred under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. The two provisions are fundamentally different. Section 10 of the Delhi High Court Act provides for an appeal, from an order passed by a Single Judge of this Court, exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction conferred by Section 5 (2) of the Delhi High Courts Act, and from no other order. In stark contradistinction, Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act allows any person, aggrieved by the judgement or order of a Commercial Court at the level of the Commercial Division of the High Court, to appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court. \nThough, in the case of an order passed by a Single Judge on the commercial side of the High Court, under one or the other provision of the CPC, the judgements in HPL (India) Ltd1 and Samsung Leasing Ltd2 would seem to suggest that an appeal, to the Division Bench, would lie only where the order was relatable to Order XLIII of the CPC, we do not feel ourselves constrained by these decisions, as, in the present case, the order under challenge, before us, has been passed, not under the CPC, but under Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules. We see no reason to exclude orders passed by the learned Single Judge, exercising commercial jurisdiction, which have not been passed under any of the provisions of the CPC, from the expansive sweep of Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, within which such orders would undoubtedly stand covered. \n45. We are, therefore, not persuaded to accept the preliminary objection, of Mr. Sindhwani, regarding the maintainability of the present appeal before us. For the sake of clarity, we reiterate our reasons, thus:\n(i) OA 58/2019 was filed in CS (COMM) 665/2017. The learned Single Judge was, therefore, exercising jurisdiction under the Commercial Division of this Court. Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act would, therefore, apply. On this aspect, we may note, Mr. Sindhwani, too, is ad idem. \n(ii) Sub-section (1A) of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act allows any person, aggrieved by the judgement or order of the Commercial Division of the High Court, to appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court. Inasmuch as the learned Single Judge was sitting in the Commercial Division of this Court, while passing the impugned order dated 3rd July, 2019, the said order would be appealable to the Division Bench of this Court, on a plain reading of Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act. \n(iii) The proviso to Section 13 (1A) cannot, in our view, be read as limiting the right to appeal, conferred by Section 13 (1A). The said proviso merely states that, from orders passed by the Commercial Division of the High Court, as are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the CPC, an appeal would lie under Section 13 (1A). In our view, the proviso cannot be read as meaning that no appeal would lie in any other case, especially where the order under appeal has not been passed under the CPC at all, but under Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules. \n(iv) The judgements in HPL (India) Ltd1 and Samsung Leasing Ltd2 do not apply, as they related to appeals, against orders passed by the learned Single Judge under one or the other provision of the CPC. In such circumstances, these decisions restricted the ambit of Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, by invoking Section 104 and Order XLIII of the CPC. The case before us being relatable to an order passed under Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules, we are not persuaded to follow the decisions in HPL (India) Ltd1 and Samsung Leasing Ltd2. Judgements rendered by courts, it is trite, are not to be read as analogous to Euclids theorems, but have to be understood and applied in the light of the fact-situation, and the legal issue arising for consideration, in those cases7. \n(v) In this context, we may note that the 2018 Original Side Rules have been notified in exercise of the powers conferred, not only by Section 129 of the CPC, but by Section 7 of the Delhi High Court Act. Section 129 of the CPC permits every High Court to make such rules, not inconsistent with the Letters Patent, or order or other law establishing it, to regulate its own procedure in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, as it thinks fit. Section 7 of the Delhi High Court Act stipulates that, subject to the provisions thereof, \"the High Court shall have all such powers to make rules and others with respect to practice and procedure as are immediately before the appointed day exercisable by the High Court of Punjab and shall also have powers to make rules and orders with respect to practice and procedure for the exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction\". The Original Side Rules of this Court have, therefore, their own individual identity, distinct and different from the CPC, and we do not see any justification for applying, to an order passed under Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules, the restraints contained in Section 104, or Order XLIII, of the CPC, insofar as the availability of a remedy of appeal, against such order, under Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, is concerned. We may note, in this U.O.I. v. Major Bahadur Singh, (2006) 1 SCC 368 regard, that, over four decades ago a Full Bench of this Court had held, in Print Pak Machinery Ltd. v. Jay Kay Papers Converters8, that in the event of any conflict, the Original Side Rules prevailed over the Civil Procedure Code, 1908.\n(vi) Nor are we persuaded to non-suit the appellant, by applying Rahul Gupta3, which proceeds on the premise that the use of the word \"appeal\", in Rule 4 in Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules - whereunder the order of the learned Single Judge had been passed in that case - was a \"misnomer\". \nThe appeal before the Division Bench had, in that case, been filed under Section 10 of the Delhi High Courts Act. In our view, the said decision, irrespective of its correctness or otherwise, would not apply to the present case, as (a) the order impugned before us has been passed, not under Rule 4 in Chapter II of the 1967 Original Side Rules, but under Rule 5 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules which, yet again, uses the word \"appeal\" and (b) the appeal, before us, lies, not under Section 10 of the Delhi High Court Act, but under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, the range and sweep of which is far more expansive than that of Section 10 of the Delhi High Courts Act. \n46. We, therefore, reject the preliminary objection, of Mr. Sindhwani, to the maintainability of the present appeal, and hold the appeal to be maintainable, under Section 13(1A) of the Commercial Courts Act. \nAIR 1979 Delhi 217 Did the learned Joint Registrar act within his jurisdiction? \n47. On a plain reading of Rule 3 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules, it is apparent, in our view, that, in passing the order dated 25th April, 2019, adjudicating IA 10990/2018, the learned Joint Registrar exceeded the jurisdiction vested, in him, by the said Rule. Clause (2), in Rule 3, empowers the Registrar to adjudicate on an \"application to amend the plaint, petition, written statement, the application or subsequent proceedings where the amendment sought is formal\".\n48. We may observe, before proceeding further, that, in our view, this provision may itself require amendment, especially as, in the absence of any definition of the expression formal in the 2018 Original Side Rules, the scope and ambit of this clause is rendered completely nebulous. What is formal, and what is not? In law, as in life, the expression formal is capable of myriad interpretations, being an expression which itself is imprecise and uncertain. It would be advisable, therefore, that Clause (2), in Rule 3 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules be either more precisely worded, specifically delineating the categories of amendment applications, which the Registrar would decide, or that the expression formal is specifically defined in the Original Side Rules. Needless to say, the former alternative is, on the face of it, preferable. \n49. In this context, it is also be necessary to bear, in mind, the fact that, oftentimes, the very complexion of the litigation may change by an amendment, and applications for amendment are, at times, strategised attempts to infuse life blood into a cause which, otherwise, may be insupportable in law. The question of whether an amendment ought, or ought not, to be allowed, is a complex question, which requires the adjudicator, adjudicating the application for amendment, to acquaint himself with the entire scope, and ambit of the litigation, and the peripheries of the claim constituting the basis thereof. A reading of the impugned order, dated 3rd July, 2019, of the learned Single Judge, is itself an indicator of the number of factors, which have to be borne in mind while deciding whether an application, for amendment, ought, or ought not, to be allowed. Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC specifically empowers the Court to adjudicate on applications for amendment, which are, as a matter of course, hotly contested - the present case being a textbook example. Whether this jurisdiction ought, at all, to be delegated to the Registrar, may also be a live issue for consideration. Allowing for an appeal, against the decision of the Registrar, to the learned Single Judge may not, in every case, be a solution. \n50. Be that as it may. We are required to decide the appeal, before us, in the light of the provisions as they exist; not the provisions as they ought to be. In the absence of any definition of the word formal, as employed in clause (2) of Rule 3 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules, we have to search, elsewhere, for its meaning. \n51. P. Ramanatha Aiyars classic Advanced Law Lexicon defines formal as \"of the outward form, shape or appearance, not the matter or substance of the thing; ceremonial; required by convention; observance of form and not of the spirit.\"\n52. Of greater help, probably, is the understanding of the expression \"formal defect\", in various judicial authorities. In Somalraju v. Samanthu Sivaji Ganesh9, it was held that the expression \"formal defect\", in normal parlance, connoted defects of various kinds not affecting the merits of the case. It was further held, in the said decision, that a \"formal defect\" was \"a defect of form unrelated to the claim of the plaintiff on merits\". To the same effect was the judgement of the Full Bench of the High Court of Bombay in Ramrao Bhagwantrao v. Appanna Samage10 and of the High Court of Gujarat in Kurji Jonabhai Kolecha v. Ambalal Kanjibhai Patel11. In Tarachand Bapu Chand v. Gaibihaji Ahmed12, it was held that failure to implead parties in respect of a claim could not be regarded as a formal defect. Non-joinder of parties, similarly, was held, in Savitri Devi v. Hira Lal13, by R. S. Pathak, CJ (as he then was), not to be a \"formal defect\". In Re. a Debtor14, claiming of an amount in excess of what was due on the judgement, even though the excess was only 15 s. 6 d., arising from a miscalculation of interest, was held not to constitute a \"formal defect or irregularity\". Similarly, an omission, in a bankruptcy petition, to state the intent of the debtors departure out AIR 2009 AP 12 AIR 1940 Bom 121 (FB) AIR 1972 Guj 63 AIR 1956 Bom 632 AIR 1977 HP 91 (1908) 1 KB 684 of England, was held to be an omission of substance, and not merely formal, in Ex. p. Coates, Re. Skelton15. In Sill v. The Queen16, it was held that an allegation in an indictment, which must be proved as alleged, cannot be called 'formal'. \n53. Viewed thus, it is clear that the amendments, to para 8 of the plaint, as sought to be effected by way of IA 10880/2018, which alter the period, with effect from which the SUPERON trademark had been adopted by the respondent, and also claimed, for the first time, that the original adoption of the said trademark was by the plaintiff through Stanvac, introduced changes of substance, and not merely of form, in the original plaint. The amendment, sought by the respondent could not, therefore, be characterised as formal, within the meaning of clause (2) of Rule 3 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules. \n54. Per sequitur, the learned Joint Registrar could not have adjudicated on the merit of the said application for amendment and, in doing so, exceeded the jurisdiction vested in him by clause (2) of Rule 3 in Chapter II of the 2018 Original Side Rules. Mr. Sindhwani, we may note, did not, fairly, contest this issue beyond a point. \nThe impugned order/judgement 55. Mr. Sindhwani has, however, sought to contend that, even if the order, dated 25th April, 2019, of the learned Joint Registrar in IA 10990/2018, were to be regarded as having been issued in excess of 5 Ch. D. 979 22 L.J.M.C. 41 jurisdiction, that, by itself, would not entitle the appellant to relief, in view of the fact that the exercise of jurisdiction, by the learned Single Judge, while adjudicating OA 58/2019, by the impugned order dated 3rd July, 2019, was also original in nature, as held by this Court in Rahul Gupta3. In his submission, therefore, the invalid exercise of original jurisdiction, by the learned Joint Registrar, stood remedied by the valid exercise of the original jurisdiction, by the learned Single Judge. Seized, as we are, with the correctness of the manner in which the learned Single Judge has exercised jurisdiction, Mr. Sindhwani would submit that the excess of jurisdiction, by the learned Joint Registrar, even if it existed, had ceased to be of significance. \n56. We agree in principle, though we are hesitant to walk the Rahul Gupta3 path, for the reasons already set out, by us, in detail hereinbefore. The learned Single Judge has, in passing the impugned order dated 3rd July, 2019, in OA 58/2019, examined the merits of the prayer, of the respondent, for amendment of its plaint, independently and in detail. We agree with Mr. Sindhwani that, in view thereof, the issue of whether the learned Joint Registrar was, or was not, acting within the jurisdiction vested in him, in adjudicating IA 10990/2018, vide order dated 25th April, 2018, has lost its significance. Setting aside the impugned order, dated 3rd July, 2019, of the learned Single Judge, solely because the learned Joint Registrar had exceeded his jurisdiction while passing the order dated 25th April, 2019, would be meaningless, in our opinion, as we would be required, then, to remand IA 10990/2018, to the learned Single Judge, for decision, de novo, thereon. This, in our view, would be an entirely futile exercise, and would result in unnecessary duplication of the proceedings, especially as the learned Single Judge has already expressed his opinion, on merits, regarding the prayer, of the respondent, for amendment of its plaint. \n57. On merits, we find the impugned order/judgement, dated 3 rd July, 2019, of the learned Single Judge, to be unexceptionable. \n58. The right to amend, as confirmed by Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, has advisedly been made expansive, save and except in cases where the trial has already commenced. Order VI Rule 17 permits the Court to, at any stage of the proceedings, allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just, and specifically ordains that \"all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties\". The provision, therefore, casts a mandate, on the court, to compulsorily allow all such amendments, as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties. The proviso, to the Rule, dilutes the rigour of the Rule only in cases where the trial has already commenced, in which case the application for amendment could be allowed only if the Court comes to the conclusion that, in spite of due diligence, the party could not have raised the matter before the commencement of trial. In the present case, the proviso does not call for application, as the trial, in the suit, had not commenced, when the respondent applied for permission to amend its plaint. \n59. All that was required to be seen, therefore, was whether the amendment, sought by the plaintiff-respondent, was necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties. The controversy, between the appellant and the respondent, in the present case, was relating to alleged infringement, and passing off, by the appellant, of the registered trademark of the respondent - as the respondent would aver. Prior user is one of the essential indicia, to be examined while adjudicating such a claim of infringement and passing off. The date from which the plaintiff-respondent was using the SUPERON trademark was, therefore, fundamental to adjudication of the controversy. The amendment, sought by the respondent, in para 8 of its plaint, was with respect to the date from which the respondent could claim user of the said trademark. That, by itself, would be sufficient to justify allowing of the amendment sought by the respondent. \n60. The chagrin, expressed by Ms. Varma, at the defence of her client being irreparably prejudiced, by allowing of the amendment, is understandable, but cannot advance the case of her client, in view of the express stipulation in Order XLVII and the law that has developed with respect thereto. We may re-emphasize that, statutorily, all that Order XLVII contemplates, as relevant while adjudicating on a prayer for amendment, is whether the amendment is necessary for the purpose of determining the real controversy between the parties. \n61. The tests, postulated in Revajeetu Builders and Developers17 in this regard, are still treated as authoritative, and have been followed in numerous decisions. At the cost of repetition, we may reproduce the said tests thus :\n\"(1) Whether the amendment sought is imperative for proper and effective adjudication of the case?\n(2) Whether the application for amendment is bona fide or mala fide?\n(3) The amendment should not cause such prejudice to the other side which cannot be compensated adequately in terms of money;\n(4) Refusing amendment would infact lead to injustice or lead to multiple litigation; \n(5) Whether the proposed amendment Constitution and the order fundamentally changes the nature and character of the case? And (6) As a general rule, the court should decline amendments if a fresh suit or the appended claims would be barred by limitation on the date of application.\" \n62. Para 9 of the report in Sampath Kumar v. Ayyakannu18, is also instructive in this regard:\n\"Order 6 Rule 17 CPC confers jurisdiction on the court to allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings at any stage of the proceedings and on such terms as may be just. Such amendments as are directed towards putting forth and seeking determination of the real questions in controversy between the parties shall be permitted to be made. The question of delay in moving an application for amendment should be decided not by calculating the period from the date of institution of the suit alone but by reference to the stage to which the hearing in the suit has proceeded. Pre-trial amendments are allowed (2009) 10 SCC 84 (2002) 7 SCC 559 more liberally than those which are sought to be made after the commencement of the trial or after conclusion thereof. In the former case generally it can be assumed that the defendant is not prejudiced because he will have full opportunity of meeting the case of the plaintiff as amended. In the latter cases the question of prejudice to the opposite party may arise and that shall have to be answered by reference to the facts and circumstances of each individual case. No straitjacket formula can be laid down. The fact remains that a mere delay cannot be a ground for refusing a prayer for amendment.\" \n(Emphasis supplied) \n63. In Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal v. K.K. Modi19, the Supreme Court held, without any equivocation, thus:\n\"... The real controversy test is the basic or cardinal test and it is the primary duty of the court to decide whether such an amendment is necessary to decide the real dispute between the parties. If it is, the amendment will be allowed; if it is not, the amendment will be refused. ... It is settled by a Catena of decisions of this Court that the rule of amendment is essentially a rule of justice, equity and good conscience and the power of amendment should be exercised in the larger interest of doing full and complete justice to the parties before the court.\"\n64. The reliance, by the learned Single Judge, on the judgments of the Supreme Court Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal17 and Lakha Ram Sharma v. Balar Marketing (P) Ltd.20, is also well taken inasmuch as, in the said decisions, the Supreme Court has clarified that, while examining an application, for amendment, under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC, the court is not required to enter into the truth, or otherwise, of the averments sought to be introduced by way thereof. \n(2006) 4 SCC 385 (2008) 17 SCC 671 65. Viewed thus, we are of the opinion that the learned Single Judge cannot be faulted, in any manner, in allowing the prayer of the respondent, for permission to amend its plaint. The issue in controversy between the parties, related to infringement, or otherwise, by the appellant, of the registered trademark of the respondent, under the Trademarks Act, by usage of the trademark \"SUPERCROME\". The contention of the respondent, as the plaintiff in the suit, was that the trademark/name/label \"SUPERCROME\" was deceptively similar to the respondents trademark \"SUPERON\". Fundamental, to adjudication of such a lis, would be the dates from which the appellant, and respondent, operated their respective trademarks. The averments that the respondent sought to incorporate in para 8 of the plaint, by way of amendment thereof, sought to contend that the respondent was entitled to claim user of the \"SUPERON\" trademark from 1994. As to whether this claim was justified, or not, was outside the province of examination, by the court adjudicating the application for amendment. Equally, whether the respondent had, or had not, succeeded in adducing sufficient evidence to support its claim of user since 1994, and of the plaintiff to claim user from the time Stanvac had adopted the trademark \"SUPERCROME\", were issues which could be adjudicated only in trial. The truth, or otherwise, of the claim, of the respondent, to prior user since 1994, too, was foreign to the question of its entitlement to amend its plaint. The contentions of Ms. Varma, which revolved essentially around the justification, of the respondent, to claim prior user since 1994, when Stanvac had adopted the \"SUPERON\" trademark, and of the sufficiency of the material, relied upon by the respondent for that purpose, cannot impact, in any manner, the merits of the application, under Order VI Rule 17, preferred by the respondent. We find ourselves in complete agreement with the learned Single Judge, in his observation that, as the appellant had, during the trial, every opportunity to contest the correctness of the claim, of the respondent, of prior user of the SUPERON trademark from 1994, no prejudice would be said to have resulted, to the appellant, by allowing the respondents to so urge. At the end of the day, the court, adjudicating on an application for permission to amend the plaint, at the pre-trial stage, is to ensure that, by adopting an unduly narrow approach, the right of the party, seeking amendment, to bring relevant facts, to the notice of the court, is not prejudiced. Were the prayer for amendment, as made by the respondent, in IA 10990/2018, to be disallowed, the respondent would be deprived of an opportunity to establish, before the court adjudicating the suit, its right to claim user, of the SUPERON trademark since 1994. The prejudice that could result, to the respondent, as a consequence thereof, would be irreversible. Per contra, allowing the prayer for amendment, would result in no prejudice to the appellant, which had every opportunity to contest the claim of the respondent, to user, of the SUPERON trademark since 1994. Application of the \"prejudice\" test, too, would, therefore, justify allowing, rather than disallowing, of the amendment sought, by the respondent, in IA 10990/2018.\n66. We, therefore, find ourselves entirely in agreement with the observations entered by the learned Single Judge in para 5 of the impugned order dated 3rd July, 2019. The objections, of Ms. Varma, to the prayer of the respondent, for permission to amend para 8 of its plaint are, in our considered opinion, completely devoid of substance. \nConclusion 67. In view of the above discussion, we find no reason to interfere with the impugned order, dated 3rd July, 2019, passed by the learned Single Judge in OA 58/2019. We uphold, on merits, the decision of the learned Joint Registrar, to allow IA No. 10990/2018.\n68. The appeal, consequently, fails and is dismissed, with no orders as to costs. \n69. The pending applications, viz., CM No. 42840/2019, CM No. 42841/2019 and CM No. 230/2020 have been filed seeking stay, condonation of delay and permission to withdraw and file amended rejoinder, respectively, do not survive for adjudication and accordingly stand disposed of.\nC.

returnable forthwith. by consent, heard both the sides for final disposal. 2) arbitration appeal no. 5/2016 is filed by the contractor, at whose instance arbitrator was appointed by this court under section 11 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the act' for short). the other appeal is filed by the employer, which is state government, corporation. arbitrator had allowed all the claims of the contractor and this decision was challenged by filing misc. application (rje) no. 77/2011 by the employer in the court of principal district judge, (hereinafter referred to as 'p.d.j.' for arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 short) parbhani under the act. by the decision dated 31.12.2015, the proceeding filed under section 34 of the act by the employer is partly allowed and the award given in respect of few claims is set aside. in view of these circumstances, both the sides have challenged the decision given by the district court, parbhani. 3) for deciding the challenges raised by both the sides in the appeals, the nature of work and also the history of previous arbitration proceedings in respect of the same work needs to be mentioned. 4) the work of majalgaon right bank canal was a part of jaikwaid project. this project was in respect of construction of dam on river godavari at paithan, district aurangabad and at various places, the canals were to be constructed. tender notice of the work of majalgaon right bank canal from k.m. 72 to 87 and k.m. 88 to 99, which included earthwork (excluding earthwork at k.m. 78 to 87) lining structure, tunnel at k.m. 90 and enroute reservoir at k.m. 91 was published by the corporation. the work was allotted to the appellant from arbitration appeal no. 5/2016. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 5) the cost of the work as per the tender was rs.700.84 lakh. the work order was issued on 20.1.1990 and the period of work was fixed as 36 months from the date of work order. from time to time, the contractor applied for extension of the period and extensions were granted by the employer. the total extension of 47 months was granted, which expired in december 1996. prior to that the contractor abandoned the remaining work. initially pre-final bill was prepared and it was finalised on 14.3.1998. the amount mentioned in the final bill was accepted by the contractor without raising any protest. 6) during the execution of the work, the contractor had raised disputes as provided by general conditions of contract (hereinafter referred to as 'g.c.c.' for short) and particularly, as per the clause no. 56. these disputes were raised in the year 1995. on most of the disputes, the incharge engineer gave the decision and it was communicated to the contractor on 15.7.1995. 7) the contractor was not satisfied with the decision arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 given by the incharge chief engineer and he referred the dispute to board of arbitrators which was constituted as per clause no. 57 of the g.c.c. as per the agreement, the board was expected to deliver reasoned award. the contractor made claims under eleven heads before board of arbitrators and all the claims were contested by the employer. in all 13 claims were made by the contractor before the department, but he prosecuted 11 claims before the board of arbitrators. it is the case of contractor that the decision on claim nos. 12 and 13 was likely to be taken departmentally as per the terms and conditions of the contract and so, he had preferred not to take decision on these claims from board of arbitrators. the board of arbitrators gave award in respect of 11 claims on 27.5.1998. 8) the reference was made to board of arbitrators as per the procedure given in the agreement between the parties and the provisions of indian arbitration act, 1940 were applicable. the award was filed as per the old provisions in the court and rule was made by the court on the award. the award and the decision of the court have become final. the award of amount of rs.2,61,14,396/was given in favour of the contractor and the cost of rs. 1,21,721/was also awarded in arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 favour of the contractor. this amount was deposited in the court when the employer failed in appeal which was filed in this court to challenge the award. the appeal was dismissed on 8.7.1999. 9) no decision was given by the chief executive engineer on the aforesaid two claims which were made with the department and which were not prosecuted before the board of arbitrators by the contractor. by the letter dated 6.2.2002, first time the contractor informed to the department that he wanted to refer the dispute to arbitrator. prior to that, the incharge executive engineer and superintending engineer had rejected these claims also. 10) the contractor then gave the name of his nominee for constitution of board of arbitrators by letter dated 21.3.2002. the employer did not give the name of it's nominee who was to work as the second arbitrator. in the letter dated 21.3.2002 itself, the contractor had informed to the employer that if the employer does not appoint arbitrator, the arbitrator appointed by the contractor will work as the sole arbitrator. as per the procedure given in clause 57 of the agreement, g.c.c., the contractor had already requested the chairman of the arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 central water commission (c.w.c.) to see that the board of arbitrators is constituted. however, by the letter dated 25.3.2002, the contractor informed to the chairman that his letter dated 8.2.2002 made in aforesaid regard be ignored and action should not be taken by the chairman for constitution of the board of arbitrators. then the contractor filed a proceeding in the high court bearing no. 5/2002 for appointment of arbitrator under the provision of section 11 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. due to the aforesaid correspondence made by the contractor, the chairman of c.w.c. did not take further action. 11) the chairman of c.w.c. was not made party in the proceeding filed under section 11 of the act in the high court. this application was opposed by the employer by contending that the high court had no power and the board of arbitrators needs to be constituted as per the agreement. this court appointed retired justice shri. a.s. bhate as the sole arbitrator by the order dated 10.7.2003. the employer filed review application by contending that it was necessary to create the board of arbitrators as per the provisions of agreement and the sole arbitrator appointed by the high court cannot get arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 jurisdiction to decide the dispute. in the review application, the high court again asked the parties to supply three names by each of them. in the meantime, retried justice shri. bhate informed to the high court that he was not willing to work as sole arbitrator. this court then made appointment of one retired district judge shri. r.g. karmarkar as the sole arbitrator. the employer had objection to appointment of arbitrator under section 11 of the act, but he did not raise objection to the name of shri. karmarkar. it is the case of employer that it had not given consent for appointment of sole arbitrator and only objection was not taken to the name suggested by the high court. after making of the appointment of shri. karmarkar, as there was mention of consent of the employer in the order, application was moved by the employer for making correction and to remove that mention. the high court did not accept that contention. the application filed for correction was rejected by the high court on 4.3.2004. the order of appointment of shri. karmarkar dated 9.10.2003 and the order dated 4.3.2004 were challenged by the employer in the apex court by filing special leave to appeal. 12) the hon'ble apex court granted stay to the orders of arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 hon'ble high court on 14.3.2005. before that date, shri. karmarkar had started the proceeding. the claim statement was filed and the written statement was also filed by the employer. the employer took the defence that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction and he was not competent as his appointment was not as per the agreement. other objection was taken that the claims were barred by the principle of res-judicata and they were time barred. on merits also, the claims raised before the sole arbitrator were opposed. 13) due to stay granted by the apex court, the proceeding before shri. karmarkar remained stayed from 14.3.2005 to 28.11.2007. on 28.11.2007, the apex court disposed of the special leave to appeal with observations that the point of jurisdiction can be decided by the arbitrator himself in view of the position of law prevailing at that time. shri. karmarkar then expressed his enability to act as an arbitrator. prior to that, in the year 2004, he had passed order on objection of jurisdiction taken by the employer. the names of retired justice shri. s.c. malte and retired justice shri. s.g. mutalik were suggested by high court this time. the employer contended that such persons cannot be appointed as arbitrator arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 in view of the agreement made by the parties. this court then appointed shri. mutalik as the sole arbitrator. before shri. mutalik also, the employer took aforesaid defences and objections. the request was made to decide the point of jurisdiction first, but shri. mutalik, arbitrator expressed that this point will be decided along with the dispute. shri. mutalik fixed his fees as rs.1,00,000/for reading the papers and rs.70,000/per meeting. the order with regard to aforesaid charges and fees was also challenged by the employer, but the employer did not succeed. 14) the learned arbitrator has allowed all the claims of the contractor (7 +1 claims). it is held by the learned arbitrator that there is no bar of principle of res-judicata to the claims. though issue was framed on the point of limitation and it was clubbed with the issue of res-judicata, the award delivered by the learned arbitrator does not show that he had touched this point. the learned arbitrator has held that in view of the order made by this court under section 11 of the act, he has jurisdiction. the learned arbitrator has held that the contractor is entitled to recover the amount of rs. 11,24,60,651/with interest at the rate of 16% p.a. and has held that the interest arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 will be payable up to the period ending on 30.9.2003 and then the interest will be payable from 4.2.2004 the date of filing of the claims on the awarded amount then till the date of realisation. the cost of rs.10,00,000/was imposed by the learned arbitrator on the employer. this award was delivered on 3.4.2011. 15) in the decision given by the learned p.d.j., parbhani in application (rje) no. 77/2011, the learned p.d.j. has set aside the award of arbitrator in respect of claim nos. 2 [2a and 2b], 3, 4 and 5. the award in respect of claim nos. 1 and 6 is confirmed by the p.d.j. the claim no. 7 was in respect of interest and so, it can be said that interest is allowed in respect of the claim nos. 1 and 6. the learned p.d.j. has held that the claim nos. 2a, 2b, 4 and 5 cannot be allowed as they are hit by the principle of res-judicata. the learned p.d.j. held that claim no. 4 was time barred. the claim no. 3 is set aside by holding that there is virtually no evidence and there is no justification in awarding this claim when the award was required to be reasoned award. 16) in the present matter, in view of the contentions arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 made and the arguments advanced, following points need to be decided. (i) whether the present matters need to be decided by commercial appellate division constituted under the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high court act, 2015 ? (ii) whether the learned arbitrator shri. mutalik, retired judge of this court was competent in view of the agreement ? (iii) whether claim nos. 1, 2, 3 & 6 could have been considered by the arbitral tribunal in view of the terms and conditions of the contract ? (iv) whether the aforesaid claims [2a, 2b, 4 and 5] are hit by the principle of res-judicata ? (v) whether claim nos. 1, 4 & 6 are time barred? (vi) whether claim no. 3 was substantiated ? (vii) whether the award delivered by the learned arbitrator and the decision given by the learned p.d.j. need to be interfered with in the appeals ? point no. 1 :effect of the provisions of the commercial courts, arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 commercial division and commercial appellate division of high court act, 2015 on the jurisdiction of this court : 17) the learned counsel for contractor submitted that for aurangabad bench of this court, commercial appellate division of high court is created under the aforesaid enactment and so, the present matters need to be placed before the said court. for ascertaining as to whether this court has jurisdiction, this court has seen the scheme of the aforesaid special enactment carefully. it is true that the dispute of the present matters falls under the definition of 'commercial dispute' given under section 2(c) and the value of the dispute is more than rs. 28 crore. 18) aurangabad bench of bombay high court has no ordinary original civil jurisdiction and so, there is no commercial division of the high court at aurangabad bench. commercial appellate division for aurangabad bench came to be constituted under the aforesaid act with effect from 30.6.2016. the present proceeding was filed on 31.3.2016. the proceeding under section 34 of the act was decided by the learned p.d.j., parbhani on 31.12.2016 as \"court\" under the act. this is because first arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 time by government notification dated 30.6.2016, the government constituted commercial court at district levels including for district parbhani and high court under letter dated 14.7.2016 appointed the judges of district court as commercial courts. from the record, it can be said that for parbhani district and other districts, the commercial court actually started functioning for district places on 16.7.2016. the aforesaid special enactment was published by notification in official gazette on 31.12.2015, but the courts were constituted subsequently and the proceeding under section 34 was decided by the learned p.d.j. as the \"court\" under section 34 of the act on 31.12.2015. 19) the matters which are required to be decided by commercial appellate division are mentioned in section 13 of the aforesaid special enactment and the provision runs as under :\"13. appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions.(1) any person aggrieved by the decision of the commercial court or commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 order, as the case may be: provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1906 (5 of 1908) as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996). (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\" 20) section 3 of this special enactment shows that the state government is expected to constitute the commercial courts by notification. it is required to be published in official gazette and that was done on 30.6.2016. on the date of decision of the matter filed under section 34 of the act, commercial court was not in existence and similarly, commercial appellate division was also not in existence when the present appeals were filed in this court. the provision of section 15 takes care of the pending matters and this provision shows that only the matters which are filed or were filed under section 34 of the act and which were still pending can be arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 transferred under the provision of section 15 and they are required to be transferred either to commercial court or commercial division. neither in section 15 nor in any other provision of the special enactment, there is provision for transferring the appeals, which are filed against the decisions given by the courts as mentioned in section 34 of the act to commercial appellate division of this court. in view of this position of law, it needs to be held that present appeals need to be decided by this court as appeals filed under section 37 of the act and not by commercial appellate division of the high court. so, the point is answered accordingly. 21) on the aforesaid point, the learned counsel for contractor placed reliance on the observations made by commercial appellate division of this court at principal seat in judgment of commercial appeal no. 7 of 2016 [hubtown limited vs. idbi trusteeship service limited] decided on 24.10.2016. this court has carefully gone through the facts of this case and observations made by the commercial appellate division. the facts were totally different and the order made by the commercial division in summons for judgment was taken in appeal before the commercial appellate division. it was held arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 that appeal filed under section 13 of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015 was tenable and the order of learned single judge of commercial division in summons for judgment was set aside. the maintainability of commercial appeal was in question, but as the order of commercial division was taken in appeal such decision was given. thus, the observations made in this case are of no use to the contractor in the present matter. point no. 2 compentency of the arbitrator :22) to ascertain, whether the retired judge of the high court shri. mutalik could have been appointed as arbitrator under section 11 of the act, the provision of section 11 (relevant portion) needs to be considered first. the relevant portions are section 11(1) to 11(6), 11(8) of the act and they run as under :\"11. appointment of arbitrators. -(1) a person of any nationality may be an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. (2) subject to sub-section (6), the parties are free to agree on a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators. (3) failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (2), in an arbitration with three arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 arbitrators, each party shall appoint one arbitrator, and the two appointed arbitrators shall appoint the third arbitrator who shall act as the presiding arbitrator. (4) if the appointment procedure in subsection (3) applies and(a) a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days from the receipt of a request to do so from the other party; of (b) the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty days from the date of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the chief justice or any person or institution designated by him. (5) failing any agreement referred to in sub-section(2), in an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties fail to agree on the arbitrator within thirty days from receipt of a request by one party from the other party to so agree the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the chief justice or any person or institution designated by him. (6) where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties, (a) a party fails to act as required under that procedure; or (b) the parties, or the two appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an agreement expected of them under that procedure; or arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 (c) a person, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to him or it under that procedure, a party may request the chief justice or any person or institution designated by him to take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment. (7) . (8) the chief justice or the person or institution designated by him, in appointing an arbitrator, shall have due regard to(a) any qualifications required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties; and (b) other considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator.\" 23) in the present matters, the application under section 11 of the act was filed in the year 2002 and the appointment of retired judge of this court was made first time in the proceeding on 10.7.2003. the subsequent appointments of sole arbitrator mentioned above were made only to replace the first sole arbitrator appointed by this court. this decision was taken up to supreme court by filing special leave petition by the employer. the apex court referred the case of m/s. s.b.p & co. vs. m/s. patel engineering ltd. and anr. [air 2006 supreme arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 court 450] and held that it will be open to raise the challenge to jurisdiction of arbitrator appointed by high court before the arbitrator himself as provided in the act. in the case of s.b.p. & co. cited supra also, the apex court had made it clear that if the applications filed under section 11 of the act were already decided, it is to be presumed that in those cases, the appointments were made as per the ratio of previous case of apex court reported as m/s. konkan railway corporation ltd. and anr. vs. m/s. rani construction p. ltd. [air 2002 supreme court 778]. as the contrary view was taken in the case of s.b.p. & co., cited supra, the apex court made it clear in the case of s.b.p. & co. itself that in the matters in which arbitrators were already appointed as per the case of konkan railway corporation cited supra, in those cases all objections with regard to jurisdiction of the arbitrator need to be decided under section 16 of the act. this position of law needs to be kept in mind while applying the provisions of section 11(1) to 11(6) of the act to the present matters. thus, the point of competency of the arbitrator is open in the present matter. in view of the provision of section 16 (6) of the act read with provision of section 34 (2) (v) of the act, this point could have been considered by the arbitrator and also the district court. in arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 the appeal, this point can be again considered. 24) if the provisions of section 11(2) and 11(6) of the act are read together, they show that if there is agreement over the procedure for appointment of arbitration and the procedure provides other means for securing the appointment, the power under section 11(6) of the act cannot be used. 25) the provision of section 11(2) of the act shows that this provision is subject to the provision of section 11(6) of the act and so, if there is already agreement on procedure, there cannot be new agreement on procedure by the parties to appoint the arbitrator. similarly, if there is agreement on procedure available, the provisions of sections 11 (3), 11 (4), 11 (5) cannot be used as those provisions are to take care of the situation where there is no agreement on the procedure to appoint arbitrator. it needs to be kept in mind that in section 11(6) of the act, there are two parts. the first part relates to the lacuna in the procedure agreed. due to such lacuna, if even after following the procedure the arbitrator cannot be appointed, then the court can take necessary measures as mentioned in those provisions of law to see that arbitrator is appointed. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 however, the second part relates to the situation where there is the procedure, and due to the failure on the part of the one or more parties or due to other situation mentioned in clauses (b) (c) of section 11(6) of the act, the arbitrator is not appointed, but there is the procedure to take care of such situation and by following that procedure the arbitrator can be appointed. in the present matters, procedure mentioned in second part of section 11(6) of the act was available. 26) clause no. 57 of the g.c.c. between the parties reads as under :\"57. arbitration : (1) all disputes or differences in respect of which the decision, if any, of the engineer or employer has not become final and binding as aforesaid, shall on the initiative of either party in dispute be referred to the adjudication of three arbitrators. one arbitrator is to be nominated by the employer, one by the contractor and the third by the president of the international chamber of commerce, in the case of foreign contractors and chairman, central water commission in the case of local contractors. if either of the parties fail to appoint its arbitrator within sixty days after receipt of notice for the appointment of an arbitrator then the president of the international chamber of arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 commerce or the chairman, central water commission as the case may be, shall appoint an arbitrator. a certified copy of the appointment made by the 'president'/'chairman' shall be furnished to both parties. (2) the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of conciliation and arbitration of the international chamber of commerce, paris in the case of foreign contractors and provisions of indian arbitration act 1940 or any statutory modifications thereof in the case of local contractors and shall be held in either case at such place and time in india as the arbitrators may determine. the decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties and the expenses of the arbitrators shall be paid as may be determined by the arbitrators. (3) the said arbitrator/s shall have full power to open up, revise and review any decision, opinion, direction, certificate or valuation by the engineer, neither party shall be limited in the proceedings before such arbitrator/s to the evidence or arguments put before the engineer for the purpose of obtaining his said decision. no decision given by the engineer in accordance with the foregoing provisions shall disqualify him from being called as a witness and giving evidence before the arbitrator/s on any matter whatsoever relevant to the dispute or difference referred to the arbitrator/s as aforesaid. the reference to arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 arbitration may proceed notwithstanding that the works shall not then be or be alleged to be complete provided always that the obligations of the employer, the engineer and the contractor shall not be altered by reason of the arbitration being conducted during the progress of the works. (4) performance under the contract shall, if reasonably possible, continue during the arbitration proceedings and payments due to the contractor by the employer shall bot be withheld, unless they are the subject matter of the arbitration proceedings. (5) all awards shall be in writing and in case of claims equivalent to rupees one hundred thousand or more, such awards shall state reason for the amounts awarded. (6) neither party is entitled to bring a claim to arbitration if its arbitrator has not been appointed by thirty days after the expiration of the maintenance period. (7) the term 'indian contractor' shall include indian firm or group of indian firms and joint venture consortia eligible for price preference as domestic tenderer.\" clause no. 57 (1) shows that the authority mentioned in the clause viz. the chairman of c.w.c. was having power to appoint the sole arbitrator if both or either party had failed to nominate arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 the arbitrator as provided in first part of this clause. in the first arbitral proceeding, both the sides had appointed their nominees and the third arbitrator was appointed by chairman of c.w.c. thus, in the present matter also, it was possible to use this procedure. infact reference was already made to the chairman of c.w.c. and the matter was pending before the chairman for consideration. it is the contractor, who had written to the chairman of c.w.c. to inform that he was not interested in getting the arbitrator appointed as per this clause as he wanted to move high court under section 11 of the act. this fact of the present matter and the position of law already quoted are sufficient to hold that retired justice shri. mutalik could not have been appointed as arbitrator under section 11 by this court. both the learned arbitrator and the court under section 34 of the act have committed error in holding that retired justice shri. mutalik was appointed as per the provisions made in law. this single ground is sufficient to set aside the entire award delivered by the learned arbitrator. so, the point no. 2 is answered accordingly. 27) on the aforesaid point, the learned counsel for employer placed reliance on the observations made by the arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 supreme court in the case reported as 2016 (4) mh.l.j. 101 [huawei technologies company ltd. vs. sterlite technologies ltd.]. in this case, the apex court has considered the provisions of section 11 and 15 (2) of the act and has laid down that the term 'rules' mentioned in section 15 (2) relates to the provisions made in the agreement for appointment of arbitrator. it is laid down that on every occasion including for occasion of filling vacancy of arbitrator, the rules in that regard need to be followed. there cannot be dispute over this proposition and this court has quoted the relevant portion of the agreement mentioned in the procedure for appointment of arbitrator. 28) the learned counsel for respondent/contractor placed reliance on the observations made by the supreme court in civil appeal no. 6275/2014 [north eastern railway & ors. vs. tripple engineering works] decided on 13.8.2014. in this case and also in the case reported as 2013 (2) arb.l.r. 105 (sc) [m/s. deep trading company vs. m/s. indian oil corporation and ors.], the apex court has discussed the provision of section 11 and has laid down that when one party forfeited right to appoint his nominee for arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 constitution of arbitral tribunal, it is not open to the said party to say that the arbitrator cannot be appointed under section 11 of the act. the facts of the two reported cases show that due to failure of one party to nominate his arbitrator, it was not possible to constitute the arbitral tribunal. in view of that circumstance, the apex court laid down that the provision of section 11 can be used. the facts of the present matter are totally different and this court has already observed that even after failure of one or both the parties, the arbitrator could have been appointed by the agency mentioned in the agreement. in the present matter, the contractor avoided to get constituted the tribunal from the said agency, the chairman of c.w.c. the relevant portion of section 11 of the act is also discussed in this regard and so, the observations made by the apex court in these two cases are of no use to the contractor. point no. 3 :29) under this point, this court is discussing all the remaining points like point of limitation, point of res-judicata, point of excepted matters and to some extent the merits of the claim. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 30) the relevant facts of the dispute between the parties are already quoted and they show that while before december 1996, the contractor had abandoned the work, though the period for execution of work was expected by the department till december 1996. in the year 1995, only 13 claims were raised by the contractor before the employer as per the procedure given in clause 56 of g.c.c. out of the said 13 claims, the contractor preferred to get decision from board of arbitrators on 11 claims. as per the record, pre-final bill was prepared on 30.6.1996 and then the final bill was prepared and singed on 14.3.1998. in view of the aforesaid facts, it can be said that no more work was expected when pre-final bill and final bill were signed by the parties. these bills were accepted by the contractor without raising any protest. these circumstances need to be kept in mind while deciding the point of limitation, and the point of res-judicata. in spite of these circumstances, the contractor raised new claims which were five in numbers before the second arbitrator. it can be said that there is no record with the contractor in respect of these new five claims to show that they were made under the procedure given under the agreement and particularly, clause no. 56 of the agreement. the award prepared by the learned arbitrator in the present arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 matter shows that the learned arbitrator considered one way correspondence allegedly made by the contractor with the department for presuming that these new claims were raised and they were pending with the department. it is already observed that only 13 claims were raised as per the procedure and the contractor had preferred to take final decision on two claims departmentally and he had filed claims statement in respect of remaining 11 claims before the board of arbitrators (first arbitration). the award delivered by the learned arbitrator in the present matter shows that there was virtually non application of mind and the learned arbitrator virtually accepted all the contentions made by the contractor as they were without considering the effect of the principle of res-judicata, limitation and also the presence or absence of the material with regard to actual work done. there are many points, on the basis of which it can be said that the arbitrator had not considered the basic concepts like res-judicata and for instance issue no. 6a can be quoted in that regard. \"6a] does the claimant prove that he is entitled to for payment of interest @ 16% p.a. from 1302-1993 to 15-7-1995 on all sums awarded under the award dated 27-05-1998 ?\" fortunately, in the reasoning other point is considered and decided. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 31) the provision with regard to the procedure to raise the claims and to make reference to arbitration can be found in clause nos. 56 and 57 of g.c.c. clause no. 57 is already quoted. clause no. 56 runs as under :\"56. settlement of disputes :if any dispute or difference of any kind whatsoever shall arise between the engineer or employer and the contractor in connection with, or arising out of the contract, or the execution of the works, whether during the progress of the works or after their completion and whether or after the termination, abandonment or breach of the contract, it shall, in the first place, be referred to and settled by the engineer-in-charge who shall, within a period of thirty days after being requested by the contractor to do so give written notice of his decision to the contractor. upon receipt of the written notice on decision of the engineer the contractor shall promptly proceed without delay to comply with such notice for decision. if the engineer-in-charge fails to give notice of his decision in writing within a period of thirty days after being requested, or if the contractor is dissatisfied with the notice of decision of the engineer-in-charge the contractor may within thirty days after receiving notice of decision arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 appeal to the superintending engineer, who shall afford an opportunity to the contractor to be heard and to offer evidence in support of his appeal. the superintending engineer shall give notice of his decision within a period of thirty days after the contractor has given the said evidence in support of his appeal. subject to arbitration, as hereinafter provided, such decision of the superintending engineer in respect of every matter so referred shall be final and binding upon the contractor and shall forthwith be given effect to by the contractor, who shall proceed with the execution of the works with all due diligence whether he requires arbitration, as hereinafter provided, or not. if the superintending engineer has given written notice of his decision to the contractor and no claim to arbitration has been communicated to him by the contractor within a period of thirty days from receipt of such notice, the said decision shall remain final and binding upon the contractor. if the superintending engineer shall fail to give notice of his decision as aforesaid within a period of thirty days after being requested as aforesaid, or if the contractor be dissatisfied with any such decision, then and in any such case the contractor within thirty-days after receiving notice of such decision, or within thirty days after the expiration of the first-named period of thirty days, as the case may be, appeal to chief engineer who shall afford an opportunity arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 to the contractor to be heard and to offer evidence in support of his appeal. the chief engineer shall give decision within a period of thirty days after the contractor has given evidence in support of his appeal. if the contractor is dissatisfied with this decision, the contractor within a period of thirty days from receipt of decision shall indicate his intention to refer the dispute to arbitration, failing which the said decision shall be final and conclusive.\" in view of the wording of clause no. 56, it was necessary for the contractor to presume that his two claims, out of aforesaid 13 claims, were not accepted by the department. this presumption is necessary as for every stage, the period is fixed in clause no. 56. if he had taken the matter up to chief engineer and the decisions were given against him by the incharge engineer and superintending engineer, then after expiry of period of 30 days from raising the grievance before the chief engineer, it was necessary for the contractor to presume that the department was not accepting the remaining two claims. it can be said that the contractor took the risk by presuming that he will be getting the remaining two claims settled departmentally and the contractor did not stake claims under the two heads before the board of arbitrators. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 32) it is already observed that so far as the remaining five claims are concerned from the present matter, they were not prosecuted as per the procedure given in clause no. 56 and so, it can be said that these claims were never raised during the execution of the work. even if it is presumed that in the year 1995, the contractor had made correspondence with regard to new claims, in that case also the contractor ought to have prosecuted the matter under clause no. 56 of g.c.c. thus, it needs to be inferred that the cause of action had already arisen at the end of year 1995 in respect of the new claims also. 33) clause 57 (6) of g.c.c. shows that matter needs to be referred to arbitration within 30 days after expiration of the maintenance period. clause 5 of g.c.c. provides for maintenance and defect liability period. this period was 180 days from the certified date of completion. it is already observed that contractor had abandoned the work and there was no question of issuing certificate of completion. the record shows that the contractor never attempted to obtain completion certificate to get absolved himself from the liability mentioned in clause 5 of g.c.c. if the work was not completed, then it can be arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 said that the period mentioned in clause 5 can be counted from the date of final bill. as final bill was signed by the contractor without protest on 14.3.1998, the period of limitation started to run after expiry of 180 days from 14.3.1998. 34) the amendment to section 28 of the contract act, which made agreement void if the agreement was limiting the limitation period provided by general law came in to force with effect from 8.1.1997. in view of clause no. 5 of g.c.c. if it is presumed that benefit of amended provision of the contract act needs to be given to the contractor, in that case also, the period of limitation started to run after completion of 180 days from 14.3.1998. if this amendment is not made applicable, then the period had started to run as provided in clause 56 of g.c.c. thus, even if the best possible case for the contractor is accepted, he ought to have raised the dispute within three years from 14.9.1998 (14.3.1998 + 180 days). 35) for all the claims decided in the present matter, it can be said that the contractor took steps first time in the year 2002 by filing proceeding under section 11 of the act. he filed the claim before arbitrator appointed by this court in the year arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 2003. due to these circumstances, this court has no hesitation to hold that all the claims decided by the learned arbitrator in the present matter were time barred. 36) so far as the point of res-judicata is concerned, following points need to be kept in mind. not only the principle of res-judicata, but the principle of constructive res-judicata also needs to be used in such matters. the contention of waiver was made at all the stages for the employer. (i) the board of arbitrators came to be constituted on 17.1.1996 and it had given direction to both the sides to file statement of claims. (ii) the first meeting of board of arbitrators was held on 4.11.1996 and on that date, the decision was taken as to which claims will be decided. thus, it was open to the contractor to file the claims decided in the present matter before the board of arbitrators also. in spite of these circumstances, the contractor preferred not to file the claims before the board of arbitrators in the first arbitration. 37) the board of arbitrators had given award on arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 following claims :(i) revised rates for work executed after the original scheduled period viz. for the work executed after 20.1.1993. the new rate was fixed by the board of arbitrators as per the contract formula accepted in the agreement by the parties viz. as per the price indices as on 20.1.1993. this additional amount was given as compensation for delay caused for execution of the work. (ii) revised rates for extra items exceeding 30% of the work over the tender quantities. the revised rates were given in respect of this work done also even prior to 20.1.1993. similarly, under this head the revised rate was given in respect of work done after 20.1.1993. (iii) damages on account of recovery of amount as security deposit from running bills and interest at the rate of 16% p.a. is given on such amount. thus, the claim of compensation in respect of retension of money by the department during the work period was placed before the board of arbitrators for consideration. the board of arbitrators could have considered the present arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 claim of getting interest on amount of bank guarantee for the period starting from 20.1.1993. but, this point was not raised. (iv) the payment of rs.1.5 per bag cement was awarded as the difference of rate as there was contract to supply cement in jute bags to the contractor by the employer and the cement was supplied in polythene bags. (v) interest on all the amount due and demanded in claims at the rate of 16% p.a. from the date of occurrence till the date of realisation. the board of arbitrators has awarded interest on the amount which was due to the contractor prior to 10.7.1995 and also on the amount which became payable on 15.7.1995. these dates are with regard to the demands made by the contractor under clause 56 of g.c.c. similarly past and pendente-lite interest with reference to the date 4.11.1996, the date of first hearing of the board of arbitrators is granted at the rate of 16% p.a. further, the order was made by board of arbitrators that if the amount was not paid within two months from the date of the award delivered by the board of arbitrators, the arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 department was liable to pay the interest at the rate of 18% p.a. this item again shows that it was open to the contractor to claim interest in respect of all the amounts which were due to him, according to him, before the board of arbitrators. 38) the board of arbitrators had rejected the following claims made by the contractor :(i) loss of over heads and profits due to delay. this was done as revised rate was given for entire work done after 20.1.1993 by the board of arbitrators. (ii) the compensation for extra lead charges for cut spoils disposed of at the distant location. this claim was rejected with reference to clauses of g.c.c. and special terms and conditions of the contract. (iii) the extra rate for hard rock excavation in canal section. this claim was rejected as the contractor failed to prove that there was any such agreement. under this item, the present claim of control blasting could have been considered and it can be said that it needs to be presumed that such claim was considered. (iv) compensation for idle machinery and idle labour arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 charges due to stoppage of work for the same period. this claim was rejected as the contractor failed to prove that at any time, his labour and machinery remained idle and so, on merit it was rejected. (v) payment of rehandling charges for casing material of k.m. 90 spoils used for embankment of entire reservoir. this claim was rejected on the basis of the material available and terms and conditions of the contract. (vi) extra item of every overcuts of hard rock at k.m. 89 and 90 beyond normal pay line and also back filling of the same. this is also rejected on merits and it can be said that present item and control blasting could have been raised under this claim also by the contractor. 39) aforesaid circumstances show that all the so called extra items except the two claims which were specifically withdrawn by the contractor were placed before the board of arbitrators, first arbitration. the following were the two items which were specifically withdrawn by the contractor. (i) hard rock excavation involving controlled arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 blasting. it was the case of contractor that radius was changed due to geography and existence of the structures in the vicinity. on this point also, it needs to be observed that as per the terms and conditions of contract, it was necessary for the contractor to visit the site and make assessment, estimate before quoting rate. these things ought to have been inspected by the contractor. the learned arbitrator in the present matter has not considered this aspect of the matter. the board of arbitrators had considered this aspect. (ii) extra quarrying and transport charges for stone and metals for concrete work and also for work of filling. it is the case of contractor that useful stones were not available along with canal line and he was required to bring that material from the other place, k.m. 91. the work was to be done from k.m. 72 to 87 and 88 to 99. here only it needs to be observed that the learned arbitrator has not touched the record of sites already informed by the employer. the learned arbitrator has decided this point only on the basis of quantities used in the work and it is presumed that these quantities were brought from distant place when arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 no material whatsoever was produced by the contractor to show that this material was in fact brought from distant place. 40) the discussion already made and the material show that the work of controlled blasting was executed in the year 1994-95. it is already observed that it was necessary for the contractor to presume that the department was not accepting this claim as extra item and so, it was necessary for the contractor to refer this claim to arbitration. this opportunity was there to the contractor when the board of arbitrators was constituted, but he preferred to virtually withdrawn the claim. same can be said in respect of the other claim, extra item of stone and metals. 41) before the learned arbitrator from the present matter, the contractor had made in all 7 claims which included the aforesaid two claims. the department took the defence that already revised rate was given to the contractor by the board of arbitrators in the past and the new claims were not raised before the arbitrator. it was submitted for the employer that the agreement did not provide for separate or additional charges arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 even in respect of the controlled blasting. the defence was taken that there was no prior approval of incharge engineer with regard to controlled blasting. as already observed, like point of res-judicata, the point of limitation was also there. 42) so far as the item of controlled blasting is concerned, the attention of the learned arbitrator was drawn to the clause 2.16 of second volume of agreement. this clause provides for execution of hard rock chiseling/control blasting. it is the case of employer that the tender rates were fixed after preparing estimates on the basis of survey done by the department and the contractor had accepted the rate and so, it was not open to him to claim additional rate or as extra item. the attention of the learned arbitrator was drawn to clause no. 2.16.2 of the second volume showing that when the control blasting was not permissible in the zone of 100 meters directly below transmission line, the contractor ought to have resorted to pneumatic rock breakers or chiseling. in view of this clause, it was necessary for the contractor to first take permission of the employer if he wanted to do the control blasting under transmission lines. it is not the case of contractor that such permission was granted by the employer to him. for this reason arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 also, nothing could have been given by the learned arbitrator under this head to the contractor. it can be said that it was not agreed item. even when arbitral tribunal has held that permission was not granted by the employer, the claim is allowed by the arbitrator. 43) so far as the claim no. 2 which was withdrawn by the contractor in the past when the board of arbitrators was constituted is concerned viz. the claim of extra quarrying and transport of stones/metals, the attention of the learned arbitrator was drawn to clause no. 20 of g.c.c. and clause no. 5.6 of the special terms and conditions of the contract. the sites where quarries could have been taken were already informed and it was made clear that if the material available at those quarries was not sufficient, the contractor was to make his own arrangement at own cost of such material. the clauses show that the contractor was expected to spend for construction of road also for transport of such material. even if the case of contractor that he was required to collect the material at k.m. 91 could have been considered by ignoring the aforesaid clauses of agreement, then also it was necessary for the contractor to substantiate that claim. the award delivered by the arbitrator arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 shows that he did not refer to the drawings and maps annexed with the tender record showing the quarries. the learned arbitrator did not ask the contractor to produce the record which is ordinarily created like payment of royalty in respect of such material to the revenue department. surprisingly, the learned arbitrator has granted the claim by presuming that the quantities actually used was required for work and so, the contractor must have transported this quantity from the place which he has contended. the contractor himself has admitted that some material was available at the other quarries which were not that away from the site of work, but the contractor has not given the exact quantity of the material recovered from those sites by producing record of royalty and other record. these circumstances show that most casual approach was shown by the learned arbitrator and even when there was no material to substantiate the claim, the learned arbitrator has granted the claim and so award on such claim cannot sustain in law. the arbitral tribunal has not referred clause no. 5.7 of the special terms and conditions. thus, there was no material with the contractor to substantiate the claim under this head and the contractor had virtually failed to substantiate this claim and the court has rightly set aside the claim under this head. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 44) the decision of the learned arbitrator of granting claims under issue no. 3a, 3b, 4a and 4b viz. revised rates for entire quantities of work executed after 20.1.1993 and for quantities which were less than 70% of the tender quantity show that there was virtually non application of mind. it is already mentioned that the board of arbitrators had given revised rates to the contractor by presuming that delay was caused to the employer, but the learned arbitrator has again given compensation under this head. even if, the board of arbitrators had not given such compensation, in that case also, the decision of the board of arbitrators had become final on that point as this point was raised before the board of arbitrators and so, there was bar of principle of res-judicata for granting these claims. from this angle, the learned arbitrator has not considered these claims. thus, the award on such claims cannot sustain in law. 45) the claim in respect of excess price allegedly paid by the contractor for sand mentioned in issue nos. 5a and 5b is similar to the claim in respect of other material like rubble, arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 metal etc. it was the responsibility of the contractor as per the clause 20 of g.c.c. and clause 5.6 of special terms and conditions of the contract to procure the sand. this aspect of the agreement is not at all considered by the learned arbitrator and compensation is granted under this head. such award cannot sustain in law. 46) the claim in respect of interest under issue no. 6a viz. interest on bank guarantee could not have been awarded by the arbitrator. clause no. 10.3 of the special terms and conditions of the contract shows that it was necessary for the contractor to keep such bank guarantee with the employer during the period of execution of work. as per this clause, bank guarantee was to remain with the employer and it was to be released only after completion of the work and settlement of the account. thus, the learned arbitrator has committed grave error in awarding interest on the bank guarantee in the present matter. if issue nos. 6a, 6b and 7 are read, which were framed by the learned arbitrator, it can be said that the learned arbitrator had not applied mind even for framing the issues. for these reasons, the award on claims under this head needs to be set aside. arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 47) issue no. 12 framed by the learned arbitrator was about entitlement of the contractor to get compensation, revision of rates and specific relief at the same time. as already observed, claims were considered by the board of arbitrators and decision was given by the board of arbitrators on this point. this point appears to be separately considered by the learned arbitrator and it can be said that it was not necessary for the learned arbitrator to decide this issue in view of the decision given by the board of arbitrators. this issue could not have been considered separately as it had connection with other claims. 48) the decision given under section 34 of the act by the learned p.d.j., parbhani shows that the award in respect of claim nos. 2 to 5 is set aside and for the reasons given by the 'court' and by this court, it is not possible to interfere in the said decision of the p.d.j. the p.d.j. has however confirmed the award given on claim nos. 1 and 6. but the award given in respect of those claims also cannot sustain in law in view of the discussion already made. 49) the learned counsel for employer placed reliance on arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 the observations made by the apex court in the case reported as 2016 (8) scale 779 [union of india and anr. vs. indusind bank ltd. and anr.]. this case is on the interpretation of provision of section 28 of the contract act as amended in the year 1997. the apex court has laid down that the provision has prospective effect. this court has quoted the relevant terms and conditions of the agreement and the best possible case for contractor is considered. in spite of such consideration, this court has come to the conclusion that it is not possible to hold that the contractor took action for enforcement of his so called right within prescribed period of three years from the date of cause of action. thus, even if the observations made in this case are ignored in view of the terms and conditions of the contract, the contractor cannot succeed in the matter. however, there cannot be dispute over the proposition made by the hon'ble apex court in this matter. 50) on the point of interest claimed on the bank guarantee amount, the learned counsel for employer placed reliance on the observations made by the apex court in the case reported as 2016 (3) mh.l.j. 1 [union of india vs. bright power projects (india) pvt. ltd. in the case decided by three arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 hon'ble judges of the apex court, it is made clear that when there is agreement that no interest would be awarded to the contractor, the arbitral tribunal cannot award interest. the apex court has referred the provision of section 31 (7)(a) of the act, which runs as under :\"31(7)(a) unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and in so far as an arbitral award is for the payment of money, the arbitral tribunal may include in the sum for which the award is made interest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, on the whole or any part of the money, for the whole or any part of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made.\" 51) the facts of the reported case show that there was the claim in respect of interest on security deposit, earnest money and also on other amount, but in view of the agreement that no interest would be payable, the apex court held that arbitral tribunal could not have awarded interest. on the other hand, the learned counsel for respondent placed reliance on the observations made by the apex court in the case reported as air 1985 sc 607 [hyderabad municipal corporation vs. m. krishnaswami mudaliar]. in this case decided by two hon'ble judges of the apex court, the work was abandoned and arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 in view of the claim made by the contractor under the interest act, in that case, the apex court held that granting of interest was possible. the facts were different and further, there is the case cited supra viz. 2016 (3) mh.l.j. 1 [union of india vs. bright power projects (india) pvt. ltd. decided by the three judges of the honble apex court showing that arbitrator is not expected to give award which will be against the terms and conditions of the agreement. in the present matter, relevant facts are considered by this court and relevant portion of the agreement is already quoted and so, the finding is given that the contractor is not entitled to get interest on the bank guarantee. 52) the learned counsel for respondent placed reliance on the observations made by the apex court in the cases reported as 2014 (4) arb.lr 307 (sc) [associate builders vs. delhi development authority] and 2014 (4) arb.lr 1 (sc) [swan gold mining ltd. vs. hindustan copper ltd.]. the apex court has laid down that ordinarily when view expressed by the arbitrator on facts is possible view, the decision of the arbitrator given on factual aspect cannot be disturbed by the court. however, the observations show that such award needs to be based on evidence given to substantiate arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 the claim and it should be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract and it should not be against the law. there cannot be dispute over the proposition. only to that extent, this court has considered the challenge against the award. 53) in view of the aforesaid discussion made by this court, this court holds that point nos. (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) need to be answered against the contractor and they are answered accordingly. 54) so, this court holds that the proceeding filed by the department, employer needs to be allowed and entire award of the learned arbitrator needs to be set aside. similarly, the decision given by the learned p.d.j. of conforming the award in respect of claim nos. 1 and 6 needs to be set aside. in the result, following order :order (i) arbitration appeal no. 6/2016 of the employer is allowed. the entire award delivered by the learned arbitrator is hereby set aside and the claims stand rejected. the decision given by the learned p.d.j., parbhani in proceeding filed under arb.appeal nos.6 & 5/16 section 34 of the act, by which award in respect of claim no. 1 and 6 is confirmed, is also set aside and the entire proceeding filed under section 34 of the act by the employer stands allowed. (ii) arbitration appeal no. 5/2016 of the contractor stands dismissed. (iii) civil applications filed in both the matters are disposed of. (iv) parties to bear their own cost throughout.
