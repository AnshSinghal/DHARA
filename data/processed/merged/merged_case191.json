SHAH) RULE. Shri Harshrajsinh Vaghela, learned Advocate waives service  of notice of Rule on behalf of the respondent. \n[1.0] By way of this petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution  of India, the petitioner - Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (hereinafter  referred   to   as   \"Corporation\")   has   prayed   for   an   appropriate   writ,  direction and order to quash and set aside the impugned order dated  31.05.2018 passed by the learned Commercial Court, City Civil Court,  Ahmedabad   in   Civil   Misc.   Application   No.37/2018   as   well   as   the  impugned   order   dated   09.05.2018   passed   by   the   learned   Arbitral  Tribunal  below application  Exh.17  of  the  Arbitration  and Conciliation  Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"Arbitration Act\"). \n[2.0] The facts leading to the present Special Civil Application in nut shell and the chronology of events and dates are as under: \n[2.1] That the respondent, being successful bidder of the Tender Inquiry  No.D16BC16023 was awarded the contract on 10.02.2017 for hiring the  services for one Mobile Air Compressor on the offered period of 5 years  at Ahmedabad Asset of the petitioner Corporation and according to him  the contract was executed between the petitioner Corporation and the  respondent  on  07.04.2017.  That the  contract agreement  provided  the  termination clause viz. Clause No.18 which read as under: \n\"18. TERMINATION 18.1 Termination on expiry of the CONTRACT This   Agreement   shall   be   deemed   to   have   been  automatically   terminated   on   the   expiry   of   the  CONTRACT period unless the ONGC has exercised its  option to extend this CONTRACT in accordance with  the provisions, if any, of this CONTRACT. \n18.2 Termination on account of force majeure  Either   party   shall   have   the   right   to   terminate   this  CONTRACT on account of Force Majeure, as set forth  in clause 23. \n18.3 Termination on account of insolvency In the event the CONTRACTOR or its collaborator at  any time during the term of this Agreement becomes  insolvent or makes a voluntary assignment of its assets  for   the   benefit   of   creditors   or   is   adjudged   bankrupt,  then the ONGC shall, by a notice in Writing have the  right   to   terminate   the   CONTRACT   and   all   the  CONTRACTOR's rights and privileges hereunder, shall  stand terminated forthwith.\n18.4 Termination for unsatisfactory performance If   the   ONGC   considers   that   the   performance   of   the  CONTRACTOR   is   unsatisfactory   or,   not   upto   the  expected   standard,   the   ONGC   shall   notify   the  CONTRACTOR   in   writing   and   specify   in   detail   the  cause of such dissatisfaction. The ONGC shall have the  option to terminate this Agreement by giving 30 days  notice   in   writing   to   the   CONTRACTOR,   if,  CONTRACTOR In view of the above, present Second  Appeal fails and the same deserves to be dismissed and  is, accordingly, dismissed.   No costs.   to comply with  the   requisitions   contained   in   the   said   written   notice  issued by the ONGC.\n18.5 Termination for delay in mobilisation Successful   bidder   shall   be   required   to   mobilise  complete   equipment   alongwith   crew   (only  manpower   /   crew   in   case   of   Operation   and  Maintenance Contracts) for commencement of services  at   the   specified   site   &   completion   thereof   within   a  maximum number of 180 days from the date of NOA.  If   the   CONTRACTOR   (successful   bidder)   fails   to  mobilise as above, ONGC shall have, without prejudice  to   any   other   clause   of   the   CONTRACT,   the   right   to  terminate the contract. \n18.6 Consequences of termination In   all   cases   of   termination   herein   set   forth,   the  obligation of the ONGC to pay shall be limited to the  period upto the date of termination. Notwithstanding  the   termination   of   this   Agreement,   the   parties   shall  continue   to   be   bound   by   the   provision   of   this  Agreement   that   reasonably   require   some   action   or  forbearance after such termination.\n  In   case   of   termination   of   Contract   herein   set  forth, except under 18.1 and 18.2, and / or annulment  of the contract due to nonsubmission of Performance  Security (as  per  clause  36 of  Annexure1), following  actions shall be taken against the Contractor. \ni. ONGC   shall   conduct   an   inquiry   against   the  Contractor   and   consequent   to   the   conclusion   of   the  inquiry, if it is found that the fault is on the part of the  Contractor,   then   they   shall   be   put   on   holiday   (i.e.  neither   any   tender   enquiry   will   be   issued   to   such   a  Contractor   by   ONGC   against   any   type   of   tender   nor  their   offer   will   be   considered   by   ONGC   against   any  ongoing tender(s) where contract between ONGC and  that particular Contractor (as a bidder) has not been  concluded) for a period of two years from the date the  order for putting the Contractor on holiday is issued.  However, the action taken by ONGC for putting that  Contractor   on   holiday   shall   not   have   any   effect   on  other ongoing contract(s), if any, with that Contractor  which shall continue till expiry of their term(s).\nii. Pending  completion  of  the  enquiry  process  for  putting the Contractor on holiday, ONGC shall neither  issue any tender enquiry to the defaulting Contractor  nor shall consider their offer in any ongoing tender.\"\n[2.2] That   as   per   Clause   2   of   the   Notification   of   award   /   contract  agreement the respondent was required to supply the new Mobile Air  Compressor   and   as   per   Clause   3,   the   respondent   Corporation   was  supposed to mobilize compressor, manpower etc. within 180 days from  the date of issue of the NOA and the said mobilization was supposed to  be offered by 19.08.2017. That vide communication dated 09.08.2017,  the respondent Company sought extension of mobilization period upto  23.08.2017   and   the   same   was   extended   upto   23.08.2017,   subject   to  certain conditions. It appears that the respondent Company addressed  one another letter to the Corporation for extension of mobilization to  07.09.2017   which   also   came   to   be   granted   vide   its   letter   dated  01.09.2017. That vide communication dated 31.08.2017 the respondent  Company addressed a letter  to the  Corporation  supplying  information  regarding readiness of Mobile Air Compressor for deployment. It is the  case   on   behalf   of   the   petitioner   Corporation   that   the   Corporation  appointed a Committee for inspection of hard Mobile Air Compressor as  provided   in   the   contract   Agreement   on   05.09.2017.   According   to   the  petitioner, the said Committee for inspection, inspected the Mobile Air  Compressor offered by the respondent Company and prepared its report  on 07.09.2017, whereby it was found that the Mobile Air Compressor  offered by the respondent Company is not new one, as claimed by the  respondent   Company.   Therefore,   according   to   the   petitioner  Corporation,   the   Mobile   Air   Compressor   offered   by   the   respondent  Company was not as per the bid submitted by the respondent Company  and   as   per   the   contract   entered   into   by   it.   Therefore,   the   petitioner  Corporation   addressed   a   communication   dated   12.09.2017   to   the  respondent   Company,   sending   therewith   a   detailed   report   of   the  Committee   for   inspection  inter   alia  indicating   that   the   equipments   in  question were damaged, old and in poor condition. That the respondent  Company   addressed   a   communication   dated   19.09.2017   to   the  Corporation, indicating Corporation that they are sending the equipment  to   the   manufacturers   at   Sonepat   to   resolve   the   issues   and   has   also  requested the Corporation to sent its representatives to inspect the MAC  at   Sonepat.   According   to   the   petitioner   Corporation,   the   respondent  Company   offered   reinspection   after   removing   the   MAC.   That   the  Corporation   addressed   a   communication   dated   25.09.2017   to   the  respondent   Company   stating   that   the   inspection   carried   out   on  06.09.2017 is final and no reinspection is required. That in view of the  failure on the part of the respondent Company to mobilise and deploy  the required equipments even during the extended mobilization period,  vide communication dated 11.10.2017, the Corporation terminated the  contract   by   taking   into   consideration   contained   in   Clause   18.5.  According   to   the   petitioner   Corporation   the   contract   was   terminated  taking   into   consideration   Clause   19(b)   of   the   General   Contract  Conditions   of   the   contract   agreement   also.   That   on   12.10.2017,   the  Corporation   suspended   the   respondent   Company's   Vendor   Code,  pending   completion   of   the   inquiry   for   blacklisting.   That   vide  communication   dated   13.10.2017   the   respondent   Company   wrote   a  letter to the Corporation requesting  inter alia to release the respondent  Company's   Vendor   Code   was   that   it   can   participate   in   various  forthcoming (new) tender activities. That on 18.10.2017 the Corporation  issued the showcause notice to the respondent Company, to showcause  as to why the Corporation should not take action for stopping / banning  business   dealings   with   the   respondent   Company   i.e.   permanently  blacklisting the respondent Company for the period of 2 years.  \n[2.3] Feeling   aggrieved   and   dissatisfied   with   the   action   of   the  Corporation to block Vendor Code allotted to the petitioner as well as  the   showcause   notice   dated   18.10.2017   seeking   to   blacklist   the  petitioner for the period of 2 years, the respondent Company preferred  Special   Civil   Application   No.19289/2017   before   this   Court   for   the  following reliefs. \n\"(A) To quash and set aside the action of ONGC to  block Vendor Code allotted to the petitioner, (AA) To   set   aside   the   Show   Cause   Notice   dated  18.10.2017, seeking to blacklist the petitioner for the  period of two years (added pursuant to amendment), (B) To   quash   and   set   aside   Clause   18.6(ii)   of   the  Contract, (C) Pending   the   hearing   and   final   disposal   of   the  petition,\n  (i) To direct ONGC to unblock Vendor Code  allotted to the petitioner,\n  (ii) To direct ONGC to allow the petitioner to  participate in various tenders of ONGC. \n(CC) Pending   hearing   and   final   disposal   of   the  present   petition,   Your   Lordships   may   be   pleased   to  stay   the   Show   Cause   Notice   dated   18.10.2017   at  ANNEXURES.\" \nThat   the   Division   Bench   of   this   Court   issued   the   notice   to   the  petitioner   Corporation.   That   on   02.11.2017   the   respondent   Company  issued a notice invoking the arbitration to the Corporation stating, inter   alia, that the Corporation has illegally terminated the contract and that  the   respondent   Company   has   mobilized   the   required   equipments   on  31.08.2017, which is lying ideal and therefore, the dispute has arisen  between the parties which is required to be referred to arbitration under  Clause 27 of the Contract Agreement. \n[2.4] That the petitioner Corporation addressed a reminder letter to the  respondent Company on 02.11.2017 seeking its reply to the showcause  notice dated 18.10.2017. \n[2.5] At this stage it is required to be noted that the aforesaid Special  Civil   Application   as   such   was   preferred   initially   seeking   the   relief   to  quash and set aside  the  action  of the   petitioner  Corporation  to  block  Vendor   Code  allotted   to   the  petitioner   and  thereafter  the   showcause  notice dated 18.10.2017 was issued and therefore, on 06.11.2017 the  respondent   Company   preferred   a   Draft   Amendment   in   the   aforesaid  Special   Civil   Application   No.19289/2017   challenging   the   showcause  notice dated 18.10.2017. \n[2.6] That on 07.11.2017 the respondent Company addressed a letter to  the petitioner Corporation with reference to the showcause notice dated  18.10.2017. \n[ 2.7 ] That thereafter  the  petitioner  Corporation  issued another  show cause notice dated 25.11.2017 to the respondent Company seeking its  explanation which according to the petitioner Corporation was in lieu of  the showcause notice dated 18.10.2017. \n[2.8] It   is   the   case   on   behalf   of   the   petitioner   that   the   respondent  Company   addressed   a   letter   dated   01.12.2017   to   the   petitioner  Corporation refusing to disclose the location of the MAC. That thereafter  the petitioner  Corporation addressed a letter dated 13.12.2017 to the  respondent Company forwarding the names of the learned Arbitrator to  be   appointed   for   the   adjudication   of   the   dispute   for   claim   of  Rs.2,19,96,769/.   At   this   stage   it   is   required   to   be   noted   that   at   the  relevant time the dispute was with respect to termination of contract. \n[2.9] That the petitioner Corporation thereafter addressed one another  showcause   notice   on   20.12.2017   to   the   respondent   Company   with  reference   to   the   earlier   notices   dated   18.10.2017   and   25.11.2017.  According   to   the   petitioner   Corporation,   by   the   said   notice   dated  20.10.2017, the petitioner Corporation has expressly sought explanation  from   the   respondent   Company   as   to   why   it   should   not   stop   /   ban  business   dealings   with   the   respondent   Company   for   foisting   old   and  refurbished MAC upon the petitioner Corporation which is only available  under Integrated Materials Management Manual. \n[2.10 ] That thereafter vide communication dated 21.12.2017, the  respondent company gave its consensus for appointment of the learned  sole Arbitrator. \n[2.11] That thereafter the respondent Company submitted its reply  to the showcause notice on 29.12.2017. That thereafter the respondent  Company   withdrew   the   aforesaid   Special   Civil   Application  No.19289/2017   on   02.02.2018   with   a   view   to   remove   the   learned  Arbitrator for interim measures under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act. \n[2.12] That   on   02.02.2018   the   respondent   Company   filed   its  Statement   of   Claim   before   the   learned   sole   Arbitrator.   That   in   the  Statement   of   Claim   the   respondent  claimed  added   final  relief   against  notice dated 18.10.2017 (it is the case on behalf of the petitioner that  though   the   said   showcause   notice   dated   18.10.2017   was   the   subject  matter   before   this   Court   in   Special   Civil   Application   No.19289/2017,  which   came   to   be   withdrawn   only   with   a   view   to   move   the   learned  Arbitrator for interim measures under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act  and though no liberty was reserved raising the dispute against the show cause   notice   dated   18.10.2017,   the   respondent   -   claimant   added   the  final relief against the notice dated 18.10.2017). \n[2.13] That   on   10.02.2018,   the   respondent   Company   filed   an  application under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act,  inter alia,  seeking  direction to the Corporation to unblock the Vendor Code No.V814297  allotted   to   it   for   participating   in   various   tender   activities.   That   on  12.02.2018, the Corporation filed its objection to the said application by  stating inter alia that the application of the respondent Company is not  incidental   as   the   blacklisting   proceedings   (putting   the   respondent  Company in holidays) are not arising under the arbitration proceedings  invoked   by   the   respondent   Company,   wherein   it   had   challenged   the  termination of the contract only . That on 12.02.2018 the Corporation  filed an application under Section 16 of the Arbitration Act challenging  the jurisdiction of the learned Arbitral Tribunal with respect to the show cause notice dated 18.10.2017 for blacklisting / putting the respondent  Company in holiday . \n[2.14] It   appears   that   thereafter   on   15.02.2018   the   Corporation  passed an order deciding to stop any further business dealings with the  respondent   Company   (i.e.   to   put   on   holiday).   That   thereafter   on  19.02.2018   the   respondent   Company   -   original   claimant   filed   an  amendment application for amending the Statement of Claim and also  its interim measure application filed under Section 17 of the Arbitration  Act.   That   on   10.03.2018,   the   learned   Arbitrator   passed   an   order  allowing the amendment sought by the respondent Company - original  claimant.   That   on   12.02.2018,   the   respondent   Company   -   original  claimant filed an amended Section 17 application, inter alia, seeking stay  of   the   final  order   of   blacklisting  /   putting   on   holiday  the   respondent  Company   dated   15.02.2018   of   the   Corporation.   That   by   order   dated  09.05.2018 the learned Arbitral Tribunal rejected section 16 application.  On the very day and on the basis of the findings recorded while passing  the   order   under   Section   16   application,   the   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal  allowed section 17 application and stayed the order dated 15.02.2018 as  well as the order of suspension of business dealings dated 12.10.2017. \n[2.15] Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order passed by  the learned Arbitral Tribunal in Section 17 application, the Corporation  preferred an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act before the  learned   Commercial   Court,   Ahmedabad.   That   by   impugned   judgment  and order the learned Commercial Court, at Ahmedabad has dismissed  the said appeal of the Corporation which is the subject matter of present  petition before this Court. \n[3.0] Shri   Kamal   Trivedi,   learned   Senior   Advocate   has   appeared   on  behalf   of   the   petitioner   Corporation   and   Shri   S.N.   Soparkar,   learned  Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the respondent Company -  original claimant. \n[4.0] Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner  has   vehemently   submitted   that   order   passed   by   the   learned   Arbitral  Tribunal   under   Section   17   of   the   Arbitration   Act   confirmed   by   the  learned   Commercial   Court   is   wholly   without   jurisdiction   as   well   as  beyond the scope and ambit of section 17 of the Arbitration Act. \n[4.1] It   is   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned   Counsel   appearing   on  behalf of the petitioner that infact the respondent Company invoked the  arbitration under the contract only in respect of the termination of the  contract as per Clause 27.1 of the Contract Agreement. It is submitted  that therefore the dispute which was referred to the sole Arbitrator was  with respect to the termination order only. It is submitted that even at  the time when the notice invoking the arbitration was issued and served  as   per   Clause   27.1   of   the   contract,   even   there   was   no   order   dated  15.02.2018 putting the respondent Company on holidays. \n[4.2] It is submitted that Clause 27.1 of the Contract expressly provides  for reference of specific disputes at the time of invocation of arbitration  and not there after. It is submitted that therefore, the learned Tribunal  does   not   have   jurisdiction   to   decide   any   dispute   which   has   not  specifically been referred to it. It is submitted that therefore the learned  Arbitrator   cannot   by   traveling   beyond   the   reference,   entertain   any  additional claims or counter claims which are not part of the disputes  specifically referred  to  arbitration.  It is  submitted  that   in  view  of  the  negative covenant contained in Clause 27.1 of the Contract, providing  for   reference   of   only   the   specified   points   of   dispute   in   the   notice  invoking   arbitration  and   not   thereafter  it   was   impermissible   for   the  respondent   Company   to   seek   to   add   any   new   point   of   dispute   with  regard   to   putting   it   on   holidays,   after   having   issued   notice   dated  02.11.2017. It is submitted that therefore all the orders passed by the  learned Tribunal in connection with the banning proceedings are beyond  the scope of reference and without jurisdiction. \n[4.3] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the petitioner that even Notice dated 02.11.2017 was issued  after  receipt of  the  showcause notice   dated 18.10.2017  and the  said  does not refer to or even whisper about the latter. It is submitted that  not only the notice dated 02.11.2017 but the subsequent letters dated  07.11.2017   and   29.12.2017   also   clearly   stated   that   the   respondent  Company has invoked arbitration only in respect of termination of the  contract and so far as the dispute with regard to holidaying the same,  had   been   agitated   before   the   High   Court.   It   is   submitted   that   it   is   a  settled principle of law that special Tribunals like Arbitral Tribunals get  jurisdiction to proceed with the case only from the reference made to  them.   It   is   submitted   that   thus,   it   is   not   permissible   for   such  Tribunals/authorities to travel beyond the terms of reference and powers  cannot be exercised by the Tribunal so as to enlarge materially the scope  of the reference itself. It is submitted that the learned Arbitral Tribunal  can not widen jurisdiction by deciding a question not referred to it by the  parties or cannot assume jurisdiction over a question which has not been  referred to it.  In support of his above submissions, Shri Trivedi, learned  Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has heavily relied upon the  following decisions. \n1.

Sheodutt vs. Pandit Vishnudutta   AIR 1955 Nag. 116  [4.4] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the petitioner that even considering the Order XXIII  Rule  1(3) & 1(4) of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the respondent Company  having unconditionally withdrawn the writ petition without leave of the  Court to institute fresh claim in respect of the show cause proceedings  for   putting   the   respondent   Company   on   holiday,   the   respondent  Company is precluded from making claim before the Arbitral tribunal on  the same subject matter. It is submitted that the record reveals that the  respondent Company has challenged the show cause proceedings  and  more particularly showcause notice dated 18.10.2017 before this Court  by filing the writ petition being Special Civil Application No.19289/2017  with a prayer to set aside showcause notice dated 18.10.2017 and has  pursued the remedy before the High Court only. It is submitted that the  said   petition   was   fully   and   finally   heard   by   the   High   Court   and   was  pending   for   the   judgment   when   the   respondent   company   sought   to  withdraw   the   said   petition.   It   is   further   submitted   that   order   dated  02.02.2018 passed by the High Court has reproduced the liberty sought  for   by   the   respondent   Company   while   withdrawing   the   writ   petition,  which reads that 'the petition may be permitted to be withdrawn with a  view to take out appropriate  application  before the  Ld. Arbitrator  for  interim measures'. It is submitted that thus, no liberty was sought to add  final claim before the learned Arbitrator. It is submitted that it is curious  to note that on the very day i.e. 02.02.2018 the respondent Company  has submitted its  Statement of Claim with a final prayer to set aside  showcause   notice   dated   18.10.2018.   It   is   further   submitted   that  unconditionally   withdrawing   the   writ   petition   before   the   High   Court  amounts to abandonment of claim and the respondent Company thus  has been precluded from instituting any fresh proceedings in respect of  showcause proceedings and showcause notice dated 18.10.2017. \n[4.5] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the petitioner that the principle underlining provisions of  Order XXIII Rule 1(3) & 1(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is  considered as a principle of public policy to preclude the petitioner from  reagitating the same cause of action and relief. It is submitted that thus  unless the Court grants express permission to institute a fresh claim on  the same subject matter it is not permissible for a litigant to reopen and  reagitate   the   concluded   and   unconditionally   withdrawn   claim   and  relief.   In   support   of   his   above   his   submission,   Shri   Trivedi,   learned  Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has relied on the following  decisions. \n1. 1999 (1) SCC 81 - rel. paras 11 to 15   Upadhyay & Co. vs. State of U.P. and others   2. 2018 (11) SCC 104 - rel. paras 13 and 14   H.N. Jagannath and Others vs. State of Karnataka and Ors. \n3. 2012 (2) CHN 452 - rel. paras 11 and 12   S.S.K. Construction vs. Rupa Ghosh [4.6] It is further submitted that even the final order dated 15.02.2018  is a new and fresh cause of action and therefore also, with respect to the  order putting the respondent Company on holidays which is a new and  fresh cause of action, the learned Arbitral Tribunal ought not to have  assumed the jurisdiction  with respect to such new and fresh cause of  action. It is submitted that order dated 15.02.2018 was not even born  either on the date when the notice invoking arbitration was issued or on  the date of filing of Statement of Claim. It is submitted that thus, it could  not   be   assailed   without   first   raising   the   dispute   in   accordance   with  Clause 27 of the contract. It is submitted that the order finally deciding  the   issue   of   holiday   is   a   new   and   fresh   cause   of   action   involving  completely   different   and   distinct   scope   of   dispute,   which   has   been  passed under the Integrated Materials Management Manual. \n[4.7] It is further submitted that the order of holiday has been passed  after   affording   an   opportunity   of   hearing   to   the   respondent   company  pursuant to three showcause notices dated 18.10.2017, 25.11.2017 &  20.12.2017, which called upon the respondent Company to answer the  allegation   of   foisting   old   MAC   unit   based   on   the   false   invoices.   It   is  submitted that thus, order dated 15.02.2018 has been passed in exercise  of administrative/executive power of the petitioner Corporation and not  only under Clause 18.6 of the contract. It is submitted that power under  Clause 18.6 of the contract is restricted and could only be exercised in  cases of delayed mobilization, unsatisfactory performance or insolvency,  whereas powers under the Manual are larger. It is submitted that effect  of holidaying under the contract is also restricted to the entity of the  contractor,   whereas   under   the   Manual   the   petitioner   corporation   has  larger power to put on holiday all other sister concerns. It is submitted  that   thus,   power   to   put   on   holiday   sister   concerns   without   privity   of  contract itself shows that such power is not contractual but an inherent  administrative/executive   power.   In   support   of   his   above   submissions,  Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has  heavily relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the  case of Kulja Industries Limited vs. Chief General Manager, Western  Telecom Project Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Ors. reported in  (2014) 14 SCC 731  as well as the decision of the Delhi High Court in  the case of Surinder Pal Singh vs. HPCL & Anr. reported in 2006 (92)  DRJ 537.  \n[4.8] Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner  has further submitted that even otherwise the relief which is granted by  the   learned   Arbitrator   in   an   application   under   Section   17   of   the  Arbitration Act is not sustainable under the law. \nIt   is   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned   Counsel   appearing   on  behalf of the petitioner that the learned Arbitral Tribunal has granted  the relief by way of interim measures in an application under Section 17  of the Arbitration Act which as such is a final relief that may be granted.  It is submitted that the interim injunction / interim relief is always in aid  and as an auxillary to the final relief that may be granted. It is submitted  that the respondent Company neither could have prayed for nor the Ld.  Tribunal   could   have   granted   the   interim   relief   granting   temporary  injunction against order dated 15.02.2018 based on new and fresh cause  of action inasmuch as, the final relief to set aside the action is itself not  available   to   the   respondent   Company   to   pray   for   in   the   arbitral  proceedings. It is submitted that the respondent Company, since could  not pray for setting aside/quashing of the proceedings for putting the  respondent company on holiday or order dated 15.02.2018, it was not  entitled   to   grant   of   any   interim   relief   in   terms   thereof.   It   is   further  submitted that if the final relief cannot be granted in terms as prayed  for, temporary relief in same terms could not be granted because right to  obtain an interlocutory injunction is not a cause of action and it cannot  stand on its own. It is submitted that the injunction sought in the action  must be part of the substantive relief to which the plaintiffs' cause of  action entitles him. It is submitted that the learned Tribunal has granted  the   interim   relief   staying   the   holiday   awarded   to   the   respondent  Company without jurisdiction to grant final relief in terms thereof. In  support   of   his   above   submissions,   Shri   Trivedi,   learned   Counsel  appearing   on   behalf   of   the   petitioner   has   heavily   relied   upon   the  decision   of   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in   the   case   of  Cotton  Corporation of India Limited vs. United Industrial Bank Limited and  Others reported in AIR 1983 SC 1272 as well as in the case of Adhunik  Steels Ltd. vs. Orissa Manganese and Minerals Pvt. Ltd.  reported in  AIR 2007 SC 2563.\n[4.9] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the petitioner that the respondent Company could not have  prayed for the relief which is beyond the subject matter of the reference  and, the jurisdiction of the learned Tribunal could not extend beyond the  said subject matter. It is submitted that after amendment of Section 17 it  stands in pari materia as section 9 of the Arbitration Act. It is submitted  that the Hon'ble Apex Court while interpreting the provisions of Section  9   has   held   that   the   said   provisions   would   be   restricted   to   the  preservation   of   the   subject   matter   of   arbitration   and  it  would   not  be  correct to say that the power under section 9 of the Arbitration Act is  totally independent of the well known principles governing the grant of  an interim injunction. It is submitted that thus, even under section 17,  the   learned   Tribunal   could   not   have   transgressed   its   jurisdiction   and  granted   relief   which   otherwise   is   beyond   the   subject   matter   of   the  arbitral proceedings when such powers are not exercised by the Courts  to   grant   interim   relief   beyond   the   subject   matter   of   the   proceedings  before it. It is submitted that the learned Tribunal therefore could not  have granted interim injunction compelling the petitioner Corporation to  enter into the contract with the respondent Company. In support of his  above submissions, Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of  the   petitioner   has   heavily   relied   upon   the   decision   of   the   Hon'ble  Supreme Court in the case of Adhunik Steels Ltd. (Supra) as well as in  the case of  MD, Army Welfare Housing Organisation vs. Sumangal  Services (P) Ltd. reported in (2004)9 SCC 619 as well as the decision  of   the   Calcutta   High   Court   in   the   case   of  West   Bengal   Surface  Transport   Corporation   Ltd.   vs.   Howrah   East   West   Mini   Bus  Association reported in AIR 2011 Calcutta 50. \n[4.10] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned   Counsel  appearing   on  behalf   of  the  petitioner   that  as   such  there   is  no  bar   to  blacklisting   proceedings   during   the   pendency   of   the   Arbitral  proceedings. It is submitted that as such there are divergent views on  whether   during   the   pendency   of   the   arbitral   proceedings,   blacklisting  proceedings can be initiated or not? It is submitted that, that apart, in  the present case the subsequent order putting the respondent Company  on   holidays   cannot   be   said   to   be   consequential   to   the   order   of  termination of the contract and it was altogether an independent cause  of action under the Integrated Material Management Manual and not at  all   connected   with   the   termination   order.   It   is   submitted   that   if   the  Corporation  would have  invoked  the  powers under  Clause  18 in  that  case the order of blacklisting / putting on holidays would be restricted to  the Company only and not against the Directors etc.  [ 4.11 ]   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the petitioner that as can be seen from various  showcause notices issued from time to time the showcause notice was  not   based   on   the   termination   of   the   contract,   but   was   issued   on   the  allegation of cheating and not supplying the fresh machinery etc., which  cannot be the subject matter of the proceedings under Clause 18 of the  contract.   It   is   submitted   that   therefore   the   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal  ought   not   to   have   stayed   the   order   dated   15.02.2018   in   exercise   of  powers under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act. \n[4.12]   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the petitioner that even the learned Commercial  Court in the impugned order has also specifically noted that there were  divergent   views   of   the   different   High   Courts   on   whether   during   the  pendency   of   the   arbitral   proceedings   there   can   be   blacklisting  proceedings or not?\n[4.13]   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the petitioner that in the facts and circumstances  of   the   case   on   hand,   the   views   expressed   by   the   Delhi   High   Court,  Punjab & Haryana High Court and Jharkhand High Court in  cases  of  IOCL v. SPS Engineering, Prakash Atlanta JV v. NHAI, NBCC v. NDMC,  Mahavir   Transmission   v.   Punjab   State   Transmission   Corp.   Ltd.   and  Nagarjuna v. State of Jharkhand shall not be applicable. It is submitted  that in the aforesaid cases there was identity in the arbitral proceedings  as well as blacklisting proceedings. It is submitted that in those cases the  orders have been passed either without issuance of hte notice or without  assigning the proper reasons at the fag end of the arbitral proceedings. It  is   submitted  that  thus  the   aforesaid  High   Courts   have   expressed   that  such hasty decisions ought not to have been taken by the Authorities. \n[4.14]   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the petitioner  that on the other hand, various  High   Courts   have   expressed   the   view   that   mere   initiation   of   arbitral  proceedings   would   not   act   as   an   embargo   or   absolute   prohibition   to  proceed further with the blacklisting proceedings less it would result into  a situation where no authority would be in a position to conduct black  listing proceedings inasmuch as the Arbitral Proceedings would be used  as a tool to thwart blacklisting proceedings. It is submitted that in the  present   case   infact   showcause   notice   18.10.2017   has   preceded  invocation   of   arbitral   proceedings   despite   which   the   respondent  Company has chosen not to include dispute with regard to showcause  notice   in   its   reference   to   arbitration.   It   is   submitted   that   the   learned  Commercial  Court in  its  order  dated 31.05.2018  has  also  found that,  initiation   of   arbitration   proceedings   would   not   prohibit   conduct   of  blacklisting proceedings as a matter of rule in all cases. In support of his  above submissions, Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of  the petitioner has relied on the following decisions. \n1.

It is submitted  that   the   learned  Tribunal   as   well   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has  committed   patent   error   on   the   face   of   the   record   in   holding   that  proceedings   of   putting   the   respondent   Company   on   holiday   is   a  consequence of termination  and thus  the  respondent Company would  not   be   in   a   position   to   recover   the   damages   caused   to   it   even   if   it  succeeds in its challenge to the holiday proceedings. It is submitted that  firstly, holiday proceedings are not the consequence of termination of  contract inasmuch as for an example if the respondent Company would  have brought genuinely new MAC unit during the extended period after  supplying old refurbished MAC unit at the first instance, the petitioner  Corporation   could   still   initiate   holiday   proceedings   but   it   would   not  result into termination of contract as the mobilization stands completed  upon   bringing   the   genuinely   new   MAC   unit.   It   is   submitted   that  similarly,   in   a   given   case   where   due   to   bonafide   reasons   if   the  contractor is unable to mobilize the MAC unit within the agreed time,  contract   stands   terminated   but   the   petitioner   Corporation   may   not  initiate   holiday   proceedings.   It   is   submitted   that   thus,   it   cannot   be  concluded that holiday is a consequential action to termination. \n[4.16] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the petitioner that apart from this, the learned  Tribunal as well as the learned Commercial Court has committed gross  errors in holding that since the invoices reflect the year of manufacture  as 2017 it is established that the MAC unit is new. It is submitted that  the   learned   Tribunal   as   well   as   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has  committed errors on the face of the record in ignoring the inspection  report dated 07.09.2017 of the petitioner Corporation which clearly held  that   the   MAC   unit   is   an   old   and   repainted   one   although   its   relevant  documents say that it is new. It is submitted that the certificates and the  inspection reports submitted by the respondent Company have opined  only on the basis of the documents without verification of the physical  condition of the MAC unit. It is submitted that it is the precise case of  the petitioner Corporation that the respondent Company has submitted  false   documents   to   show   that   MAC   unit   is   new   when   the   physical  condition upon physical site inspection revealed that it is old. \n[ 4.17 ] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the petitioner that the learned Tribunal and the  learned   Commercial   Court  have   erred  in   holding   that   the   respondent  Company is likely to suffer irretrievable damage as it is likely to lose  business opportunities during the period of holiday. It is submitted that  such   conclusions   and   findings   are   perverse   inasmuch   as   such   loss   of  business opportunities are clearly determinable in terms of money and  could be compensated by awarding damages as against which it would  create   irreversible   situation   for   the   petitioner   corporation   if   the  respondent   company   is   allowed   to   do   business   with   the   petitioner  corporation   inasmuch   as   once   the   contract   is   performed   it   cannot   be  reversed   such   irreversible   situation   would   compel   the   petitioner  corporation to enter into business with a person which is found to be  unsuitable   by   the   petitioner   corporation.   In   support   of   his   above  submissions, Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the  petitioner has relied on the decision of the Divisoin Bench of this Court  in the case of  Krishak Bharati Cooperative Limited vs. S.R. Travels  and Anr. reported in 2018 SCC Online Guj. 805 (Paras 8 and 13). \n[4.18]  It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel  appearing   on   behalf   of   the   petitioner   that  in   the   facts   and  circumstances   of   the   case   and   even   considering   the   provisions   of   the  Commercial   Courts   Act,   nonchallenge   to   the   order   passed   by   the  learned Arbitral Tribunal in Section 16 application shall not come in the  way of the petitioner. It is submitted that still it will be open for the  petitioner   to   contend   that   the   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   has   no  jurisdiction to entertain and/or consider the dispute with respect to the  blacklisting   to   the   extent   while   considering  prima   facie  case.   It   is  submitted that considering the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act  more particularly section 8 of the Arbitration Act, the appeal at this stage  challenging   the   order   passed   in   Section   16   application   shall   not   be  maintainable and even the dispute  with respect to jurisdiction  can be  agitated only in an appeal challenging the final award. It is submitted by  Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners that  even   in   the   impugned   order   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   also  observed that at this state challenge to the order passed in Section 16  application shall not be maintainable. \nMaking   above   submissions   it   is   requested   to   allow   the   present  petition. \n[5.0] Present petition is vehemently opposed by Shri Soparkar, learned  Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent. \n[5.1] It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Soparkar,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the respondent that the learned Arbitrator has  jurisdiction to grant the reliefs as granted by the impugned order on an  application   under   Section   17   of   the   Arbitration   Act   which   is   rightly  confirmed by the learned Commercial Court by the impugned order. \n[5.2] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Soparkar,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the respondent that the learned Arbitrator has by  an order dated 09.05.2018 on an application under Section 16 of the  Arbitration   Act   filed   by   the   Corporation   has   ruled   that   the   learned  Arbitrator has jurisdiction to agitate the dispute raised in the amended  statement of claim filed by the respondent. It is submitted that the order  passed by the learned Arbitrator ruling the jurisdiction under Section 16  of   the   Arbitration   Act   is   not   appealable   under   Section   37   of   the  Arbitration Act. It is submitted that in the event the learned Arbitrator  opines that he has jurisdiction in the matter, he may proceed therewith,  which order can be challenged alongwith the award in terms of section  34 of the Arbitration Act. \nIn   support   of   his   above   submissions,   Shri   Soparkar,   learned  Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent has heavily relied upon  the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Pandey & Co.  Builders (P) Ltd. vs. State of Bihar & Anr.  reported in  (2007)1 SCC  467 (Paras 15 and 16). It is submitted that therefore, in view of the  settled   position   of   law,   the   Corporation   which   cannot   challenge   the  order dated 09.05.2018 under Section 16 of the Arbitration Act on the  question of jurisdiction of learned Arbitrator, cannot indirectly challenge  the said question in the present petition by challenging the order dated  09.05.2018  passed  by  the   learned  Arbitrator   under  Section   17  of   the  Arbitration   Act.   It   is   submitted   that   therefore ,   the   order   dated  09.05.2018  under Section  16(5) of the Arbitration  Act is final at this  stage and cannot be challenged. It is submitted that even otherwise as  such the said order is not challenged by the Corporation. It is submitted  that therefore what is not permitted directly cannot be done indirectly. \n[5.3] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Soparkar,   learned   Counsel  appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent   that   barring   excepted   items  agreed   between   the   parties,   the   learned   Arbitrator   has   full   power   to  adjudicate   and   decide   the   dispute   arising   out   of   the   contract   dated  07.04.2017. It is submitted that in the present case the dispute raised in  the arbitration proceedings are such items which are not excepted in the  contract and therefore, are not barred. \n[5.4] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Soparkar,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the respondent that even otherwise the notice  dated 02.11.2017 invoking the arbitration clause by respondent is wide  enough to cover the disputes which are raised in the amended statement  of claim. It is submitted that from the chronology of events it can be seen  that the Corporation terminated the contract by letter dated 11.10.2017  under   Clause   18.5   of   the   contract   and   blocked   the   Vendor   Code   on  12.10.2017 under Clause 18.6(ii) without any order passed for blocking  the Vendor Code. It is submitted that subsequently the Corporation gave  showcause notice dated 18.10.2017 to the  respondent as to why the  Corporation should not take  action  against the respondent as per the  terms and conditions of the contract to stop / ban business dealings with  the   respondent.   It   is   submitted   that   the   respondent   invoked   the  arbitration   clause   27.1   and   gave   a   notice   dated   02.11.2017   raising  dispute in respect of terminating the contract and the action / intention  of   the   Corporation   to   put   the   respondent   on   holiday   with   malafide  intention. It is submitted that paras 12, 13, 14, 21 and 22 of the notice  dated 02.11.2017 are wide enough to cover the dispute of termination  and   the   action   /   intention   to   put   the   respondent   on   holiday   by   the  Corporation . It is submitted that even in reply dated 07.11.2017 by the  respondent to the showcause notice dated 18.10.2017 it was pointed  out that the respondent has invoked the arbitration clause and request  was made not to proceed with show cause notice.   It is submitted that  subsequently the reply dated 01.12.2017 was given by the respondent  pointing   out   that   the   respondent   has   already   invoked   the   arbitration  proceedings. It is submitted that the learned Arbitrator was appointed on  21.12.2017.   The   respondent   again   gave   a   reply   dated   21.12.2017  pointing out that the consent for appointing Arbitrator has been given by  letter dated 21.12.2017 and therefore, the Corporation may not proceed  further in the matter. It is submitted that infact, the learned Arbitrator  gave a notice dated 25.01.2018 informing the parties that the meeting  will   be   held   on   06.02.2018.   The   statement   of   claim   challenging   the  termination   letter   dated   11.10.2017   and   showcause   notice   dated  18.10.2017 alongwith an application under Section 17 of the Arbitration  Act was filed before the learned Arbitrator. It is submitted that during  the pendency of the hearing to section 17 application, which was going  on, the  Corporation  passed office  order  dated  15.02.2018  putting  the  respondent  on  holiday.   It is  submitted  that  the  dispute  regarding  the  action / intention of the Corporation to put the respondent on holiday  was already raised in the notice dated 02.11.2017 by the respondent. It  is submitted that considering the said facts the learned Arbitrator by an  order   dated   10.03.2018   granted   amendment   to   challenge   the   office  order dated 15.02.2018 and also permitted amendment in application  under Section 16 seeking stay of the office order dated 15.02.2018. It is  submitted  that therefore, the  said  dispute  which  is  raised falls within  clause 27 of the contract and the learned Arbitrator has jurisdiction to  decide the said dispute as the notice dated 02.11.2017 is wide enough to  cover the disputes which are raised in the amended statement of claim. \n[5.5] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Soparkar,   learned   Counsel  appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent   that   Clause   18.5   provides   for  termination   of   the   contract   if   the   contractor   fails   to   mobilize   the  complete equipment along with crew. It is submitted that Clause 18.6  provides for 'consequences of termination' of putting the respondent on  holiday for period of two years from the dated of the order and pending  completion of enquiry process for putting the respondent on holiday, the  Corporation shall neither issue any tender enquiry nor shall consider any  offer in the ongoing tender to the contractor. \n[5.6] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Soparkar,   learned   Counsel  appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent   that   in   the   present   case   the  Corporation has terminated the contract by a letter dated 11.10.2017  under Clause 18.5 on the ground that respondent failed to mobilize the  equipment and reserved the right to take further consequential action as  provided in the contract. It is submitted that the Corporation  did not  accept which was ready for deployment by the respondent in view of the  alleged report dated 07.09.2017 which is based on visual inspection and  without   opportunity   to   the   respondent   to   rectify   /   repair   the   defect  which   otherwise   is   provided   under   3.12.2(G)   of   inspection.   It   is  submitted that in any case the respondent had deployed the new MAC. It  is submitted that the Corporation then gave a showcause notice dated  18.10.2017 to the respondent as to why the Corporation should not take  action to put the respondent on holiday as per terms and conditions of  the contract and also referred to the alleged report dated 07.09.2017 in  the   said   showcause   notice.   It   is   submitted   that   the   reminder   dated  25.11.2017   also   reminds   of   the   fact   that   the   consequential   action   is  taken under Clause 18.6 of the contract. It is submitted that even the  notice dated 20.12.2017 by the Corporation in reference to the earlier  notice   dated   18.10.2017   calls   upon   the   respondent   to   give   reply   on  merits otherwise it will proceed ex parte and quoted the observations of  the alleged report dated 07.09.2017 which was already referred to in the  showcause notice dated 18.10.2017. It is submitted that thereafter the  respondent   is   put   on   holiday   as   per   Clause   18.6   of   the   terms   of   the  contract by an office order dated 15.02.2018. It is submitted that hence,  the   action   /   intention   of   the   Corporation   to   put   the   respondent   on  holiday   is   a   consequence   of   termination   under   Clause   18.6   of   the  contract   read   with   Clause   18.5   of   the   contract.   Therefore,   when   the  termination   of   the   contract   is   to   be   adjudicated   and   decided   by   the  learned Arbitrator in that case the learned Arbitrator also has power to  adjudicate and decide the consequential action of putting the respondent  on holiday taken pursuant to termination of the contract. \nIn   support   of   his   above   submissions,   Shri   Soparkar,   learned  Counsel has  heavily  relied upon the  decision  of the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court   in   the   case   of  Rashtriya   Ispat   Nigam   Ltd.   &   Anr.   vs.   Verma  Transport Co. reported in (2006)7 SCC 275 (Paras 7, 21 to 23 & 43).  It is submitted that in the aforesaid decision it is held that the cause of  action arose in terms of the contract in respect of illegal termination of  the contract and blacklisting of the firm and it cannot be said to be two  different causes of action. \n[5.7] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Soparkar,   learned   Counsel  appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent   that   if   the   termination   letter  dated  11.10.2017  is  set aside  then  the   office  order dated  15.02.2018  putting the respondent on holiday would not survive inasmuch as the  office order dated 15.02.2018 is a consequence of the termination letter  dated 11.10.2017. It is submitted further that the allegations made and  the grounds on the basis of which the Corporation has terminated the  contract by termination letter dated 11.10.2017 are identical and similar  to put the respondent on holiday by an office order dated 15.02.2018. It  is   submitted   that   therefore,   if   the   respondent   is   directed   to   raise   a  separate dispute as alleged by the Corporation under Clause 27.1 of the  contract for a separate arbitration then in that case there would be two  separate   arbitration   for   same   cause   of   action   based   on   identical  allegations   and   similar   grounds   which   would   lead   to   two   conflicting  awards in two separate arbitration proceedings. It is further submitted  that no prejudice will be caused to the Corporation if the dispute raised  in the amended statement of claim is adjudicated and decided by the  learned Arbitrator. It is submitted that therefore, if the argument of the  Corporation   is   accepted   then   it   would   lead   to   multiplicity   of  proceedings   /   litigation   /   arbitration   which   should   be   curbed   in   the  interest of substantial justice. \n[5.8] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Soparkar,   learned   Counsel  appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent   that   the   bifurcation   of  proceedings in two parts i.e. one for adjudication of the termination of  contract   and   another   for   putting   the   respondent   on   holiday   to   be  decided   in   two   separate   proceedings   would   inevitably   delay   the  proceedings . It is submitted that the whole purpose of speedy disposal of  dispute and cost of litigation would be frustrated by such procedure. It is  submitted   that   it   would   also   increase   the   cost   of   litigation   and  harassment   to   the   parties   and   on   occasions   there   is   possibility   of  conflicting judgment and orders in two separate proceedings. \n[5.9] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Soparkar,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the  respondent that the  Corporation  had filed  petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India challenging the  order dated 31.05.2018 passed by the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad  confirming the order dated 09.05.2018 passed by the learned Arbitrator  under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act. It is submitted that it is settled  position of law that such powers be exercised sparingly and in the rarest  of the rare case which is not one in the present case. It is submitted that  therefore this Court may not exercise the power as the impugned orders  does not suffer from patent perversity nor there has been a gross and  manifest  failure   of   justice   nor  there   is   violation   of  basic  principles  of  natural justice. \nIn   support   of   his   above   submissions,   Shri   Soparkar,   learned  Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent has heavily relied upon  the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Shalini Shyam  Shetty & Anr. vs. Rajendra Shankar Patel  reported in  (2010)8 SCC  329 (Paras 47 to 49) as well as the recent decision dated 07.05.2018 of  the Division Bench of this Court rendered in  Special Civil Application  No.737/2018.\n[5.10] It  is   further   submitted   by  Shri  Soparkar, learned  Counsel  appearing on behalf of the respondent that the order dated 09.05.2018  is passed by the learned Arbitrator under Section 17 of the Arbitration  Act against which appeal under Section 37(2)(b) of the Arbitration Act is  preferred   before   the   Commercial   Court   on   which   the   order   dated  31.05.2018   is   passed   by   the   Commercial   Court   confirming   the   order  dated 09.05.2018 passed by the learned Arbitrator under Section 17. It  is submitted that the scope of interference by a Commercial Court in an  interim direction given by the learned Arbitrator is very limited more so  because the learned Arbitrator has taken fair, reasonable and equitable  view. \nIn   support   of   his   above   submissions ,   Shri   Soparkar,   learned  Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent has heavily relied upon  the   decisions   in   the   case   of  Subhash   Chander   Chachra   &   Anr.   vs.  Ashwini Kumar Chachra & Ors. reported in 2007 (95) DRK 55 as well  as   in   the   case   of  Bakshi   Speedways   vs.   Hindustan   Petroleum  Corporation reported in 2009 SCC Online Del 2476 (Para 4). \n[5.11] It  is   further   submitted   by  Shri  Soparkar, learned  Counsel  appearing on behalf of the respondent that there are multiple / various  judgments which support the view taken by the Arbitrator that since the  validity and legality of the termination is yet to be adjudicated till then  the order putting the respondent on blacklisting should be stayed subject  to outcome of the final award as the award of the blacklisting  would  depend upon the termination. \nIn   support   of   his   above   submission,   Shri   Soparkar,   learned  Counsel   has   relied   upon   the   decisions   in   the   case   of   (1)  National  Building   Construction   Corporation   Ltd.   vs.   New   Delhi   Municipal  Council   &   Anr.   [138   (2007)   DLT   414   (Para   25)];  (2)  Indian   Oil  Corporation   Ltd.   vs.   SPS   Engineering   Ltd.   [128   (2006)   DLT   417  (Para   16)];  (3)  Prakash   Atlanta   JV   &   Ors.   vs.   National   Highway  Authority of India & Ors. [169 (2010) DLT 664 (Paras 37 & 38)]; (4)  M/s.   Mahavir   Transmission   Udyog   Pvt.   Ltd.   vs.   Punjab   State  Transmission Corporation Ltd. & Ors. [AIR 2014 P&H 21 (Paras 9,  11,   12   &   13)];  (5)  Nagarjuna   Construction   Co.   Ltd.   vs.   State   of  Jharkhand  &  Ors.   [MANU/JH/1211/2011  (Paras  19,  23, 24,  26  & \n28)]  and   (6)  Gujarat   High   Court   -   Centre   for   Development  Communication   vs.   Ahmedabad   Municipal   Corporation   [2017(0)  AIJELHC 237439 (Paras 3, 8.1, 8.2 & 8.3)]. \n[5.12] It  is   further   submitted   by  Shri  Soparkar, learned  Counsel  appearing on behalf of the respondent that as per the settled proposition  of law if the view taken by the learned Arbitrator is a plausible view,  then the same shall not be interfered by the Court in a case where two  inferences are reasonably possible. \n[5.13] It  is   further   submitted   by  Shri  Soparkar, learned  Counsel  appearing on behalf of the respondent that from the separate chronology  of events even by the respondent it can be seen that the respondent has  purchased brand new Prime Mover Diesel Engine of the Make: Kirloskar,  Truck Chassis of Ashok Leyland and Air Compressor of M/s. Positive Gas  &   Air   Equipments   for   which   the   purchase   has   been   paid   by   the  respondent to the  respective  supplier. It is  submitted  that  the  invoice  raised and the payments made by NEFT are on record. It is submitted  that the air compressor is to be aligned with the Diesel Engine with gear  box for smooth running and to be mounted on the Truck Chassis. It is  submitted that therefore, it was to be assembled. It is submitted that on  completion of assembly, it is painted where alignment is carried out and  the equipments are fixed. It is submitted that it is the normal procedure  which  is followed in  such type of assembly. It is submitted  that even  three   independent   inspection   reports   provided   by   the   respondent  provide that the said Air Compressor is new. It is further submitted that  the  Corporation  did  not permit the  respondent to rectify / repair  the  defect as pointed out in the alleged report dated 07.09.2017 though it is  required to be permitted under Clause 3.12.2(G). It is submitted that in  short   the   Corporation   was   determined   to   terminate   the   contract   and  initiate consequence action to put respondent on holiday. It is submitted  that   despite   various   representations   and   offer   by   the   respondent   to  physically check the MAC part by part at the cost of the respondent to  show that it is a new one, the Corporation refused to do it. \n[5.14] It  is   further   submitted   by  Shri  Soparkar, learned  Counsel  appearing on behalf of the respondent that it is pertinent to note that the  maximum   \"punishment\"   that   the   respondent   might   have   to   suffer,   if  termination is found to be valid is to be put on holiday is two years. It is  submitted   that   the   learned   Arbitrator   has   yet   to   adjudicate   whether  termination is valid. It is submitted that pending this adjudication if the  Corporation is permitted to put the respondent on holiday even without  any  adjudication   as   to  the   default  the   respondent  starts  suffering  the  punishment. It is submitted that if the later on the learned Arbitrator  holds   that   the   termination   was   illegal   /   unjustified,   the   loss   that  respondent would suffer for being put on holiday during interregnum  period cannot be compensated. It is submitted that apart from extreme  difficulty, almost impossibility, to prove damages, the second litigation  would involve time, money and energy on both sides. It is submitted that  as against that if pending arbitration the suspension order is stayed the  petitioner   will   not   suffer   at   all   because   as   directed   by   the   learned  Arbitrator, in case if the respondent loses in arbitration proceedings, it  can always be put on holiday for remaining period of two years. It is  submitted that this clearly shows that the balance of convenience is in  favour of the respondent. \n[5.15] It  is   further   submitted   by  Shri  Soparkar, learned  Counsel  appearing on behalf of the respondent that the  respondent has major  business with the Corporation since 1994 and has successfully completed  134 contracts and approximately 44 are running as on March, 2018. It is  submitted that if the respondent is put on holiday for two years and the  said punishment is implemented then the respondent would not be able  to participate in tender inquiries. It is submitted that on the other hand if  the respondent succeeds in arbitration and the termination is set aside  then the order putting the respondent on holiday would not survive but  by then the respondent would have suffered the punishment of holiday  for two years. It is submitted that loss to goodwill and reputation of the  respondent   cannot   be   compensated   in   terms   of   money.   It   is   further  submitted   that   the   financial   loss   cannot   be   compensated   in   terms   of  money as it would be difficult to come to conclusion that in those two  years the respondent would have participated in all the tender inquiries  and that the tender would have been awarded to the respondent and the  profit arising out of such contract could be crystallized. It is submitted  that infact in a decision reported in 2018 SCC Online Guj 805, this Court  did not grant claim towards loss of business caused due to blacklisting as  such business loss was not proved . It is therefore submitted that even for  the respondent it would not be possible to prove business loss for putting  the respondent on holiday by the Corporation. \nIt is further submitted that on the other hand, no loss would be  caused to the Corporation if the Office Order is stayed on a condition  that it would be revived for the remaining period out of total two years  of holiday in case the respondent does not succeed in the arbitration. It  is   further   submitted   that   Clause   18.6   stipulates   that   in   case   of  termination, the obligation of the Corporation to pay shall be limited to  the period up to the date of termination. It is submitted that Clause 35.0  of the contract provides that the respondent shall not be liable whether  in contract, tort or otherwise or any consequential loss or damage, loss  of   use,   loss   of   production   or   loss   of   profits   or   interest   cost   to   the  Corporation. \n[5.16] It  is   further   submitted   by  Shri  Soparkar, learned  Counsel  appearing on behalf of the respondent that infact the respondent is put  on holiday w.e.f. 11.10.2017 by an Office Order dated 15.02.2018. It is  submitted that despite the Office Order dated 15.02.2018 is stayed by  the learned Tribunal and confirmed by the Commercial Court which has  not   stayed   the   said   order,   the   Corporation   on   its   own   have   not  unblocked the Vendor Code and has still disallowed the respondent from  participating in tender inquiries. It is submitted that the respondent is  therefore out of business from 11.10.2017 i.e. for a period of almost 9  months out of the total period of two years. \n[5.17] Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the Corporation  that the proceedings are barred under Order 23 Rule 1 of the Code of  Civil Procedure, 1908, in view of the withdrawal of the petition by the  respondent   is   concerned ,   it   is   submitted   by   Shri   Soparkar,   learned  Counsel for the respondent that the petition was filed challenging the  action   of   blocking   the   Vendor   Code   pending   the   enquiry   to   put   the  respondent on holiday was challenged and the showcause notice dated  18.10.2017. It is submitted that the said petition was withdrawn by an  order dated 02.02.2018  with  permission  of the  High Court to initiate  proceedings for interim measures before the learned Arbitrator who was  by   then   appointed   and   had   fixed   the   meeting   on   06.02.2018.   It   is  submitted   that   the   liberty   was   also   reserved.   It   is   submitted   that   the  permission   was   granted   by   the   High   Court   and   therefore,   the  proceedings cannot be barred under Order 23 Rule 1 of the CPC. It is  further submitted that the Office Order dated 15.02.2018 was not the  subject matter of the petition and therefore also, the provisions of Order  23 Rule 1 of the CPC would not be attracted. It is therefore submitted  that the proceedings are maintainable before the learned Arbitrator. \n[5.18] It  is   further   submitted   by  Shri  Soparkar, learned  Counsel  appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent   that   the   Integrated   Materials  Manual (IMM) is not a part of the contract and hence the said Manual is  not binding upon the respondent. It is submitted that in fact, the show cause   notice   dated   18.10.2017   nowhere   refers   that   the   proceedings  under the said manual is initiated and the said showcause notice dated  18.10.2017 only refers to action under Clause 18.6 of the contract. It is  submitted that hence, the said contention of the Corporation that the  action   under   manual   is   an   afterthought   as   it   was   never   taken   under  Manual under showcause notice dated 18.10.2017. It is submitted that  hence, the action is not independent and distinct of the contract. \n[5.19] It  is   further   submitted   by  Shri  Soparkar, learned  Counsel  appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent   that   the   argument   of   the  Corporation that the relief granted to the respondent is \"Final Relief\" \nand   cannot   be   granted   at   an   interim   stage   is   also   incorrect.   It   is  submitted that in case if it is held that the respondent was at fault, the  order of suspension can be revived. It is submitted that for the present,  however, the issue is pending in arbitration the relief that can be granted  to the respondent. It is submitted that this is only an interim protection  under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act. It is submitted that the learned  Arbitrator would not be and is not been called upon to decide the order  of suspension as an independent dispute. It is submitted that the learned  Arbitrator is required to decide the validity of termination and pending  that adjudication whether such a suspension is called for. \nMaking above submissions and relying upon above decisions, it is  requested to dismiss the present petition. \n[6.0] Heard   learned   Counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respective  parties at length. \nWhat is challenged in the present petition is the impugned order  passed by the learned Commercial Court confirming the order passed by  the learned Arbitral Tribunal under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act and  by way of interim measure the learned Arbitrator has directed to stay  further   implementation   and   operation   of   the   order   passed   by   the  petitioner putting the respondent Contractor on holiday. \n[6.1] It   is   required   to   be   noted   that   as   such   the   respondent   herein  initiated the arbitration proceedings by invoking the arbitration clause -  clause 27 contained in the contract challenging the termination of the  contract and for ancillary reliefs. That the termination of the contract  can be said to be under Clause 18.4 of the contract agreement. However,  thereafter, the proceedings were going on to blacklist / put on holiday  the respondent Contractor and number of notices were issued by which  the respondent Contractor and thereafter its Directors etc. were called  upon to showcause why they may not be put on holiday. Thereafter,  after the contract was terminated and even the arbitration proceedings  were initiated, the order came to be passed by the petitioner putting on  holiday   the   respondent   Contractor   as   well   as   its   Directors   etc.   It   is  required to be noted that as such the respondent Contractor challenged  the order putting them on holiday before this Court by way of Special  Civil Application No.19289/2017, however, thereafter they withdrew the  same   with   a   liberty   to   submit   an   appropriate   application   for   interim  measure   before   the   learned   Arbitrator   under   Section   17   of   the  Arbitration Act. At this stage it is required to be noted that as such the  petition   was   withdrawn   with   a   liberty   to   initiate   proceedings   under  Section 17 of the Arbitration Act. Despite the same while submitting the  application   under   Section   17   for   interim   measure   in   which   the  respondent Contractor prayed for stay of implementation and operation  of the order putting them on holiday, simultaneously they submitted the  application   to   amend   the   statement   of   claim   challenging   the   order  putting them on hold / blacklisting them which came to be allowed. The  statement of claim was  also permitted  to be amended. The petitioner  submitted   the   application   under   Section   16   of   the   Arbitration   Act  challenging the jurisdiction of the learned Arbitral Tribunal to consider  the   question   with   respect   to   the   subsequent   action   of   putting   the  Contractor   and   its   Directors   etc.   on   holiday.   The   learned   Arbitrator  decided  and disposed of section  16 application  by detailed order and  held that it had jurisdiction to consider the issue / question with respect  to putting the respondent Contractor and its Directors etc. on holiday. It  is required to be noted that simultaneously on the very day the learned  Arbitrator   has   passed   the   impugned   order   in   an   application   under  Section 17 of the Arbitration Act simply following the reasonings and the  observations made while disposing of section 16 application. It is true  that order passed under Section 16 of the Arbitration Act has not been  challenged. However, at the same time, considering the provisions of the  Arbitration Act as well as the Commercial Courts Act , the same cannot  be challenged and even the order passed by the learned Arbitrator on  jurisdiction can be challenged only in an appeal against the final award.  Even that is so observed by the learned Commercial Court. Under the  circumstances   and   even   considering   the   fact   that   while   deciding   and  disposing   of   section   17   application,   the   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   has  solely   considered   the   reasoning   and   finding   recorded   while   deciding  section 16 application, nonchallenge to the order passed in section 16  application   shall  not  come  in  the   way  of  the  petitioner   to  the   extent  pointing out the balance of convenience.  \n[6.2] It  is   mainly  contended  on   behalf   of   the   respondent  that   as  the  subsequent   order   of   putting   the   Contractor   and   its   Director   etc.   on  holiday   is   a   consequence   of   order   of   termination   of   contract   and  considering Clause 18 of the contract agreement, the same can be said to  be a continuous cause of action and therefore, in arbitration proceedings  challenging the termination of the contract, the same can be permitted  to be agitated before the learned Arbitral Tribunal. It is also the case on  behalf   of   the   respondent   Contractor   that  when   the  notice   was  issued  invoking   the   arbitration   clause   challenging   the   termination   of   the  contract, the notice was very wide including the question with respect to  the blacklisting and therefore, the order of blacklisting and/or putting  the   respondent   on   holiday   can   be   the   subject   matter   of   arbitration  proceedings even without issuing any fresh notice. \n[6.3] On the other hand, it is the specific case on behalf of the petitioner  that the order putting the Contract and its Directors on holiday is not a  consequence  of   the   termination   of   the   contract  and  it  is  altogether   a  different cause of action relying  upon the General Manual and it has  nothing to do with the termination of the contract. It is also the case on  behalf   of   the   petitioner   that   even   at   the   time   when   the   arbitration  proceedings   were   initiated   while   issuing   the   notice   invoking   the  arbitration   clause   and   even   when   the   arbitration   proceedings  commenced,   no   order   blacklisting   the   respondent   was   passed   and  therefore,   considering   relevant   clause   more   particularly   considering  Clause  27 without  issuing   any specific  notice  invoking  the  arbitration  clause even with respect to the blacklisting the arbitration proceedings  cannot be commenced and therefore, without following the procedure as  required under Clause 27 the learned Arbitrator has no jurisdiction. \n[6.4] Having heard learned Counsel appearing for respective parties at  length   and   considering   the   material   on   record   more   particularly   the  execution of notices, notice invoking arbitration clause, relevant clauses  of the contract agreement more particularly Clause 18 and Clause 27  and the order terminating the contract and the subsequent order putting  the  respondent Contractor and its Directors on holiday and the stand  taken   by   the   respective   parties,   we   are   of   the   opinion   that   that   the  subsequent   action   /   order   putting   the   respondent   Contractor   and   its  Directors on holiday is not the consequence of the termination of the  contract. It  prima facie  appears that the  order putting  the  respondent  Contractor and its Directors on holiday is not passed under Clause 18 of  the contract agreement. The subsequent order / action is altogether a  different cause of action and is passed under General Contract Manual  and   not   under   Clause   18.   Under   the   circumstances,   we   are   of   the  opinion that there are serious disputes with respect to even jurisdiction  of the learned Arbitral Tribunal to entertain and consider the dispute  with respect to putting the respondent Contractor and its Directors on  holiday. At this stage it is required to be noted that the order blacklisting  the respondent Contractor and its Directors cannot be said to be under  Clause   18   as   in   Clause   18   there   is   no   question   of   even   putting   the  Directors of the respondent Contractor on holiday. The relevant Clause  18 is already reproduced herein above. Therefore, the decisions which  are   relied   upon   by   the   learned   Counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the  respondent   that   in   support   of   his   submission   that   as   the   order  blacklisting / putting on holiday the respondent Contractor can be said  to be the consequence of the termination of the contract and therefore,  the same shall be permissible in a arbitration proceedings challenging  the   termination   of   the   contract   are   not   applicable   in   the   facts   and  circumstances of the case. \n[6.5] It   is   required   to   be   noted   that   even   the   day   on   which   the  arbitration clause was invoked and the notice was issued and even the  arbitration proceedings commenced in which the only dispute was with  respect to termination of the contract, no cause of action with respect to  blacklisting the respondent Contractor and/or putting them on holiday  had arisen. \n[6.6] It is also required to be noted that when the arbitration clause was  invoked and the notice was issued invoking the arbitration clause the  only dispute raised was with respect to the termination of the contract.  Considering   various   notices   and   the   notice   invoking   the   arbitration  clause,   it   cannot   be   said   that   the   same   was   also   with   respect   to   the  action putting the respondent Contractor and its Director on holiday. At  that stage as observed herein above even the  same was  at the  show cause notice stage. Blocking the Vendor Code has nothing to do with the  subsequent order putting the respondent Contractor and its Directors on  holiday. \n[6.7] Under the circumstances and considering the aforesaid facts and  circumstances there are very serious contentious issues with respect to  the jurisdiction of the learned Arbitral Tribunal to consider and decide  the   dispute   with   respect   to   the   order   blacklisting   the   respondent  Contractor and/or putting them on holiday. The same is required to be  considered while considering the balance of convenience and prima facie   case. \n[6.8] Even   otherwise   on   facts   and   considering   serious   allegations  enumerated   in   the   order   blacklisting   and/or   putting   on   holiday   the  respondent Contractor and its Directors more particularly with respect to  the   fraud   committed   in   supplying   old   machinery   etc.,   we   are   of   the  opinion   that   both,   the   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   as   well   as   learned  Commercial   Court   have   materially   erred   in   holding   the   balance   of  convenience and prima facie case in favour of the respondent Contractor. \n[6.9] Even otherwise we are of the opinion that such an order of staying  the  order passed by the  appropriate  Authority putting  the  respondent  Contractor   and   its   Directors   on   holiday   cannot   be   stayed   by   way   of  interim measure in an application under Section 17 of the Arbitration  Act. Nobody can be compelled to enter into the contract. If at all any  remedy is there, it is to claim damages afterwards but by way of such  interim measure such an order keeping in abeyance the order passed by  the   appropriate   Authority   putting   the   Contractor   on   holiday   and/or  blacklisting   them   is   not   justified.   Under   the   circumstances   both,   the  learned Arbitral Tribunal as well as the learned Commercial Court have  materially erred in holding the balance of convenience, prima facie case  and irreparable loss in favour of the respondent. Therefore, in the facts  and circumstances of the case the decisions relied upon by the learned  Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent shall not be applicable to  the facts of the case on hand more particularly with respect to serious  allegations   of   fraud,   cheating   etc.   of   supplying   old   machinery   and  treating and showing them as new machinery after painting the same.   \n[6.10] We   do   not   further   observe   anything   on   merits   as   it   may  affect either parties in other proceedings may be proceedings pending  before the learned Arbitral Tribunal. Suffice it to say that in the facts and  circumstances of the case the learned Arbitral Tribunal was not justified  in passing such an order of interim measure in exercise of powers under  Section  17 of the  Arbitration  Act.  The  learned Commercial  Court  has  materially erred in confirming the same. \n[7.0] In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, present  Special   Civil   Application   succeeds.   Impugned   order   dated   31.05.2018  passed by the learned Commercial Court, City Civil Court, Ahmedabad in  Civil Misc.

(b) the defendants, after entering appearance, have filed their written statement in the month of january 2010. thereafter, issues were framed on 27.06.2014. after framing of issues, the court directed both sides to file affidavit of documents and give the list of witnesses within a period of three weeks and further two weeks' time was given for inspection of documents. (c) the appellant/plaintiff filed affidavit of documents on 24.07.2014. thereafter, the matter was posted before the learned additional master o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 no.iv, high court of madras, for recording evidence. the trial commenced in the month of december 2016. mr.sunil kapoor, manager of the plaintiff-company filed proof affidavit. on 05.12.2016, chief examination of p.w.1 was recorded and exs.p-1 to p-19 were marked. again, on 08.12.2016, chief examination of p.w.1 continued and exhibits upto ex.p-24 were marked. thereafter, the matter was posted for cross examination of p.w.1. (d) at this juncture, the respondents/defendants had filed application in a.no.1243 of 2017 to eschew exs.p-2, 6, 7, 10, 23, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11 marked on the side of the plaintiff. in the affidavit filed in support of application in a.no.1243 of 2017, it is stated by the defendants that these documents were erroneously marked in the suit and the said documents could be classified as (i) photocopies of the documents (secondary evidence), (ii) incomplete documents or illegible and (iii) e.mail correspondences not falling under the above said categories. (e) the said application was opposed by the appellant/plaintiff by filing counter affidavit(s). (f) the learned single judge, after considering the submissions made o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 on either side had partly allowed the said application in a.no.1243 of 2017 on 30.06.2017. the concluding portion of the order reads as follows: \"13. in fine, the application is partly allowed and the documents marked as ex.p6, ex.p7 and ex.p23, ex.p10 series (xiv) and ex.p23 are ordered to be eschewed. with respect to other documents, ex.p2, ex.p5 series, ex.p8 series (ii, iii, iv, vi, viii, ix), ex.p9 series (i, ii, iii), ex.p10 series (xiv), ex.p11 series (v, vi, viii, xv) and ex.p12 the learned additional master is directed to verify and substitute the same.\" (g) the reason for ordering eschewing the above exhibits, namely ex.p6, ex.p7 and ex.p23, ex.p10 series (xiv) and ex.p23, by the learned single judge, was that, without an application to receive the secondary evidence under section 65 of the indian evidence act, the photocopies of the documents cannot be marked. (h) thereafter, the appellant/plaintiff filed application in a.no.6383 of 2017 to permit the applicant to produce and mark xerox copies of letter dated 30.10.2006, 11.12.2006 and 20.04.2008 and invoice dated 15.11.2008, as secondary evidence, which were originally marked as exs.p6, 7, 10 (xiv) and 23 and subsequently eschewed. the plaintiff also filed o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 application in a.no.6384 of 2017 to permit him to file the affidavit of mr.r.rajagopalan, the applicant's accounts manager and systems incharge, in support of the proof affidavit of p.w.1, dated 08.12.2016 in compliance with section 65-b of the indian evidence act, 1872. (i) in the common affidavit filed in support of the above said two applications in a.nos.6383 and 6384 of 2017 in c.s.no.220 of 2009, the plaintiff stated that, inspite of the best efforts, the original of exs.p-6, 7, 10 (xiv) and 23, could not be traced and since these documents were essential to prove the case of the plaintiff, they should be allowed to mark them as secondary evidence. (j) opposing the said applications, defendants 2 and 3 have filed common counter affidavit stating that, under the guise of seeking leave of the court for marking the documents as secondary evidence, the plaintiff was attempting to mark the documents that have already been eschewed. seeking the leave of the court prior to marking documents in secondary evidence under section 65 of the indian evidence act, is not merely a technical formality, but a mandatory pre-requisite, considering the seriousness of marking such documents. the applicant/plaintiff having o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 failed to seek leave of the court at the relevant time (prior to marking of such documents), ought not to have been granted such leave after having failed to make good the opportunity and consequent to the order of this court eschewing the said documents, and thus prayed to dismiss the said applications. (k) by the impugned order dated 11.08.2018 passed in a.nos.6383 and 6384 of 2017 in c.s.no.220 of 2009, the learned single judge dismissed the said applications holding as follows: \"20. in the present case, the applicant had suffered an adverse order not only because they had not filed any application seeking permission to mark secondary documents. the plaintiff has not taken the order dated 30.06.2017 on appeal. the order had worked itself out. this court had declared that the documents have to be eschewed. once a definite pronouncement had been made it would be highly inappropriate to once again revisit the said order. the plaintiff cannot claim ignorance of the fundamental provision to seek permission before filing secondary documents. having not done so and having suffered an adverse order, the plaintiff cannot be permitted to file an application just because an application has to be filed and then seek permission to file xerox copies of documents which have been eschewed from the records. 21. i hold that the plaintiff had not come to court with clean hands or with true reasons. it o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 appears to be an affidavit more for the sake of formality than for the sake of compliance with the provisions of the law. in the present applications, the plaintiff has sworn to an affidavit only because they were found fault with that they had not filed such application earlier. the plaintiff cannot take judicial proceedings for granted and in such a casual manner. a pronouncement eschewing documents has its own sanctity and cannot be revisited for the mere asking. even otherwise the reasons given that the letters could not be traced is a very weak reason to be given by a private limited company wherein it is expected that records must be maintained with due diligence. i am not able to convince myself to accept those reasons. 22. all the reasons stated above, i hold that plaintiff's applications will have to be dismissed. 23. a.nos.6383 and 6384 of 2017 are dismissed. no costs.\" aggrieved by the same, the present appeals have been filed by the plaintiff. 4. when these appeals were taken up for hearing, a preliminary objection was raised by the learned counsel appearing for the defendants with regard to the maintainability of these appeals. the reasons for such an objection are as follows: (i) as per clause 15 of the letters patent, an intra court appeal would lie only from a judgment. the impugned order passed in the applications cannot be termed as \"judgment\". hence, these appeals are not maintainable. o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 (ii) though, originally the suit was filed on the original side of this court, subsequently the said suit was transferred to the commercial division of this court. the impugned order was passed by the learned single judge on 11.8.2018 on the commercial division of this court. hence, these appeals are not maintainable under section 13 of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015 (act 4 of 2016) (for short, 'cca'). 5. since the question of maintainability had arisen, the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff firstly proceeded to make his submissions with regard to the maintainability of the appeals. 6. the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff submitted that the present appeals are maintainable under clause 15 of the letters patent. he submits that section 13 of the cca is not applicable to the facts of the present case. 7. with regard to the non-applicability of section 13 of the cca, the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff submitted that, the suit was filed in february 2009 on the original side of this court. the commercial o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 division of the madras high court was notified, vide, tamil nadu government gazzette no.381 in part vi, section 1 in r.o.c.no.3233/a/2016/g4, dated 29.11.2017, whereas application no.1243 of 2017 was filed in february 2009 even before the suit was transferred to the commercial division of the high court from the original side of this court. it is also submitted that applications nos.6383 and 6384 of 2017 in c.s.no.220 of 2009, filed by the plaintiff, were taken on record in august 2017 itself. the defendants filed their counter affidavit to the said applications only in january 2018 and order under appeals were passed on 11.08.2018. he submits that there could be four possible situations in filing the appeals against the interlocutory orders passed in the suit instituted before the the original side of this court. according to the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff, the four scenarios are as follows: (i) appeals filed against interlocutory orders passed in applications filed under relevant provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (cpc), read with the original side rules of this court (o.s. rules), where the order under appeal, was passed before notification of the commercial division, but where the appeal is heard after such notification; o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 (ii) appeals filed against interlocutory orders passed in applications filed under relevant provisions of the cpc and os rules, where such application was filed before the notification of commercial division, but where the orders under appeals were passed after the notification of the commercial division; (iii) appeals filed against orders passed in interlocutory applications filed under relevant provisions of the cpc and os rules, and not under any specific provision of the cca, where the application itself was filed after notification of the commercial division and after transfer of the suit to the commercial division and where the order was passed by the commercial division, and (iv) appeals filed against interlocutory orders passed in applications filed under the specific provisions of the cca. 8. it is submitted that the appeals against orders in scenario (i) would lie under clause 15 of the letters patent and will not be governed by section 13 of the cca, while appeal against the orders in scenario (iv) will be strictly governed by the rigours of section 13 cca. but the issue that o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 falls for consideration in these appeals is as to whether the bar under section 13 of the cca would apply to interlocutory orders in scenarios (ii) and (iii). the appellant's case is concerned under scenario (ii). the learned counsel submitted that section 13 of the cca will have no application for scenario (ii) and (iii). hence, according to him, intra-court appeal will lie under clause 15 of the letters patent before the division bench of this court. 9. it is further submitted that, right to prefer an appeal is a statutory right. such right accrues on the date on which the suit was originally instituted. though such right is a procedural right, it vests with a substantial right on the person as on the date of institution of original action. while so, such right cannot be curtailed by a subsequent statute or an amendment of the same statute, unless the statute itself either expressly or by necessary implication, makes it retrospective. in support of this contention, the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff relied on the decision of the supreme court in garikapati vs. subbiah choudhry, reported in air 1957 sc 540, wherein it has been held as follows:\"23. from the decisions cited above the following o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 principle clearly emerge: (i) that the legal pursuit of a remedy, suit appeal and second appeal are really but steps in a series of proceedings all connected by an intrinsic unity and are regarded as one legal proceeding. (ii) the right of appeal is not a mere matter of procedure but is a substantive right. (iii) the institution of the suit carries with it the implication that all rights of appeal then in force are preserved to the parties thereto till the rest of the career of the suit. (iv) the right of appeal is a vested right and such a right to enter the superior court accrues to the litigant and exists as on and from the date the lis commences and although it may be actually exercised when the adverse judgment is pronounced such right is to be governed by the law prevailing at the date of the institution of the suit or proceeding and not by the law that prevails at the date of its decision or at the date of the filing of the appeal. (v) this vested right of appeal can be taken away only by a subsequent enactment, if it so provides expressly or by necessary intendment and not otherwise.\" 10. in the case of hitendra vishnu thakur and others vs. state of maharashtra\" reported in 1994 (4) scc 602, the following issue fell for consideration:. \"25. clause (b) of sub-section (4) of section 20 of tada act was amended by the amendment act no.43 of 1993 with effect from 22-5-1993. o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 besides reducing the maximum period during which an accused under tada could be kept in custody pending investigation from one year to 180 days, the amendment act also introduced clause (bb) to subsection (4) of section 20 enabling the prosecution to seek extension of time for completion of the investigation. does the amendment act no. 43 of 1993 have retrospective operation and does the amendment apply to the cases which were pending investigation on the date when the amendment act came into force?\" there were cases where on 22-5-1993, where the period of 180 days had already expired but the period of one year was not yet over. the supreme court, in the said case of hitendra vishnu thakur, answered the issue as follows:\"28. .. .. we are, thus, of the opinion that amendment act 43 insofar as it modifies the period prescribed in clause (b) and introduces clause (bb) to sub-section (4) of section 20 would apply retrospectively and apply to pending cases as well. we are unable to persuade ourselves to agree with mr khanwilkar that clause (b) only and not clause (bb) of sub-section (4) of section 20 should be held to have retrospective operation. the acceptance of such an argument would result in the creating of an anomalous situation and defeat the very object with o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 which clause (bb) was introduced after the period of compulsory detention was curtailed under clause (b) of section 20(4) of the act. 29. as a result of our above discussion, it follows that amendment act 43 of 1993 is retrospective in operation and both clauses (b) and (bb) of sub-section (4) of section 20 of tada apply to the cases which were pending investigation on the date when the amendment came into force with effect from 22-5-1993 and in which the challan had not been filed till then. 30. in conclusion, we may (even at the cost of repetition) say that an accused person seeking bail under section 20(4) has to make an application to the court for grant of bail on grounds of 'default' of the prosecution and the court shall release the accused on bail after notice to the public prosecutor uninfluenced by the gravity of the offence or the merits of the prosecution case since section 20(8) does not control the grant of bail under section 20(4) of tada and both the provisions operate in separate and independent fields. it is, however, permissible for the public prosecutor to resist the grant of bail by seeking an extension under clause (bb) by filing a report for the purpose before the court. however, no extension shall be granted by the court without notice to an accused to have his say regarding the prayer for grant of extension under clause (bb). in this view of the matter, it is immaterial whether the application for bail on ground of 'default' under section 20(4) is filed first or the report as envisaged by clause (bb) is filed by the public prosecutor first so long as both are considered while granting or refusing bail. if the period prescribed by clause (b) of section 20(4) has expired and the court does not o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 grant an extension on the report of the public prosecutor made under clause (bb), the court shall release the accused on bail as it would be an indefeasible right of the accused to be so released. even where the court grants an extension under clause (bb) but the charge-sheet is not filed within the extended period, the court shall have no option but to release the accused on bail if he seeks it and is prepared to furnish the bail as directed by the court. moreover, no extension under clause (bb) can be granted by the designated court except on a report of the public prosecutor nor can extension be granted for reasons other than those specifically contained in clause (bb) which must be strictly construed.\" the plaintiff relied on the decision of the apex court in videocon international limited vs. securities and exchange board of india, reported in 2015 (4) scc 33, in which, the supreme court held as follows: \"38. .. .. .. insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, it would be pertinent to mention, that a right of appeal can be availed of only when it is expressly conferred. when such a right is conferred, its parameters are also laid down. a right of appeal may be absolute i.e. without any limitations. or, it may be a limited right. the above position is understandable, from a perusal of the unamended and amended section 15-z of the sebi act. under the unamended section 15-z, the appellate remedy to the high court, against an order passed by the securities appellate tribunal, was circumscribed by the words \". on any question of fact or law arising out of such order\". the amended section 15-z, while altering the appellate forum o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 from the high court to the supreme court, curtailed and restricted the scope of the appeal, against an order passed by the securities appellate tribunal, by expressing that the remedy could be availed of \". on any question of law arising out of such order\". it is, therefore apparent, that the right to appeal, is available in different packages, and that, the amendment to section 15-z, varied the scope of the second appeal provided under the sebi act. 39. as illustrated above, an appellate remedy is available in different packages. what falls within the parameters of the package at the initial stage of the lis or dispute, constitutes the vested substantive right of the litigant concerned. an aggrieved party, is entitled to pursue such a vested substantive right, as and when, an adverse judgment or order is passed. such a vested substantive right can be taken away by an amendment, only when the amended provision, expressly or by necessary intendment, so provides. failing which, such a vested substantive right can be availed of, irrespective of the law which prevails, at the date when the order impugned is passed, or the date when the appeal is preferred. for, it has repeatedly been declared by this court, that the legal pursuit of a remedy, suit, appeal and second appeal, are steps in a singular proceeding. all these steps, are connected by an intrinsic unity, and are regarded as one legal proceeding.\" in fact, the supreme court in 2015 (4) scc 33 (cited supra) has stated the same position in garikapati veeraya vs. subbiah choudhry and others reported in air 1957 sc 540 (cited supra). in this connection, following passage from the said judgment may be referred to:o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 \"56. considering the question on principle, an appeal is a proceeding by which the correctness of the decision of an inferior court is challenged before a superior court. a right of appeal therefore can arise by its very nature only when a decision by which a litigant is aggrieved is given, and it sounds paradoxical to say that it arises even before judgment in the case is pronounced. now, what reason can there be for holding that a right of appeal vests in a suitor at the commencement of the proceedings? if it is to be held not to arise on the date of judgment, then why should it be held to arise on the institution of the proceedings, and not on the date of the transaction which forms the foundation for those proceedings? if it is to be said that when a litigant commences a proceeding he acts on the expectation that a right of appeal existing under the then law with reference to that proceeding would not be taken away, it could likewise be said that when a person enters into a transaction, he does so in the expectation that the right of action and of appeal in relation thereto under the then law would be available to him for the enforcement of his rights under the transaction. and no one has asserted that a right of appeal is to be determined on the law as it stood on the date of the transaction. 57. then again, if the right of appeal arises at the commencement of the action, in whom does it vest, the plaintiff or the defendant ? it is the suitor who is aggrieved by the decision that has a right to prefer an appeal against it, and it might, according to the result, be either the one or the other, and if the theory that a right of appeal arises when the proceedings are commenced is to be accepted, it must be held to vest at that point of time both in the plaintiff and the defendant, and cease on the determination of the cause as regards the party who succeeds, and where the success is partial, to the extent of that success. can anything so nebulous and contingent be regarded as a right o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 and as a right which vests before a decision is given. the judgment in colonial sugar refining company vs. irving (1905) ac 369 does not disclose the reasoning on which it is based. lord macnaghten no doubt refers to \"a long line of authorities from the time of lord coke to the present day\", and they are presumably what are referred to in the argument of counsel at p.370. but when examined, they do not bear on this point. lord coke, in commenting on the statute of gloucester (6, edward i, chap 78, section 3) which prohibited alienations of tenement, stated: \"this extendeth to alienations made after the statute and not before; for it is a rule of law of parliament that regularly nova constitutio futuris forman imponere debet, non praeteritis\" (a new statute regulates future conduct and not past. (2 inst. 292)\". from this passage, one may say that legislation does not affect a right of appeal, which has accrued. but it throws no light on the questions when that right accrues, whether at the commencement of the action or on the pronouncement of the decision. \" .. . .. 70. when the law establishes a hierarchy of courts and then provides in succession for appeals from a court of the lower grade to one of the higher grade, it will not be correct to regard those appeals as forming a single proceedings, or the right to file them as a single right. if a suit is instituted in court a and the law permits an appeal against its decision to court b, and if the law further provides for an appeal from the decision of court b, to court c, and there is again a right of further appeal provided against the decision of court c to court d, the successive appeals from court a to court b, court b to court c and o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 from court c to court d are distinct proceedings independent of one another. how then can the right of appeal from one court to another be held to comprise within it the right of appeal from that court to a third court? section 96 of the code of civil procedure provides for an appeal from a decree passed by the trial court, and under that provision the decision in a suit instituted in the court of a district munsif will be open to appeal to the district court. section 100 of the code of civil procedure provides for further appeal from the judgment of the district court to the high court; but this right of second appeal is much more limited than that given under section 96. it lies only when there is a question of law, and it is also subject in certain cases, to pecuniary limitations. thus, the rights of appeal conferred by sections 96 and 100 of the code of civil procedure are different in their quality and contents. then again, under sections 109 and 110 of the code of civil procedure a further appeal is provided against the decision of the high court to this court subject again to certain conditions. this is a right different in its character from the right of appeal conferred by section 96 or section 100. the notion, therefore, that if a suitor has a right of appeal from court a to court b, that right includes a right of appeal from court b to court c and again from court c to court d, would appear to be untenable. 71. viewing the question next from the point of view of the jurisdiction of the court, a right which is given to a suitor to challenge the decision of court a in appeal is only a right to challenge it before court b, which is authorised to hear appeals from court a. it cannot extend to a possible appeal from court b to court c, because court c is not a court authorised to entertain an appeal against the decision of court a, and it will be an error to speak of the suitor in court a having a right of appeal to court c to which under the law an appeal cannot lie. section 96 of the code of civil o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 procedure brings out the position quite unmistakably, when it provides that an appeal shall lie \"to the court authorised to hear appeals from the decisions of such court\". and if, as already pointed out, under the scheme of the code an appeal from court a to court b is a proceeding distinct and different from an appeal from court b to court c, and that is a feature which runs through the entire succession of appeals under the code, it will be inconsistent with that scheme to hold that when a suitor commences an action in court a, a right vests in him at that time not merely to appeal from court c to court b, as held in colonial sugar refining company vs. irving (1905) ac 369 but also from court b to court c and from court c to court d. the decision in colonial sugar refining company vs. irving (1905) ac 369 on which this conclusion in sadar ali vs. dalimuddin (1929) ilr 56 cal 512 is based, is clearly no authority in support of it.\" 11. by placing reliance on the aforesaid judgments, the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff reiterated that since the applications were filed during august 2017, before the cca was notified in madras, the vested right of the plaintiff cannot be taken away. the documents in question along with affidavit of documents were filed as early as on 24.07.2014. the four documents in question were marked as exhibits on 08.12.2016 along with an affidavit of mr.sunil kapoor under section 65-b o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 of the indian evidence act. it is only in this background of order dated 30.06.2017 eschewing documents, the plaintiff was constrained to file the applications in question during august 2017. therefore, the right of appeal accrued to the plaintiff on the date of filing the suit is february 2009 when the \"lis\" commenced. it is submitted even otherwise, the \"lis\" commenced, when the applications were filed during august 2017. it is submitted that in august 2017, the commercial courts act (cca) had not been notified and thus the right of appeal was governed by clause 15 of the letters patent. even though the order under appeal was passed after notification dated 29.11.2017 issued under section 4 of the cca, the right of appeal has to be construed as governed by the law on the date of institution of the \"lis\", as held in the above decisions of the supreme court. 12. the learned counsel for the plaintiff further submitted that there is nothing to indicate in the provisions of the cca that the provisions therein, will apply with retrospective effect. if the intention of the legislature is to divest a litigant his vested right, it must be positively stated in a statute. in the absence of any such indication, the provisions of the cca can apply only prospectively. therefore, the learned counsel for the plaintiff o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 contended that the present appeal is maintainable under clause 15 of the letters patent. in this regard, the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff invited the attention of this court to the decision of a division bench of this court in the case of rubinetterie bresciane bonomi spa vs. lehry instrumentation and values private limited, reported in 2019 (4) ctc 188, to contend that, right of appeal under the letter patent would continue to be available to all the orders passed in the proceedings in all suits pending on the date of the coming into force of the cca. therefore, he submitted that section 13 of the cca will not apply to this case. he also relied on the judgments of the delhi high court: (i) in eros resorts and hotels vs. explorer associates, reported in 2018 scc online delhi 8945 and (ii) in bhramos vs. fiitjee limited, reported in 2019 scc online delhi 7282, wherein, it was held that where the appeals were filed before the suits were transferred to the commercial division, section 13 of the cca were not applicable. it was also held therein that an \"appellate remedy\" becomes a \"vested right\" to a party on the date when the dispute / lis is instituted. therefore, it was held that the \"right to appeal\" would have accrued to the appellant and it had become a \"vested right\" on the date of o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 filing of the suit or at worst, on the date when the plaintiff filed the application which culminated in the impugned orders. 13. with regard to the judgment of the division bench of this court in magic frames and others vs. radiance media private limited, reported in 2019 (4) ctc 497 = 2019 (3) lw 385 = 2019 (5) mlj 479, in which one of us (r. subbiah, j was a member), it is submitted that the ratio laid down in the said judgment will not apply to the facts of the case on hand, inasmuch as the order which was under challenge in the said decision was passed by the commercial court under order 13 a of the code of civil procedure, as amended by the cca viz., application for summary judgment to decree the suit. in that case, the entire procedure was governed by the provisions of cca. however, in the present case, the applications were filed when the commercial division had not been notified under section 4 of the cca and therefore, the vested \"right of appeal\" of plaintiff as an appellant under clause 15 of the letters patent, cannot be curtailed. 14. in respect of scenario (iii) mentioned above, the learned counsel for the plaintiff invited the attention of this court to the judgment delivered by the division bench of this court in o.s.a.nos.13 to 15 of 2020, dated o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 05.02.2020 (m/s.kapoor imaging private limited vs. m/s.kodak (india) private limited), reported in cdj 2020 mhc 1737 and submitted that this court applied the principle elucidated by the supreme court in the case of garikapati vs. subbiah choudhry and other, reported in air 1957 sc 540 as well as videocon international limitaed vs. securities and exchange board of india, reported in 2015 (4) scc 33 and held that appeal is maintainable under clause 15 of letters patent. in that case, the commercial division assumed jurisdiction on 16.08.2019 and issues were framed on 17.09.2019. therefore, the appellant therein who is also the appellant in the present case, filed an application seeking to mark additional documents under order vii rule 14 (4) of cpc on 17.09.2019. an objection was raised by the respondent under order ix of cpc and amended by the cca stating that under order ix of cpc, as amended by cca, require that all the documents should be filed along with the plaint. therefore, order vii rule 14 cpc does not apply by virtue of order ix rule 7 of amended cpc. the same was rejected by the division bench of this court in the said case in o.s.a.nos.13 to 15 of 2020 (supra) observing that the right available under the code of civil procedure in a suit which o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 has been transferred, cannot be taken away as the right is substantial in nature. therefore, it is submitted that, section 13 of the cca is not a bar for the maintainability of the present appeals before this court under clause 15 of the letters patent. 15. with regard to the applicability of clause 15 of the letters patent, the learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that, to file an appeal against the order, first, it has to be seen as to whether the said \"order\" amounts to a \"judgment\" within the meaning of clause 15 of the letters patent. in this regard, the learned counsel for the plaintiff invited the attention of this court to shah babulal khimji vs. jayaben d.kania and another, reported in 1981 (4) scc 8, wherein, it was held as follows:\"113. the concept of a judgment as defined by the code of civil procedure seems to be rather narrow and the limitations engrafted by sub-s. (2) of s.2 cannot be physically imported into the definition of the word 'judgment' as used in cl.15 of the letters patent because the letters patent has advisedly not used the terms 'order' or 'decree' anywhere. the intention, therefore, of the givers of the letters patent was that the word 'judgment' should receive a much wider and more liberal interpretation than the word 'judgment' used in the code of civil procedure. at the same time, it cannot be said that any order passed by a trial judge would amount to a judgment; otherwise, there will be no end to the number of orders which would be appealable under the letter patent. it seems to us o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 that the word 'judgment' has undoubtedly a concept of finality in a broader and not a narrower sense. in other words, a judgment can be of three kinds:1. 2. 3. intermediary or interlocutory judgment: most of the interlocutory orders which contain the quality of finality are clearly specified in clauses (a) to (w) of order 43 rule 1 and have already been held by us to be judgments within the meaning of the letters patent and, therefore, appealable. there may also be interloctory orders which are not covered by o.43 r.1, but which also possess the characteristics and trappings of finality in that, the orders may adversely affect a valuable right of the party or decide an important aspect of the trial in an ancillary proceeding. before such an order can be a judgment the adverse effect on the party concerned must be direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote. 114. in the course of the trial, the trial judge may pass a number of orders whereby some of the various steps to be taken by the parties in prosecution of the suit may be of routine nature while other orders may cause some inconvenience to one party or the other, e.g., an order refusing an adjournment, an order refusing to summon an additional witness or documents, an order refusing to condone delay in filing documents, after the first date of hearing an order of costs to one of the parties for its default or an order exercising discretion in respect of a procedural matter against one party or the other. such orders are purely interlocutory and cannot constitute judgments because it will always be open to the aggrieved party to make a grievance of the order passed against the party concerned in the appeal against the final judgment passed by the trial judge. 115. thus, in other words every interlocutory order cannot be regarded as a judgment but only those orders would be judgments which decide matters of moment or affect vital o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 and valuable rights of the parties and which work serious injustice to the party concerned. similarly, orders passed by the trial judge deciding question of admissibility or relevancy of a document also cannot be treated as judgments because the grievance on this score can be corrected by the appellate court in appeal against the final judgment.\" 16. the learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that, going by the above dictum, the rejection of an application filed for taking the documents on record before the first hearing of the suit, would be a \"judgment\". in this case, four disputed documents were filed before the first hearing, before the trial commenced with the filing of proof affidavit. subsequently, with a view to cure certain defects pointed, applications were filed. if the procedural defects are not cured, the same cannot be corrected in an \"appeal\" filed against \"judgment\" that may be subsequently delivered in the suit. in this regard, the learned counsel for the plaintiff referred to paragraph no.115 of the decision of the supreme court in the case of shah babulal khimji case (supra), and submitted that, all orders pertaining to admissibility and relevancy of a document, cannot be treated as \"judgment\", o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 unless the grievance on this score can be corrected by the appellate court in an \"appeal\" against the \"final judgment\". in this regard, the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff also relied on a decision in the case of r.v.e.venkatachala gounder vs. arumigh visweswaraswami and v.p. temple and another, reported in 2003 (8) scc 752 and the relevant paragraph of the same reads thus:\"20. the objections as to admissibility of documents in evidence may be classified into two classes:(i) an objection that the document which is sought to be proved is itself inadmissible in evidence; and (ii) where the objection does not dispute the admissibility of the document in evidence but is directed towards the mode of proof alleging the same to be irregular or insufficient. in the first case, merely a document has been marked as an exhibit, an objection as to its admissibility is not excluded and is available to be raised even at a later stage or even in appeal or revision. in the latter case, the objection should be taken when the evidence is tendered and once the document has been admitted in evidence and marked as an exhibit, the objection that it should not have been admitted in evidence or that the mode adopted for proving the document is irregular cannot be allowed to be raised at any stage subsequent to the marking of the document as an exhibit. the latter proposition is a rule of fair play. the crucial test is whether an objection, if taken at the appropriate point of time, would have enabled the party tendering the evidence to cure the defect and resort to such mode of proof as would be regular. the omission to object becomes fatal because by his failure the party entitled to object allows the party tendering the evidence to act on an assumption that the o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 opposite party is not serious about the mode of proof. on the other hand, a prompt objection does not prejudice the party tendering the evidence, for two reasons; firstly, it enables the court to apply its mind and pronounce its decision on the question of admissibility then and there; and secondly, in the event of finding of the court on the mode of proof sought to be adopted going against the party tendering the evidence, the opportunity of seeking indulgence of the court for permitting a regular mode or method of proof and thereby removing the objection raised by the opposite party, is available to the party leading the evidence. such practice and procedure is fair to both the parties. out of the two types of objections, referred to hereinabove in the latter case, failure to raise a prompt and timely objection amounts to waiver of the necessity for insisting on formal proof of a document, the document itself which is sought to be proved being admissible in evidence. in the first case, acquiescence would be no bar to raising the objection in a superior court.\" 17. in the present case, the \"order under appeal\" deals with mode of proof and the same was required to be raised at the time of marking the document itself, since there is no scope of challenge/correction in the appeal or revision and therefore, the said order does not fall within the ambit of negative connotation in paragraph 115 of the decision of the supreme court in shah babulal khimji case (supra). insofar as the orders passed on objections regarding the very admissibility of documents, is concerned, o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 there is no valuable right lost, since the aggrieved parties can raise these objections, both at the time of final arguments before the trial court, or even before the appellate court. however, orders passed regarding objections, \"qua\", mode of proof, ought to be considered as 'judgment', and a party relying on the document is totally precluded from introducing the document on record and there is no opportunity at any future date to make out any case on the basis of the said document. hence, when a valuable right is lost forever by way of an order, the order becomes appealable, even though the same is not enumerated under order 43 of the cpc. therefore, the \"orders\" that affect the valuable right of a party so as to cause grave prejudice or decide an important aspect of trial in an ancillary proceeding, as that of this case, ought to be considered as a \"judgment\" under clause 15 of the letters patent. 18. with regard to merits of the case, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant/plaintiff submitted that, absolutely, there is no requirement to file application under section 65(c) of the indian evidence act, to let in secondary evidence. in this regard, he also invited the attention of this court to the judgment of the apex court reported in 2020 scc online sc 606 o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 (dhanpat vs. sheo ram), relevant portion of which, reads as follows: \"20. there is no requirement that an application is required to be filed in terms of section 65(c) of the evidence act before the secondary evidence is led. a party to the lis may choose to file an application which is required to be considered by the trial court but if any party to the suit has laid foundation of leading of secondary evidence, either in the plaint or in evidence, the secondary evidence cannot be ousted for consideration only because an application for permission to lead secondary evidence was not filed.\" 19. thus, the learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that there is no need to file an application seeking permission to lead secondary evidence, in view of section 65(c) of the indian evidence act. in the instant case, chief examination was conducted on 08.12.2016 and the reasons have also been given for non-filing of the originals of the four documents. hence, the order under appeal has to be set aside, inasmuch as one of the main reasons for rejecting the application is on the basis of an earlier order, inter-partes, to the effect that an application for secondary evidence was not filed before marking of documents. 20. according to the learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff, o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 another reason assigned by the learned single judge to dismiss the application(s) of the plaintiff is that, when once the document was eschewed for non-compliance of procedures under section 65 of the indian evidence act, a subsequent application seeking for such permission is not applicable. in this regard, the learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff submitted that non-compliance of procedures can be cured at any time. moreover, in the instant case, the cross examination had not commenced, and therefore, the concept of \"res-judicata\" is not applicable. 21. with regard to the application to file affidavit of the accounts manager and systems-in-charge of the plaintiff-company, it is submitted that the learned single judge had not assigned any reason and therefore, the order under appeal has to be set aside on this ground alone. further, the learned counsel for the plaintiff relied on a decision of the supreme court reported in 2020 (7) scc 1 = 2020 scc online sc 571 (arjun panditrao khotkara vs. kailash kushanrao gorantyal and others) and submitted that, so long as the hearing in the trial is not over, the certificate can be directed to be produced by the judge at any stage or \"a-fortiori\" can be produced by a party by way of an application, so that the information o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 contained in electronic record form can be admitted and relied upon in evidence. the relevant portion of the above decision of the supreme court reads as follows: \"56. therefore, in terms of general procedure, the prosecution is obligated to supply all documents upon which reliance may be placed to an accused before commencement of the trial. thus, the exercise of power by the courts in criminal trials in permitting evidence to be filed at a later stage should not result in serious or irreversible prejudice to the accused. a balancing exercise in respect of the rights of parties has to be carried out by the court, in examining any application by the prosecution under sections 91 or 311 crpc or section 165 of the evidence act. depending on the facts of each case, and the court exercising discretion after seeing that the accused is not prejudiced by want of a fair trial, the court may in appropriate cases allow the prosecution to produce such certificate at a later point in time. if it is the accused who desires to produce the requisite certificate as part of his defence, this again will depend upon the justice of the case — discretion to be exercised by the court in accordance with law.\" \"64. to obviate this, general directions are issued to cellular companies and internet service providers to maintain cdrs and other relevant records for the period concerned (in tune with section 39 of the evidence act) in a segregated and secure manner if a particular cdr or other record is seized during investigation in the said period. the parties concerned can then summon such records at the stage of defence evidence, or in the event such data is required to cross-examine a particular witness. this direction shall be applied, in criminal trials, till appropriate o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 directions are issued under relevant terms of the applicable licences, or under section 67-c of the information technology act, which reads as follows: \"67-c. preservation and retention of information by intermediaries.—(1) intermediary shall preserve and retain such information as may be specified for such duration and in such manner and format as the central government may prescribe. (2) any intermediary who intentionally or knowingly contravenes the provisions of subsection (1) shall be punished with an imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and also be liable to fine.\" 22. thus, the learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff submitted that, on merits of the matter also, the appellant has got a good case and thus, he prayed for allowing the present o.s.as. 23. countering the above submissions made by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, the learned counsel for the defendants submitted in the first place that the appeals filed by the plaintiff, are not maintainable under clause 15 of the letters patent as well as under section 13 of the cca. 24. with regard to the non-applicability of clause 15 of the letters patent, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents/defendants o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 submitted that, on a reading of clause 15 of the letters patent, it is evident that an appeal would lie under clause 15 of the letters patent only from \"judgment\". clause 15 of the letters patent also sets out as to when an appeal would not lie. the nature of order under challenge in these appeals, will not fall within the ambit of \"judgment\" as per clause 15 of the letters patent. in this regard, the learned counsel appearing for the defendants also relied upon the very same judgment that was relied upon by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, reported in shah babulal khimji vs. jayaben d.kania, (supra), and submitted that in paragraph 115 therein, it has been stated that the orders passed by the learned trial judge deciding the question of admissibility or relevancy of the document, cannot be treated as \"judgments\", because, the grievance of the court can be corrected by the appellate court in the \"appeal\" in the final judgment. 25. in the instant case also, the order passed by the learned single judge, in effect, pertains to admissibility of a document, and hence, the order under challenge cannot be treated as \"judgment\" within clause 15 of the letters patent. in this regard, the learned counsel appearing for the defendants also drew the attention of this court to a judgment of a division o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 bench of this court delivered in the case of rubinetterie bresciane bonomi spa vs. lehry instrumentation and valves private limited, reported in 2019 (2) mlj 257 and submitted that in the said case, two orders, namely (i) an order disallowing production of certain documents, and (b) order eschewing of oral evidence of a witness, passed by the learned single judge, were challenged before a division bench of this court under clause 15 of the letters patent. in the said case, the division bench held that the order under challenge, does not constitute \"judgments\" within the meaning of clause 15 of the letters patent, as the said order, in effect, was made while regulating the trial proceedings. it has been further held in the said judgment that the order regulating the trial proceedings does not qualify a \"judgment\" within the meaning of clause 15 of the letters patent. even in the instant case, the impugned order, in effect, only regulates the trial proceedings by determining the nature of documents that could be treated as evidence, and hence, it will not qualify as \"judgment\" under clause 15 of the letters patent. the applications in question were admittedly filed only to cure procedural defects and hence, could not affect valuable rights / finally determine the rights. the instant appeals filed by the o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 plaintiff do not constitute a \"judgment\"and hence, on that ground, the present appeals are not maintainable as per clause 15 of the letters patent. 26. with regard to the maintainability of the appeals under section 13 of the cca, it is submitted that by virtue of section 8 of the cca, 2015, there is a specific bar on any appeal under the interlocutory order of a commercial court. in this regard, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents/defendants invited the attention of this court to section 8 of the cca, which reads as follows: \"section 8: bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order: -notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the commercial court.\" 27. further, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents/defendants submitted that, section 13(1) and 13(1-a) of the cca provides that \"any person\" who is aggrieved by a judgment or order of o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 a commercial court, has a \"right of appeal\". however, it does not provide the nature of orders that could be appealed against. the proviso to section 13(1) and 13 (1-a) of the cca indicates that, \"provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996).\" 28. the order under challenge neither falls under the categories set out under order 43 rule 1 of cpc, nor is it an order / appeal filed under section 37 of the arbitration act and therefore, on a combined reading of section 8 of the cca and proviso to section 13(1-a) of the cca, it is evident that the instant appeals are not maintainable under the provisions of the cca. in this regard, the learned counsel appearing for the defendants invited the attention of this court to the note, dated 31.01.2018 issued by the honourable chief justice of this court in exercise of the powers conferred under section 18 of the cca. 29. it is submitted that under sections 13(1-a) and 15(3) of the cca, all suits or applications, in which the final judgments have not o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 been reserved prior to the constitution of the commercial division or commercial court, shall stand transferred, and the provisions of the cca, 2015, shall apply to those procedures that were not complete at the time of transfer. 30. in the instant case, by virtue of the language used in section 15(3) of the cca, 2015, the procedure, viz., the right of appeal is subject to cca, 2015. with regard to the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff that, \"only with a view to cure certain procedural defects, the application under question was filed against the judgment that may be subsequently delivered in the suit\", it is replied by the learned counsel appearing for the defendants that as per order 41 rule 27-1-a cpc,. it is open to the plaintiff to file appeal against the final judgment passed in the suit, insofar as the documents in the suit are concerned. therefore, it is incorrect to state that if the appeals are dismissed, the plaintiff cannot file the documents which were now eschewed by the courts below, and cannot be taken as additional evidence in the appeals. 31. with regard to the merits of the case, the learned counsel appearing for the defendants, by inviting the attention of this court to o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 section 65 of the indian evidence act, submitted that the secondary evidence of a document can be produced only under the specific circumstances enumerated therein, albeit after the leave of the court under section 65(a),(c) and (d) of the indian evidence act, any secondary evidence of the contents of the documents is admissible. the learned counsel appearing for the defendants, invited the attention to section 65(a),(c) and (d) of the indian evidence act, which reads as follows: \"section 65: cases in which secondary evidence relating to documents may be given: -secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition or contents of a document in the following cases:-(a) when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power-of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved, or of any person out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the court, or of any person legally bound to produce it, and when after the notice mentioned in section 66, such person does not produce it; .. .. .. .. (c) when the original has been destroyed or lost, or when the party offering evidence of its contents cannot, for any other reason not arising from his own default or neglect, produce it in reasonable time; (d) when the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable; o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 .. .. ..\" 32. in the instant case, the application seeking leave of the court to file secondary evidence of four documents under section 65 of the evidence act, had been filed in a.no.6383 of 2017, however, a mere perusal of the affidavit filed in support of the said application, shows that the plaintiff had not even specified the sub-clause of section 65 of the indian evidence act, under which the said application had been filed. more specifically, in paragraphs 8 and 11 of the common affidavit filed in support of the said applications, dated august 2017, the appellant/plaintiff had merely stated that, \". despite best efforts, the applicant has not been successful in finding the originals of letter dated 30.10.2006, 11.12.2006 and 20.04.2008 and invoice dated 15.11.2008\" and that \"the originals of the same are not traceable despite best efforts .\". these statements neither indicate as to whether the originals are in the hands of any third party, or lost, or destroyed or not movable. 33. in the above context, the learned counsel appearing for the defendants relied on a decision of the supreme court reported in 2007 (5) o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 scc 730 (j.yashoda vs. k.shohana rani), wherein it was held as follows: \"9. .. .. section 65, however permits secondary evidence to be given of the existence, condition or contents of documents under the circumstances mentioned. the conditions laid down in the said section must be fulfilled before secondary evidence can be admitted. secondary evidence of the contents of a document cannot be admitted without non-production of the original being first accounted for in such a manner as to bring it within one or other of the cases provided for in the section.\" 34. the learned counsel appearing for the respondents/defendants also relied on a judgment of this court reported in 2007 (2) lw 211 (sivamalai viswakarma samuthaya nala sangam vs. natarajab and four others) and thus, submitted that when the appellant/plaintiff had failed to plead any of the circumstances enumerated under section 65(c) of the indian evidence act, he is not entitled to the relief prayed for and thus, he seeks for confirmation of the order passed by the learned single judge by dismissing these appeals. 35. keeping in mind the submissions made on either side, we have o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 carefully perused the entire materials available on record. 36. as we have discussed the facts in detail above, we refrain from reiterating the same any further in this judgment, unless the facts are germane. 37. though very many contentions have been made by the learned counsel for both sides with regard to the maintainability of the appeals as well as merits of the case, at the outset, this court has to decide the question of maintainability of the appeals, namely, as to whether the appeals are maintainable under section 13 of the cca and under clause 15 of the letters patent. if the answer is in the affirmative, then only the question of deciding the merits of the case will arise. therefore, the question of maintainability has to be decided at first. 38. with regard to maintainability of the o.s.as. as against the order passed by the learned single judge sitting on the commercial division of this court, it is the objection of the learned counsel for the respondents/defendants that, by virtue of section 13 of the cca act, the appeal is not maintainable, whereas, according to the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff, section 13 will not apply to the present appeals. in this o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 regard, it is the submission of the appellant/plaintiff that the suit was filed during february 2009 itself before the original side of this court. the commercial division bench of this court was notified only on 29.11.2017, vide, gazette notification no.381 dated 29.11.2017 (as stated supra). appln.nos.6383 and 6384 of 2017 were filed by the plaintiff during august 2017. these o.s.as. have been filed as against the order passed in the said applications filed under the relevant provisions of the code of civil procedure. the order under appeal was passed on 11.08.2018 after notification of the commercial division by the honourable chief justice. 39. in view of the above submissions made on either side, it is appropriate to look into section 13 of cca, which reads as follows: \"section 13: appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions(1) any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court below the level of a district judge may appeal to the commercial appellate court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order (1-a) any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a commercial court at the level of district judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996) (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act.\" 40. section 13 of the cca deals with \"appeals from orders\" or \"decrees\" of \"commercial courts and commercial divisions\". sections 13 (1) and 13 (1a) provides that \"any person\" who is aggrieved by a judgment or order of the commercial court, can prefer an appeal. but, it does not provide the nature of orders that would be appealed against. the proviso to sections 13(1) and 13(1-a) of cca indicates that an \"appeal\" shall lie from such of those orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated thereunder, namely (i) order 43 of cpc as amended by the commercial courts act and (ii) section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. 41. in the instant case, the order was passed by the learned single o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 judge in a transferred suit, which was originally filed before the original side of this court, and subsequently transferred to the commercial division of this court. the proceedings were governed by section 15 (1) of the cca, 2015. as per sub-clause (5) to section 15, the provisions of the act will apply to those proceedings that were not complete at the time of transfer. these appeals were not filed under order 43 rule 1 of cpc. it has been filed under order 36 rule 1 of the original side rules of this court, read with clause 15 of the letters patent. 42. a reading of the decision in garikapati case (cited supra) makes it clear that vested \"right of appeal\" can be taken away only by subsequent enactment, if it so provides expressly or by necessary implication and not otherwise. under section 8 of the cca, there is a specific bar on any appeal against the interlocutory order passed by the commercial division. section 8 of the cca is reproduced below:\"section 8: bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order: -notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 raised only in an appeal against the decree of the commercial court.\" 43. challenge against the order of the commercial court is subject to the provisions of section 13 of the cca. if no revision or appeal against an interlocutory order of commercial court can be entertained, no appeal against such order of commercial division of the high court can be entertained. further, on a combined reading of sections 8 and 13(1-a) of the cca, it is evident that the instant appeals are not maintainable under the provisions of the cca. moreover, as per clause ii(3) of the notification no.48 of 2018, dated 31.01.2018 of this court, pertaining to \"practice note for commercial division and commercial appellate division\" in madras high court, issued by the honourable chief justice, in exercise of the powers under section 18 of the cca, it was also clarified that, even if there is an appeal provision under the letters patent of a high court or under any other law, no appeal would lie against an order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court (section 13(2) of act 4 of 2016 ..i.e. cca). 44. therefore, it is clear that the present appeals against the order o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 passed by the learned single judge, are not maintainable, as it has been passed by the commercial division of this high court. even otherwise, appeal against interlocutory order is applied to situation under order 43 of the cpc. 45. further, section 21 of the cca will have overriding effect. section 21 reads as follows:\"section 21: act to have overriding effect: save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than this act.\" 46. therefore, looking at from any angle, the instant appeals as against the order passed by the learned single judge, are not maintainable. it is immaterial as to whether the suit was instituted before the enactment of cca or afterwards. what is to be seen is as to whether the order passed by the learned single judge, will partake the character of an \"order\" passed by the commercial division of this court. when an order is passed by the commercial division of this court, whether the right of appellate remedy is o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 circumscribed by section 13 of the cca and also as to whether the appeal is hit by section 13 of the cca or not ? 47. section 15 of the cca contemplates \"right of appeal\" under chapter v relating to \"transfer of pending suits\", by virtue of which, all the suits and applications pending before the high court shall stand transferred to the commercial division. in this regard, it is useful to extract section 15 of the cca as follows: \"section 15: transfer of pending cases:--(1) all suits and applications, including applications under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in a high court where a commercial division has been constituted, shall be transferred to the commercial division. (2) all suits and applications, including applications under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a commercial court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such commercial court: provided that no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the court prior to the constitution of the commercial division or the commercial court shall be transferred either under subsection (1) or sub-section (2). (3) where any suit or application, including an application under the arbitration and conciliation act, o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of specified value shall stand transferred to the commercial division or commercial court under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the provisions of this act shall apply to those procedures that were not complete at the time of transfer. (4) the commercial division or commercial court, as the case may be, may hold case management hearings in respect of such transferred suit or application in order to prescribe new timelines or issued such further directions as may be necessary for a speedy and efficacious disposal of such suit or application in accordance with order xv-a (substituted by act 28 of 2018, s.14 for \"with order xiv-a\" (w.r.e.f. 3.5.2018)) of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908): provided that the proviso to sub-rule (1) of rule 1 of order v of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall not apply to such transferred suit or application and the court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which the written statement shall be filed. (5) in the event that such suit or application is not transferred in the manner specified in sub-section (1), sub-section (2) or sub-section (3), the commercial appellate division of the high court may, on the application of any of the parties to the suit, withdraw such suit or application from the court before which it is pending and transfer the same for trial or disposal to the commercial division or commercial court, as the case may be, having territorial jurisdiction over such suit, and such order of transfer shall be final and binding.\" 48. thus, on a reading of the above provisions of section 15 of the o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 cca, it is to be noted that all suits and applications in which the final judgements have not been reserved prior to the constitution of the commercial division or commercial court, shall stand transferred and that the provisions of the cca, 2015 shall apply to those procedures that were not complete at the time of transfer. 49. further, the words used in sub-section (3) to section 15 of the cca,. 2015, do not refer to a particular procedure, but refers to multiple procedures. hence, the legislature had used the words \"those procedures\" and not \"the procedure\" or \"this procedure\" singularly. hence, the words in section 15(3) of the cca, 2015 cannot be construed to mean one singular event/happening during the life-span of a suit or application. 50. with regard to the maintainability of the appeal under clause 15 of the letters patent, it is the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff that an \"appeal\" is maintainable under clause 15 of the letters patent. it is the specific submission of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant/plaintiff that, to file an \"appeal\" against the order, it has to be seen as to whether the said \"order\" is a \"judgment\" within the meaning of clause 15 of the letters patent. in this regard, the learned counsel for the o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 appellant/plaintiff placed much reliance in the case of shah babulal khimji (mentioned supra), in which, in paragraph 113, it was held that there may be interlocutory orders which are not covered by order 43 rule.1 of the cpc, but which also possess the characteristics and trappings of finality in that, the orders may adversely affect a valuable right of the party or decide an important aspect of the trial in an ancillary proceeding. further, it was held that before such an order can be a judgment, the adverse effect on the party concerned must be direct and immediate rather than indirect or remote. it was also held in that judgment in paragraph 114 that, an order refusing an adjournment, an order refusing to summon an additional witness or documents, an order refusing to condone delay in filing documents, after the first date of hearing, an order of costs to one of the parties for its default or an order exercising discretion in respect of a procedural matter against one party or the other, are purely interlocutory and cannot constitute \"judgments\", because it will always be open to the aggrieved party to make a grievance of the order passed against the party concerned in the \"appeal\" against the final judgment passed by the learned trial judge, but whereas, in this case, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 that the rejection of the application(s) filed for taking the documents on record, before the first hearing of the suit, is a \"judgment\", and when once the documents were not marked, then, it cannot be agitated in the appeal, which is going to be filed as against the final judgment in the suit. 51. a reading of paragraph 114 of the judgment in shah babulal khimji case (cited supra), shows that an order refusing to condone delay in filing documents, is an interlocutory order and it does not constitute a \"judgment\", provided that, such order was passed only after the first date of hearing. further, in paragraph no.115 of the said judgment, it has been held that the order passed by the trial judge deciding question of admissibility or relevance of a document, cannot be treated as \"judgments\", because, the grievance on this score, can be corrected by the appellate court in an appeal against the \"final judgment\". 52. in the present case, the impugned order passed by the learned single judge pertains to admissibility of document(s) and it cannot be construed as a \"judgment\" within the meaning of clause 15 of letters patent. in this regard, it is worthwhile to extract clause 15 of the amended letters patent, as follows:o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 \"clause 15: appeal from the courts of original jurisdiction to the high court in its appellate jurisdiction:--and, we do further ordain that an appeal shall lie to the said high court of judicature at madras from the judgment (not being a judgment passed in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a court subject to the superintendence of the said high court, and not being an order made in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction, and not being a sentence or order passed or made in the exercise of the power of superintendence under the provisions of sec.107 of the government of india act, or in the exercise of criminal jurisdiction) of one judge of the said high court or one judge of any division court, pursuant to sec.108 of the government of india act, and that notwithstanding anything herein before provided an appeal shall lie to the said high court from a judgment of one judge of the said high court or one judge of any division court, pursuant to section 108 of the government of india act made (on or after the 1st day of february 1929), in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a court subject to the superintendence of the said high court, where the judge who passed the judgment declares that the case is a fit one for appeal, but that the right of appeal from other judgments of judges of the said high court or of such division court shall be to us, our heirs of successors in our or their privy council as hereinafter provided.\" o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 53. from a reading of clause 15 of letters patent (extracted supra), it is apparent that an 'appeal' would lie only from a \"judgment\". the said clause sets out those judgments against which no appeal would lie under clause 15. therefore, it becomes incumbent on the appellant/plaintiff to demonstrate that the order passed by the learned single judge constitutes 'judgment' within the meaning and ambit of clause 15 of the letters patent. in this case, the appellant/plaintiff miserably failed to show that the order passed by the learned single judge is a \"judgment\". the order passed by the learned single judge arose out of application(s) filed for marking secondary evidence and for filing an affidavit under section 65-b of the indian evidence act. the order passed by the learned single judge only regulates the trial proceedings and it does not in any manner take away the right of the appellant to participate in the trial or determine the suit finally. the appellant/plaintiff also may seek the indulgence of the appellate court, if he is aggrieved against/by the decree and judgment and allow the document(s), which is/are now sought to be accepted, to be produced at the appellate stage under order 41 rule 27(1)(a) of the cpc. in this regard, it is appropriate to extract order 41 rule 27(1)(a) of cpc, as follows: o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 order 41: appeals from original decrees: rule 27: production of additional evidence in appellate court: (1) the parties to an appeal shall not be entitled to produce additional evidence, whether oral or documentary, in the appellate court. but if-(a) the court from whose decree the appeal is preferred has refused to admit evidence which ought to have been admitted, or . .. . the appellate court may allow such evidence or document to be produced, or witness to be examined. .\" 54. thus, the appellant/plaintiff-company has an opportunity to raise its grievance arising out of the order passed by the learned single judge in the appeal against the final judgment to be passed in the suit. therefore, on this ground also, the order passed by the learned single judge is an interlocutory order and not a judgment as per clause 15 of letters patent. in this regard, it would be appropriate to refer the judgment relied on by the learned counsel for the respondents/defendants in union of india vs. ibrahim uddin and another, reported in 2012 (8) scc 148, wherein it has o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 been held as follows: \".. .. 38. under order 41 rule 27 cpc, the appellate court has the power to allow a document to be produced and a witness to be examined. but the requirement of the said court must be limited to those cases where it found it necessary to obtain such evidence for enabling it to pronounce judgment. this provision does not entitle the appellate court to let in fresh evidence at the appellate stage where even without such evidence it can pronounce judgment in a case. it does not entitle the appellate court to let in fresh evidence only for the purpose of pronouncing judgment in a particular way. in other words, it is only for removing a lacuna in the evidence that the appellate court is empowered to admit additional evidence. (vide lala pancham municipal corpn. of greater bombay vs. lala pancham air 1965 sc 1008).\" \"39. it is not the business of the appellate court to supplement the evidence adduced by one party or the other in the lower court. hence, in the absence of satisfactory reasons for the non-production of the evidence in the trial court, additional evidence should not be admitted in appeal as a party guilty or remissness in the lower court is not entitled to the indulgence of being allowed to give further evidence under this rule. so a party who had ample opportunity to produce certain evidence in the lower court but failed to do so or elected not to do so, cannot have it admitted in appeal. (vide state of u.p. vs. manbodhan lal srivastava (air 1957 sc 912) and s.rajagopal vs. c.m.arumugam (air 1969 sc 101)\". .. .. .. 42. whenever the appellate court admits additional evidence it should record its reasons for doing so (sub-rule (2)). it is a salutary provision which operates as a check against a too easy reception of evidence at a late stage of o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 litigation and the statement of reasons may inspire confidence and disarm objection. another reason of this requirement is that, where a further appeal lies from the decision, the record of reasons will be useful and necessary for the court of further appeal to see, if the discretion under this rule has been properly exercised by the court below. the omission to record the reasons must, therefore, be treated as a serious defect. but this provision is only directory and not mandatory, if the reception of such evidence can be justified under the rule.\" 55. therefore, the appellant/plaintiff-company can raise its grievances against the impugned order, in the appeal to be filed as against the \"final judgment\" to be passed in the suit. 56. hence, sections 13 and 15 of cca expressly or by necessary intentment takes away the substantive \"right to appeal\", which is procedural in nature, unless the procedure of filing an appeal was complete before the notification of the cca. both cca and cpc are procedural laws. it is for this reason that the provisions for preferring an appeal in civil suits or applications are provided in the cpc and cca. 57. furthermore, it is well settled proposition of law that while the 'right of appeal' may have attributes of a substantive right from a stand-point o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 of a party preferring it, the appeal \"per se\" is remedial and therefore, merely it is a matter of procedure. the fact that the appeal is a matter of procedure, had been observed time and again by the supreme court as well as this court. thus, the substantive or vested right of an appeal, can be taken away by a subsequent enactment, if it provides expressly or by necessary intentment. by virtue of sections 13 and 15 of the cca, such \"substantive\" or \"vested right of appeal\" had been taken away retrospectively in specific terms. thus, the order under challenge is an order passed by the commercial division of this court by virtue of the order being passed after the suit and connected applications were transferred on 24.01.2018. therefore, as against the order passed by the commercial division, an appeal has been expressly taken away by the cca and it is not maintainable, unless it falls within order 43 of cpc or section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act. therefore also, the present appeals are not maintainable under section 13 of the cca. thus, the present appeals are not maintainable. the supreme court in shah babulal khimji case (cited supra) held in paragraph 115 that, \" . orders passed by the trial judge deciding question of admissibility or relevancy of a document also cannot be treated as o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 judgments because the grievance on this score can be corrected by the appellate court in appeal against the final judgment.\" in the said shah babulal khimji case, in paragraph 109, the supreme court held as follows: \"109. clause 15 makes no attempt to define what a judgment is. as letters patent is a special law which carves out its own sphere, it would not be possible for us to project the definition of the word 'judgment' appearing in section 2(9) of the code of 1908, which defines 'judgment' into the letters patent: 'judgment' means the statement given by the judge of the grounds of a decree or order.\" further, in the said case (shah babulal khimji), the apex court held as follows in paragraph 40: \"40. a perusal of the letters patent would clearly reveal two essential incidents--(1) that an appeal shall lie against any order passed by the trial judge to a larger bench of the same high court, and (2) that where the trial judge decides an appeal against a judgment or decree passed by the district courts in the mofussil, a further appeal shall lie only where the judge concerned declares it to be a fit one for appeal to a division bench. thus, the special law, viz., the letters patent, contemplates only these two kinds of appeals and no other. there is, therefore, no warrant for accepting the argument of the respondent that if order 43 rule 1 applies, then a further appeal would also lie against the appellate order of the trial judge to a division bench. as this is neither contemplated nor borne out by the provisions of the o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 letters patent extracted above, the contention of the respondent on this score must be overruled.\" 58. under order xlix rule 3 of cpc, some of the provisions of the cpc are not applicable to a chartered high court. they are as follows:(1) rule 10 and rule 11, clauses (b) & (c), of order vii; (2) rule 3 of order x; (3) rule 2 of order xvi; (4) rules 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 (so far as relates to the manner of taking evidence) of order xviii; (5) rules 1 to 8 of order xx; and (6) rule 7 of order xxxiii (so far as relates to the making of a memorandum); and rule 35 of order xli shall not apply to any such high court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.\" 59. order xliii rule 1 of cpc is not there in the exceptions provided in order xlix rule 3 of cpc. rules 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of order xviii of cpc relating to manner of taking evidence, are also not applicable to a chartered high courts. 60. a judge trying a civil dispute in a civil court, who is likely to hear the case, is expected to record the evidence. there are exceptions to the o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 above rule in order xviii of the cpc. 61. an appeal against an interlocutory order of the court from original side, is governed by section 104 and order xliii rule 1 of cpc. these provisions are reproduced below:section 104 of cpc order xliii rule 1 of cpc 104. orders from which 1. appeal from orders.—an appeal shall lie appeal lies.— from the following orders under the provisions (1) an appeal shall lie from of section 104, namely : — the following orders, and save (a) an order under rule 10 of order vii as otherwise expressely returning a plaint to be presented to the provided in the body of this proper court except where the procedure code or by any law for the time specified in rule 10a of order vii has been being in force, from no other followed;

(2) that even if it be assumed that order 43 rule 1 does not apply to letters patent appeals, the principles governing these provisions would apply by process of analogy. (3) that having regard to the nature of the orders contemplated in the various clauses of order 43 rule 1, there can be no doubt that these orders purport to decide valuable rights of the parties in ancillary proceedings even though the suit is kept alive and that these orders do possess the attributes or character of finality so as to be judgments within the meaning of clause 15 of the letters patent and hence, appealable to a larger bench. (4) the concept of the letters patent governing only the internal appeals in the high courts and the code of civil procedure having no application to such appeals is based on a serious misconception of the legal position.\" 65. ultimately, in paragraph no.120 of the said shah babulal khimji case, the supreme court has given a list as to when an appeal against an interlocutory order, can be filed. paragraph no.120 of the o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 decision of the supreme court is reproduced below::120. thus, these are some of the principles which might guide a division bench in deciding whether an order passed by the trial judge amounts to a judgment within the meaning of the letters patent. we might, however, at the risk of repetition give illustrations of interlocutory orders which may be treated as judgments: (1) an order granting leave to amend the plaint by introducing a new cause of action which completely alters the nature of the suit and takes away a vested right of limitation or any other valuable right accrued to the defendant. (2) an order rejecting the plaint. (3) an order refusing leave to defend the suit in an action under order 37, of the code of civil procedure. (4) an order rescinding leave of the trial judge granted by him under clause 12 of the letters patent. (5) an order deciding a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the suit on the ground of limitation, absence of notice under section 80, bar against competency of the suit against the defendant even though the suit is kept alive. (6) an order rejecting an application for a judgment on admission under order 12 rule 6. (7) an order refusing to add necessary parties in a suit under ssction 92 of the code of civil procedure. (8) an order varying or amending a decree. (9) an order refusing leave to sue in forma pauperis. (10) an order granting review. (11) an order allowing withdrawal of the suit with liberty to file a fresh one. (12) an order holding that the defendants are not agriculturists within the meaning of the special law. o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 (13) an order staying or refusing to stay a suit under section 10 of the code of civil procedure. (14) an order granting or refusing to stay execution of the decree. (15) an order deciding payment of court fees against the plaintiff.\" 66. in paragraph no.115 of the shah babulal khimji case, the supreme court has answered the issue against the appellant (plaintiff). paragraph no.115 reads as under:\"115. thus, in other words every interlocutory order cannot be regarded as a judgment but only those orders would be judgments which decide matters of moment or affect vital and valuable rights of the parties and which work serious injustice to the party concerned. similarly, orders passed by the trial judge deciding question of admissibility or relevancy of a document also cannot be treated as judgments because the grievance on this score can be corrected by the appellate court in appeal against the final judgment.\" 67. therefore, it stands concluded that, no appeal can be filed against o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 the interim order, even under clause 15 of the letters patent read with section 104 and order xliii of the cpc. when the suit was filed, amended letters patent, which is a special law applicable to the high court, was applicable to the suit. therefore, even if the plaintiff had a vested right under the letters patent to appeal against any order, such right was circumscribed under the restriction under section 104 and order xliii of the cpc. therefore, even under clause 15 of the amended letters patent, no appeal against an interlocutory order of a single judge, could be filed before a division bench of the high court. appeal could be filed only against orders specified in order xliii rule 1(a) to (f) and section 104 of cpc. 68. with the enactment of commercial courts act, 2015 and its notification, which is special law applicable to all commercial disputes, which were transferred to the commercial division, rights stood further restricted. 69. under proviso to section 13(1-a) of the commercial courts act, 2015, as amended vide act 28 of 2018, with effect from 03.05.2018, any person aggrieved by a judgment or order of a commercial court or of a o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 commercial division of the high court, can appeal before the commercial appellate division of the high court only in respect of order which are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908. 70. the position was similar even on 29.11.2017 when the notification was issued under section 4 and section 5 of the said act, notifying the constitution of the commercial division and commercial appellate division of the high court. at the time of constitution of the commercial division and commercial appellate division, section 13 read slightly differently. however, the position was not different. therefore, the present appeal is without any merits. 71. thus, we find no merits in the present original side appeals against the interlocutory order of the learned single judge, rejecting the application filed for marking the documents as secondary evidence and disallowing the plaintiff to file affidavit of it accounts manger and systems in-charge, cannot be allowed. 72. therefore, these rights of the plaintiff, on merits which canvassed before us, can be canvassed by the plaintiff at the time of the appeal against o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 final judgment and decree in the suit in terms of the reasonings of the supreme court in the case of shah babulal khimji case (supra). 73. moreover, at the risk of repetition, it is seen that the present order is passed by the learned single judge under the nomenclature of \"commercial division/commercial court\", considering the fact that the suit was transferred to the commercial court and that the order passed by the learned single judge, neither falls under the categories set out under order 43 rule 1 of cpc, nor is it an order / appeal filed under section 37 of the arbitration act and therefore, on a combined reading of section 8 of the cca and proviso to section 13(1-a) of the cca, it is evident that the instant appeals are not maintainable even under the provisions of the cca. 74. as mentioned above, the grievances of an aggrieved party against an order declining the request for admitting and/or marking document during recording of evidence, can be redressed and corrected in the appellate proceedings against the final judgment, as per the observations made by the supreme court in paragraph no.115 of the case of shah babulal khimji case (supra). 75. in view of the foregoing reasonings, the present o.s.as. are o.s.a.nos.235 and 239 of 2020 dismissed. no costs. consequently, c.m.ps. are closed.
