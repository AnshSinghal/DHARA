This petition under Article 227 of Constitution of India has been brought being aggrieved by the order dated 22.06.2021 passed in Civil Suit No.01-B/2021, by the Criminal Court District- Raipur, C.G., by which the opportunity of the petitioner/defendants for filing written statement was closed.\n2. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the respondent has filed a Civil Suit in No.01-B/2021 before the Criminal Court Raipur, C.G.. The petitioner/defendant received the summons on 6th January, 2021. The time for filing written statement was extended for 120 days which got expired on 06.05.2021. The case was listed on 15.04.2021 and on that date the case was fixed for arguments on the application under Section 10 read with Section 151 of C.P.C. and application under Order 38 Rule 5 read with Section 151 of C.P.C., on 22.06.2021. No last opportunity was given by the Commercial Court to the petitioner for filing of written statement and on 06.05.2021, the Court was closed due to the imposition of lock-down in corona pandemic control measure. \n3. In the impugned order, the learned Commercial Court has held that according to the proviso under Order Viii Rule 1 of C.P.C. incorporated in Commercial Courts Act, after the expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the right of defendants to file written statement stands forfeited and therefore, the opportunity of filing written statement by the petitioner was closed. It is submitted by the learned counsel for petitioner that on 22.06.2021, the petitioner filed application seeking time to file written statement on the medical ground as the learned counsel for the petitioner was in quarantine. The learned trial Court has not given any consideration on this prayer of the petitioner. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has in Suo-moto Writ (Civil) No.-03 of 2020 has ordered that while computing the period of limitation prescribed in general law and special Acts, the period between 15.03.2020 to 14.03.2021 shall stand excluded. On 27.04.2021, the suspension of limitation under general or special laws was further extended and the matter was listed for 19.07.2021. Hence, on the basis of this order of the Supreme Court, the limitation that has been counted without taking into consideration of the period of lock-down, is erroneous. \n4. Reliance has been placed on the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of S.S. Group Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Aaditiya J. Garg and Anr. reported in 2020 Scc Online Sc 1050 and the judgment of Supreme Court in Kailash Vs. Nanhku & Ors. reported in (2005) 4 Scc 480. It is submitted that in the case of S.C.G. Contracts (India) Private Limited Vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Private Limited & Ors. reported in (2019) 12 Scc 210. The Supreme Court granted liberty to the defendant and ordered that the written statement that was already produced to be taken on record. Therefore, it is prayed that this petition may be admitted and petitioner may be granted opportunity to file written statement in the Civil Suit before the Commercial Court. \n5. Shri Amrito Das, learned counsel for the respondent has appeared on caveat and he opposes the petition and the submissions made in that respect and submits that the present petition under Article 227 Constitution of India is not maintainable. Section 13(1)(A) of Commercial Courts Act Specifically provides that \"Any person aggrieved by the judgment or orde r of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court.\" Therefore, the impugned order is appealable. Hence, in such a case, the appeal shall be maintainable against the impugned order, under Order 43 of C.P.C. and the same shall be heard by a Commercial Appellate Division Bench of the High Court. Therefore, there is no provision for hearing of such cases by a Single Judge. The amended provision of the C.P.C. filed under Section 16 of the Act, 2015 does not leave any scope of condonation of delay. It is submitted that in the case of S.C.G. Contracts (India) Private Limited (Supra), the Supreme Court is very clear on this point that the Commercial Court has no power to extend the time given beyond the period of 120 days. The opportunity that was given to the defendant in that case was a singular incident and does not lay down any precedent. Further, the defendant in that case had already filed the written statement in the present case, the petitioner has still not filed any written statement. In the case of Sagufa Ahmed & Ors. Vs. Upper Assam Polywood Products Private Limited & Ors. reported in (2021) 2 SCC 317, the Supreme Court has considered and it has been observed, that the order in Sou-moto is only for the purpose of extension of period of limitation and not to condone the delay. The time provided for filing of reply is prescribed period and therefore, this has to be not a limitation, which is not covered under the order of Suo-moto Writ (Civil) No.03 of 2020.\n6. It is further submitted that the petitioner was granted sufficient time for filing of written statement and on the date fixed, the Courts was not closed. The grounds taken for non-submission of reply are baseless. On the last date, on which the case was fixed for hearing i.e. 22.06.2021, again the written statement was not filed and the limitation for filing written statement had already expired on 06.05.2021. It is submitted that if such delay in filing of written statement condoned, then the object of the Act, 2015 will be frustrated. Hence, the impugned order has been rightly passed. Therefore, it prayed that this petition may be dismissed at motion stage. \n7. In reply, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the proviso of Section 13(1)(A) provides that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division of a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order 43 of C.P.C. as amended by this Act and Section 37 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act. There is a clear order of the Supreme Court in Sou-moto case extending the period of limitation. \n8. Reliance has been placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of New India Assurance Company Limited Vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage Private Limited reported in (2020) 5 SCC 757. It is again submitted that the order in Suo-moto Writ Petition regarding extension of limitation is applicable in this case. Therefore, it is prayed that this petition may be allowed and relief be granted to the petitioner. \n9. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the documents present on record.\n10. Considered on the point of the maintainability. Section 13(1)(A) of Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, 2015) provides as follows:-\n\"13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions: -\n(1A): Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order\"\n11. Although, the proviso mentions that appeal shall lie from such orders, which are specifically enumerated under Order 43 of C.P.C. as amended by the Act. The schedule Section 16 of Act, 2015 does not show any amendment in Order 43 of C.P.C. In such a case, the existing provision under Order 43 of C.P.C. has to be construed and taken into consideration. The order 43 Rule 1 of C.P.C. provides for appealable orders, in which the order passed by any Court under Order 8 Rule 1 of C.P.C. is not included. Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 also does not provide for appeal from such order, by which the opportunity for filing written statement is closed by the Court. Hence, on this basis, it can be held that the impugned order is not an appealable order, according to the provisions of Section 13 of the Act, 2015, therefore, the petition under Article 227 Constitution of India is maintainable. \n12. Considered on the submissions. The view of the Supreme Court in the case of S.C.G. Contracts (India) Private Limited (Supra) is very clear that the right to file written statement stands forfeited after the time prescribed for filing of written statement and the time extended according to the provisions contained in the enactment. Although, the case was under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and the time for filing of written statement had expired after the completion of prescribed period and the period that was extended according to the provision in the Act, the Supreme Court then held in paragraph 10:-\n\"(10) Several High Court judgments on the amended Order VIII Rule 1 have now held that given the consequence of non-filing of written statement, the amended provisions of the CPC will have to be held to be mandatory. See Oku Tech (P) Ltd. V. Sangeet Agarwal by a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court dated 11.08.2016 in CS (OS) No. 3390 of 2015 as followed by several other judgments including a judgment of the Delhi High Court in Maja Cosmetics V. Oasis Commercial (P) Ltd.\"\n13. The Supreme Court ordered that the written statement filed by the appellant be taken on record. The judgment of Supreme Court in New India Insurance Company Ltd. (Supra) had been referred to in the judgment asked in S.S. Group Pvt. Ltd. (Supra).\n14. In the case of Shagufta Ahmed (Supra), it is held in paragraph 17:-\n\"But we do not think that the appellants can take refuge under the above order in Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, In re. What was extended by the above order of this Court was only \"the period of limitation\" and not the period upto which delay can be condoned in exercise of discretion conferred by the statute . The above order passed by this Court was intended to benefit vigilant litigants who were prevented due to the pandemic and the lockdown, from initiating proceedings within the period of limitation prescribed by general or special law. It is needless to point out that the law of limitation finds its root in two latin maxims, one of which is v igilantibus et Non dormientibus Jura subveniunt which means that the law will assist only those who are vigilant about their rights and not those who sleep over them.\" \nTaking into consideration the view settled by the Supreme Court and the applicability of the order of Supreme Court in Suo-moto Writ (Civil) No.03 of 2020, the glaring fact present in this case is this, that the petitioners have till date not filed any written statement, the prescribed time for filing written statement and the time which can be extended by the Court both have expired. The case was fixed for hearing on 22.06.2021 even on that date, the petitioner was not ready and prepared to file the written statement, therefore, it appears to be a case in which the petitioner is making a prayer for extension of limitation. No Court can grant any extension of limitation against the provisions of the enactment under which the case is being considered and heard. Further, it is not a case of condonation of delay as the written statement is still not filed. Hence, I am of this view that the learned Commercial Court has not committed any error in rejecting the prayer made by the petitioner for granting time to file written statement. Accordingly, no substance is found to be present in this petition, hence, this petition is dismissed at motion stage. \n15. Accordingly, this petition is disposed off. \nSd/-\n                                              (Rajendra Chandra Singh Samant)\nMonika                                                     Judge  ",

(oral) 1. these appeals question the orders made in the course of enforcement proceedings taken out by the respondent/decree holder atc telecom infrastructure pvt. ltd. 2. at the outset, this court notices that the appeal is not maintainable given the provisions of the commercial courts act, 2015 and the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. the maintainability of such appeals against orders, made in the course of enforcement proceedings under section 36 of the arbitration act was decided today in the efa (os) (comm) no. 3/2019, south delhi municipal corporation vs. m/s. tech mahindra. in that judgment of the court, noticed the objects of the commercial courts act and the recent decision in kandla export corporation & anr. vs. m/s. oci corporation & anr., (2018) 14 scc 715, and observed as under: ―5. the relevant provision of commercial courts act, 2015 are as follows: ―8. bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order.-notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the commercial court. **************** *********** 11. bar of jurisdiction of commercial courts and commercial divisions. notwithstanding anything contained in this act, a commercial court or a commercial division shall not entertain or decide any suit, application or proceedings relating to any commercial dispute in respect of which the jurisdiction of the civil court is either expressly or impliedly barred under any other law for the time being in force. **************** *********** 13. appeals from decrees of commercial courts and commercial divisions. (1) any person aggrieved by the decision of the commercial court or commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order, as the case may be: provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure, 1908 as amended by this act and section 37 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996. (2) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or letters patent of a high court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a commercial division or commercial court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this act. **************** *********** 21. act to have overriding effect. save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than this act.‖ 6. a conjoint reading of the provisions especially section 8, 11 and 21 of the cc act, highlight the parliamentary intention to vest commercial courts and commercial appellate divisions with only limited jurisdiction. flowing from that, the scheme of section 13 of the commercial courts act, provides only two types of appeals; (1) in respect of specific matters enumerated in order xliii rule 1 (read with section 104) of the cpc and (2) appeals that are admissible under section 37 of the arbitration act. 7. the judgment in kandla export corporation (supra) noticed the statement of objects and reasons, of the commercial courts act. the supreme court had to deal with an enforcement appeal before a commercial appellate court, in regard to a foreign award, and its maintainability. the supreme court noticed not only the statement of objects and reasons but also various other provisions, especially the embargo placed upon the courts, embodied in sections 8 and 11 and the overriding nature of the cc act, to conclude that once appeals were held to be barred, an appeal to the division bench appeal against a commercial court's order in an enforcement of a foreign award issue was not maintainable. the court took into account its previous rulings in fuerst day lawson limited vs. jindal exports limited, (2011) 8 scc 333 and some other judgments. 8. the statement of objects and reasons for the commercial courts act, states that: ―the proposal to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes has been under consideration of the government for quite some time. the high value commercial disputes involve complex facts and questions of law. therefore, there is a need to provide for an independent mechanism for their early resolution. early resolution of commercial disputes shall create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive indian legal system. xxx 6. it is proposed to introduce the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts bill, 2015 to replace the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts ordinance, 2015 which inter alia, provides for the following namely:-(i) constitution of the commercial courts at district level except for the territory over which any high court is having ordinary original civil jurisdiction; (ii) constitution of the commercial divisions in those high courts which are already exercising ordinary civil jurisdiction and they shall have territorial jurisdiction over such areas on which it has original jurisdiction; (iii) constitution of the commercial appellate division in all the high courts to hear the appeals against the orders of the commercial courts and the orders of the commercial division of the high court; (iv) the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of such commercial courts and commercial division is proposed as one crore rupees; and (v) to amend the code of civil procedure, 1908 as applicable to the commercial courts and commercial divisions which shall prevail over the existing high courts rules and other provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. 7. the proposed bill shall accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the indian justice delivery system, and the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation.‖ 9. it is quite evident that the legislative or parliamentary intent, was to confer upon the commercial appellate courts and commercial appellate division bench of a high court, extremely limited jurisdiction and circumscribe the appellate jurisdiction. thus, in interlocutory matters, as it were, commercial appellate division possesses jurisdiction in matters enumerated in the order xliii rule 1 no less no more. likewise, with respect to the appeals against orders made in the course of proceedings under the arbitration act, the court's power is delineated to what is enumerated in section 37 of cpc. 10. in kandla export corporation (supra), the court held as follows: ―14. section 13(1) of the commercial courts act, with which we are immediately concerned in these appeals, is in two parts. the main provision is, as has been correctly submitted by shri giri, a provision which provides for appeals from judgments, orders and decrees of the commercial division of the high court. to this main provision, an exception is carved out by the proviso. the primary purpose of a proviso is to qualify the generality of the main part by providing an exception, which has been set out with great felicity in cit v indo mercantile bank ltd, 1959 supp (2) scr 256 at 266-267, thus: ******** ********* 15. the proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by the commercial division of the high court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure code, 1908, and section 37 section 37 of the arbitration act. it will at once be noticed that orders that are not specifically enumerated under order xliii of the cpc would, therefore, not be appealable, and appeals that are mentioned in section 37 of the arbitration act alone are appeals that can be made to the commercial appellate division of a high court. 16. thus, an order which refers parties to arbitration under section 8, not being appealable under section 37 (1) (a), would not be appealable under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act. similarly, an appeal rejecting a plea referred to in sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 16 of the arbitration act would equally not be appealable under section 37 (2) (a) and, therefore, under section 13(1) of the commercial courts act.‖ 11. the reference to order xliii rule 1 relied upon on behalf of sdmc in the context of this case, in the opinion of this court, is misplaced. order xliii rule 1(q), upon which considerable emphasis was placed to say that the appeals against directions to secure amounts during pendency of proceedings applies to suits and suits alone (as is evident from order xxxviii and all the attendant provisions), and not to proceedings in respect of an award. thus, reference to order xliii to ―draw in‖ the jurisdiction of the division bench, is wholly unjustified. likewise, the court also rejects the appellant's arguments that section 36 of the arbitration act attracts the provisions of the code of civil procedure. in fact, section 36 refers to and directs courts to follow cpc in proceedings relating to enforcement of arbitral awards. the logical corollary is that the provisions of the cpc that deal with the proceeding for enforcement of decrees and orders (such as in execution like order xxi cpc), would be attracted. 12. in view of the above discussions, we conclude that the present appeal is not maintainable. the appellant's remedy clearly lies elsewhere. an attempt was made to urge that no litigant can be deprived of remedy if there is a grievance: ubi jus ibi remedium; however, that argument is wholly without substance because an appeal, it has been repeatedly emphasised, is a specific creation of statute and cannot be claimed as a matter of right. this was explained pithily in ganga bai v vijay kumar, (1974) 2 scc 393, in the following terms: \"there is a basic distinction between the right of suit and the right of appeal. there is an inherent right in every person to bring suit of a civil nature and unless the suit is barred by statute one may, at one's peril, bring a suit of one's choice. it is no answer to a suit howsoever frivolous the claim, that the law confers no such right to sue. a suit for its maintainability requires no authority of law and it is enough that no statute bars the suit. but the position in regard to appeals is quite the opposite. the right of appeal inheres in no one and therefore an appeal for its maintainability must have the clear authority of0020law. that explains why the right of appeal is described as a creature of statute.\" 3. for the above reasons, the court is of the opinion that these appeals are not maintainable. in the event the appellant wishes to urge anything on the merits, it is open for it to do so before the learned single judge who has now listed the matter for further proceedings/ disposal on 21.02.2019. this is independent of the appellant's right to seek appropriate remedies under the constitution or the law against the impugned order. the appeals are consequentially dismissed. 4. a copy of this order be given dasti under signatures of the court master. s. ravindra bhat, j prateek jalan, j february 12, 2019 pkb"
