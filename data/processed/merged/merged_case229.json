Document) \n1. The present appeal impugns the order dated 21 February 2023 passed by the District Judge (Commercial) who has fo r reasons assigned and recorded in that order, vacated the ex parte injunction which had been granted in favour of the plaintiff/ appellant on 25 September 2021 and called upon it to furnish additional material in support of the Chartered Accountants [\"CA\"] certificate which had been presented in respect of the \"specified value\" of the suit. \n2. We find from the order dated 25 April 2023 passed on this appeal that the Court while entertaining the challenge had placed the impugned order in abeyance and restored the ad interim ex parte injunction which had operated on the suit. While considering the questions which were canvassed for consideration, the Division Bench also expressed reservation with respect to the correctness of the view expressed by a learned Single Judge of the Court in Vishal Pipes Limited vs. Bhavya Pipe Industry1. It accordingly appointed Ms. Swathi Sukumar, learned counsel, as the Amicus Curiae to assist the Court in examining the questions which arose. \n3. The doubts which were expressed by the Court with respect to the judgment in Vishal Pipes essentially appear to have arisen in light of the following facts. The proceedings in Vishal Pipes emanated from a suit for injunction which had been instituted alleging infringement of a registered trademark and copyright. The plaintiff had valued the suit at below Rs. 3 lakhs as a result of which it came to be placed before a District Judge who was not designated as a commercial court. The learned Single Judge found that in light of the suit having been valued at below Rs. 3 lakhs, notwithstanding the same raising issues of infringement of trademarks and copyright, it was liable to be tried as a regular civil suit and thus not be regulated by the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 20152. It was in the aforesaid backdrop that 2022 SCC OnLine Del 1730 CCA the learned Single Judge in Vishal Pipes formulated the question which arose to be whether IPR suits valued below Rs. 3 lakhs ought to be listed before District Judges manning commercial courts and thus be tried in accordance with the provisions of the CCA or by District Judges (Non-Commercial) as ordinary suits. The learned Single Judge noted that unscrupulous plaintiffs appeared to be deliberately undervaluing IPR suits leading to a situation where they were not only choosing the court before which those matters would be listed but also avoiding the proceedings being governed by the provisions of the CCA. On an analysis of the provisions of the CCA, the Court Fee Act, 18703 and decisions rendered by this Court as well as other High Courts, the learned Single Judge proceeded to hold as under:\n\"62. To answer the above, first, the discussion in paragraph 25 above is pertinent, as it clearly shows that IPR disputes are a set of disputes which lie only before the District Court. Thus, in that sense, such disputes are an exception to the rule of institution of cases at the Court of the lowest level having jurisdiction. With the enactment of the CCA, the subject-matter jurisdiction over IPR disputes now vests with the Commercial Courts, at the District Court Level. Therefore, can litigants and lawyers escape the rigors of the provisions of the CCA by valuing the suits below Rs. 3 lakhs? The answer ought to be a clear NO. This is due to the following reasons:\n(i) The application of the judicial principles that the plaintiff is dominus litis and is free to value the suit in the manner it so chooses, has to be in the context of enactment of the CCA. The principles cannot be stretched to justify undervaluation of IPR disputes and payment of lower Court fee. \nCourt Fees Act (ii) Not ascribing a specified value in the suit would be contrary to the scheme of the CCA which requires every suit to have a specified value, if the subject matter of the suit is a commercial dispute. A perusal of Section 12(1)(d) of the CCA does offer some guidance, that the specified value in case of intangible rights would be the market value of the said rights as estimated by the plaintiff. \n(iii) In IPR disputes, the relief of injunction or damages may be valued by the plaintiff, at an amount lower than the sum of Rs. 3lakhs and Court fee may be paid on that basis. If such valuation is permitted, despite some objective criteria being available for valuing IPR - in the CCA - it would defeat the very purpose of the enactment of special provisions for IPR statutes and the CCA. These statutes would have to be harmoniously construed i.e., in a manner so as to further the purpose of the legislation and not to defeat it. Thus, it would be mandatory for IPR suits to be ascribed a specified value, in the absence of which the valuation of the suit below Rs. 3 lakhs would be arbitrary, whimsical and wholly unreasonable. In this view, intellectual property rights being intangible rights, some value would have to be given to the subject matter of the dispute as well. The Court would have to take into consideration the specified value based upon not merely the value of the relief sought but also the market value of the intangible right involved in the said dispute. \n(iv) The subject matter of IPR disputes is usually trademarks, rights in copyrightable works, patents, designs and such other intangible property. The said amount of Rs. 3 lakhs is the estimation of the legislature as being the lowest threshold in any commercial dispute in India which deserves to benefit from speedier adjudication, owing to the economic progress in the country. The intention of the Legislature in keeping a lower threshold in a commercial dispute of Rs. 3 lakhs cannot be rendered meaningless. It would only be in exceptional cases that valuation of IPR disputes below Rs. 3 lakhs could be justified. Accordingly, Section 12(1)(d) has been included in the CCA, where the subject matter of \"intellectual property\" has been contemplated by the Legislature to be an intangible right, in respect of which the market value has to be estimated by the plaintiff, for determining the specified value. \n(v) The average Court fee paid in Delhi in any civil suit is approximately 3% to 1% of the pecuniary value ascribed to the suit. In fact, Delhi is one of the territories where ad valorem Court fee is paid beyond a particular threshold. When seen from this perspective, i.e., that at Rs. 3 lakhs, the Court fee payable is minimal, it is apparent that the only reason for which IPR disputes may be valued below Rs. 3 lakhs by litigants or lawyers would be to indulge in forum shopping and bench hunting and not merely to exercise the option of the forum where relief is sought. The purpose would also be to escape the rigors of the provisions of the CCA. Such a practice would constitute abuse by plaintiffs of their rights, at the very least. \n(vi) Usually, IPR disputes are filed by business entities. However, considering the Court fee payable even if such suits are valued at a minimum of Rs. 3,00,000/-, even individual IPR owners would be easily able to afford the Court fee at the rate of 1-3%. There thus appears to be no valid or justifiable cause to value an IPR suit below Rs. 3 lakhs except for oblique motives. Thus, the discretion vested in the plaintiff to value the suit as it pleases, ought not to be extended or stretched to an extent that it encourages malpractice, misuse, abuse and forum shopping. \nxxxx xxxx xxxx 64. Therefore, in Delhi, in order to avail of its remedies provided under the various IPR statutes, a plaintiff ought to usually institute the suit before the District Court having jurisdiction i.e., District Judge(Commercial) by valuing it at Rs. 3 lakhs or above, and pay the basic required Court fee to invoke the jurisdiction of the said Court. However, acknowledging the plaintiff's reasonable discretion in valuing its suit, it is held that in case a plaintiff values an IPR suit below the threshold of Rs. 3 lakhs, such suits would be listed before the District Judge(Commercial) first, in order to determine as to whether the valuation is arbitrarily whimsical or deliberately undervalued. \nxxxx xxxx xxxx 66. In light of the above discussion, the following directions are issued: \n(i) Usually, in all IPR cases, the valuation ought to be Rs. 3 lakhs and above and proper Court fee would have to be paid accordingly. All IPR suits to be instituted before District Courts, would therefore, first be instituted before the District Judge(Commercial). \n(ii) In case of any IPR suits valued below Rs. 3 lakhs, the Commercial Court shall examine the specified value and suit valuation to ensure it is not arbitrary or unreasonable and the suit is not undervalued. \n(iii) Upon such examination, the concerned Commercial Court would pass appropriate orders in accordance with law either directing the plaintiff to amend the plaint and pay the requisite Court fee or to proceed with the suit as a non-commercial suit. \n(iv) In order to however maintain consistency and clarity in adjudication, even such suits which may be valued below Rs. 3lakhs and continue as non- commercial suits, shall also continue to be listed before the District Judge (Commercial), but may not be subjected to the provisions of the CCA.\n(v) All pending IPR suits before the different District Judges (non-Commercial) in Delhi shall be placed before the concerned District Judges (Commercial) for following the procedure specified above. plaintiffs who wish to amend the Plaint would be permitted to do so in accordance with law.\" \n4. As would be evident from the aforesaid extracts of the decision in Vishal Pipes, the learned Single Judge essentially went on to prescribe the following procedure for IPR suits in general:\n(a) \"Usually\", the valuation of all IPR cases \"ought to be\"\nvalued at Rs. 3 lakhs and above and court fee paid accordingly. \n(b) In case an IPR suit be valued below Rs. 3 lakhs, the same be placed before a designated commercial court to enable it to examine the specified value and suit valuation at the outset and to ascertain and ensure that it had not been deliberately undervalued. \n(c) If the commercial court were to ultimately come to the conclusion that the suit had been undervalued, appropriate orders be framed for the plaint being amended and requisite court fee being demanded. \n(d) For the purposes of maintaining \"consistency\" and \"clarity in adjudication\" even if the commercial court be satisfied with respect to the declarations made in relation to specified value and the suit being found to have been legitimately valued at below Rs. 3 lakhs, the matter be listed before the commercial court to be tried as a non-commercial litigation and thus not bound by the provisions of the CCA. \n(e) All pending IPR suits presently being tried by different non- commercial courts be also placed before the District Judges (Commercial) for following the procedure noted above.\n5. The judgment in Vishal Pipes essentially proceeded on the assumption that IPR suits in Delhi were being deliberately undervalued so as to escape the rigors of the CCA. The learned Single Judge further appears to have proceeded on the premise that bearing in mind the nature of disputes which arise in IPR litigation, it would only be in exceptional cases that valuation would stand pegged at below Rs. 3 lakhs. The learned Single Judge further observed that bearing in mind the rate of court fee which would be applicable in case a suit was valued at below Rs. 3 lakhs, there would exist no valid or justifiable cause to value IPR suits as such \"except for oblique motives\". \n6. It becomes relevant to note that undisputedly the pecuniary jurisdiction of commercial courts in Delhi ranges from Rs. 3 lakhs to Rs.2 crores. Suits which are valued at above Rs. 2 crores are to be placed before the Commercial Division of this Court. It is also the admitted position that insofar as specified value under the CCA is concerned, that too has been notified as Rs. 3 lakhs. Thus, the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction and specified value of District Courts in Delhi is at par. \n7. The learned Ms. Sukumar, has with her characteristic erudition addressed the following submissions for our consideration. It was firstly urged by the learned amicus that regard must be had to the concept of \"specified value\" as introduced by the CCA and which by definition is concerned with the \"subject matter\" of the suit as opposed to the Court Fees Act which bids one to bear in mind the amount at which the \"relief\" sought is valued in the plaint or memorandum of appeal. \n8. Ms. Sukumar submitted that undoubtedly for the purposes of applicability of the CCA, a suit must necessarily qualify both the \"commercial dispute\" and \"specified value\" tests as prescribed by that statute. The learned amicus pointed out that an IPR dispute would undoubtedly fall within Section 2(1)(c)(xvii) of the CCA and thus qualify as a commercial dispute as defined thereunder. Ms. Sukumar then invited our attention to Section 12(1)(d) of the CCA and which while prescribing the manner in which specified value is to be determined for suits pertaining to intangible rights, and which would indubitably include IPR, ties \"specified value\" to the market value of the intangible right as estimated by the plaintiff. It was the submission of Ms. Sukumar that it is only when the aforenoted twin conditions are met that an IPR suit would be liable to be placed and tried by a commercial court. \n9. According to Ms. Sukumar, while the aspect of commercial dispute and specified value is relevant for the purposes of considering whether a suit is liable to be tried in accordance with the CCA, the subject matter of valuation of a suit is also governed and regulated by the provisions of the Court Fees Act as well as the Suits Valuation Act, 19774 both of which connect the valuation of a suit to the value ascribed to the reliefs as may be sought. It was in the aforesaid backdrop that Ms. Sukumar submitted that the \"subject matter\" of a suit is a facet separate and distinct from valuation of suits based on the relief claimed. According to the learned amicus, while the former has a direct bearing on whether the suit proceedings would be governed by the provisions of the CCA, the latter is concerned with the question of court fee as payable in terms of the Court Fees Act. \n10. Ms. Sukumar then submitted that even if an IPR suit were valued at below Rs. 3 lakhs, it could be tried by a District Judge even though it may not be a designated commercial court. It was her Suits Valuation Act submission that no legal provision mandates that all IPR suits must necessarily be tried in accordance with the CCA or only by courts created in terms thereof. According to the learned amicus, there is, in any case, no inherent or apparent incongruity in such suits either being instituted or being tried as non-commercial actions. \n11. Ms. Sukumar also alluded to a contingency where the valuation of a suit based on the relief claimed for the purposes of payment of court fee may be less than Rs. 3 lakhs although the specified value might be more than the above. It was her submission that merely because an IPR suit is valued at below Rs. 3 lakhs based on the relief claimed therein, there would be no legal justification to mandate either the plaint being amended or additional court fee being demanded. According to Ms. Sukumar, such a direction cannot, in any case, be prescribed as an inviolate rule divorced from the court coming to the conclusion that the valuation has been suppressed for mala fide reasons and which in any case would be a question liable to be considered in the facts of each individual case. \n12. Ms. Sukumar also commended for our consideration the judgment rendered by the High Court of Karnataka in Kirloskar Aaf Limited v. American Air Filters Company Inc. & Anr5 where the following observations came to be made: -\n\"8. The twin requirements of this Act are that a dispute has to be a commercial dispute, and secondly, it must be of certain pecuniary limit, namely Rs.3,00,000/- or above. The term commercial dispute has been defined in Section 2(c) of the Act. Section 2(1)(c) (xvii) clearly deals with the intellectual property rights [RFA No.1 of 2015, 25th September, 2018] relating to registered, and unregistered trademarks. Undoubtedly, the present case deals with a trademark the usage of trademark by the appellant, which according to the respondent plaintiff is illegal usage. Thus, the subject matter of the dispute does relate to intellectual property rights. Hence, the dispute is a commercial dispute as defined by Section 2(1)(c)(xvi) of the Act. \n9. The Karnataka Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act deals with the calculation of Court Fees. Section 26 of the said Act clearly states that in a suit for injunction, whether the subject-matter of the suit has a market value, or not, the fee shall be computed on the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint, or on rupees one thousand whichever is higher. Therefore, a distinction has to be made between the value of the subject-matter, and the calculation of Court fees. According to Section 26(c), the Court fee shall be based on the relief sought, and the value of the relief mentioned in the plaint. Admittedly, in the present case, in the plaint, the relief sought was valued as Rs.3,000/. But nonetheless, the value of the subject matter, that is the infringement of the trademark, has not been stated. But considering the fact that the dispute relates to the infringement of trademark that too by a company, the value of the subject matter can safely be taken to be more than Rs.3,00,000/-. (emphasis supplied) ... \nTherefore, the Registry is directed to list this appeal before the Commercial Appellate Division of this Court.\"\n13. Ms. Sukumar while referring to the decision in Vishal Pipes submitted that the directions as framed would tend to not only disrupt the distribution of matters between commercial and non-commercial courts, they also appear to cast an onerous and additional obligation on commercial courts to examine the valuation of all suits relating to IPR. It was her submission that the directions as framed in Vishal Pipes may therefore merit being modified to be read as all IPR suits which are valued at below Rs. 3 lakhs alone being scrutinized by the concerned court so as to verify the valuation as declared and to allay all doubts with respect to undervaluation. This exercise, according to learned counsel, could be undertaken by any court before which the suit is laid, irrespective of whether it be a commercial or a non- commercial court. \n14. The learned amicus further suggested that apart from the above, plaintiffs in IPR suits which are instituted as non-commercial actions should additionally be called upon to certify that they have not taken an inconsistent stand with respect to valuation in any previous litigation that may have been instituted. Ms. Sukumar submitted that the aforesaid declaration would not only cast a responsibility upon plaintiffs but additionally place a positive obligation upon them to truthfully disclose the value of the subject matter of the suit and consequentially deter forum shopping. \n15. Appearing for the appellant, learned counsel at the outset submitted that the District Judge has committed a manifest illegality and caused grave prejudice to the plaintiff by vacating the injunction which operated on the suit solely on the basis of the doubts which were harboured with respect to the certification submitted by the C.A. According to learned counsel, that could not have possibly constituted a valid or justifiable ground for vacation of the injunction. \n16. Proceeding further to deal with the issue of declaration of specified value, it was submitted that the suit had been valued at Rs.\n10 lakhs based on the reliefs which were claimed therein. According to learned counsel, bearing in mind the well settled principle of dominus litis, it was clearly open to the plaintiff to ascribe a particular valuation based on the reliefs that were claimed. Learned counsel also drew our attention to the judgment rendered by the Full Bench of this Court in Sheila Devi and Ors. Vs. Kishan Lal Kalra and Ors.6 where the Court had held that a plaintiff has the requisite discretion to place a value on the reliefs as claimed by him in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of the Court Fees Act. Learned counsel drew our attention to the following passages from the decision in Sheila Devi:\n\"Section 7 of the Court-fees Act provides for the computation of the amount of court-fee payable under the Act in the suits mentioned in the various paragraphs of the Section. As pointed out by M/s V. V. Chitaley and S. Appurao in Note I in their Commentary on Section 7 of the Court-fees Act, an analysis of the said paragraphs shows that the section adopts three modes of valuation of a suit, viz. (1) by valuing the subject matter according to its market value (vide paragraph (iii), (v) (d) and (e), etc.); (2) by giving to the subject matter an artificial value based on specified rules of calculation (vide paragraph (v) (a), (b) and (c); and (3) by requiring the plaintiff himself to value the relief he seeks (vide paragraph (iv). We are concerned here with the last mode. Paragraph (iv) contains clauses (a) to (f) each of which deals with a particular kind of suit. But, the court-fee payable under all the clauses is to, be computed according to one general rule which is given at the end of the paragraph. It requires the plaintiff in any of the suits mentioned in the various clauses to state the amount at which \"he values the relief sought\", and the amount of court-fee payable to be computed according to the said amount at which \"the relief sought 1974 SCC OnLine Del 136 is valued\" in the plaint. In other words, it requires the plaintiff himself to value the relief he seeks. \nxxxx xxxx xxxx We have thus only Section 7(iv) of the Cour-fees Act on a consideration of the scope and effect of which the question under consideration has to be answered. A plain reading of paragraph (iv) of Section 7 shows that it requires the plaintiff in any of the suits mentioned in the various clauses thereof to state the amount at which \"he values the relief sought\", and the amount of court- fee payable to be computed according to the said amount at which \"the relief sought is valued\" in the plaint. It is implicit in it, and it is also not disputed, that the paragraph requires the plaintiff himself to value the relief he seeks. The only question for consideration is whether the plaintiff has the right to place any valuation that he likes. The paragraph does not by itself impose any restriction or condition as regards the valuation by the plaintiff. When the statutory provision itself has not imposed any such restriction or condition, it would not be proper, in our opinion, for a Court to introduce such a restriction or condition into the section. The plain language of the provision gives an unrestricted choice to the plaintiff to value the relief. It would not, Therefore, be proper for a Court to say that the relief was undervalued and to correct the said valuation invoking the general power mentioned in Order VII Rule 11(b) or the inherent power saved by Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The provision in paragraph (iv) of Section 7 of the Court-fees Act which gives a free hand to the plaintiff to place any valuation that he likes and does not place/any restriction or condition has, in our opinion, so far as the suits mentioned in that paragraph are concerned, the effect of taking away the general power of the Court under Order VII Rule 11(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure and the inherent power to correct an undervaluation. The general power and the inherent power stand modified by the special statutory provision in Section 7(iv) of the Court-fees Act. In other words, in, our opinion, paragraph (iv) of Section 7 of the Court-fees Act gives a right to the plaintiff to place any valuation that he likes on the relief he seeks, and the Court has no power to interfere with the plaintiff's valuation. This view is quite in conformity with the nature of the suits mentioned in clauses (a) to (f) of paragraph (iv) of Section 7. All the said suits are such that it is not possible for the plaintiff to specify the precise value of the relief he seeks in each of the said suits. A perusal of the various clauses (a) to (f) shows the same. That was why the legislature obviously thought it fit to leave to the plaintiff to place any valuation the likes on the relief he seeks in such suits. It was sought to be argued that the aforesaid view would permit the plaintiff to place any arbitrary or fanciful value on the relief he seeks. When the nature of the suit is such that no precise value can be placed on the relief sought, arid for that reason there cannot be any definite standard by which it can be said that the relief has been under-valued or not , the question of the valuation being arbitrary or fanciful does not arise. To say in such a, case that the valuation placed by the plaintiff is arbitrary or fanciful and seek to interfere with the same would amount to a re-writing of the statutory provision in paragraph (iv) of Section 7 of the Court-fees Act which a Court cannot do. So far as suits for mesne profits and suits for accounts are concerned, Section 11 of the Court-fees Act provides that if the profits or the amount decreed are or is in excess of the profits claimed or the amount at which the plaintiff values the relief sought, the decree shall not be executed until the difference between the fee actually paid and the fee which would have been payable had the suit comprised the whole of the profits or the amount so decreed shall have been paid to the proper officer. In that way, so, far as the said suits are concerned, the legislature has taken care to safeguard the revenue and to see that the plaintiff does no get away with a decree for an amount in his favor without paying adequate court-fee therefore. No question, of a decree for an amount being passed arises in the other suits mentioned in clauses (a) to (e) of paragraph (iv) of Section 7 of the Court-fees Act. Thus, the view taken by us above seems to be the proper one to be taken on a plain interpretation of the relevant provisions (Sections 7(iv) and 11) in the Court-fees Act.\nxxxx xxxx xxxx As pointed out in paragraph 15 of the judgment in the case of 5. Rm. Ar. S. Sp. Sathappa Chettiar (supra) , (1) the effect of the provision in Section 8 of the Suits Valuation Act is \"to make the value for the purpose of jurisdiction dependent upon the value as determinabte for computation of court-fees\", and \"the computation of court- fees in suits falling under Section 7(iv) of the Court-fees Act depends upon the valuation that the plaintiff makes in respect of his claim\". Also, \"once the plaintiff exercises his option and values his claim for the purpose of court-fees, that determines the value for jurisdiction\" and \"not vice versa\". In other words, the value for the purpose of court-fee under Section 7(iv) of the Court-fees Act should be fixed first, and then by virtue of Section 8 of the Suits Valuation Act the same value would be the value for the purpose of jurisdiction. However, if there are rules made by any High Court under Section 9 of the Suits Valuation Act and the same are applicable, the valuation for the purpose of court- fees under Section 7(iv) of the Court-fees Act will have to be made according to such rules. So far as the rules made, by the Punjab High Court are concerned, it has to be noted that Rules 3 and 4 set out above contemplate separate valuation for the purpose of court-fees and for the purpose of jurisdiction. So, if the said rules are applicable, the valuation for purpose of court-fees would be separate from the valuation for the purpose of jurisdiction as provided in the said rules. It has also to be noted that under Rule 4, in the case of suits to which it applies the value for the purpose of court-fee is to be as determined by the Court-fees Act. That means that as regards suits falling under Section 7(iv) of the Court- fees Act, the value for the purposes of court-fee would be the value as fixed by the plaintiff. The value for the purpose of jurisdiction would be the value fixed by the plaintiff in the plaint \"subject to determination by the Court at any stage of the trial\". In other words, if Rule 4 applies, the value for the purpose of court-fee would be the value as fixed by the plaintiff in the plaint and the same cannot be interfered with by the Court, while the Value for the purpose of jurisdiction would normally by the value fixed by the plaintiff in the plaint subject, however, to determination by the Court at any stage of the trial. This is the position that emerges on the view taken by us as regards the scope and effect of paragraph (iv) of Section 7 of the Court-fees Act, reading the said paragraph along with Sections 8 and 9 and the Rules framed under Section 9 of the Suits Valuation Act in case they are applicable. \nxxxx xxxx xxxx For the foregoing reasons, our answer to the first question that has been referred is in the negative, i.e. that Paragraph (iv) of Section 7 of the Court-fees Act gives a right to the plaintiff in any of the suits mentioned in the clauses of that paragraph to place any valuation that he likes on the relief he seeks, subject, however, to any rules made under Section 9 of the Suits Valuation Act, and the Court has no power to interfere with the plaintiff's valuation.\" \n17. In addition to the judgment rendered by the Full Bench of this Court, learned counsel also placed reliance upon the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in Tara Devi Vs. Sri Thakur Radha Krishna Maharaj, through Sebaits Chandeshwar Prasad and Meshwar Prasad and Anr.7 and where too the Supreme Court had reiterated the position of the plaintiff being entitled to estimate the reliefs sought in the suit and the same being liable to be ordinarily accepted both for the purposes of court fees as well as jurisdiction. \n18. Insofar as the provisions of the CCA are concerned, learned counsel sought to draw sustenance from the judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of this Court in Soni Dave Vs. Trans Asian Industries Expositions Pvt. Ltd.8 where while considering the interplay between Section 12 of the CCA and the provisions contained in the Court Fees and Suits Valuation Acts, the following pertinent (1987) 4 SCC 69 2016 SCC OnLine Del 4282 observations came to be made: \n\"25. The Commercial Courts Act has not been enacted to interfere with the Courts Fees Act or the Suits Valuation Act. It is a settled principle of law that the provisions such as Section 21 supra have to be read and interpreted by finding out the extent to which the legislature intended to give it a overriding effect and the context in which such a provision is made and on a consideration of purpose and policy underlying the enactment. It is also relevant to consider whether the conflicting enactment can be described as a special one and in which case the special one may prevail over the more general one, notwithstanding that the general one is later in time.\nxxxx xxxx xxxx 27. In my view Section 12 of the Commercial Courts Act providing for determination of specified value as defined in Section 2(i) thereof is not intended to provide for a new mode of determining the valuation of the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction and court fees. It would be incongruous to hold that while for the purpose of payment of court fees the deemed fiction provided in the Court Fees Act for determining the value of the property is to apply but not for determining the specified value under the Commercial Courts Act.\nxxxx xxxx xxxx 28. In my opinion Section 12 of the Commercial Courts Act has to be read harmoniously with the Court Fees Act and the Suits Valuation Act and reading so, the specified value of a suit where the relief sought relates to immovable property or to a right thereunder has to be according to the market value of the immovable property only in such suits where the suit as per the Court Fees Act and / or the Suits Valuation Act has to be valued on the market value of the property and not where as per the Court Fees Act and the Suits Valuation Act the valuation of a suit even if for the relief of recovery of immovable property or a right therein is required to be anything other than market value as is the case in a suit by a landlord for recovery of possession of immovable property from a tenant.\" \n19. Learned counsel submitted that the view as expressed in Soni Dave has been followed by different High Courts of the country as would be evident from the following decisions rendered by the Karnataka and Kerala High Courts:-\ni ) Fine Footwear Pvt. Ltd. Represented by its Director v. \n                                     Skechers USA Inc. and Anr.9                             ii )      C.K. Surendran Vs. Kunhimoosa10                             iii )     Bangalore Blues Entertainment India Private Limited Vs. One Ikigaii Edutech Private Limited and Ors.11 20. Learned counsel submitted that the Court in Vishal Pipes clearly erred in attempting to distinguish the principles propounded in Soni Dave merely on the ground that the same emanated from a suit relating to immovable property. According to learned counsel, Soni Dave had in unequivocal terms held that section 12 of the CCA cannot possibly be construed as constructing a new or novel method for valuation of suits or for that matter mandating a departure from the provisions contained in the Court Fees and Suits Valuation Acts. \n21. It was also the submission of learned counsel that the principles laid down in Vishal Pipes also fail to bear in consideration situations where quia timet actions may be instituted and thus actions being commenced at a time when a defendant is yet to commence use of the complained mark or suits which may be legitimately instituted based on an apprehension of infringement and passing-off. It was submitted 2019 SCC OnLine Kar 1024 2021 SCC OnLine Ker 9808 Miscellaneous First Appeal No. 6392 of 2022 (CPC), Decided on: 02.01.2023 that the directions as formulated in Vishal Pipes would be rendered wholly unworkable in such situations. This, according to learned counsel, would additionally merit Vishal Pipes being reviewed. \n22. It was further contended that Vishal Pipes clearly fails to bear in mind the distinction which must be recognized to exist between the concepts of specified value and valuation of a suit for the purposes of court fee. According to learned counsel, the concept of specified value becomes relevant only for the purposes of determining whether a particular suit is liable to be placed before a commercial court. Learned counsel also laid stress on Section 12(1)(d) itself enabling the plaintiff to declare the market value of an intangible right based on its own estimation. It was thus contended that the court in Vishal Pipes has clearly failed to bear the aforesaid aspects in consideration and has erroneously proceeded on the premise that all IPR suits which may be valued at below Rs. 3 lakhs have been so filed only for the purposes of escaping from the rigors of the CCA.\n23. Having considered the aforenoted submissions, we at the outset find merit in the submissions addressed by Ms. Sukumar and learned counsel for the appellant when they contended that Vishal Pipes appears to have confused the aspects of specified value and valuation based on the reliefs claimed. The CCA would inarguably be attracted to any action which relates to a commercial dispute falling within the ambit of section 2(1)(c) and where the specified value of the subject matter goes beyond the minimum Rs. 3 lakhs pecuniary limit as notified. Undisputedly if the declared specified value be Rs. 3 lakhs or above and the suit relate to a commercial dispute, it would necessarily have to be placed before the notified commercial court. \n24. However, in our considered opinion, it would be wholly incorrect to proceed on the premise that the dispute forming the subject matter of IPR suits would necessarily and invariably be liable to be valued at Rs. 3 lakhs or above. While we do not intend to convey a position of a deliberate undervaluation being accorded a judicial imprimatur, we are of the firm opinion that it would be wholly incorrect for courts to proceed on the presumption that an IPR suit when valued at below Rs. 3 lakhs is necessarily based on ulterior motives or a mala fide intent to avoid application of the CCA. We note that the issue of whether a particular suit has been deliberately undervalued is one which can always be examined and scrutinized by a competent court. Ultimately the issue of a deliberate suppression of valuation would have to be considered and answered based on the facts obtaining in an individual case. All that we deem apposite to note and observe in this respect is that Vishal Pipes clearly appears to have been incorrectly decided when it formulated a direction mandating that normally in all IPR cases, the valuation ought to be Rs. 3 lakhs and above. \n25. We also find merit in the submission of Ms. Sukumar who alluded to the disruptive outcome of the directions contained in Para 66 (iv) and (v) of Vishal Pipes. As would be evident from a reading of the various provisions of the CCA, a suit is liable to be placed before the notified commercial court only if it relates to a commercial dispute and crosses the threshold of Rs. 3 lakhs as the specified value when determined in accordance with Section 12. Undisputedly, unless the twin factors of \"commercial dispute\" and \"specified value\"\nare met, a matter cannot be placed before or be taken cognizance of by a commercial court. It is in the aforesaid backdrop that we find ourselves unable to appreciate or sustain the directions contained in sub-paragraphs (iv) and (v) of Para 66 of Vishal Pipes. \n26 . Undisputedly, the direct fallout of Para 66 (iv) is that even where suits are found to have been correctly valued at below Rs. 3 lakhs and are thus liable to be tried as non-commercial suits, they are liable to be listed before the District Judge (Commercial) and be tried in accordance with the law as ordinarily applicable. If the suit is ultimately found to have been correctly valued at below Rs. 3 lakhs, the District Judge (Commercial) would clearly stand denuded of jurisdiction to try the same. It would, therefore, be wholly inappropriate for us by way of a judicial fiat to direct such non- commercial suits to be tried by District Judges (Commercial) notwithstanding those suits not meeting the threshold criteria constructed in terms of the CCA. \n27. We also find ourselves unable to approve the direction for transfer of all pending IPR suits presently laid before District Judges (Non-Commercial) to be placed before the commercial courts in Delhi. The said direction clearly flies in the face of the primordial conditions statutorily created by the CCA. In our considered view, unless the twin conditions of commercial dispute and specified value are satisfied, a suit cannot be tried by a commercial court. The directions formulated in Vishal Pipes and embodied in Para 66 (iv) and (v) thus clearly distort the distribution of matters between commercial and non-commercial courts as statutorily ordained. In fact, if those directions were to be affirmed, they would operate so as to create and confer jurisdiction on commercial courts contrary to the qualifying criterion as laid in place by the CCA. \n28. On due consideration of the questions which stand raised, we find that Vishal Pipes clearly appears to have firstly proceeded on a general presumption of IPR suits being liable to be valued at Rs. 3 lakhs and above. It then presupposes that every instance of an IPR suit below Rs. 3 lakhs must be understood as being actuated by a mala fide intent to overreach the provisions of the CCA and the plaintiff indulging in forum shopping. We are of the view that not only is such a premise wholly conjectural, it amounts to painting all actions, legitimate or otherwise, with a common brush. We thus find ourselves unable to either countenance or approve the presumptions which constitute the foundation for the directions which ultimately came to be formulated in para 66 of Vishal Pipes. While it would still be open for a court to consider and examine whether a particular suit has been deliberately undervalued, the valuation as ascribed by a plaintiff cannot be doubted merely on the basis of a surmise. \n29. Insofar as para 66 (ii) and (iii) are concerned we find merit in the submission of Ms. Sukumar that all IPR suits in which a valuation has been pegged at below Rs. 3 lakhs may be duly examined by the court before which those matters are presently laid. We find no justification for the withdrawal of those matters from the competent courts and their placement before a commercial court for the purposes of ascertaining the correctness of the valuation as declared. That exercise can very well be undertaken by the competent court itself. If the competent court, in the facts of a particular case, ultimately comes to conclude that the valuation of an IPR suit has been deliberately suppressed, it could always frame appropriate directions for the plaint being amended and additional court fee being demanded. However, those directions would be warranted only when the concerned court comes to a definitive conclusion in the facts of a particular case that the declared valuation is patently incorrect or is actuated by ulterior motives. \n30. We further note that Section 12 and which sets out the basis for determination of specified value is essentially placed in the statute in order to subserve the provisions of the CCA and which are intended to require suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value being placed either before the notified commercial court or the Commercial Division of a High Court. However, Section 12 cannot possibly be construed as seeking to override the principles enshrined in the Court Fees and Suits Valuation Acts. This is evident when one bears in mind the intent of Section 12 and which clearly appears to be restricted to the determination of the value of the subject matter of the commercial dispute alone. Sections 2(1)(c) and 12 essentially constitute the two gateways which when crossed would lead to a particular matter being placed before a commercial court. That is the only purpose which those two provisions serve. They, however, clearly do not appear to be imbued with any legislative intent to override the provisions of the Court Fees and Suits Valuation enactments and which entitles a plaintiff to ascribe a value to the reliefs as claimed in the suit. The provisions contained in the Court Fees and Suits Valuation statutes are principally concerned with the imposition of court fee and other related matters. Insofar as the subject of court fee is concerned, it would be the amount as claimed by the plaintiff bearing in mind the nature of reliefs which are sought which would be determinative. We thus find ourselves unable to discern or read any provision of the CCA which may be said to mandate a contrary view being taken or the provisions of the Court Fee and Suits Valuation statutes being ignored. \n31. We also cannot ignore the contingency alluded to by Ms. Sukumar and who had urged us to consider a situation where even though the subject matter of the commercial dispute be more than Rs. 3 lakhs, the amount as claimed in terms of the reliefs as framed may be less than the aforenoted threshold limit. If the directions as framed in Vishal Pipes were to be accepted, the plaintiff in such a situation would be compelled to pay court fee on the basis of specified value as opposed to the amount claimed in terms of the reliefs as sought. It was in order to avoid the said conflict that Soni Dave correctly harmonized the provisions contained in the CCA and the Court Fees and Suits Valuation Acts. Soni Dave also rightly negated the argument based on Section 21 of the CCA. As we read the provisions of the said enactment, we come to the firm conclusion that the CCA did not intend to either override the provisions of the Court Fees and Suits Valuation Acts nor was it intended to regulate the subject of court fees.\n32. Our inability to subscribe or accede to the directions framed in Vishal Pipes is further fortified when those directives are tested in the backdrop of a quia timet action. It would clearly be impossible to accord an imprimatur to those directions in situations where loss cannot be quantified or where the infringement is apprehended. Learned counsel for the appellant thus clearly appears to be correct when he contended that the directions framed by the Court in Vishal Pipes would be rendered unworkable in such contingencies. \n33. We thus come to conclude that while it would be open for the competent court to examine the declared specified value and the value ascribed to the reliefs claimed in an IPR suit if it be pegged at below Rs. 3 lakhs, the issue of undervaluation would have to be evaluated based on the facts of each case. The aforesaid exercise can be legally undertaken by the competent court itself and such matters need not be transferred to commercial courts for the aforesaid purpose. \n34. The Court further finds merit in the suggestion mooted by Ms. Sukumar of an additional declaration being made by plaintiffs in IPR suits where valuation is placed at below Rs. 3 lakhs. We thus direct that in all such cases, the plaintiff would have to declare that it has not taken an inconsistent position with respect to specified value in any other litigation pending or instituted in the past. \n35. Reverting to the facts of the present case, we find that the District Judge had clearly erred in vacating the ex parte injunction consequent to a purported failure on the part of the appellant to dutifully place all particulars relating to specified value. Those were defects which were curable. In any case, such a mistake or failure in compliance did not justify the vacation of the injunction which had been granted. The impugned order to the aforesaid extent is clearly liable to be set aside. We however leave it open to the appellant to place on the record of the proceedings pending before the District Judge such additional material as may be chosen and desired insofar as specified value is concerned. The issue of court fee and valuation would however have to be considered in light of the observations rendered hereinabove. \n36. We consequently allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order dated 21 February 2023. The matter shall stand remanded to the concerned District Judge for deciding the pending issues afresh in accordance with the principles enunciated hereinabove. The ex parte injunction which stood revived in terms of our order dated 25 April 2023 passed on the instant appeal shall continue to hold the field. We however accord liberty to the defendant/respondent to apply for vacation of the ex parte injunction if so chosen and advised. Any such application, if so moved, may be decided in accordance with law. \n37. We, for reasons aforenoted, find ourselves unable to affirm or approve the directions contained in Para 66 (iv) and (v) of Vishal Pipes. They shall consequently stand overruled. Any matters which in the interregnum may have been transferred to designated commercial courts for compliance with the directions issued in Vishal Pipes shall revert to the competent courts for being tried in accordance with the observations made hereinabove. \n38. To avoid inconvenience to parties, we request the concerned District Judges to display a list of all such matters indicating the courts to which they would revert and the dates on which they would be called before the appropriate courts. A list of all such matters carrying details as indicated above, may also be uploaded on the web portals of the concerned District Courts. The courts upon receipt of such matters shall proceed further and in accordance with the directions framed hereinabove. \n39. We request the Registrar General of this Court to bring the present judgment to the notice of all the Principal District Judges for necessary compliance. \nYASHWANT VARMA, J.\nDHARMESH SHARMA, J.\nNOVEMBER 02, 2023 /kk",

(hereafter collectively referred to as 'respondents') 4. the respondents claim to be engaged in the business of various types of confectionary items. from the year prior to 1996, the respondents claim to be selling their products throughout the country through its dealers / distributors. it is claimed that the trademark 'madhur' was adopted by the predecessors of the respondents for the confectionery items. respondent no.1 claim to have devised various trademarks / labels from time to time and have acquired registration of various trademarks in class 30, including the trademarks in dispute, which are 'madhur rose pop lollipops' and three-dimensional rose shape in the class 30. 5. respondent no.1 claims that trademark / label has original artistic works and he have also acquired copyright registration on the shape of rose. 6. the respondents also claim to have extensively sold their goods under the trademark in dispute. the sales figure of the confectionary products including the rose shaped lollipops under the trademark in dispute, sold by respondents for the year 2020-2021 is claimed to be ₹88,89,68,411/-. respondent no.1, therefore, claims rights over the distinctive shaped lollipop, in a rose flower shape, where the colour of rose flower is red and the colour of the stem along with leaves is green. they claim to be selling the rose shaped lollipops under the trademark of 'rose pop' along with its house mark 'madhur' with the word 'rose' appearing in a red colour font and word 'pop' appearing in a green colour font in a distinct style with the word 'lollipops' appearing after the words 'rose pop' with each letter in a different colour. 7. respondent no.1 claims to have adopted the distinctive and novel rose shaped lollipop and the trademark / label 'madhur rose pop' on 15.11.2016. it is claimed that the rose shaped lollipop is exclusively associated with the respondents. 8. as mentioned above, respondent no.1 claims to be the proprietor of the registered word mark 'rose pop', label mark 'madhur rose pop lollipops' and three-dimensional shape mark on a figure of rose, all in class 30. respondent no.1 also claims to be registered proprietor of rose shaped lollipop under the copyright act, 1957 and claims that the rose shape of a lollipop is his invention and nobody prior to him had devised or sold a lollipop in the shape of a rose. 9. respondent no.1 claims to be exclusively using the said marks since november, 2016 and to have acquired an unimpeachable reputation. the respondents claim that public and members of trade, associate the trademark as well as the shape of lollipop being the design of a rose with respondent no.1. they also claim to have given wide publicity to their trademark 'madhur rose pop lollipops' as well as the rose shaped lollipop. 10. respondent no.1 also claims to be vigilant about his rights with respect to the trademark 'madhur rose pop lollipops' and the rose shaped lollipop. in the year 2018, when respondent no.1 came to know about the lollipop in the shape of a rose being sold under the trademark 'rekha gulab lollipop', filed a suit being cs(comm) 133/2019, wherein an ex-parte interim order was granted in favour of respondent no.1. the said suit, however, was later compromised and a decree was passed in favour of respondent no.1. respondent no.1, in the month of january, 2021, came to know about the availability of a lollipop in a shape of rose under the mark / label 'sweet rose lollipop' being sold by the appellants. a notice dated 19.01.2021 was sent by respondent no.1 asking the appellants' to cease and desist from manufacturing the lollipop in a shape of a rose and also claiming that the trademark / label 'sweet rose lollipop' is deceptively similar to its trademark / label 'madhur rose pop lollipops'. 11. the appellants replied to the said notice and also filed an application for rectification of respondent no.1's trademark registration in shape of a rose in class 30. the respondents claim that the use of identical shape of lollipop by the appellants is bound to cause confusion amongst the purchasing public, which are likely to be misled into thinking that the appellants' goods originate from the same source as that of the respondents. it is, thus, claimed that the present case is a case wherein, the marks are identical and are used in respect of identical goods sold/distributed through the same trade channels. this led the respondents to file the instant suit being cs (comm) 251/2021. 12. for the ease of reference, the conflicting marks are reproduced as under: source appellants' unicon sweet respondents' madhur rose label rose pop label suit samples product samples 13. the learned commercial court, by the impugned order dated 28.10.2021, allowed the application filed by the respondents under order xxxix rules 1 & 2 of cpc and by the same order, dismissed the application filed by the appellants under order xxxix rule 4 of cpc and restrained the appellants from: i. manufacturing, exporting, selling, offering for sale, advertising, exhibiting, directly or indirectly dealing in the goods bearing the shape of rose in class 30; ii. manufacturing, exporting, selling, offering for sale, advertising, exhibiting, directly or indirectly dealing under the mark / label 'sweet rose lollipop' or any other identical / deceptively similar trademark to the respondent no.1's trademark 'madhur rose pop lollipops'; iii. the appellants were also restrained from manufacturing, exporting, selling, offering for sale, advertising, exhibiting, directly or indirectly dealing in goods, lollipops etc. and other cognate / allied goods such as chocolates, cookies, toffee and confectionery items under the packaging package or any other identical / deceptively similar any other packaging which is identical /deceptively similar to the respondent no.1's packaging. 14. the learned commercial court held that the shape of the appellants' product being is deceptively similar to the shape of respondents' product being ; the mark 'sweet rose lollipop' is deceptively similar to the trademark 'madhur rose pop lollipop'; the packaging is deceptively similar to packaging . 15. the learned commercial court held that the appellants had recently launched their rose shaped lollipop and were earlier selling / marketing lollipops of different shape(s). 16. the learned commercial court held that the mark 'rose' is common and cannot be monopolised. however, it held that the respondents have only claimed their rights in respect of the rose shaped lollipop, which has a striking similarity with the rose shaped lollipop being manufactured by the appellants, and has a likelihood of causing confusion / deception among the purchasing public and users of the same. the learned commercial court also relied upon an order dated 01.06.2018 passed by learned single judge this court in the case of ferrero spa & ors. v. mr. kishor j. savlani & ors : cs (comm) no. 966/2018, to hold that the protection to the trademark is to be granted when the plaintiff claims the exclusivity over the shape of a product. 17. the learned commercial court also held that the packaging of the products has a striking similarity. the court observed that comparison of the packaging shows that the appellants have copied many features of the respondents' label, including the artistic work rose, and the same cannot be a co-incidence or an honest adoption. 18. in regard to the contention that the respondents have obtained the registration in respect of a rose shape illegally, the court held that the same is pending consideration before the trademark registry, and no observations could be made by the court at that stage. submissions 19. the learned counsel for the appellants vehemently contended that the marks 'unicon sweet rose' and 'madhur rose pop lollipops', when compared as a whole, are not remotely similar and the only common element in both the marks is the word 'rose'. 20. he submitted that the learned commercial court itself had categorically noted that the word 'rose' is a common word and cannot be monopolised by anyone. 21. he submitted that the packaging of both the products is dissimilar, and is demonstrably different in all respects, including colour scheme, elements, shape, arrangement of features and get up etc. 22. he further submitted that the respondents cannot claim exclusivity over the rose shaped lollipops, which have been in the market for decades prior to the respondents' claim of adoption in november, 2016. even otherwise, the shape being adopted by the appellants is completely different from the shape used by the respondents for their lollipops. he submitted that in the appellants' lollipops, the stem is much longer and does not have any leaves. 23. he further submitted that the learned commercial court erred in rejecting the contention that the rose shape is common to trade and is used by several entities. the material placed on record demonstrate that the rose shape lollipop is a common product and is sold on various e-commerce websites by many confectionery sellers in india and overseas. he relied upon the photographs of third party rose shaped lollipops, e-commerce websites commercially selling rose shaped lollipops in india, invoice showing purchase of rose shaped lollipops etc., to contend that there is no novelty in a confectionery being made, in shape of a 'rose'. he further submitted that even if, the same is registered, the party in whose favour registration is granted, cannot claim more than what has been granted to it. 24. it is, thus, contended that the shape being generic, cannot be monopolised by the respondents. the learned counsel relied upon the decision of the hon'ble apex court in the case of skyline education institute (india) private limited v. s.l. vaswani & anr : (2010) 2 supreme court cases 142 and the decision of this hon'ble court in the case of bhole baba milk food industries limited v. parul food specialities (p) ltd.: ilr (2011) delhi 317, in support of his arguments that the party using a mark, which is common to trade, bears the risk of it being used by others. 25. he vehemently contended that respondent no.1 did not invent the rose shaped lollipop but merely got the same registered in his favour. he submitted that an appropriate application for rectification has already been filed, which is pending before the trade mark registry. he also relied upon the whatsapp chats and the invoices issued prior in time in order to show that the rose shape in respect of a lollipop, had been adopted by various confectionary manufacturers and sellers prior to the claim of the respondents. 26. it is contended that there is no distinctiveness in the rose shaped lollipops and the registration of the trademark was, thus, wrongly granted and the appellants' rectification application is liable to be allowed. for anyone, who claims distinctiveness in a shape, a user for several years has to be established, whereas the respondents applied for the registration and claimed to the user from the same date, that is, in november 2016. 27. in the alternative, it is contended that the respondents at best would have an exclusive right in the specific shape being demonstrated in the registration certificate and no monopoly can be claimed in respect of all shapes of a rose. the shape being adopted by the appellants is not at all similar with the shape of the respondent's product. 28. he further submitted that the learned commercial court further erred in holding that the appellants' mark 'unicon sweet rose' is deceptively similar to respondent no.1's mark 'madhur rose pop lollipops'. he submitted that the only common element in both marks is the word 'rose', which even as per the learned commercial court, cannot be monopolised by anyone. thus, minus the word 'rose', the marks used by the parties, by no stretch of imagination, can be perceived as similar. 29. he further submitted that the packaging being used by the appellants also cannot be termed similar to the packaging being used by respondent no.1 for his lollipops. he submitted that the packaging being used by parties, that is, a box with a transparent top showing the lollipop is being used virtually by all manufacturers and sellers of lollipops. the colour scheme, element, shape, layout, get up etc. in both the packaging is otherwise not similar. 30. it is lastly contended that the respondents had supressed the material facts from the learned commercial court, which disentitles them from any interim relief the respondents did not file the copy of the cancellation petition filed by the appellants against their registration of shape of 'rose'; and also, did not place on record the reply sent by the appellants to the notice dated 19.01.2021. 31. the learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, submitted that the learned commercial court, after considering the material facts, has rightly passed the impugned order injuncting the appellants from manufacturing / selling the products with the impugned trademark. he submitted that it is an admitted fact that the registration of shape of a 'rose' was granted in favour of respondent no.1, which entitles the respondents for an order of injunction against a party using similar trademarks without any authority. 32. he submitted that the appellants are not allowed to question the validity of the registration in the present proceedings and the court has rightly passed an appropriate order on the basis of the registration being in favour of respondent no.1. the registration of a mark is a proof of a validity of a right in favour of the respondents. once it is admitted that a shape of a product can also be registered as a trademark, the appellants cannot resist the injunction till such time the registration is valid and subsisting. any registration granted in favour of a party is prima facie evidence of its validity and the registered trademark cannot be held to be invalid on the ground that the same was not registrable under section 9 of the trade marks act, 1999. 33. he further submitted that the appellants have given no reasoning for adoption of an identical shape of a rose for their product. he stated that the appellants had, at no stage prior to the present suit, opposed the grant of registration of the rose shaped lollipop in favour of respondent no.1. analysis 34. the learned commercial court has restrained the appellant from; (i) manufacturing, selling and marketing the lollipops with a shape of rose; (ii) manufacturing, selling and marketing its products with a trademark 'unicon sweet rose' holding it to be prima facie similar to the trademark used by the respondent 'madhur rose pop lollipops'; and (iii) manufacturing, selling and marketing etc. the confectionary items under the packaging holding it to be deceptively similar to the packaging used by the respondent being 35. since the three injunctions have been granted, we would be dealing with each one of them separately. 36. whether the appellants' manufacturing / selling / marketing its product 'lollipop' in the shape of rose amounts to infringement of the trademark belonging to the respondent being 36.1 the learned commercial court, in the present case, granted the interim injunction prima facie holding that the shape of the product made by the appellants is identical to the shape of the product manufactured by the respondents. 36.2 the respondents, having the shape registered as trademark, are held to be entitled for an order of injunction. 36.3 it is not disputed that the product, being manufactured / marketed / sold by both the parties, is confectionary item being 'lollipop'. 36.4 it is a trite law that in any action for infringement of the trademark, the first and foremost test to be satisfied is the test of similarity between the two marks. the court has to consider not only the appearance or the phonetics of the marks but also the goods in respect of which they are used, the nature of consumers who are likely to buy those goods, the intent of the user in adopting the mark, and also the number and nature of similar marks in use, in respect of similar goods in the same class. 36.5 the court also has to consider the nature and extent of any actual confusion and the stretch of time during which the mark has been used and the extent to which the user has a right to exclude others from the use of its mark in respect their goods. 36.6 under the trade and merchandise marks act, 1958, the definition of the word 'mark' did not include the shape of goods, however, under the trade marks act, 1999, the trademark protection was extended to features such as shape of goods, packaging, sound, smell and combination of colours amongst others as long as they fulfil the function of a trademark which is essentially the source identification. 36.7 as per the provisions under the trade marks act, 1999, the shape of the product is now protected as long as the same is identifiable with the source of the product. the same is held to be registrable if it has acquired a secondary meaning. 36.8 it is now settled that in order for a shape to be registered as a trademark, it has to be shown that the shape is not the generic shape of the product, rather has a distinct shape, which associates the mark with the source without adding anything further like a name or a logo. 36.9 a single judge of this court in the case of knitpro international v. examiner of trade marks through registrar of trade marks: 2022:dhc:2631, while analysing the law in relation to the shape of a product being claimed as a trademark held as under: \"13. thus, the settled legal position is that in order for a shape trademark to be registered, it has to be shown that the said shape is not the generic shape of the product. it has to be a distinctive shape that associates the mark with the source by itself without anything further like a name or logo appended on it. the shape must have lost its inherent or generic meaning and ought to have acquired a secondary connotation. the standard of distinctiveness required to be acquired would be quite high.\" 36.10 respondent no.1, in the present case, admittedly claimed to have adopted the shape of a 'rose' in respect of their product in the year 2016, when he applied for its registration. it is not a case where the respondents claimed distinctiveness to the shape of the product on account of using the same for considerable period of time. it is pointed out that in an objection raised by the trademarks registry under section 9(1)(a) of the trade marks act, 1999, the respondents had replied by saying that there is no conflicting mark to the said trademark and the objection be waived. it is not the case of the respondent that at the time of registration, the shape adopted by them has lost its inherent or generic meaning but had acquired distinctiveness because of its long user. 36.11 the reliance placed by the respondents on the judgment by the bombay high court in the case of lupin v. johnson and johnson: 2015(61) ptc1 (bom), is also misplaced. the bombay high court in the facts of the said case, had held that at the interlocutory stage, the court was not required to call upon the plaintiff to prove that the registration of its trade mark was not invalid. it was, however, held that the jurisdiction of civil court is not completely barred. the court is not embarking upon the inquiry whether the registration granted is illegal or fraudulent, but, in the present case, is examining whether on the material as produced, ex facie, entitles the plaintiff for an order of injunction. even though the same requires a high threshold, however, the court can, prima facie, consider the question of the validity for the limited purpose of arriving at a prima facie conclusion, whether the injunction ought to be granted on the basis of the registered trade mark. there is no cavil as far as the ratio of the judgment relied upon by the respondent in that respect. 36.12 the appellants have produced enough material which, prima facie, shows that it is not only the parties in the present case, but many other manufacturers who have been manufacturing and marketing the lollipops in the shape of a flower and more particularly of a rose. the material produced by the appellants include the queries raised with the manufacturers abroad much prior to the claim made by the respondents of having adopted the said shape and also copy of the invoices evidencing the sale of rose shaped lollipop. in addition, the appellants have material produced material downloaded from the internet which is not denied by the respondent. the same shows the extensive use of shape of a 'rose' in respect of a lollipop and other confectionary items. the material produced cannot be discarded, at this stage, specifically in the absence of any denial. 36.13 it is correct, that any objection in regard to the registration obtained by the respondent would be looked into by the trademark registry, however, the same can be, prima facie, looked into for the purpose of considering whether an interim injunction is required to be issued on the basis of the registration. 36.14 from the bare perusal of the material produced, it is observed that the shape of a flower and also of a 'rose' in confectionary items is generic in nature, which is extensively used by many manufacturers dealing in similar type of products. 36.15 the hon'ble apex court, in the case of skyline education institute (india) pvt. ltd. v. s.l. vaswani & anr. : (2010) 2 scc 142, in relation to the use of trademark 'skyline' in respect of an institute had held as under: \"26. in our opinion, the findings recorded by the learned single judge and the division bench on the crucial factors like prima facie case, balance of convenience and equity are based on a correct and balanced consideration of various facets of the case and it is not possible to find any fault with the conclusions recorded by them that it is not a fit case for restraining the respondents from using the word \"skyline\" in the name of the institute established by them. it has not been disputed on behalf of the appellant that the word \"skyline\" is being used as trade name by various companies/organisations/business concerns and also for describing different types of institutes/institutions. the voluminous record produced by the respondents before this court shows that in india as many as 117 companies including computer and software companies and institutions are operating by using the word \"skyline\" as part of their name/nomenclature. in the united states of america, at least 10 educational/training institutions are operating with different names using \"skyline\" as the first word. in the united kingdom also two such institutions are operating. in view of this, it is not possible to agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that skyline is not a generic word but is a specific word and his client has right to use that word to the exclusion of others.\" 36.16 the hon'ble apex court had recognised that the mark is being used by many companies in india and abroad and the plaintiff in that case was not allowed to monopolise the mark, which was used in a generic manner by many other entities. 36.17 the other aspect, which cannot be lost sight of, is that the shapes of the products being used by both the parties are not identical. whether the same can be termed as similar only because both are in shape of a 'rose', in the present case, is doubtful. 36.18 the shape being used by the respondent no.1 is altogether different from the shape being used by the appellants in their product. the stem being used by the appellants is longer and does not have any leaf whereas the respondents' product has a short stem with leaves. the shape of flower is also different. it is not apposite to compare the shape of the competing marks by juxtaposing them side by side. the court has to ascertain on a prima facie basis whether the overall commend impression of the competing marks/ products is the same from the standpoint of a person of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. 36.19 prima facie, appellant's product is not similar to respondent no.1's trademark on the anvil of the aforesaid standard. it is relevant to note that the shape registered in favour of the appellant is a distinct three-dimensional shape. the perusal of the shape makes it clear that the same can be termed as similar only if we call all flowers to be similar in shape. the registration in favour of respondent no.1 is of a particular shape of a rose and not of flowers in general. 36.20 the party having registration in one mark / shape cannot be allowed to monopolise each and every variant of the said shape only because both happened to be flowers. if that argument is accepted then the respondents would be entitled to seek injunction against every manufacturer who wants to manufacture a confectionary in a shape of a flower. 36.21 a party, who takes a risk of getting a registration of a generic word or a shape, runs a risk of the same being used by others. 36.22 at the same time, it is not in doubt that even a generic or a commonly used word / shape / mark is entitled for protection if the same has acquired distinctiveness because of the long usage. in the case of ferrero spa and ors. v. mr. kishor j. salvani and ors.(supra), the court had restrained the defendant from manufacturing / marketing / selling the confectionary in the shape of an egg. the plaintiff was able to prima facie establish that because of the long usage over the decades, the shape had acquired a secondary meaning and is identified with the plaintiff's product. 36.23 the reliance placed by the learned counsel for the respondent in the case of ferrero spa and ors. v. mr. kishor j. salvani and ors. (supra), in respect of its case is misplaced. the plaintiff, in the said case, had sought injunction against the defendants from using the deceptively similar shape, that is, egg shaped chocolates, of the product. it was held that the plaintiff's product 'egg shaped chocolate' is a well-known product in the shape having acquired distinctiveness because of its long use over the decades. 36.24 in the case of ferrero spa and ors. v. vijendra kumar jain and anr.: cs(comm) 572/2016 dated 18.05.2016; ferrero spa and ors. v. sunil gureja and ors.: cs(os) 2727/2012 dated 07.09.2012; and ferrero spa and ors. v. kamco chew food private limited and ors.: cs(comm) 179/2019 dated 18.12.2019, the learned single judge of this court had granted injunction in favor of the plaintiff(s) noting that the user of the product of a particular shape over the decades has acquired goodwill and reputation all over the world and has acquired a status of a well-known trade mark. 36.25 the reliance placed on the judgment passed by the district court of united states, california in morroccanoil, inc. v. mare anthony cosmetic, inc.: 57 f. supp. 3d 1203 (c.d. cal. 2014); and the judgment passed by the court of session in scotland in boord & son v. thom and cameron ld.thom and cameron ld. v. boord & son.: (1907) 24 rpc 697, are also misplaced. in the case of morroccanoil, inc. v. mare anthony cosmetic, inc. (supra), the court had held that the determination that a trade mark has become generic requires persuasive and clear evidence that the same has become generic amongst the majority of the buyer group. in the case of boord & son v. thom and cameron ld.thom and cameron ld. v. boord & son. (supra), the court had held that the use of the mark by third party outside a common market place was not relevant. 36.26 the reliance on the judgment passed by the hon'ble apex court in corn products refining co. v. shangrila food products ltd. :air 1960 sc 142, is also misplaced. the hon'ble apex court, in the said case, had held that the party taking the defense of 'common to trade' has to show that the mark is in extensive use in the market. the matter had reached the hon'ble supreme court after the trial. the hon'ble court noted that the respondent had led no evidence as to the user of the mark being common. it was also noted that the presence of the mark in the register does not prove its user at all. 36.27 in the present case, in our opinion, the respondents have not been able to show the usage of such nature which would make the mark/ shape as distinctive and having acquired a secondary meaning. on the other hand, there is enough material that has been produced by the appellants which, prima facie, shows that the product / lollipop is being manufactured / sold in a shape of a 'rose' / flower from prior in time by many manufacturers. 36.28 with the advancement of technology and the products being offered for sale from all over the world, one cannot be oblivious of market trends and practices in the global market place. the advent of e-commerce platform cannot be ignored. in the present case, the appellant has produced not only the screen shots from internet search engine result pages but also material to show that rose shaped lollipops were sold in india. there are videos available on the internet showing the recipes for making rose shaped lollipops and confectionary. in face of this overwhelming material, the respondents were required to cross a very high threshold to succeed in their case that use of rose shapes for lollipops is infringing one. 36.29 the judgment passed by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of hewlett packard india sales private limited v. commissioner of customs (import), nhava sheva and lenovo (india) private limited v. commissioner of customs (import), nhava sheva : (2023) 7 scc 799, is also of no aid to the respondent. in the said case, the adjudicating authority of the customs department had relied upon the online sources such as wikipedia, to reach a conclusion that the goods produced by hewlett packard and lenovo were portable in nature and classified under \"tariff item 8471 30 10\". the hon'ble supreme court in said circumstances had held that the adjudicating authority was wrong in relying upon such material. the court held that the material may have been downloaded from treasure trove of knowledge but the same is based on crowd-sourced and user-generated editing model that cannot be completely depended upon. 36.30 in the present case, the material relied upon by the appellant consist of results yielded by google search and the data taken out from youtube.com. the same is not denied by the respondent. in the absence of any denial, the same, in our opinion, can be looked into by the court to reach a prima facie conclusion. 36.31 the reliance on the judgment pankaj goel v. dabur india ltd: 2008:dhc:1941-db, is also not helpful to the respondents. this court, in the facts of that case, had held that delay being a defence, would not be available if the defendant's conduct is fraudulent. the court, in that case, had found that the adoption of similar marks was dishonest. 36.32 it was also held that the defendant has not been able to show that the word 'mola' is common to trade and that the plaintiff was not expected to sue for minor infringement, that may not be affecting the plaintiff. 36.33 in the instant case, the appellants have shown that they had been raising queries and has, in fact, bought confectionary / lollipop in the shape of a 'rose' from manufacturer(s) outside india. and, that trade queries were being raised prior in time than the adoption of the mark by the respondent no.1. prima facie the use of the mark by the appellants cannot be, construed as fraudulent. 36.34 the reliance of the respondents on the case of godfrey philips india ltd. v. girnar food and beverages pvt. ltd: (2004) 5 scc 257, is also not material. the hon'ble apex court, in the said case, had observed that the descriptive marks are also entitled for protection if they acquire a secondary meaning and identity a particular product with a particular source. 36.35 in the present case, the respondents have not been able to, prima facie, show that the lollipop / confectionary in the shape of a 'rose' has acquired a secondary meaning, and that the shape is identified with respondent no.1. 36.36 the appellants, on the other hand, have been able to, prima facie, show that the product, that is, lollipop is being manufactured by many manufacturers all over the world. 36.37 the respondents also relied upon national bell co. and gupta industrial corporation v. metal goods mfd. co. (p) ltd. and ors.: air 1971 sc 898, to contend that when a person gets his trademark registered, he acquires a valuable right and he is entitled to protect his mark by an action of infringement in case of use of an identical or deceptively similar trademark. 37. in the present case, as discussed above, the marks of the respondent no.1 cannot be held to be identical or deceptively similar to the marks being used by the appellants. the only similarity is that both shapes are that of a flower. the same, however, cannot be termed as deceptive in the facts of the present case. 37.1 considering the fact that the shape of the 'rose' / flower being used by the appellant is not similar to the shape of a 'rose'/ flower being used by the respondent, the learned commercial court, in our opinion fell in error in restraining the appellants/ defendants from manufacturing / marketing / selling their product in shape being used by them. 37.2 considering the aforesaid and the fact that there are many manufacturers and sellers which have been making and selling the lollipops in the shape of a flower or a rose albeit in different variations, the likelihood of confusion at least prima facie cannot arise. 37.3 the appellants'/defendants' also, by the material produced, along with the written statement has been able to, prima facie, show that the adoption of the mark is bona fide. the queries being raised by the appellants from the manufacturers in hong kong, prior in time than the adoption of the shape by the respondent no.1 is a plausible explanation of the adoption of the shape/ mark. 38. whether the mark 'unicon sweet rose' is deceptively similar to the mark 'madhur rose pop lollipop' 38.1 the learned commercial court has also passed an injunction against the appellant from using the mark / label 'sweet rose lollipop'. the same has been held to be deceptively similar to the respondent's trademark 'madhur rose pop lollipops'. 38.2 in reaching the prima facie conclusion, the learned commercial court, in our opinion, has failed to give any reasons. the learned court specifically held that the mark 'rose' is common and cannot be monopolised, however, failed to give any reason how it felt that the two marks are deceptively similar. 38.3 it is a settled law that the mark has to be seen as a whole. the commonality in both marks are the words 'rose' and 'lollipop'. in fact, the mark used by the appellants contains four words, the first being 'unicon', which is the house name of the appellant and admittedly the respondent has no objection for its use. the second word is 'sweet', which only describe the quality of the product being sweet. the same is descriptive and, in any case, is not used in the mark of the respondent. the third word is 'rose', the use of which, even as per the learned commercial court, cannot be monopolised. the fourth word is a 'lollipop', which only describes the product being a confectionary item commonly known as lollipop. 38.4 therefore, the common words in the competing marks are 'rose' and 'lollipop', which by no stretch of imagination, can be monopolised by anyone. the mark has to be seen as a whole and, in our opinion, cannot be termed to be deceptively similar. 38.5 we are unable to concur that the marks are deceptively similar. both marks, on the first impression, appears to be descriptive of the product containing the house name of the parties. 39. whether the packaging used by the respondent no.1 is deceptively similar to the packaging used by the respondent 39.1 the learned commercial court has held both packaging to be similar and held that the packaging and other features show that the appellants have copied many features of the respondent no.1's packaging. in our opinion, the learned commercial court failed to give any reason or to mention as to how packaging of the parties, are held to be prima facie similar to each other. 39.2 the similarity as claimed by the respondents is that the packs for display of the product being made by the appellants, also contain the photograph of a 'rose' and mentioning of the word 'rose' in the packaging. it was also alleged that the top half of the packs being, transparent displaying the lollipops, is unique to the respondent no.1's packaging. 39.3 as mentioned above, the learned commercial court itself held that no one can be allowed to monopolise the use of the word 'rose'. therefore, the same, in our opinion, will not entitle the respondents for an order of injunction. the colour scheme and the placement of words in both the packages are also different. the colour scheme being different where the appellant has used yellow colour as dominant colour of the packaging, whereas the respondent has used blue as a dominant colour in its packaging. 39.4 the arrangement of features even though if looked into on an individual basis, may appear similar but their arrangement in the packaging, are not similar so as to project a similar overall appearance of the competing packaging. 39.5 the transparent top half of the packaging for display of the product also, prima facie, appears to be commonly used by various entities for the purpose of displaying their product. the appellants have produced enough material to show that the similar kind of packaging is used by many manufacturers for selling their confectionary items. the main purpose being, to display the items for the purpose of being seen by the consumer. 40. there is another aspect, which cannot be ignored while considering the competing marks, that is, the words 'rose', 'sweet' and 'lollipop', are essentially descriptive and indicate the kind, quality, or other characteristics of the product. section 30(2)(a) of the trade marks act, 1999, categorically provides that a trademark is not infringed where the same is used in relation to goods or services indicating the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, etc of such goods or services. 41. it is well settled that an appellate court would normally not interfere with a, prima facie, view of the trial court unless it finds that the trial court has exercised the jurisdiction arbitrarily, capriciously or in ignorance of the settled principle of law. in this case, we find that the learned commercial court has erred in finding that the competing marks are similar only on the basis that shape of both the products is that of a rose flower. the learned court failed to give any reason for holding albeit prima facie that the mark / label 'sweet rose lollipop' is deceptively similar to the mark 'madhur rose pop lollipop' despite holding that no one can monopolise the word 'rose'. 42. in view of the above, we are of the opinion that the learned commercial court was not correct in holding that the shape of the appellants' product being is identical to the shape of respondents' product being ; the mark 'sweet rose lollipop' is deceptively similar to the trademark 'madhur rose pop lollipops'; the packaging is deceptively similar to packaging . 43. in view of the above, the impugned judgment is set aside. 44. we make it clear that the observations made in the present order are only, prima facie, for the purpose of interim relief granted under section 39 (1) & (2) of the cpc. amit mahajan, j vibhu bakhru, j december 14, 2023 \"sk\" / kdk/ \"ss\"/hk"
