This appeal is directed against the order dated 17.02.2016 passed by a learned single Judge of this court in Ia No.4311/2016 in Omp 294/2014. Ia No.4311/2016 was an applicatio n under Section 5 of the Limitation Act filed on behalf of the respondent for condonation of delay of 55 days in re- filing. The said application was allowed by the learned single Judge by virtue of the impugned order dated 17.02.2016. OMP 294/2014 is a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the A&C Act) for setting aside the arbitral award dated 10.09.2013. \n2. The plea of the appellant before this court is that the learned single Judge ought not to have condoned the delay of 55 days in re-filing the said petition under Section 34 of the A&C Act. \n3. The learned counsel for the respondent herein raised a preliminary objection with regard to the maintainability of the present appeal. It was contended on behalf of the respondent that an appeal under Section 37 of the A&C Act could be filed only against the orders specified in Section 37(1)(a), (b) or (c). It was pointed out that the impugned order does not fall within the orders specified in Section 37(1) of the A&C Act. The learned counsel emphasised that Section 37(1) of that Act uses the expression \"(and from no others)\" which clearly indicates that only those orders mentioned in Section 37(1) would be appealable and no others. \n4. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appeal is maintainable and for this submission, he placed reliance on Sections 8 and 13 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of the High Courts Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the Commercial Courts Act). He also placed reliance on a Full Bench decision of this court in the case of National Highways Authority of India v. Oriental Structure Engineers Limited-Gammon India Limited (JV): 2012 (132) DRJ 769 (FB). The learned counsel for the appellant referred to Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act to submit that no civil revision application or petition could be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court. But, this was subject to the provisions of Section 13 of that Act. He submitted that Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act deals with the appeals and Section 13(1) specifically refers to appeals from judgments or orders. Thus, according to him, any person aggrieved by a decision of the Commercial Division of a High Court could appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of 60 days from the date of judgment or \"order\", as is the case herein. It was further submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that the Full Bench decision in the case of National Highways Authority (supra) made it clear that an aggrieved party could maintain more than one appeal, that is, one at the initial stage and the other at the final stage when the petition under Section 34 of the A&C Act is finally disposed of. It was submitted in this context that the appellant was entitled to file an appeal against the impugned order inasmuch as the learned single Judge had allowed the condonation of delay application and, as a result, he had taken the Section 34 petition under the A&C Act on board when it ought to have been rejected on the ground of limitation. It was contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that an appeal against this order would lie at this stage itself as also at the stage of disposal of the said OMP No.294/2014 by the aggrieved party. It was contended that the learned single Judge could not have condoned the delay in re-filing. Had that been the case, the petition under Section 34 of the A&C Act would not itself be entertained and for this reason, the appellants rights have been affected and, therefore, the present appeal is clearly maintainable. \n5. Section 37 of the A&C Act has been amended by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (act 3 of 2016) with retrospective effect from 23.10.2015. Clauses (a) and (b) of the earlier Section 37(1) were re-numbered as clauses (b) and (c), respectively and new clause (a) was inserted. Section 37 of the A&C Act, post amendment, reads as under:-\n\"37. Appealable orders. - (1) An appeal shall lie from the following orders (and from no others) to the Court authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the order, namely:-\n(a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8;\n(b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9;\n(c) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34.\n( 2 ) An appeal shall also lie to a Court from an order granting of the arbitral tribunal.-\n(a) accepting the plea referred in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of section 16; or (b) granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under Section 17. \n(3) No second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or take away any right to appeal to the Supreme Court.\" \n6. Sections 8 and 13 of the Commercial Courts Act read as under:-\n\"8. Bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order.-Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the Commercial Court.\nxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx 13 . Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions.-(1) Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Commercial Court or Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order, as the case may be:\nProvided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996). \n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\"\n7. First of all, we may point out that Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act, which was sought to be relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant, has no application in the present case. This is so because it relates to an interlocutory order of a commercial court. A commercial court by definition as per Section 2(1)(b) read with Section 3(1) is a court at the district level. The impugned order is an order passed not by a Commercial Court but by a learned single Judge within the Commercial Division of this High Court. Therefore, clearly, Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act has no application. \n8. Insofar as Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act is concerned, while it is true that it speaks of appeals from a judgment or order, the proviso to Section 13(1) makes it clear that the appeal would lie from such orders passed by, inter alia, a Commercial Division that are specifically enumerated under Order 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act) and Section 37 of the A&C Act. The use of the word and in the proviso to Section 13(1) is only to specify that an appeal would lie against any order passed by, inter alia, a Commercial Division, which finds mention in the list of orders specified in Order 43, CPC and Section 37 of the A&C Act. It is an admitted position that the impugned order having been passed in proceedings arising out of an arbitral award would have to be governed by Section 37 of the A&C Act. \n9. On a plain reading of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, it is evident that it does not amplify the scope of appealable orders specified in Section 37 of the A&C Act. It actually reiterates that, in a matter of arbitration, an appeal shall lie only from the orders specified in Section 37 of the A&C Act. In fact, Section 13(2) reinforces this by providing that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or the Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. \n10. Coming to Section 37(1), it is evident that an appeal can lie from only the orders specified in clauses (a), (b) or (c). In other words, an appeal under Section 37 would only be maintainable against (a) an order refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under Section 8 of the A&C Act; (b) an order granting or refusing to grant any measure under Section 9 of the A&C Act; or (c) an order setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section 34 of the A&C Act. The impugned order is clearly not relatable to Sections 8 or 9 of the A&C Act. It was sought to be contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that the present appeal would fall within Section 37(1)(c) which relates to an order \"setting aside\" or \"refusing to set aside\" an arbitral award under Section 34. We are unable to accept this proposition. By virtue of the impugned order, the arbitral award dated 10.09.2013 has not been set aside. Nor has the court, at this stage, refused to set aside the said arbitral award under Section 34 of the A&C Act. In fact, the appellant in whose favour the award has been made, would only be aggrieved if the award were to have been set aside in whole or in part. That has not happened. What the learned single Judge has done is to have condoned the delay in re-filing of the petition under Section 34. This has not, in any way, impacted the award. \n11. The learned counsel for the appellant had placed strong reliance on the decision of the Full Bench in National Highways Authority (supra). However, that decision would not, in any manner, come to the aid of the appellant. The issue before the Full Bench was confined to an enquiry as to whether, in law, there was any impediment in the court issuing limited notice in a petition under Section 34 of the A&C Act. The concept of limited notice would, inter alia, entail a situation where an arbitral tribunal having awarded claims 1 to 4, a petition in respect thereof is filed by the losing party under Section 34 and the court hearing the petition issues notice only in respect of claims 3 and 4 and not in respect of claim numbers 1 and 2. In such an eventuality, for all intents and purposes, the limited notice would impact the arbitral award in respect of the claims 1 and 2 and, therefore, the aggrieved party would be entitled to file an appeal at that stage itself under Section 37 of the A&C Act. This is so because for all intents and purposes, the limited notice would entail the refusal on the part of the court to set aside the arbitral award insofar as claims 1 and 2 were concerned. This is exactly what the Full Bench in National Highways Authority (supra) held. Paragraph 18 of the said decision sets out the conclusions and they are as under:-\n\"18. Having regard to our discussion above, our conclusions are as follows:\n(i) There is no limitation in the court issuing a limited notice at the stage of admission of a petition under Section 34 of the 1996 Act provided the grounds which are raised and argued are rejected by a reasoned order. \n(ii) There is complete autonomy conferred under the 1996 Act on the party aggrieved, to prefer an appeal under Section 37 against grounds which the court rejects either at that stage or at the stage when the petition under Section 34 is finally disposed of. \n(iii) In view of our conclusion arrived at, as indicated in sub- clause (ii) above, what would necessarily follow is that the aggrieved party can maintain more than one appeal. \n(iv) A fresh cause of action would arise at both stages, i.e., at the initial stage and at the final stage when the petition under Section 34 of the 1996 Act is finally disposed of as at each stage the award would get impacted. \n(v) If an application is filed in the executing court, pursuant to rejection of some grounds, in Section 34 proceeding, the executing court would have to discern as to whether that part of the order of the court pertains to those claims which can be sustained on a stand-alone basis. If the executing court comes to such an conclusion, undoubtedly, the execution proceedings can proceed against that part of the order subject, however, to intercession by an appellate court.\"\n12. From the above discussion, it is evident that the said decision in National Highways Authority (supra) does not, in any way, advance the case of the appellant herein. The order, which is impugned herein, does not have the effect of setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award. Clearly, the said Full Bench decision does not help the appellant. \n13. In sum, the impugned order does not fall within the category of appealable orders specified in Section 37(1) of the A&C Act. Therefore, even if the provisions of Section 37(1) are read with Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, the present appeal is not maintainable. This, however, does not mean that the appellant cannot take up the ground that is sought to be urged before us if the decision in OMP 294/2014 (under Section 34 of the A&C Act) goes against him. In other words, if the arbitral award is set aside in part or in whole and the appellant is aggrieved thereby, he may prefer an appeal under Section 37 of the A&C Act on merits as also on the ground that the delay in re-filing ought not to have been condoned. This is in line with the scheme of the A&C Act of not, in any way, stalling the proceedings thereunder. For example, under Section 13(4) of the A&C Act, if a challenge to an arbitrator is not successful, the arbitral tribunal is required to continue the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award and, in such an instance, as provided in Section 13(5) of the A&C Act, the party challenging the arbitrator may make an application for setting aside such an arbitral award in accordance with Section 34. In other words, recourse to a remedy for an unsuccessful challenge to an arbitrator is deferred till the stage of the making of the award. Similarly, under Section 16, an arbitral tribunal may rule on its jurisdiction. In a case where the arbitral tribunal rejects a plea with regard to its jurisdiction, it is enjoined by Section 16(5) of the A&C Act to continue with the arbitral proceedings and to make the arbitral award. Section 16(6) stipulates that a party aggrieved by such an arbitral award may make an application for setting aside the award in accordance with Section 34. Here, too, the unsuccessful party, who challenges the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal, is asked to wait till the award is made. The remedy of questioning the decision of the arbitral tribunal with regard to the arbitrators jurisdiction in such a case is not extinguished but is merely deferred till the making of the arbitral award. In similar vein, in the present case, the remedy of challenging the decision of condoning the delay in re-filing is not extinguished but is deferred till the final decision of the court on the pending Section 34 petition. \n14. In view of the discussion above, the present appeal is not maintainable and is dismissed. \n                                        BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J September 30, 2016                                ASHUTOSH KUMAR, J dutt  ",

(1) every suit or other civil proceeding arising under this chapter in respect of the infringement of copyright in any work or the infringement of any other right conferred by this act shall be instituted in the district court having jurisdiction. (2) for the purpose of sub-section (1), a \"district court having jurisdiction\" shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), or any other law for the time being in force, include a district court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, at the time of the institution of the suit or other proceeding, the person instituting the suit or other proceeding or, where there are more than one such persons, any of them actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain. 6. jurisdiction of commercial court. the commercial court shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value arising out of the entire territory of the state over which it has been vested territorial jurisdiction. explanation. for the purposes of this section, a commercial dispute shall be considered to arise out of the entire territory of the state over which a commercial court has been vested jurisdiction, if the suit or application relating to such commercial dispute has been instituted as per the provisions of sections 16 to 20 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908). 20. other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action arises. subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction (a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the leave of the court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution; or (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises. 227 (2016) dlt 320 (db) 9. mr. prasanna, learned counsel for the petitioner does not dispute the applicability, to the present case, of the decision in ultra home construction4. his contention is, however, that the decision in ultra home construction4 is per incuriam, as it is contrary to the explanation to section 6 of the commercial courts act, 2015, which it does not notice, and which, he submits, has necessarily to be accorded strict interpretation, as per a catena of authorities on the point. he has also placed reliance on the judgment of the supreme court in solidaire india ltd. v. fairgrowth financial services ltd.5 10. having heard mr. prasanna, i regret my inability to agree with his contention. 11. the division bench of this court has, in ultra home construction4, clearly held, following the judgment of the supreme court in indian performing rights society ltd. v. sanjay dalia 6, that section 62 of the copyright act provides an additional forum for institution of a suit alleging infringement of copyright, over and above the forum which, by operation of section 20 of the cpc, would have jurisdiction in the matter. the relevant passages from ultra home construction4 may be reproduced thus: \"13. by virtue of the supreme court decision in sanjay dalia6 (supra) this deeming provision contained in the explanation in section 20 of the code has been read into section 134(2) of the trade marks act, 1999 and section 62(2) of the copyright act, 1957 for the purposes of isolating the place where the plaintiff can be said to carry on business. it will be noted that though the expression \"carries on business\" is used in all the three provisions (i.e., section 20 of the code, 2001 3 scc 71 (2015) 10 scc 161 section 134(2) of the trade marks act, 1999 and section 62(2) of the copyright act, 1957), the deeming provision contained in the explanation in section 20 of the code has not been expressly incorporated in the other two provisions. but, the supreme court has, in the said decision, given the expression \"carries on business\" used in relation to a corporation in the context of a defendant in section 20 of the code the same meaning when it is used in relation to a plaintiff under the said sections 134(2) and 62(2). it would be instructive to note the following observations of the supreme court in the said decision: \"14. considering the very language of section 62 of the copyright act and section 134 of the trade marks act, an additional forum has been provided by including a district court within whose limits the plaintiff actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain. the object of the provisions was to enable the plaintiff to institute a suit at a place where he or they resided or carried on business, not to enable them to drag the defendant further away from such a place also as is being done in the instant cases. in our opinion, the expression \"notwithstanding anything contained in the code of civil procedure\" does not oust the applicability of the provisions of section 20 of the code of civil procedure and it is clear that additional remedy has been provided to the plaintiff so as to file a suit where he is residing or carrying on business, etc. as the case may be. section 20 of the code of civil procedure enables a plaintiff to file a suit where the defendant resides or where cause of action arose. section 20(a) and section 20(b) usually provides the venue where the defendant or any of them resides, carries on business or personally works for gain. section 20(c) of the code of civil procedure enables a plaintiff to institute a suit where the cause of action wholly or in part, arises. the explanation to section 20 cpc has been added to the effect that corporation shall be deemed to carry on business at its sole or principal office in india or in respect of any cause of action arising at any place where it has subordinate office at such place. thus, \"corporation\" can be sued at a place having its sole or principal office and where cause of action wholly or in part, arises at a place where it has also a subordinate office at such place. 15. the learned author mulla in code of civil procedure, 18th edn., has observed that under clauses (a) to (c) of section 20, the plaintiff has a choice of forum to institute a suit. the intendment of the explanation to section 20 of the code of civil procedure is that once the corporation has a subordinate office in the place where the cause of action arises wholly or in part, it cannot be heard to say that it cannot be sued there because it did not carry on business at that place. the linking of the place with the cause of action in the explanation where subordinate office of the corporation is situated is reflective of the intention of the legislature and such a place has to be the place of the filing of the suit and not the principal place of business. ordinarily the suit has to be filed at the place where there is principal place of business of the corporation.\" ***** \"18. on a due and anxious consideration of the provisions contained in section 20 cpc, section 62 of the copyright act and section 134 of the trade marks act, and the object with which the latter provisions have been enacted, it is clear that if a cause of action has arisen wholly or in part, where the plaintiff is residing or having its principal office/carries on business or personally works for gain, the suit can be filed at such place(s). the plaintiff(s) can also institute a suit at a place where he is residing, carrying on business or personally works for gain dehors the fact that the cause of action has not arisen at a place where he/they are residing or any one of them is residing, carries on business or personally works for gain. however, this right to institute suit at such a place has to be read subject to certain restrictions, such as in case the plaintiff is residing or carrying on business at a particular place/having its head office and at such place cause of action has also arisen wholly or in part, the plaintiff cannot ignore such a place under the guise that he is carrying on business at other far-flung places also. the very intendment of the insertion of provision in the copyright act and the trade marks act is the convenience of the plaintiff. the rule of convenience of the parties has been given a statutory expression in section 20 cpc as well. the interpretation of provisions has to be such which prevents the mischief of causing inconvenience to the parties. 19. the intendment of the aforesaid provisions inserted in the copyright act and the trade marks act is to provide a forum to the plaintiff where he is residing, carrying on business or personally works for gain. the object is to ensure that the plaintiff is not deterred from instituting infringement proceedings \"because the court in which proceedings are to be instituted is at a considerable distance from the place of their ordinary residence\". the impediment created to the plaintiff by section 20 cpc of going to a place where it was not having ordinary residence or principal place of business was sought to be removed by virtue of the aforesaid provisions of the copyright act and the trade marks act. where the corporation is having ordinary residence/principal place of business and cause of action has also arisen at that place, it has to institute a suit at the said place and not at other places. the provisions of section 62 of the copyright act and section 134 of the trade marks act never intended to operate in the field where the plaintiff is having its principal place of business at a particular place and the cause of action has also arisen at that place so as to enable it to file a suit at a distant place where its subordinate office is situated though at such place no cause of action has arisen. such interpretation would cause great harm and would be juxtaposed to the very legislative intendment of the provisions so enacted. 20. in our opinion, in a case where the cause of action has arisen at a place where the plaintiff is residing or where there are more than one such persons, any of them actually or voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain would oust the jurisdiction of other place where the cause of action has not arisen though at such a place, by virtue of having subordinate office, the plaintiff instituting a suit or other proceedings might be carrying on business or personally works for gain. 21. at the same time, the provisions of section 62 of the copyright act and section 134 of the trade marks act have removed the embargo of suing at place of accrual of cause of action wholly or in part, with regard to a place where the plaintiff or any of them ordinarily resides, carries on business or personally works for gain. we agree to the aforesaid extent that the impediment imposed under section 20 cpc to a plaintiff to institute a suit in a court where the defendant resides or carries on business or where the cause of action wholly or in part arises, has been removed. but the right is subject to the rider in case the plaintiff resides or has its principal place of business/carries on business or personally works for gain at a place where cause of action has also arisen, suit should be filed at that place not at other places where the plaintiff is having branch offices, etc. 22. there is no doubt about it that the words used in section 62 of the copyright act and section 134 of the trade marks act, \"notwithstanding anything contained in cpc or any other law for the time being in force\", emphasise that the requirement of section 20 cpc would not have to be complied with by the plaintiff if he resides or carries on business in the local limits of the court where he has filed the suit but, in our view, at the same time, as the provision providing for an additional forum, cannot be interpreted in the manner that it has authorised the plaintiff to institute a suit at a different place other than the place where he is ordinarily residing or having principal office and incidentally where the cause of action wholly or in part has also arisen. the impugned judgments, in our considered view, do not take away the additional forum and fundamental basis of conferring the right and advantage to the authors of the copyright act and the trade marks act provided under the aforesaid provisions.\" ***** 52. in our opinion, the provisions of section 62 of the copyright act and section 134 of the trade marks act have to be interpreted in the purposive manner. no doubt about it that a suit can be filed by the plaintiff at a place where he is residing or carrying on business or personally works for gain. he need not travel to file a suit to a place where the defendant is residing or cause of action wholly or in part arises. however, if the plaintiff is residing or carrying on business, etc. at a place where the cause of action, wholly or in part, has also arisen, he has to file a suit at that place, as discussed above.\" 12. it is perfectly clear, therefore, both from indian performing rights society6 as well as from ultra home construction4, that the non obstante clause, with which section 62 of the copyright act commences, enables a plaintiff to institute a suit where she, or he, resides or works for gain, and is in addition to the venue for institution of the suit as envisaged by section 20 of the cpc. the only caveat, to this right, is that, if the plaintiff has his principle place of work at one place, where the cause of action has also arisen, the suit would have to be instituted there, and not at some other distant place where the plaintiff may also have a subordinate office. this caveat has no application in the present case, on facts. 13. the decision in indian performing rights society6, as followed in ultra home construction4, therefore, defeats, in its entirety, the argument of mr prasanna. mr prasanna's contention that these decisions have been rendered without considering section 6 of the commercial courts act is plainly unacceptable, as the explanation to section 6 incorporates, by reference, sections 16 to 20 of the cpc, which have been considered in both these decisions. 14. besides, the interpretation placed by mr. prasanna on the explanation to section 6 of the commercial courts act ignores the fact that the explanation is precisely that, i.e. an explanation to the main provision. section 6 is an enabling provision, and not one which ousts jurisdiction vested, by any other provision, in any court. it contains no obstante clause, unlike section 62 of the section 6, which does. in fact, the submission of mr. prasanna that section 6 of the commercial courts act would prevail over section 62 of the copyright act is, besides being contrary to the law enunciated in indian performing rights society6 and ultra home construction4, in the teeth of section 62(2) of the copyright act, which accords pre-eminence, via the non obstante clause, to section 62 over the cpc. 15. by no stretch of imagination can section 6 of the commercial courts act be treated, therefore, as a provision which excludes the applicability of section 62 of the copyright act. section 6 of the commercial courts act, read with section 16 to 20 of the cpc, operate in their own distinct sphere. that sphere, has held by the supreme court in indian performing rights society6 and by the division bench of this court in ultra home construction4, is distinct and different from the sphere in which 62 of the copyright act operates. both the decisions clarify that a plaintiff seeking to institute a suit for infringement of copyright can institute a suit within the court having jurisdiction either under section 62 of the copyright act or under section 16 to 20 of the cpc. 16. the plea, of mr prasanna, that ultra home construction4 is per incuriam is, therefore, completely bereft of merit. 17. adverting, now, the judgment of the supreme court in solidaire5, it is seen that the dispute in that case is completely distinct, in contour and complexion, to the dispute which arises in the present case. in that case, the court was concerned with a situation in which there were two statutes conferring jurisdiction over the same cause of action or two different courts, in which each was found to be a special statute. significantly, there is a significant finding, in the said decision, that the two statutes, namely the special court (trial of offences relating to transactions and securities) act, 1992 and the sick industrial companies (special provisions) act, 1985 were in conflict with each other on the aspect of territorial jurisdiction. it was in these circumstances that the supreme court held that the later statute would prevail. 18. in view of the ruling of the division bench of this court in ultra home construction4, there is, clearly, no conflict between section 62 of the copyright act and sections 16 to 20 of the cpc. they are supplementary to each other, and neither provision ousts the other. the decision in solidaire5 cannot, therefore, assist mr prasanna. 19. mr. prasanna has candidly acknowledged that, but for his contention that the decision in ultra home construction4 is violative of section 6 of the commercial courts act, the case is otherwise covered by the decision in ultra home construction4. 20. in view of the aforesaid, the learned commercial court cannot be said to have erred in fact or in law or on the aspect of jurisdiction in holding as it did. 21. the impugned order, therefore, does not make out a case for interference within the limited jurisdiction vested in this court by article 227 of the constitution of india. 22. the petition is accordingly dismissed in limine. 23. as prayed by mr. prasanna, the petitioner is granted a further period of 2 weeks to deposit the costs as directed by the learned commercial court. c.hari shankar, j july 12, 2023 ar"
