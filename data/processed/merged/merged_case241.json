The   facts   leading   to   the   present   Special   Civil  Applications in nutshell are as under: \n3.1. That the petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the \"DPT)  is a body corporate   constituted   under   the   provisions   of   the  Major   Port   Trusts   Act,   1963.   That   the   respondent   was  Special   Purpose   Vehicle   incorporated   by   M/s   IMC   Ltd.   as  per   the   conditions   of   tender,   for   the   purposes   of   the  project   and   implementation   of   works   provided   in   the  Concession Agreement 18.02.2011.\n3.2. That   the   DPT   is   engaged   in   the   development   of  Kandla   Port   and   Port   related   facilities   at   Kandla,   Gujarat. \nThat in order to cater to future dry cargo  traffic, DPT had  decided   to   undertake   development   of   4   Multipurpose  Cargo   Berths   with   Private   Sector   Participation   on   Build,  Operate   and   Transfer   framework.   That   the   DPT     issued   a  request   for   qualification   on   2 n d   January,   2006,   inviting  interested   parties   to   implement   the   project   of  development   of  Multipurpose   Cargo   Berth  through  Private  Sector   Participation   on   Build,   Operate   and  Transfer  Basis.  One   M / s.   IMC   Ltd   amongst   other   interested   parties   made  an   application   on   12.06.2006   to   DPT   in   response   to   the  Request   for   Qualification.   That   with   respect   to   Berth   15,  the   bid   of   M/s.   IMC   Ltd   was   accepted   and   a   letter   of  intent   for   Award   of   Concession   was   issued   on   7.12.2010. \nThat   a   concession   Agreement   was   signed   between  Petitioner and Respondent on 18.02.2011. \n3.3. That   thereafter,   dispute   arose   between   the  petitioner and the respondent and the DPT issued a notice  on  1.7.2017 terminating  the  Concession  Agreement taking  note   of   persistent   defaults   by   the   concessionaire   of   its  obligations   in   accordance   with   the   provisions   of   the  concession   agreement   and   on   the   ground   that  continuation   of   the   agreement   was   not   in   public   /  national interest.\n3.4. That in view of the disputes, as per Article 19 of  the   Concession   Agreement   dated   18.02.2011,   Arbitral  Tribunal   has   been   constituted   for   adjudication   of   the  disputes under the concession agreement. \n3.5. That   first   meeting   of   the   Arbitral   Tribunal   was  held   on   26.08.2017.   The   petitioner   DPT   filed   statement  of   claim   on   26.08.2017.   The   claims   of   DPT   were   broadly  categorized under the following heads. \n(A). Nonpayment of license fees as per Article 9.1. (B).

It   appears   that   before   filing   of   the   statement   of  defence   and   counterclaim,   the   respondent   preferred  application   purportedly   under   Section   17   of   the  Arbitration   and   Conciliation   Act,   1996   seeking   inter  alia,\"Direct   the   Claimant   to   forthwith   pay   the   amount   of   Rs.   92,82,32,724/,   (being   90%   of   the   Debt   Due   to   the   Lender   ,   State   Bank   of   India   in   accordance   with   Article   17.1(b)   of   the   Concession   Agreement   along   with   interest   as   per   Article   17.5   of   the   Concession   Agreement.\"    The   said  application   was   vehemently   opposed   /   contested   by   the  petitioner   herein.   The   petitioner   submitted   its   reply.   The  respondent   also   filed   the   rejoinder   to   the   said   application  somewhere in the month of October 2017. That thereafter,  the   respondent   herein   filed   statement   of   defence   and   the  counter   claim   inter   alia,   seeking   sums   towards   (i).   the  costs   incurred   by   JRE   for   the   project,   (ii)   loss   of   profit   in  relation   to   the   project   and   (iii)   consequential   interest  arising therefrom. \n3.8. That   the   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   heard   Section   17  application   on   13.11.2017   and   the   order   was   reserved   by   the  learned Tribunal. \n3.9. That   thereafter,   by   order   dated   04.12.2017,   the  learned   Tribunal   disposed   of   the   said   Section   17  application   by   directing   the   claimant      KPT(DPT)   to  deposit   an   amount   of   Rs.92,82,32,724/   by   way   of   Debt  Due   to   the   Lender   in   an   Escrow   Account   with   the   State  Bank of India, to be deposited on or before 19.12.2017. At  this   stage,   it   is   required   to   be   noted   that   as   such   the  learned Tribunal disposed of Section 17 application  in the  terms   indicated   in   para   16   of   the   order.   Para   16   reads   as  under:\nIn   our   opinion,   it   would   meet   the   ends   of   justice   if   the   Claimant   KPT   is   directed   to   deposit   an   amount   of   Rs.   92,82,32,724/   by   way   of   Debt   Due   to   the   Lender   in   an   Escrow   Account   with   the   State   Bank   of   India.  We    h ave   been   told   that   the   Escrow   Account   is   already   there   and   is   under   the   control   and   management   of   the   State   Bank   of   India.   The   amount   so   deposited   in   Escrow   account   shall   earn   interest.   The   principal   amount   and   the   interest   shall   remain   available   for   appropriation and disbursal in accordance with   the   Award   finally   made   by   the   Tribunal .   The   amount   so   deposited   with   the   SBI   having   reached   its   coffers   available   to   be   utilized   by   it,   there   should   be   no  difficulty   in   SBI   giving   a   discharge   and   as   such   the   Transfer   from     shall   be free from encumbrance..\" \n3.10. While   disposing   of   Section   17   application,   in  terms   of   the   above,   the   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   also  observed   that   all   the   process   shall   be   subject   to   final  award passed by the learned Tribunal.\n3.11. It   appears   that   thereafter   by   Email   dated  18.12.2017,   the   Advocates   for   M/s.   JRE   had  informed  the  Hon'ble Tribunal, which read as under:\n\" We   refer   to   the   Order   dated   December   4,   2017   passed   by   this   Hon'ble   Tribunal   (\"Order\"),   which   was   forwarded   by   us   to   State   Bank   of   India   (\"SBI\").   We   attach  herewith   a   letter   dated   December   12,   2017   addressed   by   SBI   to   the   parties,   whereby   SBI   has   stated   that   since   the   amount   deposited   by   Kandla   Port   Trust   (\"KPT\")   pursuant   to   the   Order   will   be   deposited   in   the   Escrow   Account   without provision for SBI to adjust the amount   towards debt due, SBI will be unable to release   the   encumbrance   over   the   project   site   and   project assets.\nWe   also   attach   herewith   a   letter   dated   December   14,   2017   addressed   by   KPT   to   SBI   requesting   for   a   confirmation   regarding   the   method by which the 90% debt due required  to   be   paid   by   KPT   in   accordance   with   the   Order   may   be   deposited   in   the   Escrow   Account.   In   response   to   KPT's   letter   dated   December   14,   2017,   SBI   has   addressed   a   letter   dated   December   15,   2017   (copy   attached),   wherein   SBI   has   provided   the   details   of   the   Escrow   Account   for   deposit   of   amounts   and   has   also   indicated   that   the   said   Escrow   Account   is   a   current   account,   which   is   a   noninterest   bearing account. Therefore to earn interest the   amount   is   to   be   kept   in   a   Fixed   Deposit   account   with   definite   period.   Further   SBI   also   stated   that   unless   SBI   is   allowed   to   adjust   the   amount   so   remitted   towards   the   outstanding   debt   SBI   would   not   be   in   position   to   treat   the   remittance   as   a   discharge   of   KPT's   obligation   to pay the debt due.\"\n3.12. That   Email   /   communication   dated   18.12.2017  was   replied   by   the     DPT   vide   Email   dated   19.12.2017  inter   alia,   pointing   out   that   \"we   refer   to   the   order   dated   December   4,   2017   passed   by   this   Hon'ble   Tribunal   (order).   Pursuant   to   the   order,   we   have   written   an   email   on   19.12.2017   to   JRE   Infra   Port   Pvt.,   Ltd.,   (JRE)   and   informed them that Deendayal Port Trust (DPT) has agreed   to   implement   the   order   as   per   para   18   read   with   para   16   and  requested  them  to  depute   their   officials   to  consummate   the   formalities   pertaining   to   transfer   of   Project   Site   as   contemplated   under   the   Concession   Agreement   (copy   enclosed).With   a   clear   understanding   that   this   order   will   not be modified  or altered at any stage DPT has followed it   with   in   its   letter   and   spirit,   on   19.12.2017,  DPT   has   deposited   the   amount   of   Rs.92,82,32,724.00   in   the  following account (Account statement copy enclosed):\nAccount No.  31834438649 Beneficiary JRE Infra Pvt Ltd (Escrow Account) Name of Bank  CAG Branch Chennai and Branch IFSC Code SBIN0009999 Officials of DPT has visited the Project Site at 12 O'clock on   19.12.2017 to takeover of the possession of the Project Site,   however   the   officials   of   JRE   present   at   the   site,   on   instructions   from   their   advocate   has   refused   to   hand   over   the Project Site. We understand that the order speaks about   reciprocal   obligations   and   DPT   has   complied   with   its   part,   but   JRE   has   refused   to   comply   with   its   obligations.  On   19.12.2017   at   13   hours,   we   have   received   an   email   from   JRE mentioning that their advocate has sent an email to the   Hon'ble   Tribunal   seeking   clarification   in   the   matter.  We  would   like   to   mention   that   by   depositing   the   amount   as  per   the   directions   of   the   tribunal,   DPT   has   already   put  itself   in   an   irreversible   position   and   now   we   understand  that   through   its   email   dated   18.12.2017,   JRE   is   seeking  modification/alteration   in   the   order.   We   are   in   the  process   of   collecting   information   and   will   revert   to   the  email   ASAP   and   without   prejudice   to   our   rights   and  remedies   including   seeking   refund   of   the   deposited  amount   with   interest ,   we   request   the   Hon'ble   Tribunal   to  direct JRE to hand over the Project Site.\" \n3.13. That   the   aforesaid   Email   was     replied   by   the  respondent   vide   its   communication   of   20.12.2017,   in  which,   it   was   stated   by   the   respondent   that  \"it   would  appear that SBI and KPT have reached an impasse and our  Client   has   been   caught   in   the   crossfire.   It   would   be   most  appropriate,   expedient   and   in   the   interest   of   justice   that  the   Hon'ble   Tribunal   hold   an   urgent   short   hearing  (including   either   by   way   of   a   videoconference   or   a   tele conference)   in   the   ensuing   Christmas   holidays,   where   the  officials of SBI and / or their advocates also participate so  that   a   mutually   acceptable   resolution   of   the   issue   can   be  reached   at. We   would   also   humbly   request   KPT   and   SBI  (who   are   public   sector   entities)   to   not   take   any  precipitative   action   /   steps,   until   the   Hon'ble   Tribunal  passes further directions.\"\n3.14. It   appears   that   thereafter   the   lender   Bank   SBI  issued  a   letter   dated  addressed  to   the   Chief  Engineer  DPT  inter   alia   stating   that   \"as   you   are   aware   as   per   the  directions   of   the   Tribunal   payment   is   placed   in   non  interest bearing escrow account. The termination payment  in   order   to   earn   interest   needs   to   be   transferred   from  escrow   account   to   a   fixed   deposit   account .   Accordingly,  we request you to provide us direction from the Tribunal.\" \n3.15. That thereafter, the petitioner received the copy  of   the   impugned   order   23.12.2017,   vide   Email   dated  23.12.2017, by which, learned Tribunal purported to be in  continuance   of   earlier   order   dated   04.12.2017   issued  further directions as under: \n(i).That   the   respondent   shall   handover,   and   the   claimant   shall   takeover,   the   project   and   the   site   to   the   Claimant   on   a   date   mutually   agreed by the two;\n(ii)   That   such   transfer   shall   be   deemed   to   be   without   encumbrance     i.e.   free   from   encumbrances   so   far   as   the   parties   are   concerned;\n(iii)   For   all   practical   purposes,   so   far   as   the   present proceedings are concerned, the deposit   of   Rs.92,82,32,724/   by   KPT/DPT   with   the   State   Bank   of   India   shall   be   treated   as   discharge   of   obligation   of   the   Claimant   KPT   to   pay   the   amount   of   Debt   Due   to   the   Lender   under   Article   17.1(b)   of   the   Concession   Agreement dated 18.02.2011.\"\n3.16. That   on   receipt   of   the   further   order   dated  23.12.2017,   the   petitioner   submitted   application   dated  23.12.2017   and   sought   clarification   of   the   orders   passed  by the learned Tribunal dated 04.12.2017 and 23.12.2017  to   the   extent   that   the   orders   passed   by   the   learned  Tribunal are purely interlocutory and would not affect the  right   of   claimant   in   respect   of   the   principal   amount   and  interest and same shall remain available  for appropriation  and   disbursal   in   accordance   with   award   made   by   the  Tribunal.   In   the   said   application,   it   was   submitted   that  said   clarification   is   necessary   and   vital   as   otherwise  award,   if   any,   in   favour   of   claimant   may   not   be  enforceable   against   the   respondent   as   the   respondent   is  Special Purpose Vehicle with no substantial assets. That in  response   to   the   said   application,   by   order   dated  25.12.2017,   the   learned   Tribunal   disposed   of   the   said  application   by   observing   inter   alia   that   \"the   orders   dated  4.12.2017   and   23.12.2017   are   clear   and   self   explanatory.  No   further   clarification   is   called   for,   for   the   present.\"   It  appears   that   thereafter,   the   petitioner   DPT   approached  this   Court   by   way   of   Special   Civil   Application   No.     23338  of   2017.   In   the   said   Special   Civil   Application,   the  petitioner   DPT   prayed   for   an   order   restraining   SBI   from  appropriate   and   adjust   the   amount   of   Rs.   92,82,32,724/  from   the   escrow   account   of   the   parties   by   submitting   that  if   same   is   allowed   to  happen,   would  render   the   petitioner  remediless.

At   this  stage , it  is required to be  noted  that  in  the  meantime, the  petitioner   had   already   approached   the   learned  Commercial Court under Section 37 of the Arbitration and  Conciliation   Act   challenging   the   orders   4.12.2017   and  23.12.2017   and   therefore,   the   Division   Bench   disposed   of  the aforesaid Letters Patent Appeal as well as Special Civil  Application. \n3.17. That   by   impugned   common   judgment   and   order  dated   09.03.2018,   the   learned   Commercial   Court,   Rajkot  has   rejected   the   appeals   under   Section   37   of     the  Arbitration   and   Conciliation   Act.     That   thereafter,   being  aggrieved and dissatisfied with the common judgment and  order   passed   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court,   Rajkot  dated   09.03.2018   passed   in   Commercial   Civil  Miscellaneous   Application   Nos.   25   and   26   of   2017,   the  petitioners   approached   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   under  Section   37(3)   of   the   Arbitration   Act.   That   by   order   dated  19.03.2018   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   did   not   entertain  the   same   on   the   ground   that   against   the   order   dated  09.03.2018   passed   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court,  Rajkot   passed   in     Commercial   Civil   Miscellaneous  Application   Nos.   25   and   26   of   2017,   the   petitioner   can  approach the High Court under Article 226 and 227 of the  Constitution   of   India.   That,   while   relegating   the  petitioner   DPT   to   approach   this   Court,   the   Hon'ble  Supreme   Court   continued   the   adinterim   relief   granted  earlier   which   has   been   continued   till   date.   Thereafter,  common   petitioner   DPT   has   preferred   present   Special  Civil   Application   under   Articles   226   &   227   of   the  Constitution   of   India   challenging   the   impugned   common  order   passed   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court,   Rajkot  dated   09.03.2018   passed   in   Commercial   CMA   Nos.   25   of  2017  &  26  of   2017   as  well  as  order  passed  by  the  learned  Arbitral   Tribunal   dated   04.12.2017   as   well   as   23.12.2017  passed in Section 17 application. \n4.0. Shri   Mihir   Joshi,   learned   counsel   has   appeared  with   Shri   Dhaval   Vyas,   learned   advocate   for   the   DPT   and  Shri   R.S.   Sanjanwala,   learned   counsel   has   appeared   with  Shri Dhaval Shah, learned advocate for the no.1 herein. \n5.0. At   the   outset,   it   is   required   to   be   noted   that   in  the   present   petition,   the   petitionerDPT   has   challenged  both   the   orders   dated   04.12.2017   as   well   as   subsequent  order   dated   23.12.2017   passed   by   the   learned   Arbitral  Tribunal   passed   in   Section   17   application   submitted   by  the respondent herein. \n6.0. Shri   Mihir   Joshi,   learned   counsel   for   the  petitionerDPT   while   challenging   the   order   dated  04.12.2017   passed   by   the   learned   Tribunal   has  vehemently submitted that the direction made in the order  dated 04.12.2017 as such are beyond the scope  of Section  17   of   the   Arbitration   and   Conciliation   Act,   inasmuch  direction   granted   are   final   reliefs   sought   in   the  counterclaim. \n6.1. It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   in   the  counterclaim,   M/s.   JRE      respondent   herein   has   sought  award   inter   alia,   of   Rs.   Rs.252,30,07,148/   only   which  includes   sum   of   Rs.   Rs.92,82,32,724/   claims   90%   of   the  amount availed by the M/s. JRE original respondent from  its   lender.   It   is   submitted   that   therefore,  Rs.92,82,32,724/   as   such   is   part   of   the   final   award  sought     vide   principal   reliefs   prayed   in   the   counter   claim  by   M/s.   JRE.   It   is   submitted   that   DPT   has   emphatically  contested   the   claim.   It   is   submitted   that   direction   to  deposit   the   same   towards   liability   of   M/s.   JRE   to   third  party under the loan agreement shall be final in nature so  far   as   DPT,     whilst   executing   deposit   claim   to   the   said  extent   of   M/s.   JRE   prior   to   its   adjudication.   It   is  submitted   that   therefore,   order   dated   04.12.2017   inter  alia  directing DPT to deposit  the  sum claimed as  debt due  (which  is disputed by the petitioner) without adjudicating  the   said   dispute   as   to   the   quantification   to   the   same  towards   debt   due,   as   also   lowest   amount   as   per   Article  17(b) of the Concession Agreement, which DPT is required  to   pay   /   deposit   towards   compensation   to   the  concessionaire. \n6.2. It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned counsel for the petitioner DPT that   as   such   the  petitioner     DPT   has   categoricaly   and  emphatically   denied  that   the   book   value   and   the   actual   project   cost   for   berth  15   is   in   the   range   of   approximately   Rs.   200   -   250   crore,  as alleged or otherwise. It is submitted that therefore, it is  specifically   denied   that   the   KPT   /DPT   is   required   to     pay  90%   of   the   debt   due   to   JRE   on   the   transfer   date,   which  amounts to Rs. 92,82,32,724/, as alleged or otherwise. \n6.3. It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   DPT/KPT   has  specifically   denied   that   DPT   has   to   pay   compensation  under   article   17   of   the   Concession   Agreement.   It   is  submitted   that   therefore,   the   liability   to   pay   any   amount  under   Article   17.1(b)   of   the   Concession   Agreement   of   the  DPT/KPT   is  yet   to  be   determined  by   the   learned  Tribunal.  It   is   submitted   that   therefore,   the   learned   Tribunal   has  materially   erred   in   passing   the   order   dated   4.12.2017  solely   relying   upon   Article   17.1(b)   of   the   Concession  Agreement   and   that   too   without   final   determination   /  adjudication   of   the   amount   towards   debt   due   payable  under Article 17.1(b) of the Concession Agreement. \n6.4. It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   Article  17.1(b)   provides   that   in   the   concessionaire   event   of  default,   the   concessioning   authority   shall   pay   loss   of   (1)  book value (2) 90% debt due and (3) only project costs. It  is vehemently submitted by Shri Joshi, learned counsel for  the  petitioner  DPT  that    book   value   under the  concession  agreement   would   be   the   aggregate   written   down   value   as  on   the   date   of   issue   of   termination   of   notice   in   the   books  of   concessionaire   of   the   tangible   assets   forming   part   of,  fixed   or   attached   to   the   ground,   created,   installed   or  provided   by   the   concessionaire   and   comprised   in   project  facilities   and   services,   which   in   the   reasonable   judgment  of   a   expert   are   capable   of   being   put   to   use   /   utilized   by  the   concessioning     authority.   It   is   submitted   that   there   is  a   serious   dispute   with   respect   to   the   assets   comprised   in  project   facilities   and   services   as   capable   of   being   put   to  use   /   utilized   by   the   concessioning   authority.   It   is  submitted   that   therefore,   unless   evidence   is   led   as   to   the  condition   of   the   assets   and   its   usability   by   the  concessioning   authority   and   of   prudent   valuation   of   the  assets thereto, the dispute persists as to the book value of  the   assets   under   the   concession   agreement     and   as   to  whether   90%   of   the   debt   due   is   the   lowest   of   the   three  eventualities   as   per   Article   17.1(b)   of   the   concession  agreement. \n6.5. It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   even  otherwise   the   directions   in   Section   17   application   were  sought   citing   lis   /   issue   pertaining   to   third   parties   to   the  arbitration   proceeding   i.e.   lender   and   \"other   group  companies\"   of   M/s.   JRE,   which   as   such   was   not   subject  matter of  the  Arbitration  Proceedings.  It  is submitted that  impugned   directions   were   sought   principally   to   enable   to  discharge   M/s   JRE   and   its   \"other   group   companies\"   from  the   obligations,   securities   and   guarantees   under   the   Loan  Agreement   from   the   Lenders,   which   as   such   was   not   the  subject   matter   of   the   Arbitration   Proceedings.   It   is  submitted   that   the   issues   with   the   lenders   under   the  finance   documents   or   otherwise,   and  the   securities   by   the  \"other   group   companies\"   of   JRE   both   of   which   are   not   a  party   to   the   arbitration   proceeding,   is   not   the   subject  matter of arbitration before the Tribunal and therefore, in  view of the underlining cause and in view of the nature of  disputes, the application Section 17 of the Arbitration and  Conciliation Act was not maintainable.\n6.6.   It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   even  otherwise   the   JRE   is   a   special   purpose   company  incorporated   for   the   purposes   of   implementation   of  present   project   only   and   possesses   no   assets   or   finance   at  all, therefore, there is no question of JRE indulging in any  other   businesses   or   availing   financial   advances   from  institutions     and   as   such   the   application   was   preferred   in  order  to  provide  discharge  to   \"other group  companies\".  It  is   submitted   that   therefore,   apparently   the   alleged  irreparable   loss   or   balance   of   convenience,   as   cited,   was  of   the   \"other   group   companies\"   which   were   not   a   party   to  the   proceeding   and   therefore,   claim   of   convenience   or  irreparable   injury   to   such   entities   cannot   be   a   relevant  factor   for   consideration   of   the   equities   between   the  present parties. \n6.7.   It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   on   clear  understanding that direction of para 16 of the order dated  04.12.2017 would not be modified or altered at any stage,  \"without   prejudice   of   the   rights   and   remedies\"   DPT   had  agreed   to   follow   the   directions   made   in   the   order   dated  04.12.2017   in   letters   and   spirit.   It   is   submitted   that   the  compliance   of   the   directions   made   in   the   order   dated  04.12.2017   cannot   be   cited   to   the   prejudice   of   DPT   while  seeking   modification   or   alteration   of   directions   made   in  para   16   of   the   order   dated   04.12.2017.   It   is   submitted  that   if   the   directions   made   in   Para   16   are   reviewed   or  modified   or   further   directions   are   made   to   the   prejudice  of   DPT,   the   right   to   seek   redress   against   the   order   of  4.12.2017 cannot be restricted. \n6.8.   It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   even  otherwise   the   learned   Tribunal   has   materially   erred   in  passing   order   dated   04.12.2017   on   conditions     to   deposit  disputed   the   amount   of   debt   due.   It   is   submitted   that  envisaging the situation like the present, equitable redress  for   delayed   payment   (Article   17.5)   is   encompassed   in   the  concession   agreement   while   M/s   JRE   should   forthwith  hand   over   the   possession   of   the   Project   facilities   to   DPT,  inasmuch   as   every   day   of   nonutilization   of   the   berth   at  the   government   port   is   a   waste   of   the   natural   resource.   It  is submitted that in the facts, the direction to transfer the  possession   of   the   government   asset   ought   to   have   been  passed   without   condition   to   deposit   (disputed)   amount   of  debt due.\n6.9 .   It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   clauses   of  agreement may not be read in the manner, whereby undue  advantage   is   provided   to   one   party   while   recovery   of  government   monies   from   private   commercial   entities   is  rendered   unexecutable.   It   is   submitted   that   on  construction   of   Articles   17.1b   r/w   17.5   there   is   no   lis   or  liability   of   DPT   to   pay   or   towards   the   lender,   rather   the  amount,   if   deposited   by   DPT,   is   for   and   on   behalf   of   and  in discharge of liability of M/s JRE towards the lenders. It  is   submitted   that   the   liability   under   the   concession  agreement   of   DPT   visa   vis   M/s   JRE   is   yet   to   be  adjudicated,   inasmuch   as  sum  payable   by   M/s   JRE   to  DPT  is   required   to   be   adjusted   against   the   sum   which   may   be  adjudicated   as   90%   of   the   debt   due   by   the   learned  Tribunal. \nMaking   above   submission,   it   is   requested   to   quash  and   set   aside   direction   issued   by   the   learned   Tribunal   to  transfer   the   possession   of   the   government   assets   on  conditions   to   deposit   Rs.92,82,32,724/  being   90%   of   the  debt due. \n7.0. Now,   so   far   as   challenged   to   the   subsequent  order   dated   23.12.2017   passed   by   the   learned   Tribunal   is  concerned,   it   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   that   subsequent   order  dated   23.12.2017   purported   to   be   in   continuance   of   the  earlier order dated 4.12.2017 is not sustainable under law  and   same   is   without   hearing   the   petitioner   or   his   lawyers  and also on the ground that same is not sustainable under  law. \n7.1.   It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   while  application   filed   under   Section   17   of   the   Act,   M/s.   JRE  prayed   by   way   of   interim   measures   to   direct   the   claimant  to   forthwith   pay   the   amount   of   Rs.   92,82,32,724/,  (being   90%   of   the   Debt   Due   to  the   Lender   ,  State   Bank   of  India in accordance with Article 17.1(b) of the Concession  Agreement   along   with   interest   as   per   Article   17.5   of   the  Concession Agreement. It is submitted that such relief was  not   granted   by   learned   Tribunal   while   passing   the   order  dated   04.12.2017.   It   is   submitted   that   on   the   contrary  while   passing   the   order   dated   04.12.2017,   the   learned  Tribunal specifically observed and directed as under: \n\"In   our   opinion,   it   would   meet   the   ends   of  justice   if   the   Claimant   KPT   is   directed   to  deposit   an   amount   of   Rs.   92,82,32,724/   by  way   of   Debt   Due   to   the   Lender   in   an   Escrow  Account   with   the   State   Bank   of   India.   We   have  been   told   that   the   Escrow   Account   is   already  there and is under the control and management  of   the   State   Bank   of   India.   The   amount   so  deposited in Escrow account shall earn interest.  The   principal   amount   and   the   interest   shall  remain   available   for   appropriation   and  disbursal   in   accordance   with   the   Award   finally  made by the Tribunal. \"\n7.2.   It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   JRE   did   not  challenge   the   said   order   dated     4.12.2017,   which   as   such  did   not   grant   reliefs   as   prayed   for   by   the   JRE.   It   is  submitted   that   by   email   of   18.12.2017   (indirectly)  without   challenging   order   dated     4.12.2017,   JRE   sought  directions   which   as   such   were   not   granted   by   the   learned  Tribunal in the order dated 04.12.2017. \n7.3.   It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   the   order  dated   23.12.2017   has   been   passed   without   hearing   the  petitioner   Port   or   its   lawyers   and   therefore   is   vitiated.   It  is submitted that the order of 23.12.2017 materially alters  and   modifies   the   clear   operative   directions   made   in   the  order   dated   4.12.2017   which   inter   alia   provides,   the   sum  alleged   as   debt   due   was   to   be   'deposited   in   escrow  account',   which   was  to  'earn  interest',   while   'the   principal  amount   and   interest   shall   remain   available   for  appropriation   and  disbursal   in   accordance   with  the   award  finally made by the Tribunal.' 7.4.   It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   the  subsequent order of 23.12.2017 has been passed on email  dated   18.12.2017   made   by   the   Lawyers   of   M/s   JRE.   It   is  submitted  that   the   email   by   the   lawyers   of   M/s   JRE   could  not   have   been   accepted   as   application   for   review   or  modification   of   the   directions   made   in   the   order   of  4.12.2017 or for further directions. DPT had replied to the  said   email   stating,   'We   are   in   the   process   of   collecting  information   and  will   revert   to  the   email  ASAP',   whilst   the  lawyers   of   M/s   JRE   also   had   sought   a   hearing   on   the  contents   of   the   email   (of   18.12.2017)   vide   the   email   of  19.12.2017.   It   is   submitted   that   therefore,   M/s   JRE   was  also   conscious   that   no   directions   at   all   could   have   been  ordered unless the parties were heard. \n7.5.   It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,  learned counsel for the petitioner DPT that the directions  made   in   the   order   of   4.12.2017   ought   not   to   have   been  altered   and   modified,   pertinently   as   the   directions   were  clear   and   accordingly   understood   by   all   parties   i.e.   DPT,  JRE   and   SBI   (letter   of   12.12.2017),   whilst   M/s   JRE   had  not   challenged   such   directions   which   clearly   did   not  permit   the   appropriation   of   sum   deposited   in   the   escrow  account   pursuant   to   the   order   of   4.12.2017   against   the  Debt   Due   by   SBI   (which   is   not   a   party   to   the   Arbitration  proceeding). \n7.6. It   is   further   submitted   that   the   directions   made  in   the   orderdated   23.12.2017   as   such   are   beyond   the  scope   of   Section   17   of   the   Arbitration   and   Conciliation  Act,   1996.   It   is   submitted   that   the   directions   under  Section   17   are   always   in   the   nature   of   'interim   measure'  as   distinguished   from   'an   all   time   or   permanent  protection'.   It   is   submitted   that   the   directions   to   deposit  sums   towards   the   liability   of   M/s   JRE   to   a   third   party  while  observing  that  the  amount deposited is  not  going to  be   returned   by   the   lender   in   any   case   as   such   shall   be  final in  the  nature,  whilst   irreversibly  executing  the  claim  to the said extent of M/s JRE prior to its adjudication.\n7.7. It is further submitted that Section 17 of the Act  inter   alia   provides   for   'interim   measures'   by   the  Arbitration   Tribunal,   the   powers   which   are   purely  interlocutory   in   nature   and   cannot   partake   as   final  directions,   that   too   before   adjudication   of   disputes  between   the   parties.   It   is   submitted   that   the   directions  and observations made by Hon'ble Tribunal in the order of  23.12.2017   irreversibly   executes   finally   the   claim   of   Rs.  92   Cr.   as   90%   of   the   debt   due   to   the   lenders,   prior   to   its  adjudication.\n7.8. It   is   further   submitted   that   the     direction   to  deposit   alleged   dues   payable   by   M/s   JRE   to   a   third   party  to   the   Arbitration   proceeding   and   appropriation   thereof  by   the   said   third   party   is   not   'interim   measure'   U/s   17   of  the   Act,   as   such   is   a   final   direction   which   cannot   be  restituted   as   M/s   JRE   is   a   financially   defunct   company  and   the   Hon'ble   Tribunal   would   not   be   able   to   provide  binding directions for refund / adjustment to the Bank. \n7.9. It   is   further   submitted   that   the   issues   with   the  lenders   under   the   finance   documents   or   otherwise,   and  the securities by 'the other group companies' of JRE  both  of   which   are   not   a   party   to   the   arbitration   proceeding,   is  not   the   subject   matter   of   arbitration   before   the   Tribunal,  therefore,   in  view   of  the  underlining  cause   and  in   view  of  the   nature   of   disputes,   the   application   was   not  maintainable   U/s   17   of   the   Act.   It   is   submitted   that   the  consequence   of   permitting   the   lender   -   third   party   to   the  proceeding,   to   appropriate   and   finally   adjust   the   amount  towards   the   debt   due   payable   by   M/s   JRE,   shall   create   an  irreversible   situation   and   enable   final   and   permanent  discharge   to   third   parties   by   the   lender   prior   to  adjudication   of   disputes   of   the   sums   towards   debt   due,   at  the instance of M/s JRE. \n7.10. It   is   further   submitted   that   it   is     an   admitted  fact   that   M/s.   JRE   is   a   special   purpose   company  incorporated for the purposes of present project only. M/s  JRE   has   no   assets   or   financial   standing   at   all   and   as   such  is   a   financially   defunct   company.   Thus,   it   would   be  impossible   to   secure   or   enforce   the   directions   (even)   of  refund of the said sums deposited in terms of the order of  4.12.2017   by   the   Hon'ble   Tribunal,   while   the   Hon'ble  Tribunal   would   not   be   able   to   provide   binding   directions  for refund / adjustment to the Bank. \n7.11. It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Joshi,   learned  counsel for the petitioner DPT that even otherwise as per  Article   16.5(a)   read   with   Article   18.2,   M/s   JRE   is   under  absolute   obligation   to   handover   the   project   site,   port  assets, the project and project facilities and services to the  Concessioning   Authority.   It   is  submitted  that   M / s   JRE   has  not   handed   over   the   possession   of   the   project   facilities,  port assets and project site to DPT despite clear directions  made   by   the   learned   Tribunal.   It   is   submitted   that  admittedly  no charge could be or has been created on the  project   site   and   the   port   assets   and   therefore   the  possession   thereof   cannot   be   withheld   by   the   M/s.   JRE.   It  is   submitted   that   even   if   the     issues   are   not   settled   with  the   lender,   M/s   JRE   was   obliged   to   hand   over   the  possession   of   the   project   facilities   with   or   without  encumbrance to DPT. It is further submitted by Shri Joshi,  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   DPT   that   only   12  vessels   have   been   handled   in   the   year   2017   at   Berth   15.  It   is   submitted   that   the     berth   has   remained   non operational from the date of termination of the concession  agreement. It is submitted that as such M/s JRE is not in a  position   to   operate   the   facilities,   it   would   not   be   in   the  interest   of   parties   as   also   in   the   national   interest   to   keep  the   berth   idle   without   generating   revenue   and/or   not  handling   the   vessels   arriving   at   the   Government   Port,  whilst   the   risk   of   the   idle   assets   being   deteriorated.   It   is  submitted   that   if   at   all   any   award   is   passed   in   favour   of  M/s.   JRE   in   that   case,   the   same   is   recoverable   from   the  DPT  which  is  established  under the  Major  Port   Trust  Act     which is a statutory body.  Making above submissions, it is  requested   to   quash   and   set   aside   the   subsequent   order  dated 23.12.2017. \nMaking   above   submissions,   it   is   requested   to   quash  and   set   aside   the   impugned   orders   passed   by   the   learned  Commercial   Court,   Rajkot   dated   9.3.2018   passed   in  Commercial   CMA   Nos.   25   of   2017   &   26   of   2017   on  quashing   and   setting   aside   the   orders   dated   04.12.2017  and   23.12.2017   passed   by   the   learned   Tribunal   passed   in  Section 17 application. \n8.0 . Shri R.S. Sanjanwala, learned counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   respondent   M/s.   JRE   has   vehemently  submitted   that   in   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   the   case  the   orders   passed   by   the   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   both  dated 04.12.2017 and 23.12.2017 are just and proper and  absolutely   in   consonance   with   the   relevant   provisions   /  clauses   of   the   Concession   Agreement,   the   learned  Commercial   Court   has   rightly   rejected   the   Commercial  Civil   Miscellaneous   Applications   and   has   rightly   not  interfered with the same. \n8.1. It   is   further   submitted   by     Shri   R.S.   Sanjanwala,  learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent  M/s.   JRE   that   orders   dated   04.12.2017   and   23.12.2017  passed   by   the   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   which   is  adjudicating   main   dispute   between   the   petitioner   and   the  respondent   which   arise   under   the   concession   agreement  dated   18.02.2011   for   development   of   Multipurpose   Cargo  on   a   BuildOperate   Transfer   Basis   for   30   years.   It   is  submitted  that   under   the     Concession   Agreement,   JRE   has  created   /   constructed   a   Cargo   Jetty   of   size   300   meters   X  55   meters   for   vessels   to   berth   alongside   for  discharging/loading   the   cargo   and   also   developed   Marshy  Land   of   about   55   acres   to   set   up   Cargo   Handling  infrastructure   for   operating   the   Jetty   expending   in   excess  of   Rs.250   Crore   towards   the   same.   The   entire   land   of   55  acres   was   marshy   land   which   was   developed   by   JRE   and  JRE   also   constructed   the   Jetty   on   the   sea   by   driving   piles  into   the   seabed.     It   is   submitted   that   as   is   evident   from  the said  photographs,  JRE  has created  a substantial assets  on   the   sea   water   and   developed   the   said   marshy   land  provided by KPT.\n8.2. It is further submitted by   Shri R.S. Sanjanwala,  learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent  that   M/s.   JRE   has   incurred   a   project   cost   of   over   Rs.252  Crores   to   develop   the   Jetty.   This   Project   cost   has   been  certified  by JRE's  auditors  and  verified  by  an  independent  auditor appointed by KPT. \n8.3. It is further submitted by   Shri R.S. Sanjanwala,  learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent  that   JRE   obtained   financial   assistance   from   State   Bank   of  India   (\"SBI\")   at   the   commencement   of   the   Project,   with  the  knowledge   and  consent  of  KPT   -  as  per  the  provisions  of   the   Concession   Agreement.   One   of   the   Conditions  Precedent   under   Article   3.1   (a)(vii)   required   JRE   to  provided   its   Financial   Plan   and   Financing   Document   for  the   Project   including   the   loan   agreement   entered   into  between   JRE   and  SBI,   to   KPT.   Thus,   KPT   is  fully   aware   of  the   existing   terms   of   the   loan   and   Debt   Due   to   SBI   from  KPT. \n8.4.   It   is   further   submitted   by     Shri   R.S.   Sanjanwala,  learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent  that   after     commencement   of   operations   of   the   Project,  disputes   arose   between   JRE   and   KPT   on   account   of   KPT's  failure   to   fulfill   its   obligations   and   pursuant   thereto   KPT  has   invoked   arbitration   and   raised   false   disputes   to  wriggle   out   of   its   breaches   under   the   Concession  Agreement.   Claims   and   counterclaims   have   been   filed   by  both   parties   in   the   arbitration   (which   relate   to   the  operations   of   the   Project).   It   is   only   after   the  commencement   of   the   arbitration,   KPT   terminated,   KPT  terminated   the   Concession   Agreement   by   a   notice   dated  July   1,   2017.   It   is   submitted   that   this   termination   was  accepted by JRE as a repudiatory breach by KPT and it has  reserved its rights to claim damages from KPT. \n8.5.   It   is   further   submitted   by     Shri   R.S.   Sanjanwala,  learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent  that   irrespective   of   the   issue   as   to   which   Party's   default  lead to termination of the Concession  Agreement, (though  it   is   the   specific   case   on   behalf   of   the   JRE   that   it   was   the  then   KPT   who   have   committed   defaults   and   breaches   and  not   JRE)     there   is   an   independent   mechanism  provided   in  the   Concession   Agreement   regarding   the   transfer   of   the  Project   Site,   Port's   Assets,   the   Project   Facilities   and  Services back to KPT, upon payment of some value by KPT  for   such   Project   Assets   developed   by   JRE.     It   is   submitted  that   this   payment   has   to   be   made   to   SBI,   which   currently  has   a   charge   on   the   Project   Assets.     It   is   submitted   that  upon   release   of   the   charge,   the   Project   Assets   would   be  transferred   to   KPT,   as   required   by   the   Concession  Agreement.   It   is   submitted   that   this   transfer   has   no  bearing   on   the   main   arbitration   /   disputes   pending  between   KPT   and   JRE   and   must   be   complied   with   by   KPT  under   the   express   provisions   of   the   Concession  Agreement,   even   assuming   that   JRE   is   at   fault(whilst  expressly denied).\n8.6.   It   is   further   submitted   by     Shri   R.S.   Sanjanwala,  learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent  that   on   conjoint   reading   of   the   relevant   clauses   of   the  Concession   Agreement   makes   it   clear   that   upon  termination   of   the   Concession   Agreement,   KPT   has   to   pay  an   undisputed   amount   of   minimum   compensation   to   JRE  (on   the   assumption   that   JRE   had   committed   an   Event   of  Default).   It   is   submitted   that   KPT   therefore,   cannot   seek  to   defer   the   performance   of   its   obligations   till   the  arbitration   proceedings   are   concluded   and   /   or   take   a  stand   that   the   compensation   payable   by   KPT   will   be  adjusted in accordance with the final award passed by the  learned Tribunal. \n8.7. It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   R.S.   Sanjanwala,  learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent  that   the   amount   of   debt   due   compensation   to   be   paid   by  KPT has never been denied or disputed by the KPT earlier. \nIt   is   submitted   that   the   same   is   evident   by   letters   dated  1.7.2017,   2.8.2017,   5.8.2017,   28.9.2017   and   29.9.2017.  It   is   submitted   that   as   such   on   August   1,   2017,   JRE  submitted   the   information   /   documents   sought   by   KPT  under   the   requisition   notice.   That   thereafter,   on  September   22,   2017,   at   the   request   of   KPT,   JRE  resubmitted   information   in   response   to   KPT's   requisition  notice   including   SBI's   certificate   of   debt   due   and   all   the  details   to   ascertain   the   Book   Value   of   the   Project.   It   is  submitted that the details regarding the debt due annexed  and   the   details   regarding     book   value   were   also   annexed  to   the   letter   dated   September   22,   2017.   It   is   submitted  that   at   no   point   of   time   KPT   challenged   the   same.   It   is  submitted   that   it   is   only   on   September   29,   2017   that   the  KPT representative orally informed JRE  when they arrived  at   the   Project   Site   for   the   purpose   of   taking   over  possession   that   they   would   not   pay     90%   of   the   debt   due  to   SBI.   It   is   submitted  that   at   this  stage   also,   the   KPT   did  not   dispute   the   quantum   of   payment   to   be   made.   It   is  submitted that only dispute raised by the KPT and the sole  ground   on   which   KPT   refused   to   pay   the   compensation  was   that   KPT   had   claims   against   JRE,   for   which,   it   had  invoked   arbitrariness   under   Clause   19   of   the   Concession  Agreement. \n8.8.   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   R.S.   Sanjanwala,  learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent  that   on   account   of   KPT's   refusal   to   pay   the   compensation  under   the   Concession   Agreement   on   September   29,   2017,  JRE   filed   an   application   seeking   interim   relief's   from   the  Tribunal.   It  is  submitted that  before  the  learned  Tribunal,  KPT   did   not   dispute   the   quantum   of   the   Debt   due   by  providing   an   alternate   figure   and   merely   denied   the  averments made by JRE in this regard. It is submitted that  the   KPT   also   never   disputed   that   both   the   book   value   of  the   assets   to  be  transferred   by  JRE   to  KPT   on   the   transfer  date   or   the   Actual   Project   Cost   incurred   by   JRE   were  higher   than   90%   of   the   debt   due.     It   is   submitted   that  because   KPT   was   aware   that   its   own   independent   auditor  had   confirmed   that   the   actual   project   cost   was   over  Rs.252   crores   and   that   the   book   value   of   the   immovable  assets   created   by   JRE   was   in   excess   of   Rs.240   crore   at  March   31,   2016.   It   is   submitted   that   therefore,   the   KPT  actually aware and accepted that 90% of the debt due was  the   lowest   of   three   alternatives   contemplated   under  Article   17.1(b)   of   the   Concession   Agreement   and  therefore,   never   raised   nay   dispute   or   request   of  adjudicate   on   which   of   three   figures   was   the   lowest.   It   is  submitted   that   in   fact   the   KPT   did   not   make   any  submission disputing debt due before the learned Tribunal  has   been   clearly   and   rightly   observed   by   the   learned  Commercial   Court.   It   is   submitted   that   therefore,   KPT  can not   challenge   the   quantum   of   the   debt   due   or   allege  that   the   book   value   may   be   lower   than   the   debt   due   at  this   belated   stage   now.   It   is   submitted   this   is   clearly   an  afterthought   not   based   on   any   contemporaneous  correspondence and / or the pleadings and contrary to the  material on record. \n8.9.   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   R.S.   Sanjanwala,  learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   respondent  that   as   such   the   petitioner   had   already   complied   with   the  order   dated   04.12.2017   and   accepted   the   same  unconditionally.   It   is   submitted   that   therefore,   it   is   not  open   for   the   petitioner   to   challenge   the   first   order   dated  04.12.2017   as   it   appears   that   till   19.12.2017   the  petitioner   was   never   aggrieved   by   the   order   dated  04.12.2017   and   deposited   the   entire   amount   as   directed  by the learned Arbitral Tribunal. It is further submitted by  Shri Sanjanwala, learned advocate for the respondent that  even   otherwise   the   first   order   dated   01.12.2017   is  absolutely   in   accordance   with   the   concession   agreement,  more   particularly,   considering   Article   17.1(b)   of   the  Concession   Agreement.     It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri  Sanjanwala,   learned   advocate   for   the   respondent   that   as  such   by   passing  final  order   dated  04.12.2017,   the   learned  Tribunal   specifically   observed   that   pending   adjudication  of   the   claims   and  cross   claims   between   KPT   and   JRE,   KPT  is   bound   to   discharge   its   obligation   under   Article   17.1(b)  of   the   Concession   Agreement,   by   making   payment   to   SBI.  It   is   submitted   that   as   such   escrow   account,   in   which,  amount   was   directed   to   be   deposited   vide   order   dated  04.12.2017   was   being   operated   under   the   concession  agreement and it was merely current account. \n9.0. Now,   so   far   as   challenge   to   the   clarificatory  second   order   dated   23.12.2017   by   the   petitioner   is  concerned,     it   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri  Sanjanwala,   learned   advocate   for   the   respondent   that   by  the   subsequent   order   dated   23.12.2017,   earlier   order  dated  04.12.2017  has  not   been   modified  and  /  or  altered.  It   is   submitted   that   on   the   contrary   it   has   only   been  clarified   by   learned   Tribunal   in   light   of   the  correspondence  addressed  by SBI and KPT.  It is  submitted  that  since  hearing  has already   been  granted  to  the   parties  and   written   statement   were   also   filed   earlier,   the   learned  Tribunal deemed fit to pass order to clarify its order dated  04.12.2017.   It   is   submitted   that   the   clarification   order  dated   23.12.2017   is   to   be   read   in   continuance   of   order  dated   04.12.2017,   no   further   order   was   required   to   be  given   by   the   learned   Tribunal.   It   is   submitted   that  therefore ,   the   impugned   order   dated   23.12.2017   is   not  vitiated on the ground that before passing the order dated  23.12.2017,   the   petitioner   and   /   or   his   lawyer   has   not  been given any opportunity of being heard. \n9.1.   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Sanjanwala,   learned  advocate   for   the   respondent   that   even   otherwise   on  perusal   of   the   order   dated   23.12.2017   makes   it   clear   that  that directions of the learned Tribunal while passing order  dated   04.12.2017   was   that   monies   required   to   be  deposited by KPT was in discharge of its admitted liability  under   Article   17.1   of   the   Concession   Agreement   and   that  the   monies   so   deposited   with   SBI   could   be   utilized  commercially   by   SBI   and   would   not   be   returned   by   it   to  the parties. It is submitted that therefore,  when there was  ambiguity   in   the   order   dated   04.12.2017   and   /   or   some  confusion  on  the  part  of the  SBI that  the  amount  received  by   the   SBI   would   be   in   full   and   final   settlement   of   the  claim   so   far   as   SBI   is   concerned,   as   on   such   deposit   the  charge   was   to   be   removed   and   the   possession   of   project  assets   was   to   be   transferred   to   KPT   and   thereafter   SBI  sought   clarification,   the   copy   of   which   was   also   given   to  the   KPT   (its   lawyer)   and   thereafter   when   the   learned  Tribunal   has   clarified   its   earlier   order   dated   04.12.2017,  the   order   dated   23.12.2017   cannot   be   said   to   be   per   se  illegal   and   /   or   contrary   to   the   earlier   order   dated  04.12.2017.   It   is   submitted   that   as   such   no   separate  hearing   was   necessary   before   passing   the   order   dated  23.12.2017   since   Arbitral   Tribunal   had   already   granted  hearing   and   was   \"merely   clarifying\"   its   earlier   order.   It   is  submitted   that   learned   Commercial   Court   has   dealt   with  aforesaid aspect while passing the impugned order. \nMaking above submissions , it is submitted by learned  Counsel   for   the   respondent   that   interest   of   all   parties  would   be   protected   if   the   present   petitions   are   dismissed  and   the   order   of   the   learned   Tribunal   are   upheld   and  complied   with   by   the   KPT   in   letter   and   spirit   since   SBI  would   receive   its   outstanding   dues,   thereby   releasing   its  charge   over   the   Project   Assets.   It   is   submitted   that   this  would   enable   JRE   to   handover   peaceful   possession   of   the  Project   Assets   to   KP,   free   of   encumbrance,   as   required  under   the   Concession   Agreement   and   KPT   would   receive  assets   worth   Rs.252   Crore   on   payment   of   Rs.   92   Crore  approximately.   It   is   submitted   that   the   project   assets  which   have   been   lying   idle   since   September   2017   would  be  put  to proper   use  and at  the  same  time,  the  lender SBI  whose debt is  required to be  repaid by KPT in terms of its  obligation   under the  Concession   Agreement   would  also  be  paid. \nMaking   above   submission,   it   is   requested   to   dismiss  the present petitions. \n10. Heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the   respective   parties  at length. We have perused and considered in detailed the  orders   passed   by   the   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   dated  04.12.2017   and   subsequent   clarificatory   order   dated  23.12.2017,   passed   under   Section   17   of   the   Arbitration  and   Conciliation   Act   as   well   as   impugned   common  judgment   and   order   passed   by   the   learned   Commercial  Court,   by   which,   the   learned   Judge,   Commercial   Court,  Rajkot   has   dismissed   Commercial   Civil   Miscellaneous  Application   upholding   the   orders   dated   04.12.2017   and  23.12.2017. \n11. Now,   so   far   as   challenge   to   the   order   passed   by   the  learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   dated   04.12.2017   is   concerned,  at   the   outset,   it   is   required   to   be   noted   that   said   order  came   to   be   passed   by   the   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   in  exercise   of   powers   conferred   under   Section   17   of   the  Arbitration   and   Conciliation   Act   and   by   which,   learned  Tribunal   in   an   application   under   Section   17   of   the  Arbitration   and   Conciliation   Act   submitted   by   the  respondent   herein   original   opponent   in   the   arbitration  proceeding,   directed   the   appellant   herein      original  claimant   as   interim   measures   to   deposit   an   amount   of  Rs.92,82,32,724/  by   way   of   debt   due   to   the   lender   in  escrow   account   with   the   State   Bank   of   India.   The   learned  Arbitral   Tribunal   also   passed   an   order   and   observed   that  amount   so   deposited   in   the   escrow   account,   shall   earn  interest.   The   principal   amount   and   the   interest   shall  remain   available   for   appropriation   and   disbursal   in  accordance   with   the   award   finally   made   by   the   Tribunal.  The   learned   Tribunal   also   further   observed   that   the  amount   was   deposited   with   the   SBI   having   reached   its  coffers   available   to   be   utilized   by   it,   there   should   be   no  difficulty   in   SBI   giving   a   discharge   and   as   such   the  Transfer   from   shall   be   free   from   encumbrance.   The  learned Tribunal observed in para 15 to 18 as under: \n\"15.   We   have   heard   the   Ld .   Sr .   Advocates   for   the   parties.   We   are   satisfied   that   for   the   present   it   is   not   necessary   to   express   any   opinion   on   the   case   law   cited   by   the   parties   as   undoubtedly   the   Claimant   KPT   is   claiming   an   amount   of   damages   by   way   of   compensation   and   that   is   yet   to   be   quantified.   There   are   claims   and   counter   claims.   However,   what   cannot   be   doubted   is   the   obligation   of   the   Claimant   KPT   to   pay   the   amount   of   Debt   Due   to   the   Lender   State   Bank   of   India   under   Article   17.1(b)   of   the   Concession   Agreement. \n16.   In   our   opinion,   it   would   meet   the   ends   of   justice   if   the   Claimant   KPT   is   directed   to   deposit   an   amount   of   Rs.   92,82,32,724/   by   way   of   Debt  Due   to   the   Lender   in   an   Escrow   Account   with   the   State   Bank   of   India .   We   have   been   told   that   the   Escrow   Account   is   already   there   and   is   under   the   control   and   management   of   the   State   Bank   of   India. The amount so deposited in Escrow account   shall  earn  interest.  The  principal  amount  and  the   interest   shall   remain   available   for   appropriation   and   disbursal   in   accordance   with   the   Award   finally   made   by   the   Tribunal.   The   amount   so   deposited   with   the   SBI   having   reached   its   coffers   available   to   be   utilized   by   it,   there   should   be   no  difficulty   in   SBI   giving   a   discharge   and   as   such   the   Transfer   from     shall   be   free   from   encumbrance.\n17.By   way   of   abundant   caution   we   clarify   that   whatever   has   been   stated   in   this   order   is   solely   for   the   purpose   of   disposing   of   the   present   application   and   shall   not   be   taken   to   mean   as   an   expression   of   opinion   either   way   on   the   merits   of   the pleas raised  by either  party in the main cause   before this Tribunal.\n18.Therefore, the application is disposed  of in the   terms   indicated   in   para   16   above.   Compliance   shall   be   made   by   the   Claimant   KPT   within   15   days   from   the   date   of   this   Order,   that   is,   on   or   before   19122017.   Transfer   by   JRE   to   KPT   as   contemplated   by   the   Concession   Agreement   shall   also   be   completed   on   the   same   day   or   latest   by   the following day. All this process shall be subject   to   the   Final   Award   to   be   passed   by   this   Tribunal.\" \n11.1. While   passing   the   order   dated   04.12.2017,   it  appears   that   the   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   considered   the  clause 17.1(b) and 17.4 of the Concession Agreement. The  relevant clauses read as under: \n\" 17.1(b):  Termination   due   to   Concessionaire Event of Default If the termination is after the Date of Commercial   Operation,   due   to   a   Concessionaire   Event   of   Default,   the   compensation  payable   by   the   Concessioning   Authority   to   the   Concessionaire   shall be the lowest of:\n                    (a)        the Book Value; \n                    (b)        90% (ninety percent) of Debt Due;\n                    (c)        the Actual Project Cost; \n\n                    17.4.Payment   of   Compensation   to                       Lenders: \n                    The   Concessionaire   hereby   irrevocably   authorize   the   Concessioning   Authority   to  pay   the   Lenders   or   at  their   instruction   to   any  designated  bank   account   in   India  the   compensation   payable   to   the   Concessionaire.   The   Concessionaire   confirms   that   upon   such   payment   being   made,   the   Concessioning   Authority   shall   stand   duly   discharged   of   its   obligations   regarding   payment   of   compensation   under   this   agreement   and   the   charge   created   by   the   Concessionaire   in   favour   of   the   Lenders   on   any   of   its   assets   taken   over  by the   Concessioning   Authority  shall   stand   satisfied   and   all   such   assets   shall   on   and   from   the   Transfer   Date   be   free   from   such   charge.   The   Concessionaire   further   confirms   that   payment   of   compensation   by   Concessioning   Authority   in   accordance   with  this   Article   17.4   shall   be   a   valid   discharge   to   the   Concessioning   Authority   in   respect   of   the   Concessioning   Authority's   obligation   regarding   payment   of   compensation   to   the   Concessionaire   under this Agreement.\"\n  11.2 However,   as   observed   in   para   15   of   the   order  dated   04.12.2017   as   the   claimant   KPT   is   also   claiming   an  amount   of   damages   by   way   of   compensation   and   that   is  yet   to   be   quantified   and   there   are   claim   and   counter  claim ,   it   appears   that   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   at   this  stage   subject   to   ultimate   outcome   of   the   proceedings   and  the   award   that   may   be   passed   and   award   finally   made   by  the Tribunal directed original  claimant  KPT to deposit  the  aforesaid   amount   by   way   of   debt   due   to   the   lender   and  also   passed   an   order   that   on   such   deposit   on   or   before  19.12.2017,   transfer   by   JRE   to   KPT   as   contemplated   by  the Concession Agreement shall also be completed. At this  stage,   it   is   required   to   be   noted   that   as   such   order   dated  04.12.2017 came to be accepted by the petitioner herein   original   claimant      KPT   and  as  such  deposited  the   amount  of   Rs.92,82,32,724/   with   the   SBI   in   escrow   account   on  19.12.2017.   From   the   correspondence,   it   appears   that   the  petitioner   herein   original   claimant   KPT   accepted   the  order dated 04.12.2017 unconditionally and deposited the  entire   amount   as   directed   vide   order   dated   04.12.2017   in  due   compliance   of   the   order   dated   04.12.2017   without  any  demur.  Thus, it  appears  that  till 19.12.2017 and even  till   23.12.2017   i.e.   clarificatory   order   dated   23.12.2017  was   passed,   the   petitioner   herein   original   claimant      KPT  was   not   aggrieved   at   all   by   the   order   dated   04.12.2017.  Therefore,   as   such   thereafter   it   will   not   be   open   for   the  petitioner herein to challenge the order dated 04.12.2017. \n11.3. Even otherwise, considering the relevant clauses  of   the   concession   agreement   and   the   correspondences  between   the   parties,   it   appears   that   the   learned   Arbitral  Tribunal   was   justified   in   passing   order   dated   04.12.2017.  The   order   dated   04.12.2017   was   subject   to   award   finally  that   may   be   made   by   the   Tribunal.   Even   the   learned  Tribunal   also   specifically   observed   that   aforesaid   amount  which   directed   to   be   deposited   as  principal   and   the  interest   shall   remain   available   for   appropriation   and  disbursal   in   accordance   with   the   Award   finally   made   by  the   Tribunal.   Thus,   the   order   dated   04.12.2017   was   by  way   of   interim   measure,   which   does   not   call   for   the  interference   of   this   Court.   Under   the   circumstances,  challenge   to   the   first   order   dated   04.12.2017   fails,   more  particularly,   when   the   petitioner   itself   accepted   the   order  dated   04.12.2017   and   deposited   the   entire   amount   with  the   State   Bank   of   India      lender   and   complied   with   the  order dated 04.12.2017. \n12.0. Now,   so   far   as   challenge   to   the   subsequent  order   dated   23.12.2017   as   observed   by   the   learned  Arbitral   Tribunal   is   clarificatory   order   and  in   continuance  of   the   earlier   order   dated  04.12.2017   is  concerned,   at   the  outset, it is required to be noted that as such by the order  dated   23.12.2017   there   is   a   substantial   modification   in  the earlier order dated 04.12.2017. By the said order , it is  observed   and  directed  that   for  all   practical   purpose   so  far  as   arbitration     proceedings   are   concerned,   present  proceedings,   as   termed   by   the   learned   Tribunal,   the  deposit   of   Rs.92,82,32,724/   by   KPT/DPT   with   the   State  of Bank of India shall be treated as discharge of obligation  of  the Claimant  KPT to pay the amount  of  debt  due to  the  lender  under  Clause   17.1(b)   of  the   Concession   Agreement  18.02.2011.   As   observed   herein   above,   no   such  observations   were   made   by   the   learned   Tribunal   while  passing   order   dated   04.12.2017.   Thus,   on   considering   the  order   dated   23.12.2017,   it   appears   that   though   the   same  has   termed   as   clarificatory   order   and   /   or   same   is   stated  to be an clarificatory order and / or in continuance of the  the   order   dated   04.12.2017,   as   the   order   dated  23.12.2017   can   be   said   to   be   modification   of   the   order  dated   04.12.2017   and   the   Arbitral   Tribunal   has   provided  what was not there in the order dated 04.12.2017 and the  same   has   been   provided   by   subsequent   order   dated  23.12.2017,   we   are   of   the   firm   opinion   that   same   could  not   have   been   passed   at   least   without   giving   any  opportunity   to   all   concerned.   From   the   order   dated  23.12.2017,   it   appears   and   may   not   be   disputed   that  before   passing   order   dated   23.12.2017,   no   hearing   has  been given to any of the parties. It is required to be noted  that   even   the   said   order   dated   23.12.2017   has   been  passed on  the  communication  by  the  State  Bank  of India   lender.   It   is   the   case   on   behalf   of   the   petitioner   that   they  accepted   the   order   dated   4.12.2017   as   the   deposit   by   the  petitioner   was   subject   to   final   award   that   may   be   passed  under   the   arbitration   proceedings   and   the   final   order   and  by   way   of   interim   measure   and   as   the   learned   Tribunal  specifically   observed   that   there   are   claims   and   counter claim and claim by the claimant by way of damages which  is yet to be determined. Therefore, also before passing the  order   dated   23.12.2017,   the   concerned   parties   ought   to  have   been   heard   by   the   learned   Tribunal.   At   this   stage,   it  is   required   to   be   noted   that   even   by   the   communication  dated   20.12.2017   addressed   by   the   respondent   herein  addressed   to   the   learned   Tribunal   even   then   also  requested   that   it   would   be   most   appropriate,   expedient  and in the interest  of  justice  the Hon'ble  Tribunal hold  an  urgent   short   hearing   (including   either   by   way   of   a   video  conference   or   a   teleconference),   where   the   officials   of  SBI   and   /   or   their   advocates   also   participate   so   that   a  mutually acceptable resolution of the issue can be reached  it. Despite the above,  no hearing was given and impugned  order   dated   23.12.2017   has   been   passed   without   hearing  the   advocates   for   the   respective   parties   and   /   or  respective   parties   and   therefore,   order   dated   23.12.2017  can be said to be in breach of principles of natural  justice  and same deserves to be quashed and set aside. We are of  the   opinion   that,   if   at   all,   any   further   order   was   required  to   be   passed   by   the     learned   Tribunal   either   in  continuance   of   the   order   dated   04.12.2017   and   /   or  clarificatory   order,   in   that   case   also,   same   could   have  been   passed   after   hearing   the   learned   advocates   for   the  respective   parties   and   /   or   the   respective   parties.   Under  the   circumstances,   order   dated   23.12.2017   and   the  impugned   order   passed   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court  dated   09.03.2018   passed   in   Commercial   Civil  Miscellaneous Application Nos. 25 of 2017 and 26 of 2017  upholding   the   order   dated   23.12.2017   deserves   to   be  quashed   and   set   aside.

the summary judgment and allowed the aforesaid suit of the appellants without recording the oral evidence. 3. feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned summary judgment, the appellants have

mr.parth bhatt, learned advocate appearing for the respondents. 5. mr.desai, learned counsel appearing for the appellants has submitted that the trial court has not considered the pleadings in its true and proper perspective. he has submitted that the trial court has misread and misconstrued the provisions of order xiii-a of the civil procedure code, while prescribing the grounds for summary judgment against the appellants original defendants. it is submitted by the learned advocate that the trial court has observed that the appellants have no real prospect of successfully defending the claim and failed to consider other compelling reason and passed summary judgment without recording of the oral evidence, which has resulted into miscarriage of justice. he has also submitted that the trial court has not followed the provisions of the act more particularly in case management hearing under exhibit 18 to the effect that the appellants failed to produce statement of truth in accordance with the provisions of order viii rule 3, which is required to put on record, however, without any due diligence on the part of the learned advocate appearing for the c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 party, the said documentary evidence did not produce before the trial court and in absence of the documentary evidence, the impugned judgment was passed by the trial court. he has submitted that there is an ample materials and documentary evidence available on record and even with the appellants which did not produce before the court. he has submitted that as the appellants have made part payment of total outstanding amount and furnished security in a nature that the polished diamonds worth rs.3,05,12,350/through the third party agent namely shri paresh chimediya, the trial court has committed an error in not considering all the aspects. it is further submitted by the learned advocate that the presiding officer of the commercial court has overlooked the materials while passing the summary judgment and even not issued any notice to the appellants with regard to filing of the reply to the application and no proper opportunity has been afforded to the appellants. he has also submitted that the trial court has not followed the ratio laid down by the apex court in the case of bright enterprise private vs. mj bizcraft llp, (2017) scc online del 6394 and, therefore, the summary judgment is not tenable and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside. c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 5.1 mr.desai, learned counsel appearing for the appellants has submitted that the trial court has completely overlooked the provisions of the civil procedure code, while passing the order under exhibit 18. he has orally submitted, in addition to the contention raised in the appeal memo, that no proper opportunity is given to the appellants to produce documents in support of the averments made in the written statement, even no notice was issued to the appellants for summary judgment. he has submitted that along the present appeal, civil application for stay and civil application under order xli rule 27 of the civil procedure code for production of the additional documents is filed as the said documents were not produced before the trial court. he has strongly submitted that as the appellants have already given guarantee in terms that they deposited some polished diamonds through the third party for the purpose of security. 5.2 in support of his submission, mr.desai, learned advocate appearing for the appellants has relied upon the decision of this court (coram: hon'ble mr. justice n. v. anjaria and hon'ble mr. justice sandeep n. bhatt) in the case of murlibhai c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 duhilanomal chhatwani through poa holder anil murlibhai chhatwani vs. mohanbhai duhilanomal chhatwani reported 2022 (1) glh 358 and the decision of the apex court in the case of bright enterprise private vs. mj bizcraft llp, (2017) scc online del 6394 . 6. mr. parth bhatt, learned advocate appearing for the respondent has submitted as under:(1) the respondent original plaintiff preferred commercial civil suit no.144 of 2019 for recovery of money amounting to rs.1,50,01,554.24. (2) that appellants original defendants purchased rough diamonds from the respondent on credit limit of 120 days vide invoices bearing no.re/0016/17-18 dated 08.05.2018 and no.re/ 0035/17-18 dated 01.06.2017. the goods in question were received by the appellants on 13.05.2017 and 06.06.2017 respectively. (3) that appellants have made false averments wherein on one hand, the appellants have denied the very transactions (paragraph 6 of the written statement) and have claimed that c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 the documents produced by the respondent are false and concocted and on the other hand, they admitted their liability of making payment for an amount of usd 4,10,201.25 (rs.2,66,63,081/-). the appellants have themselves admitted the existence of the two invoices by producing a copy of the same. (4) the appellants have made further contrary statement wherein the person, who filed the written statement and accepted the goods, has denied the transaction. (5) in the extract of books of accounts of the appellants, they admitted the claim of the respondent, inasmuch as, the same invoices for which the suit is preferred are reflected in the ledger account of the respondent. moreover, it also indicates that an amount of usd 4,10,201.25 is still outstanding to be paid to the respondent. (6) that, there is no real prospect on the part of the respondent to defend the suit as there is a clear admission on the part of the appellants about the transaction and outstanding amount which is to be paid to the respondent. c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 (7) without prejudice to the aforesaid, the document at page no.8 of the civil application no.1 of 2021 in first appeal no.2371 of 2021 i.e. : swift details of payment of usd 50000 refers to a completely different invoice dated 24.04.2017. (8) that the suit is filed for two invoices bearing no.re/0016/17-18 and re/0035/17-18 dated 08.05.2017 and 01.06.2017 respectively. the present payment details does not pertain to any of the said invoices. therefore, an attempt is made to mislead this court. (9) that the stand taken by the appellants is contradictory which indicates that the payment of usd 50000 is an afterthought, which is raised only with a mala fide intention to mislead this court as it pertains to a different invoice and, therefore, the appellants do not seem to have an iota to resist the claim of the respondent. this clearly proves that the appellants have no prospect of successfully defending the claim. the provisions of order xiiia rule 3(a) having been fulfilled, the impugned judgment deserves to be upheld and there is no reason for this court to remand the matter back as it would be fruitless exercise. c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 (10) it is pertinent to mentioned that along with the written statement, the appellants filed an application under order vii rule 11 of the civil procedure code is being the jurisdiction of the commercial court. the said application came to be rejected vide order dated 28.10.2020 and the same has not been challenged. (11) the application for case management was preferred by the respondent, which was allowed on 17.03.2021 as the appellants failed to file statement of admission / denial in addition to the fact that the written statement filed was not as per the provisions of order viii rule 3a. (12) that the application for summary judgment was filed. no reply was filed by the appellants in approximately 72 days and when the matter was taken up for hearing, the appellants filed an application for adjournment, which came to be rejected and the matter was heard finally. (13) that application at exhibit 20 for summary judgment was duly served upon the appellants and they preferred an application for adjournment after 72 days from receipt of the c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 said application, which came to be rejected and, thereafter, the summary judgment came to be passed in presence of the learned advocate for the appellants. under the circumstances, the contention of the appellants that no proper opportunity was given to them is misleading and on the contrary, an ample opportunity was given and only with an intention to delay the proceedings, the appellants neither produced any documents nor filed any reply within the stipulated time period of 30 days as per order xiii rule 4(3). (14) that the conduct of the appellants in not filing any reply to the application at exhibit 20 and not producing any documents along with their written statement clearly indicates that the appellants had no real defence to the claim of the respondent. therefore, the conduct of the appellants was only to waste the time and to protract the proceedings and even the court granted sufficient time for more than two months to the appellants to file reply, however, they failed to do so. it clearly emerges that the grounds for summary judgment as mentioned in order xiiia rule 3(a) are proved and after hearing the respective parties, the commercial court passed the order. c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 6.1 mr.bhatt, learned advocate has submitted that the commercial court has not committed any error in passing the impugned summary judgment and no interference is called for. he submitted that the appeal being meritless, deserves to be dismissed. 7. on 01.07.2022, this court has passed the following order. \"learned advocate mr. kunal n. shah for the appellants require one more opportunity to allow him to file paresh paladiya's affidavit and to substantiate his version of 3 rd party security. the matter to be posted for hearing on 13.7.2022. the matter to be listed in first 10 matters.\" 8. it appears that at the time of hearing of the appeal, the aforesaid order is passed by this court to the effect that if the learned advocate for the appellants has to file affidavit of third party in support of his contention, then, he may do so. but it seems that the third party is not ready and willing to support the contention and has not filed any affidavit of third party till date. learned advocate for the appellants has requested that the appellants will make the payment of decreetal amount and on c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 deposit of the same, an opportunity to contest the suit on merits can be afforded to the appellants. but it seems that there is no any concrete proposal made on behalf of the appellants and on all counts, the appellants failed to do so. therefore, the appeal being meritless, deserves to be dismissed. 9. it appears that the defendants have preferred application under order vii rule 11 inter alia contending that the court has no jurisdiction as it is a simple suit of recovery, for which the reply was filed by the plaintiff. the application of the defendants came to be dismissed vide order dated 28.10.2020, which was not challenged before the higher forum. the original plaintiff has preferred an application under the provisions of order xiiia for summary judgment at exhibit 20 and the list of documents produced by the plaintiff at exhibit 21 and after considering the relevant facts and averments made in the application and the documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff, the impugned order is passed. 10. the summary judgment under order xiiia of the civil procedure code is broad, by special amendment, the commercial dispute of a specified value wherein applies in its application to c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 any suit in respect of commercial dispute of a specified value. this order sets out the procedure by which courts may decide a claim pertaining to any commercial dispute without recording oral evidence. when the court is satisfied that the defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending their claim, the court pass a decree of summary judgment. 11. it is worthwhile to refer to the provisions of order xiiia of the civil procedure code, which reads as under:1. scope of and classes of suits to which this order applies. (1) this order sets out the procedure by which courts may decide a claim pertaining to any commercial dispute without recording oral evidence. (2) for the purposes of this order, the word \"claim\" shall include (a) part of a claim; (b) any particular question on which the claim (whether in whole or in part) depends; or (c) a counter-claim, as the case may be. (3) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, an application for summary judgment under this order shall not be made in a suit in respect of any commercial dispute that is originally filed as a summary suit under order xxxvii. c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 2. stage for application for summary judgment. an applicant may apply for summary judgment at any time after summons has been served on the defendant: provided that, no application for summary judgment may be made by such applicant after the court has framed the issues in respect of the suit. 3. grounds for summary judgment. the court may give a summary judgment against a plaintiff or defendant on a claim if it considers that (a) the plaintiff has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim or the defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim, as the case may be; and (b) there is no other compelling reason why the claim should not be disposed of before recording of oral evidence. 4. procedure. (1) an application for summary judgment to a court shall, in addition to any other matters the applicant may deem relevant, include the matters set forth in sub-rules (a) to (f) mentioned hereunder: (a) the application must contained a statement that it is an application for summary judgment made under this order; (b) the application must precisely disclose all material facts and identify the point of law, if any; (c) in the event the applicant seeks to rely upon any documentary evidence, the applicant must,-(i) include such documentary evidence in its application, and c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 (ii) identify the relevant content of such documentary evidence on which the applicant relies; (d) the application must state the reason why there are no real prospects of succeeding on the claim or defending the claim, as the case may be; (e) the application must state what relief the applicant is seeking and briefly state the grounds for seeking such relief.

(3) the respondent may, within thirty days of the receipt of notice of application of summary judgment or notice of hearing (whichever is earlier), file a reply addressing the matters set forth in clauses (a) to (f) mentioned hereunder in addition to any other matters that the respondent may deem relevant:-(a) the reply must precisely-(i) disclose all material facts; (ii) identify the point of law, if any; and (iii) state the reasons why the relief sought by the applicant should not be granted; (b) in the event the respondent seeks to rely upon any documentary evidence in its reply, the respondent must-(i) include such documentary evidence in its reply; and (ii) identify the relevant content of such documentary evidence on which the respondent relies; c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 (c) the reply must state the reason why there are real prospects of succeeding on the claim or defending the claim, as the case may be; (d) the reply must concisely state the issues that should be framed for trial; (e) the reply must identify what further evidence shall be brought on record at trial that could not be brought on record at the stage of summary judgment; and (f) the reply must state why, in light of the evidence or material on record if any, the court should not proceed to summary judgment. 5. evidence for hearing of summary judgment. --(1) notwithstanding anything in this order, if the respondent in an application for summary judgment wishes to rely on additional documentary evidence during the hearing, the respondent must:-(a) file such documentary evidence; and (b) serve copies of such documentary evidence on every other party to the application at least fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing. (2) notwithstanding anything in this order, if the applicant for summary judgment wishes to rely on documentary evidence in reply to the defendant's documentary evidence, the applicant must:-(a) file such documentary evidence in reply; and (b) serve a copy of such documentary evidence on the respondent at least five days prior to the date of the hearing. c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 (3) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, sub-rules (1) and (2) shall not require documentary evidence to be:-(a) filed if such documentary evidence has already been filed; or (b) served on a party on whom it has already been served. 6. orders that may be made by court. -(1) on an application made under this order, the court may make such orders that it may deem fit in its discretion including the following:-(a) judgment on the claim; (b) conditional order in accordance with rule 7 mentioned hereunder; (c) dismissing the application; (d) dismissing part of the claim and a judgment on part of the claim that is not dismissed; (e) striking out the pleadings (whether in whole or in part); or (f) further directions to proceed for case management under order xv-a. (2) where the court makes any of the orders as set forth in sub-rule (1) (a) to (f), the court shall record its reasons for making such order. 12. it would be profitably required to make reference of the decision of madras high court in the case of syrma technology private limited vs. powerwave technologies sweden ad, 2020 scc online mad 5737. c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 12.1 it would be relevant to refer to the observations made in paragraphs no.20, 21, 36, 37, 48 and 49 of the said decision, which are reproduced hereinafter. 20. thus, to conclude, we are of the view that when an application is filed under order xiii-a, a court is expected to keep in mind the provisions contained in order xiii-a rules 6 and 7 before considering a summary judgment under order xiii-a rule 3. we are conscious that order xiiia rule 6 also speaks of a judgment on the claim both part or full. order xiii-a rule 7 read with other modes mentioned under order xiii-a rule 6 act as contraceptive to grant of summary judgment under order xiii-a rule 3. 21. we have already discussed the scope and ambit of order xiii-a. thus, we do not wish to repeat it except by holding that there is a remarkable difference in the word appears as mentioned under order xiii-a rules 7 and 3, which uses the words 'considers'. further more, the order xiii-a rule 6 gives discretion to the court. therefore, looking from any perspective, it is not necessary that the court will have to decide only two issues on an application filed under order xiii-a viz.,to allow it or dismiss it, while we hold that at the time of considering the application the court can go into the merits of the case, which is exactly the object of the provision. however, the court has to keep in mind the import of order xiii-a rule 6. it has to necessarily record a finding that it is proceeding under order xiii-a rule 3 instead of exercising its discretion otherwise provided under order xiii-a rule 6. thus such a discretion when exercised has to be in tune with order xiiic/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 a rule 6. while exercising such a power, it appears to the court that it would come under the purview of order xiii-a rule 7, it should pass a conditional order. however, if it considers that an applicant has got no real prospect of succeeding and there is no other compelling reason, then it can proceed to give a summary judgment. 36. from the aforesaid judgments the parliamentary intention is clearly seen in facilitating a quicker decision through the process. as discussed above, we have to read the entire provision contained in order xiii-a as a whole. if the court comes to the conclusion that the evidence is moonshine or smokescreen and it considers that order xiiia rule 3 has been complied, then it can deliver a summary judgment on merit. 37. the question as to whether the case is complicated or not is not the concern of the court especially in deciding an application filed invoking order xiii-a of the cpc. obviously, the respondent in the application has to produce his best evidence, which would be his \"lead trump\" as he would stand the chance of losing his case. 48. from the submissions made and after going through the relevant records, the judgments produced and on perusing the judgments and appeal, we feel that it appears that there is a possibility of the defendant becoming successful though it is improbable that it shall do so. hence, the case on hand would come under order xiii-a rule 7 warranting a conditional order. we may note that the learned single judge has not considered this aspect. c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 49. we further find that there are triable issues in the suit. the first respondent itself earlier filed only an application seeking a direction to furnish security. this was filed on 04.01.2017. only thereafter, application in o.a.no.7113 of 2018 in c.s.no.851 of 2015 has been filed on 24.07.2018 after 1 1⁄2 years. factually there is a deviation from the purchase order with respect to the place of supply made. therefore, even on that ground, it would be the case, which would come under order xiii-a rule 7. in such view of the matter, while setting aside the judgment and decree of the commercial division, there shall be a conditional order that the appellant shall deposit a sum of rs.2.8 crores (rupees two crores and eighty lakhs only) to the credit of the suit in c.s.no.851 of 2015 in the name of the registrar general, high court, madras-600 104, in an interest bearing deposit within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. we may request the learned single judge to consider by issuing further directions to proceed for case management under order xv-a. accordingly, the judgment and decree of the commercial division stands set aside and the original side appeal stands allowed in part. consequently, connected civil miscellaneous petition is closed. we make it clear that in the event of non compliance of the order aforesaid, the judgment and decree of the learned single judge would get restored. 13. it would be profitably required to make reference of the decision of the delhi high court in the case of su-kam power systems ltd vs. kunwer sachdev and another, 2019 scc online del. 10764. c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 13.1 it would be relevant to refer to the observations made in paragraphs no.39, 40, 41, 44, 49, 50, 90 and 91 of the said decision, which are reproduced hereinafter. 39. the commercial courts act, 2015 has been enacted with the intent to improve efficiency and reduce delay in disposal of commercial cases. the relevant portion of the statement of objects and reasons of the commercial courts act, 2015 is reproduced hereinbelow:\"to have a streamlined procedure which is to be adopted for the conduct of cases in the commercial courts and in the commercial divisions by amending the code of civil procedure 1908, so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. the proposed case management system and provisions for summary judgment will enable disposal of commercial disputes in a time bound manner.\" (emphasis supplied) 40. amended order xiiia of cpc, as applicable to commercial disputes, enables the court to decide a claim or part thereof without recording oral evidence. order xiiia of cpc seeks to avoid the long drawn process of leading oral evidence in certain eventualities. consequently, the said provision enables disposal of commercial disputes in a time bound manner and promotes the object of the commercial courts act, 2015. 41. rule 3 of order xiii-a of cpc empowers the court to grant a summary judgment against a defendant where on c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 an application filed in that regard, the court considers that the defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending a claim, and there is no other compelling reason why the claim should not be disposed of before recording of oral evidence. order xiiia (3) of cpc, as applicable to commercial disputes, is reproduced hereinbelow:\"3. grounds for summary judgment.--the court may give a summary judgment against a plaintiff or defendant on a claim if it considers that(a) the plaintiff has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim or the defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim, as the case may be; and (b) there is no other compelling reason why the claim should not be disposed of before recording of oral evidence.\" (emphasis supplied) 44. while deciding the test for summary judgment under rule 24.2, house of lords in three rivers district council and others vs. governor and company of the bank of england [2003] 2 a.c. 1, reiterated the observation in swain v hillman [2001] 1 all er 91 that the word 'real' distinguishes 'fanciful' prospects of success and it directs the court to examine whether there is a 'realistic' as opposed to a 'fanciful' prospect of success. the house of lords in three rivers district council (supra) also held that the court while considering the words 'no real prospect' should look to see what will happen at the trial and that if the case is so weak that it has no reasonable prospect of success, it should be stopped before great expenses are incurred. the relevant portion of the three rivers district council (supra) judgment is reproduced hereinebelow:c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 \"[90] the test which clarke j applied, when he was considering whether the claim should be struck out under rsc ord 18, r 19, was whether it was bound to fail: see p 171 of the third judgment. mr stadlen submitted that the court had a wider power to dispose summarily of issues under cpr part 24 than it did under rsc ord 18, r 19, and that critical issue was now whether, in terms of cpr rule 24.2(a)(i), the claimants had a real prospect of succeeding on the claim. as to what these words mean, in swain v hillman [2001] 1 all er 91, 92, lord woolf mr said: \"under r 24.2, the court now has a very salutary power, both to be exercised in a claimant's favour or, where appropriate, in a defendant's favour. it enables the court to dispose summarily of both claims or defences which have no real prospect of being successful. the words 'no real prospect of being successful or succeeding' do not need any amplification, they speak for themselves. the word 'real' distinguishes fanciful prospects of success or, as mr bidder qc submits, they direct the court to the need to see whether there is a 'realistic' as opposed to a 'fanciful' prospect of success.\" [91] the difference between a test which asks the question \"is the claim bound to fail?\" and one which asks \"does the claim have a real prospect of success?\" is not easy to determine. in swain v hillman , at p 4, lord woolf explained that the reason for the contrast in language between rule 3.4 and rule 24.2 is that under rule 3.4, unlike rule 24.2, the court generally is only concerned with the statement of case which it is alleged discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim. in monsanto plc v tilly the times, 30 november 1999; court c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 of appeal (civil division) transcript no 1924 of 1999; stuart smith lj said that rule 24.2 gives somewhat wider scope for dismissing an action or defence. in taylor v midland bank trust co ltd 21 july 1999 he said that, particularly in the light of the cpr, the court should look to see what will happen at the trial and that, if the case is so weak that it had no reasonable prospect of success, it should be stopped before great expense is incurred. [92] the overriding objective of the cpr is to enable the court to deal with cases justly: rule 1.1. to adopt the language of article 6(1) of the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms with which this aim is consistent, the court must ensure that there is a fair trial. it must seek to give effect to the overriding objective when it exercises any power given to it by the rules or interprets any rule: rule 1.2. while the difference between the two tests is elusive, in many cases the practical effect will be the same. in more difficult and complex cases such as this one, attention to the overriding objective of dealing with the case justly is likely to be more important than a search for the precise meaning of the rule. as may lj said in purdy v cambran (unreported) 17 december 1999: court of appeal (civil division) transcript no 2290 of 1999: \"the court has to seek to give effect to the overriding objective when it exercises any powers given to it by the rules. this applies to applications to strike out a claim. when the court is considering, in a case to be decided under the civil procedure rules, whether or not it is just in accordance with the overriding objective to strike out a claim, it is not necessary to analyse that question by c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 reference to the rigid and overloaded structure which a large body of decisions under the former rules had constructed.\" [93] in swain v hillman lord woolf mr gave this further guidance: \"it is important that a judge in appropriate cases should make use of the powers contained in part 24. in doing so he or she gives effect to the overriding objectives contained in part 1. it saves expense; it achieves expedition; it avoids the court's resources being used up on cases where this serves no purpose, and, i would add, generally, that it is in the interests of justice. if a claimant has a case which is bound to fail, then it is in the claimant's interests to know as soon as possible that that is the position. likewise, if a claim is bound to succeed, a claimant should know this as soon as possible . useful though the power is under part 24, it is important that it is kept to its proper role. it is not meant to dispense with the need for a trial where there are issues which should be investigated at the trial. as mr bidder put it in his submissions, the proper disposal of an issue under part 24 does not involve the judge conducting a mini trial, that is not the object of the provisions; it is to enable cases, where there is no real prospect of success either way, to be disposed of summarily.\" (see [2001] 1 all er 91 at 9495.) (emphasis supplied) 49. consequently, this court is of the view that when a summary judgment application allows the court to find the necessary facts and resolve the dispute, proceeding to trial would generally not be proportionate, timely or cost effective. it bears reiteration that the standard for fairness c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 is not whether the procedure is as exhaustive as a trial, but whether it gives the court the confidence that it can find the necessary facts and apply the relevant legal principles so as to resolve the dispute as held in robert hryniak (supra). 50. in fact, the legislative intent behind introducing summary judgment under order xiiia of cpc is to provide a remedy independent, separate and distinct from judgment on admissions and summary judgment under order xxxvii of cpc. 90. to reiterate, the intent behind incorporating the summary judgment procedure in the commercial court act, 2015 is to ensure disposal of commercial disputes in a time-bound manner. in fact, the applicability of order xiiia, cpc to commercial disputes, demonstrates that the trial is no longer the default procedure/norm. 91. rule 3 of order xiiia, cpc, as applicable to commercial disputes, empowers the court to grant a summary judgement against the defendant where the court considers that the defendant has no real prospects of successfully defending the claim and there is no other compelling reason why the claim should not be disposed of before recording of oral evidence. the expression \"real\" directs the court to examine whether there is a \"realistic\" as opposed to \"fanciful\" prospects of success. this court is of the view that the expression \"no genuine issue requiring a trial\" in ontario rules of civil procedure and \"no other compelling reason.for trial\" in commercial courts act can be read mutatis mutandis. consequently, order xiiia, cpc would be attracted if the court, while hearing such an c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 application, can make the necessary finding of fact, apply the law to the facts and the same is a proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive means of achieving a fair and just result. 14. in the case of bright enterprises private limited (supra), the high court of delhi has observed in paragraphs no.3, 7, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23 as under:3. the appellants/plaintiffs had filed the said suit as a commercial suit because the damages claimed by them were to the extent of rs 1 crore which satisfied the definition of \"specified value' as contained in section 2(1) (i) of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \"the commercial courts act'). the plaint contained the following prayers:\"(i) decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendants, its directors, partners or proprietors as the case may be, its assigns in business, franchisees, store owners, licencees, distributors, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents from using for any or all business activities the infringing trade mark priveb, or any other trade mark or logo/device, which is identical to and/or deceptively similar to the plaintiffs' trade marks mbd prive and prive or incorporates the words \"prive\", or any other trade mark or logo/device, which is identical to and/or deceptively similar to the abovementioned plaintiffs trade marks, amounting to infringement of the plaintiffs trade mark under section 29 the trade marks act; c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 (ii) decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendants, its directors, partners or proprietors as the case may be, its assigns in business, franchisees, store owners, licencees, distributors, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents from using for any or all business activities the infringing trade mark privee, or any other trade mark or logo/device, which is identical to and/or deceptively similar to the plaintiffs' trade marks mbd prive and prive or incorporates the words \"prive\", or any other trade mark or logo/device, which is identical to and/or deceptively similar to the abovementioned plaintiffs trade marks, amounting to passing off of the goods/products of the defendants for those of the plaintiffs; (iii) decree for delivery up of all the goods, stationery, hoardings, boards, printed material, dies, blocks, etc., bearing infringing trade marks privee to an authorised representative of the plaintiffs for destruction. (iv) order for rendition of accounts of profit illegally earned by the defendants and a decree for the amount so found due, or in the alternate, a decree for damages of at least rs. 1,00,00,000/may be passed in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant. (v) an order for costs in the proceedings. (vi) any further order as this hon'ble court deems fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of this case.\" 7. the provisions of order xva of the cpc and particularly rule 6(1)(a) thereof is also relevant and the same reads as under:c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 \"6. powers of the court in a case management hearing. (1) in case management hearing held under this order, the court shall have the power to (a) prior to the framing of issues, hear and decide any pending application filed by the parties under order xiiia; xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx\" 15. section 27 cpc deals with the issuance of summons to defendants. it stipulates that where a suit has been 'duly instituted', a summons may be issued to the defendant to appear and answer the claim and may be served in the manner prescribed etc. section 33 of the cpc stipulates that the court, after the case has been heard, shall pronounce judgment, and on such judgment a decree shall follow. 16. order v rule 1 cpc stipulates that when a suit has been 'duly instituted', a summons 'may' be issued to the defendant to appear and answer the claim and to file the written statement of his defence etc. it is clear that the provisions of order v rule 1(1) reflect the substantive provision contained in section 27 cpc. 17. from the above and particularly upon examining the provisions of section 27 order v rule 1(1) cpc, it is evident that when a suit is regarded as having been \"duly instituted', a summons may be issued to the defendant. the use of the expression \"duly instituted' has to be seen in the context of the provisions of orders vi and vii of the cpc. in the present matter, it is nobody's case that the suit had not been duly instituted in the sense that it did not comply with the requirements of order vi and vii cpc. it is c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 neither a case of return of a plaint under order vii rule 10 nor a case of rejection of a plaint under order vii rule 11 cpc. the present case is one of dismissal of the suit itself on merits. therefore, the only thing that needs to be examined is whether the court had a discretion to issue or not to issue summons given that the suit had been duly instituted. in our view, the use of the word 'may' does not give discretion to the court and does not make it optional for it to issue summons or not. this is further fortified by the fact that the first proviso to order v rule 1(1) itself gives a situation where summons must not be issued and that happens when a defendant appears at the presentation of the plaint and admits the plaintiff's claim. therefore, in such a situation, there is no requirement for issuance of summons and that is why the word 'may' has been used in order v rule 1(1). in all other cases, when a suit has been 'duly instituted' and is not hit by either order vii rule 10 or order vii rule 11 cpc, summons has to be issued to the defendant. 21. the provisions relating to summary judgment which enables courts to decide claims pertaining to commercial disputes without recording oral evidence are exceptional in nature and out of the ordinary course which a normal suit has to follow. in such an eventuality, it is essential that the stipulations are followed scrupulously otherwise it may result in gross injustice. as pointed out above, a specific period of time has been provided during which an application for summary judgment can be made. that period begins upon the service of summons on the defendant and ends upon the court framing issues in the suit. even if we were to accept, which we do not, the argument of the respondents that the court had suo moto c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 powers to deliver summary judgment without there being any application, those powers also would have to be exercised during this window, that is, after service of summons on the defendant and prior to framing of issues. in addition to this, we also reiterate that, in our view, a summary judgment under order xiiia cpc is not permissible without there being an appropriate application for summary judgment. the contents of an application for summary judgment are also stipulated in rule 4 of order xiiia. the application is required to precisely disclose all material facts and identify the point of law, if any. in the event, the applicant seeks to rely on any documentary evidence, the applicant must include such documentary evidence in its application and identify the relevant content of such documentary evidence on which the applicant relies. the application must also state the reason why there are no real prospects of succeeding or defending the claim, as the case may be. 22. rule 4(2) of order xiiia also requires that where a hearing for summary judgment is fixed, the respondent must be given at least thirty days' notice of the date fixed for the hearing and the claim that is proposed to be decided by the court at such hearing. rule 4(3) of order xiiia makes provision which enables the respondents to file a reply within the stipulated time addressing the matters set forth in clauses (a) to (f) of the said sub-rule. in particular, the reply of the respondent ought to precisely disclose all the material facts and identify the point of law, if any, and the reasons why the relief sought by the applicant for summary judgment should not be granted. just as in the case of the applicant, the respondent is also given the opportunity to rely upon documentary evidence c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 in its reply which must be included in the reply and the relevant content identified. the respondent's reply is also required to give reason as to why there are real prospects of succeeding on the claim or defending the claim, as the case may be. importantly, the reply must also concisely state the issues that should be framed for trial and that it must identify what further evidence would be brought on record at trial that could not be brought on record at the stage of summary judgment. the reply should also state as to why in the light of the evidence or material on record, if any, the court should not proceed to summary judgment. 23. from the provisions laid out in order xiiia, it is evident that the proceedings before court are adversarial in nature and not inquisitorial. it follows, therefore, that summary judgment under order xiiia cannot be rendered in the absence of an adversary and merely upon the inquisition by the court. the court is never an adversary in a dispute between parties. unfortunately, the learned single judge has not considered the provisions of order xiiia cpc in this light. 15. we have perused the materials available on record and gone through the paper-book, so also the decisions cited at the bar. we have also gone through the impugned summary judgment passed by the commercial court. 16. the commercial court has observed in paragraphs no.8 to 13 as under:c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 8. as defendants neither filed their pleadings in proper form as prescribed in order 8 rule 5 nor verified their pleadings as per the provisions of order 6 rule 15a. defendants filed bare denial without stating that for what reason plaintiff filed the suit against them without having any connection with them. 9. plaintiff filed enough documentary evidence to show its transaction with defendants. defendants are silent on the specific denial with the provisions of the law and even defendants are filed to deny the documents filed by the plaintiff with the suit. the provision of summary judgment is necessary to note here. order 13a rule 3. grounds for summary judgment. the court may give a summary judgment against a plaintiff or defendant on a claim if it considers that the defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim and (b) there is no other compelling reason why the claim should not be disposed of before recording of oral evidence. 10. in case on hand, it is cleared that defendants have no real prospect of successfully defending the claim and there is no other compelling reason why the claim should not be disposed of before recording of oral evidence. 11. plaintiff demanded the interest @ 18% without production of any agreement. as per the definition of contract given under the contract act, section 2(e) every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement; and section 2(h) an agreement enforceable by law is a contract. the agreement having contractual liability is defined under section 10 of the act. section 10 says c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 that what agreements are contracts. all agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void. nothing herein contained shall affect any law in force in [india] and not hereby expressly repealed by which any contract is required to be made in [writing] or in the presence of witnesses, or any law relating to the registration of documents. 12. in case on hand, there is no written contract for the interest but as the transaction was business transaction, hence, interest may be allowed as per the provision of section 34 of the code of civil procedure. 13. as per the provision of order 15 rule 3 this court is opine that plaintiff's suit is the proper case for allowing summary judgment as defendants have no real prospect of successfully defending the claim and there is no other compelling reason for recording of oral evidence. recently, hon'ble supreme court in case: rahul s. shah vs. jinendra kumar gandhi [ca 1659-1660 of 2021] coram: cji sa bobde, justices l. nageswara rao, s. ravindra bhat counsel: adv. shailesh madiyal, adv paras jain citation: ll 2021 sc 230, passed some directions for the execution of the decree. it is held that \"6. in a money suit, the court must invariably resort to order xxi rule 11, ensuring immediate execution of decree for payment of money on oral application.\" thus, if plaintiff wishes for the immediate of execution of the decree, he, may applied for the execution of decree as per the provisions of order xxi rule 11 of the code of civil procedure and on his application the court may issue warrant as per the c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 provisions of order xxi rule 11(1). the provision is run as \"(1) where a decree is for the payment of money the court may, on the oral application of the decree holder at the time of the passing of the decree, order immediate execution thereof by the arrest of the judgment debtor, prior to the preparation of a warrant if he is within the precincts of the court.\" 17. in case on hand, it is cleared that defendants have no real prospect of successfully defending the claim and there is no other compelling reason why the claim should not be disposed of before recording of oral evidence. in view of the above facts and circumstances, we find that the commercial court has given proper reason in passing the impugned summary judgment. we also find that the commercial court has given sufficient opportunity to the appellants to defend their case, but they failed to do so. we are in complete agreement with conclusion arrived at by the court and hence, we find no reasons to interfere with the same. 18. being fully conscious that these provisions relating to summary judgment are enabling provisions with immense responsibilities for expediting the commercial disputes, at the same times, the culmination into the judgment without recording c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 the evidence shall need to be resorted to in exceptional cases and ordinary course is not given to be a go bye. however, the stipulations as needed to be followed and need to be adhere to with precision so as not to cause injustice and multiply the litigation, we had chosen to examine this matter from that angle. 19. here rule 4(2) of order xiiia requires giving of 30 days of notice for hearing, the reply under rule 4(3) is also needed to be filed on an application tendered for this purpose. the defendants need to disclose all material aspects and also the point of law. it is also required of the defendant to rely upon the documentary evidences in his reply which should indicate the reasons for succeeding in the claim or defending the claim. the issues eventually for trial which need to be carved out shall also be absolutely clear. there may also be a need for specifying further evidence for the court to be convinced us as to why the summary judgment is not desirable. order xiiia if is looked at merely because the court chooses to follow this without permitting the otherside to respond to the same, would not allow such provision to operate in essence. c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 20. in the instant case, we could notice tendering of an application, the time of not only 30 days had been given, it is close to 72 days which had been availed to the other side. the defendants have chosen not to state anything except the bear denial. the documents particularly both the invoices which have been relied upon by the plaintiff for its claim and notably reflected in the account of the defendants, have also not been denied. there is no manner in which it is pointed out as to how any further evidence is going to be an impediment in the plaintiff succeeding in the claim. in fact, further evidence before this court also was permitted to be brought on record and the defendant has chosen not to avail that opportunity as well. with a specific mention of the amount of both the invoices in the account of the defendant and when these two invoices formulate the sole claim of plaintiff respondent herein, allowing of the same, by way of judgment, on the trial court following due procedure as also grant of interest as per the provisions of rule 34 of the civil procedure code would warrant no interference. 21. in the result, the appeal shall stand dismissed. there shall be no order as to costs. c/fa/2371/2021 judgment dated: 02/08/2022 22. in view of the disposal of the main appeal, all pending civil applications shall stand disposed of.
