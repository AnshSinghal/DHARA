(Oral) \n1. The appellant has filed the present appeal impugning an order dated 15.11.2022 passed by the learned Commercial Court under Order Vii Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereafter 'Cpc').\n2. The appellant / plaintiff had filed the aforesaid suit inter alia praying for a decree for a sum of 1,66,60,555/- (Rupees One Crore Sixty Six Lakhs Sixty Thousand Five Hundred Fifty Five only) along with the interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the month of July 29, 2016, to the date of institution of the suit. The plaint was filed on 01.03.2019. \n3. Although, the appellant had prayed for pre-suit interest; it did not quantify for the same. In addition, the appellant has also Neutral Citation Number is 2023/Dhc/001409 per annum on the principal amount claimed (that is, 1,66,60,555/- plus interest at the rate of 18% per annum from 29.07.2016 to 01.03.2019). \n4. Respondent No. 1 (Defendant No. 1) in the suit is a firm constituted by defendant No. 2 and 3 (respondent No. 2 and 3 in the present appeal). The office of respondent No. 1 firm, falls within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court at Dwarka. The address of respondent No. 3 also falls within the said district. \n5. This Court is informed that respondent No. 2's address, that is, Ashok Nagar, New Delhi - 110018 falls within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court (West) at Tis Hazari Court Complex. \n6. It is the appellant's case that he had erroneously filed a suit in the District Court, Shahadara, on the assumption that the residence of respondent No. 2 (that is, Ashok Nagar) was located within the territorial jurisdiction of the said court. The appellant claims that the mistake was bona fide as there is a colony known as Ashok Nagar with the Pin Code 110093, which falls within the territorial jurisdiction of the Shahadara District Court. Although the colony where respondent no.2 resides is also known as Ashok Nagar, the pin code of that colony is 110018.\n7. Defendant No. 3 (respondent No. 3) had filed a written statement raising the objection regarding the territorial jurisdiction of the learned Commercial Court. \n8. The appellant contends that on realising the mistake, the appellant had filed an application seeking return of plaint for being presented before the court of competent jurisdiction. \n9. During the course of the proceedings, the learned Commercial Court observed that the appellant had not included Neutral Citation Number is 2023/Dhc/001409 22.04.2019 in the value of the suit and had not paid the requisite court fees on that amount. The learned Commercial Court had held that if the value of the suit was correctly computed, it would exceed its pecuniary jurisdiction. \n10. The appellant had contested the aforesaid proposition by claiming that it is not required to include the value of interest in the value of the suit or pay any court fees on the same; it claimed that it would be required to pay the same after the decree was passed. \n11. The learned Commercial Court rejected the said contention and found that the appellant / plaintiff had under-valued the suit by approximately 75 lakhs and held that owing to the said conduct, it would not be entitled to an interest on the principal amount with effect from 22.04.2019 till the date of the impugned order, that is, till 15.11.2022. Nonetheless, the learned Commercial Court also directed the appellant/plaintiff to  comply with Order VII Rule 2 of the CPC and seek amendments to the suit for including the specific amount of interest as claimed (that is, interest on 1.66 Crores for the period 29.07.2016 to 22.04.2019) and pay the necessary deficient court fees within the period of ten days. \n12. In addition to the above, the learned Commercial Court also observed that the conduct of the appellant in undervaluing the suit is \"nothing short of a scandalous conduct which exposes it to be penalized with exemplary cost as per Amended Section 35 of CPC as applicable to Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as also Section 35 B CPC.\" \n13. In view of the above, the learned Commercial Court directed the appellant to deposit cost of 5 lakhs with Shahadara Neutral Citation Number is 2023/DHC/001409 (respondent No. 3 herein). \n14. In so far as, the valuation of the suit is concerned, the learned counsel for the appellant submits that he has since complied with the said order and paid the deficient court fees. The plaint has, accordingly, been returned to be presented to the appropriate Court of competent jurisdiction. \nReasons and Conclusion 15. We find no infirmity with the impugned order to the extent that the learned Commercial Court holds that the court fees had been incorrectly calculated. \n16. Having stated the above, we are unable to concur with the conclusion that the appellant's conduct warrants imposition of exemplary costs and disentitles it to claim interest for the period up to the impugned order. We find that the aforesaid conclusion is not justified. \n17. First of all, defendant No. 1 and 2 (respondent No. 1 and 2) had not entered appearance before the learned Commercial Court. Respondent no. 3(Defendant No. 3) had entered appearance and had also filed his Written Statement. However, he had not objected to the monetary value of the suit or the pecuniary jurisdiction of the learned Commercial Court. His objection to the jurisdiction of the learned Commercial Court was confined to the territorial jurisdiction of the court on the ground that neither the residence nor the place of business of any of the defendants fell within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. According to respondent no. 3, the suit was required to be filed before the Dwarka District Court. \n18. Secondly, the learned Commercial Court proceeded on the Neutral Citation Number is 2023/DHC/001409 from the observations to the effect that any party which approaches the court with unclean hands or is found to be misusing the judicial system and thereby burdening the courts with frivolous litigations, is required to be penalised. However, there is no material to even remotely suggest that the plaint filed is frivolous or that the appellant had deliberately misused the judicial system. \n19. The learned Commercial Court has mechanically reproduced passages from the decisions in S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (Dead) by LRs Vs. Jaganath (Dead) LRs and ors. :\n(1994) 1 SCC 1; C.B. Aggarwal Vs. P. Krishna Kapoor : AIR 1995 Delhi 154; Goyal MG Gases Pvt. Ltd. Vs. AIR Liquide Deutschland Gmbh & Ors. : 138(2007) DLT 62; Salem Advocate Bar Association Vs. Union of India : (2005) 6 SCC 344; State of Karnataka Vs. All India Manufacturers Organisation : (2006) 4 SCC 683; Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund Vs. Kartick Das : (1994) 4 SCC 225; Indian Steel & Wire Products Vs. B.I.F.R. (DB) : 2004 (110) DLT 186; Jagmal Singh Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation : 1995 (59) DLT 604;\nChandra Shashi v. Anil Kumar Verma : (1995) 1 SCC 421; Mumbai International Airport Pvt. Ltd. vs. Golden Chariot Airport and Anr. : (2010) 10 SCC 422; Vinod Seth Vs. Devinder Bajaj : (2010) 8 SCC 1; Khatri Hotels Private Ltd. Vs. Union of India : (2011) 9 SCC 126; Kishore Samrite Vs. The State of UP, (2013) 2 SCC 398; and Ramrameshwari Devi & Ors. Vs. Nirmala Devi & Ors. : (2011) 8 SCC 249.\n20 . We do not find that any of the aforesaid decisions referred to by the learned Commercial Court has any relevance to the facts of this case. Merely, citing passages from judgments, which Neutral Citation Number is 2023/DHC/001409 making process. Mechanically quoting passages from judgments, apart from burdening the size of the judgment, does not assist in rendering an informed decision. \n21. The directions to pay exemplary costs and further to peremptorily direct that the appellant would not be entitled to an interest on the principal amount by way of a punitive measure, are clearly unjustified and unwarranted. \n22. As noted above, the appellant had explained the error that led it to file a suit before the learned Commercial Court, Shahadara District. The appellant had also filed an application seeking return of the plaint that was pending at the material time. \n23. In view of the above, the impugned order, to the extent that it directs payment of costs to respondent no. 3 as well as to the Shahadara Bar Association, is set aside. The direction that the appellant would not be entitled to an interest on the principal amount is also set aside. \n24. The impugned order is set aside to the aforesaid extent. \n25. The appeal is partly allowed in the aforesaid terms. \nVIBHU BAKHRU, J AMIT MAHAJAN, J FEBRUARY 21, 2023 'KDK'",

c/fa/2902/2016 judgment maintainable before the commercial court. considering the various proceedings / litigations initiated by the plaintiffs and against the plaintiffs and considering the fact that reliefs sought in the present suit were sought by the plaintiffs before the bombay high court in writ petition no. 770 of 2013, the learned judge has observed that present suit is nothing but a frivolous and vexation and by impugned order, the learned commercial court has dismissed the said suit with exemplary cost quantified at rs. 50,000/­. 2.2. feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court in dismissing suit for exemplary cost, the original plaintiffs have preferred present first appeal. 3.0. shri godiwala, learned advocate for the original plaintiffs has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned commercial court has material erred in dismissing the suit that too with exemplary cost of rs.

it is submitted that it might be true that against the some of the defendants, said suit ought not to have filed. it is submitted that however when the plaintiffs prayed for damages against the illegal acts of the defendant nos. 1 and 2 and because of illegal act on the part of the defendant nos. 1 and 2 and plaintiffs suffered damages, the learned commercial court ought not to have dismissed the said suit. 3.2. it is submitted that merely because the plaintiffs have initiated some proceedings / litigations before the appropriate court / hc-nic page 4 of 9 created on sat aug 12

making above submissions, it is requested to allow the present first appeal. 4.0. having heard the learned counsel for the appellants­ original plaintiffs and considering the averments in the plaint as well as relief sought in the plaint and various litigations initiated by the plaintiffs before the other courts including bombay high court and the proceedings initiated against the plaintiffs by defendants no. 1 and 2 for recovery of huge sum of rs. 47,25,03,203/­, we are of the opinion that learned commercial court has rightly dismissed the suit as not maintainable as well as on the ground that same is frivolous and vexatious. it is required to be noted that in exercise of powers conferred with defendants no. 1 and 2, the defendant nos.1 and 2 have taken steps against the plaintiffs under the provision of sarfaesi act as well as drt act. therefore, for any action taken under the provisions of sarfaesi act and drt act, the civil suit is barred. it is also required to be noted that with respect to the damages sought / prayed in the suit against the defendants no. 1 and 2 and others the very relief was sought by the plaintiffs before the bombay high court in writ petition no. 770 of 2013. for the similar relief and cause of action, present suit has been preferred before the commercial court, vadodara, which is rightly held to be frivolous and vexatious. 5.0. the learned commercial court has taken note of various litigations initiated by the plaintiffs as well as initiated against the plaintiffs. therefore, having been satisfied that for some of the reliefs, more particularly, in regard to prayer (b) and (c) , civil court / hc-nic page 5 of 9 created on sat aug 12 13:19:44 ist 2017 c/fa/2902/2016 judgment commercial court has no jurisdiction and for rest of the reliefs, it is found that the suit is vexatious and frivolous, it cannot be said that learned commercial court has committed any error. under order vii rule 11 of the code of civil procedure, it is the duty cast upon the court to stop such frivolous litigations at the threshold. 5.1. the learned commercial court has taken note of various litigations initiated by the plaintiffs as well as against the plaintiffs, which are as under: a. litigation initiated by the plaintiffs: i.criminal complaint filed by mr. parasmal kanugo, as authorised officer 9 of plaintiff no. 1 in the court of

no. 1 company dismissed on 29.09.2015. 5.2. that thereafter, in para 8, learned commercial court has observed as under: 8. the some of aforesaid litigations have been initiated by the plaintiffs on the similar facts against the defendants herein for the similar reliefs. the nature of litigations initiated by the plaintiffs clearly transpire that the plaintiffs left no stone unturned to obstruct the recovery of the public money. the plaintiff company has also gone ahead to stall the proceedings of recovery against it by initiating the hc-nic page 7 of 9 created on sat aug 12 13:19:44 ist 2017

scores. the parties cannot be permitted to occupy each and every forum / court available to them to get settled their personal scores in the guise of sharp and clever pleadings. the court cannot be taken as granted for entertaining the multifarious proceedings. now the time has come when such type of vexatious and frivolous litigation must be stopped at the threshold of the court. such type of vexatious and frivolous cannot be permitted to occupy the dockets of the court, therefore, present suit is deserve to be dismissed at the threshold with the exemplary costs of rs.50,000/­ (rupees fifty thousand only) and accordingly, i pass the following orders. o r d e r the present suit is dismissed with the exemplary costs of rs.50,000/­ (rupees fifty thousand only) to be deposited in district legal services authority within 7 days from the date of this order. 6.0. at this stage, decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of t. arivandandam vs. t.v. satyapal reported in (1977) 4 scc 467 is required to be referred to. in the case of t. arivandandam (supra), the hon'ble supreme court has observed that if in a meaningful not formal and reading of the plaint it is manifestly vexatious and meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, the learned trial court should exercise its power under order vii rule 11 of the cpc, taking care to see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. it is further observed that if cleaver drafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, nip it in the bud at the first hearing by examining the party searchingly under order x cpc. it is further observed that an activist judge is the answer to irresponsible law suits. while considering the duty of the counsel, the hon'ble supreme court has observed in para 7 as under: \"7. we regret the infliction of the ordeal upon the learned judge of the high court by a callous party. we more than regret the circumstances that the party concerned has been able to prevail upon one lawyer or the other to present to the hc-nic page 8 of 9 created on sat aug 12 13:19:44 ist 2017 c/fa/2902/2016 judgment court a case which was disingenuous or wrose. it may be a valuable contribution to the cause of justice if counsel screen wholly fradulent and frivolous litigation refusing to be beugiled by dubious clients. and remembering that an advoate is an officer of justice he owes it to society not to collaborate in shady actions. the bar council of india, we hope will activate this obligation. we are constrained to make these observations and hope that co­operation of the bar will be readily forthcoming to the bench for spending judicial time on worthwhile disputes and avoiding the distraction of sham litigation such as the one we are disposing of. another moral of this unrighteous chain litigation is the gullible grant of ex­ parte orders tempts gamblers in litigation into easy courts. a judge who succumbs to ex parte pressure in unmerited cases helps devalu the judicial process. we must appreciate shri ramasesh for his young candour and correct advocacy.\" 6.1. considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court, vadodara in dismissing the suit with exemplary cost. we are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned commercial court. no interference of this court is called for. 7.0. in view of the above and for the reasons stated above, present appeal fails and same deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed. 7.1. in view of dismissal of the first appeal, civil application stands dismissed. sd/­ (m.r. shah, j.) sd/­ (b.n. karia, j.) kaushik hc-nic page 9 of 9 created on sat aug 12 13:19:44 ist
