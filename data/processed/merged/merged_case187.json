The present appeal has been preferred by the appellant (Ntpc) under Section 37 (1)(b) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 199 6 as amended, read with Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 against the order dated 11.05.2021 passed by the Judge, Commercial Court, East Khasi Hills District, Shillong in Commercial Misc. Case No. 8 of 2021 filed in Commercial (Arbn.) Case No. 2 of 2021. \n3. The impugned order came to be passed on an application under Order 39 Rule, 4 CPC, filed by the appellant for vacation of the ex parte ad- interim order dated 22.04.2021, on an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in Arbitration Case No. 2 of 2021 which was filed by the respondent. By way of the interim order, the learned Commercial Court directed for maintenance of status quo regarding the encashment of Letter of Credit that had been opened in favour of the appellant by the respondent. \n4. The appellant before the learned Commercial Court, Shillong in the application for vacation of the interim order, had raised the issue of jurisdiction and that a dispute between the appellant, a generating company and the respondent a licensee, should strictly be adjudicated under the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, wherein it is provided in Section 79 (1) (f) that the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission can adjudicate the dispute itself, or choose to refer the same to arbitration, and that should the dispute be referred to arbitration, the same should be under the stipulation as provided in Section 158 of the Electricity Act, 2003.\n5. The grievance of the appellant is that though pertinent issues on jurisdiction and maintainability, were raised by the appellant before the learned Commercial Court, the impugned order was passed by holding that no case was made out for vacating the order dated 22.04.2021 under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC, either under the question of suppression of facts or on the question of maintainability of the application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Hence the appeal. \n6. We have heard the learned Counsels for the parties who have both argued at length and placed various authorities in support of their respective arguments and in fact have touched upon the merits of the case itself. Though at the commencement of the admission hearing, Mr. A. Kumar, learned Advocate General had raised a preliminary objection as regards maintainability of the appeal and the same was partly heard, however with the counsel for the appellant Mr. V.K. Jindal, learned Senior advocate resisting the same, the appeal was then heard in its entirety. \n7. Mr. V.K. Jindal, learned Senior counsel assisted by Mr. S. Jindal, learned counsel for the appellant, has advanced arguments on three main issues, firstly on the maintainability of the instant appeal, secondly the maintainability of the Section 9 application under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before the learned Commercial Court below and thirdly, on the merits of the impugned order dated 11.05.2021. On the question of maintainability of the appeal, it has been submitted by the learned Senior counsel that though Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act bars the filing of a civil revision application, the instant application being an appeal, cannot be equated with a civil revision application or petition. Reliance has been placed by the learned Senior counsel on three judgments to illustrate this point; namely (i) Pranathmaka Ayurvedics Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. vs. Cocosath Health Products, 2020 SCC Online Ker 5476: (2021) 1 KLJ 293(ii) Sigmarq Technologies Pvt. Ltd., &Ors. vs. Manugrah India Limited & Ors. 2017 SCC Online Bom9191: (2018) 1 Bom CR 202 and (iii) Antrix Corporation vs. Devas Multimedia, 2018 (6) RAJ 235 . Learned Senior counsel submits that the above judgments bring out the fact that an appeal is to be differentiated from a civil revision application and that an appeal per se, is maintainable under the Commercial Courts Act, and for the requirement of the bar under Section 8 to fully operate, the challenge raised by way of a civil revision, has to be against an interlocutory order. Learned Senior counsel then submits that the impugned order is not an interlocutory order and though this term has not been defined under the Commercial Courts Act, the connotation of the same can be well understood under other enactments and its interpretation by various judgments. In support thereof, learned counsel has placed reliance on three judgments; (i) Amar Nath & Ors. vs. State of Haryana, AIR 1977 SC 2185, (ii) Central Bank of India vs. Shri Gokal Chand, AIR 1967 SC 799 and (iii)Shah Babulal Khimji vs. Jayaben D, AIR 1981 SC 1786. Learned Senior counsel submits that the above judgments have clearly set out, what is or is not an interlocutory order and that in this context any order, which substantially affects the rights of the party or decides certain rights, even though the order may not bring the entire proceedings to a conclusion, cannot be said to be an interlocutory order. Learned Senior counsel contends that the impugned order, holding that the application under Section 9 is maintainable and thereby rejecting the issue of lack of jurisdiction, is an order that has decided the right of the respondent to prefer a Section 9 application, in a matter that is governed by the Electricity Act, 2003, and as such the impugned order cannot be said to be an interlocutory order. Learned Senior counsel submits that the very purpose of citing these judgments is to show how interlocutory orders are understood under different Acts and as there being no definition under the Commercial Courts Act, these definitions have to be imported into Section 8 of the Act and that the judgments cited however, are not for the purpose to show which orders are appealable under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. \n8. On the question that the bar under Section 8 is subject to right of appeal under Section 13, learned Senior counsel submits that though it may be provided for an order to be challenged only at the time of filing an appeal against a decree of a Commercial Court, the same is subject to the right of appeal provided under Section 13 of the Commercial Court Act and in this context has relied on the judgment of Hubtown Limited vs. IDBI Trusteeship Service Limited and Ors. 2016 SCC Online Bom 9019, which he submits has held that the issue of jurisdiction is appealable under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. Coming to whether the impugned order is appealable under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, learned Senior counsel submits that Section 37 is the controlling section, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which provides for an appeal against an order refusing or granting an interim order under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act. Relying on the judgment of BGS SGS Soma JV vs. NHPC Limited (2020) 2 SCC 234, learned Senior counsel submits that the Supreme Court has clarified that the Commercial Courts Act, only provide for the forum to file the appeal and does not set the parameters as the same are circumscribed by Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. It is contended by the learned Senior counsel that the impugned order challenged by the appellant falls squarely under the scope of Section 37 (1) (b) of the Arbitration Act, inasmuch as, the application for vacation of the ex parte stay on encashment of the Letter of Credit was dismissed by the learned Commercial Court below. The learned Senior counsel has placed reliance on the case of ICCI Bank Limited vs. IVRCL Ltd. & Ors. AIR 2015 AP 179, wherein he submits it has been held that, the appeal provided in Section 37 of the Act comprises within its locus an appeal against an order granting ad-interim measures, pending passing of final orders under Section 9 of the Act. He further submits that though objections have been raised, inasmuch as, the judgment was rendered prior to the application of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and amendment of the Arbitration Act in 2015, this would have no significance since the import of the judgment shows that an order under Section 9, interim or otherwise is appealable under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. Learned Senior counsel has also relied on the case of Perin Hoshang Davierwalla vs. Kobad Dorabji Davierwalla, decided on 7th May 2014 (MANU/AP/0078/2011) to reaffirm his stand. Learned Senior counsel then seeks to distinguish the instant point from what has been held in BGS SGS Soma judgment (supra)by contending that the instant impugned order dated 22.04.2021 of status quo, passed by the Commercial Court below cannot come within the meaning of a step towards an interim order, which would render it un-appealable as per the judgment. He further adds that for an order to be considered an interim order, it need not be an order finally adjudicating the issue, but can also be any order that alters and effects the rights of the parties. Learned Senior counsel next has relied on the case of Sati Oil Udyog Ltd vs. Avanti Projects & Infrastructure; 2010 (1) GLT 141 passed by a Single Bench of Gauhati High Court on the point that any order passed under Section 9 whether interim, final, ex parte, ad-interim or otherwise is appealable under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. \n9. The learned Senior counsel has also advanced submissions that the instant appeal is not only directed against the order dated 11.05.2021, but also against the original ad-interim order of status quo dated 22.04.2021, by contending that the appellant in the application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC had also prayed for vacating the order of interim status quo and for closure of the proceedings filed by the respondent for want of jurisdiction. \n10. The learned Senior counsel on this aspect, has also tendered alternative submissions that the appeal would be maintainable under Order 43 CPC read with Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, in case it is deemed by this Court that the impugned order is not an order contemplated under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. To qualify his submissions, it is contended by the learned Senior counsel, that if it is assumed, that the impugned order has not been passed under the Arbitration Act but under the CPC, the requirement of meeting the rigours of Section 37 would no longer exist, as then the impugned order would only be an order passed under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC, which he submits would make it appealable in view of the proviso to Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act. Reliance has been placed on the following judgments to try to substantiate the above noted proposition; (i) Arvind constructions Co. vs. Kalinga Mining Corporation, 2007 (6) SCC 798 (ii) Sri Krishen & Anr. vs. Radha Kishen, AIR 1952 All 652 (DB) (iii) The East India Hotels Ltd. vs. Jyoti (P) Ltd, 1996 (38) DRJ 73 (DB) and (iv) Judgment of the Delhi High Court dated 13 July, 2020, in EFA(OS)(COMM) 4/2020, Prasar Bharati vs. M/s Stracon India Limited. The learned Senior counsel apart from submissions made herein before, also submits that vide the impugned order, the application filed by the appellant under Order 39 Rule 4 has been dismissed by holding that the petition under Section 9 is maintainable which has accorded finality to the challenge raised, and as such the appeal is maintainable under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act.\n11. Submissions have also been advanced to maintain that even if an appeal is filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, there is no bar against seeking relief under any other law or provision. In this context, the learned Senior counsel has placed certain judgments wherein it has been held that mentioning of a wrong provision in a petition cannot be a ground for rejecting the petition. These are (i) J. KumarDasan Nair vs. IricSohan (2009) 12 SCC 175 (ii) P.K. Palanisami vs, N. Arumugham (2009) 9 SCC 173 and (iii) Challamane Huchha vs. M.R. Tirumala, (2004) 1 SCC 453. Apart from this point, an attempt has been made by the learned Senior counsel to distinguish the case of Kandla Export Corporation vs. OCI Corporation, (2018) 14 SCC 715, by contending that the same was rendered in a complete different context and relates to provisions of Section 50 of the Arbitration Act present in Part-II of the Act concerning execution of foreign awards and not Part I of the Act.\n12. The learned Senior counsel on the next issue, that is the maintainability of a Section 9 petition before the learned Commercial Court, has vehemently contended that a dispute between the appellant, a generating company and the respondent who is a licensee, is to be adjudicated by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) under Section 79 (1) (f) of the Electricity Act, 2003 and that the CERC, can either adjudicate the dispute itself, or choose to refer the same to arbitration. Learned Senior counsel further submits that, should the dispute be referred for arbitration, Section 158 of the Electricity Act enjoins that the said arbitration shall be conducted under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which means that Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, as invoked by the respondents, will only come into play after the CERC appoints an arbitrator to adjudicate the matter and not before that. He further submits that the CERC, is not bound to refer matters to arbitration as soon as an application to that effect is filed under Section 79 (1) (f), but that the CERC can decide to adjudicate the dispute itself, or it may refer the same to an arbitrator. Learned Senior counsel submits that the stance of the respondents, that it is the duty of the CERC to appoint an arbitrator to decide the dispute is incorrect. In support of this contention, reliance has been placed in the decision of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited vs. Essar Power Limited, (2008) 4 SCC 755. He asserts that by this judgment, the Supreme Court has laid down that the provisions of the Arbitration Act would apply only after the dispute has been referred to arbitration under Section 79 (1) (f) by the CERC and contends that the invocation of Section 9 of the Arbitration Act is therefore incongruous. Learned Senior counsel submits that if any interim relief is to be sought, the respondents should have resorted to Section 94 (2) of the Electricity Act, which authorises the CERC to pass interim orders. It is also submitted that the Electricity Act being a special law governing all such matters, is an exhaustive code by itself, and as such will have pre-eminence over other general law. \n13. The learned Senior counsel thereafter in continuation on this point of argument, has taken us through a series of decisions which are given herein below but for the sake of brevity are not elaborated. (i) Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited vs. Essar Power Limited, (2008) 4 SCC 755, (ii) PTC India Limited vs. Jaypee Karchan Hydro Corporation Limited (iii) T.N. Generation and Distribution Corporation vs. PPN Power Generating Company, (2014) 11 SCC 53 (iv) BGS SGS Soma JV vs. NHPC, (2020) 4 SCC 234 (v) Adani Power vs. Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission, (2019) 19 SCC 9 and (vi) Haldiram Manufacturing vs M/S DLF Commercial Complexes, 2012 SCC Online Del 2139. \n14. Learned Senior counsel on the last issue raised i.e. the merit of the impugned order dated 11.05.2021, apart from reiterating his submissions made earlier, has pointed out that the learned Commercial Court has not appreciated the judgment rendered in Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited vs. Essar Power Limited, (2008) 4 SCC 755, wherein he contends, it is implied that the provisions of Arbitration & Conciliation Act would apply only after the dispute has been referred to arbitration under Section 79 (1) (f) of the Electricity Act and not before. Learned Senior counsel therefore submits that the learned Commercial Court has erred in law in also misconstruing the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) by relying on the judgment of Bharat Aluminum Co.(BALCO) vs. Kaizer Aluminum (2012) 9 SCC 522 in respect of the seat of arbitration notwithstanding the fact that the PPA had vested jurisdiction exclusively on the Courts in Delhi. \n15. It is also further contended that the learned Commercial Court had erred in law in dismissing the application of the appellant by holding that no ground had been made out in the application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC, that is whether there was a suppression of facts or change in circumstances, inasmuch as, the substantive portion of Rule 4, was totally ignored, which he submits provides that; one is not required to show suppression of facts or change in circumstances in approaching the Court for vacation of an interim order. The learned Senior counsel has also touched upon other minor issues such as, whether the respondents had sought invocation of arbitration or even expressed a clear intention to do so, which is a pre-condition for exercise of powers under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act and submits that all the respondents have done is to invoke the dispute resolution process under clause 7.1 of the PPA, which contemplates the resolution of differences or disputes through mutual discussions. \n16. Learned Senior counsel while closing his arguments submits that the order dated 22.04.2021 of interim status quo, should have been set aside on the application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC and the entire proceedings closed on the ground of jurisdiction itself by the learned Commercial Court and as such, and on its failure to do so, a grave illegality has been committed which requires interference by this Court by setting aside and quashing the impugned order and consequently the proceedings under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act initiated by the respondents. \n17. In reply to the submissions made by the counsel for the appellant, Mr. A. Kumar, learned Advocate General, assisted by Mr. A.H. Kharwanlang, learned GA has put up three pointed issues for our consideration. First, whether the appeal under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 read with the Arbitration Act is maintainable against the impugned interlocutory order dated 11.05.2021, secondly, if the first issue is answered in the affirmative, whether the learned Commercial Court had rightly refused to vacate the ad-interim stay in terms of Order 39 Rule 4 CPC and thirdly, whether this Court can examine the matter on merit in absence of any challenge to the interim order of status quo/injunction dated 22.04.2021. \n18 . The learned Advocate General on the question of maintainability of the appeal before this Court, has strongly argued that the same is not maintainable as it is barred by law i.e. Section 8, Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts, Act, 2015 read with Section 37 (1)(b) of the Arbitration Act. To substantiate this contention, the learned Advocate General submits that the impugned order 11.05.2021 is an interlocutory order which is not appealable under Section 37 (1) (b) of the Arbitration Act, as there is no final grant or refusal of interim measures by way of the impugned order, or any final determination of the Section 9 application. Section 37 (1) (b) he submits, only contemplates appeals against a final order and that this stipulation has been made clear by the term \"and from no others\" in the provision itself.\n19. Learned Advocate General then refers to Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 which bars any petition against an interlocutory order of a Commercial Court including an interlocutory order on jurisdiction. He submits that Section 8 further provides that subject to the provisions of Section 13, any such challenge can only be raised in an appeal against the decree of the Commercial Court. It is further contended that Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, is subject to Section 37 of the Arbitration Act and does not confer an independent right of appeal on the appellant, but merely provides a forum for final appeal and further that Section 37 is complete in itself and governs the substantive right of appeal in arbitration matters.\n20. On the question as to whether an appeal can be preferred by the appellant under Order 43 (1) (r) of the CPC, the learned Advocate General submits that, as a right of appeal from orders under Section 9 is exclusively governed by Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, the same will not be permissible in the instant matter. He further submits that the appellant has initiated parallel proceedings by way of the instant commercial appeal while at the same time the Section 9 matter before the learned Commercial Court below is pending. \n21. The learned Advocate General has then raised the point that the appellant having elected to prefer an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, the rigours as stipulated thereunder, which provides for a limited right of appeal against orders mentioned in Section 37 (1) and 'from no others', must be satisfied. He submits that, apart from the fact that Section 37 does not permit a challenge to an interlocutory order, even if the same has been passed without jurisdiction, this ground, i.e. lack of jurisdiction is not available to the appellant to sustain the present appeal under Section 37. He further submits that the present appeal being preferred under the appellate jurisdiction of the Arbitration Act, grounds which are not available under Section 37, cannot be taken recourse to by the appellant for consideration of the admission of the appeal. \n22. In support of the submissions recorded hereinabove, learned Advocate General has placed reliance on the following authorities: - (i) BGS SGS SOMA JV v. NHPC (2020) 4 SCC 234 (ii) Chintels India Ltd v. Bhayana Builders 2021 SCC Online SC 80 (iii) Kandla Export Corpn. Vs. OCI Corpn. (2018) 14 SCC 715 (iv) Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd v. Jindal Exports Ltd. (2011) 8 SCC 333 (v) Symphony Services Corporation Pvt. Ltd. vs. Sudip Bhattacharjee 2007 SCC Online Kar 368 and (vi) Benaulim Cable TV Network v. Blits Global Technologies Pvt. Ltd. in SLP (C) No. 2586 of 2019 order dated 14.02.2020. \nLearned Advocate General submits that as per the decision rendered in BGS SGS SOMA (supra) it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that there is no independent right of appeal under Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and following the decisions rendered in Kandla Export (supra) and Fuerst Day (supra) the settled position of law now is that the Arbitration Act being a complete code by itself, an appeal if not maintainable under Section 37 of Arbitration Act cannot be maintained on the principle that the Commercial Court provides the forum of appeal and not substantive right to file appeal. The learned Advocate General relying on the same judgment submits that as can be seen from what has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court there can be no independent appeal under Order 43 Rule (1) (r) of the CPC, and that interlocutory orders and interim orders under Section 9 are not appealable. He thus submits that by this judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid down the law in categorical terms barring an appeal such as the instant one. The other judgements cited above by the learned Advocate General as they are on the same premise are not deemed necessary to be elaborated or discussed. \n23. On another limb of submission, the learned Advocate General categorically submits that the commercial appeal challenges only the order dated 11.05.2021 passed by the learned Commercial Court, refusing to vacate the ad-interim stay granted vide order dated 22.04.2021, and as such the only question to be decided on merit is whether the learned Commercial Court rightly refused to vacate the ad-interim stay on grounds of suppression of facts or change of circumstances within the ambit of Order 39 Rule 4 CPC. The learned Advocate General submits that it is the pleaded case of the respondents, that there has been no suppression whatsoever and that in its application under Section 9 itself, it has been disclosed that the dispute is covered by statutory arbitration under the Electricity Act. This fact he submits has been noted and recorded by the learned Commercial Court in the impugned order itself that no case of suppression has been made out. He further submits that the appellant is wrong in suggesting that the respondents have suppressed facts, inasmuch as, such interpretation as to the applicability of the provision of the Arbitration Act and the Electricity Act, in the backdrop of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court cannot in any manner be considered to be suppression. He further submits that however; the above issue would be required to be gone into by this Court, only if this Court is of the opinion that the appeal is maintainable against an order passed on an application under Order 39 Rule 4 of the CPC under Section 37 (1) (b) of the Arbitration Act. \n24. The learned Advocate General on the question as to whether the Section 9 petition under the Arbitration Act was maintainable before the learned Commercial Court, submits that without prejudice to the fact that the instant appeal is limited only to the dismissal of the application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC and the main issue yet to be decided by the learned Commercial Court; in view of the submissions of the appellant on this point, certain counter arguments are necessary to be made. Drawing this Court's attention to clause 7.2.1 of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) under the heading of 'Arbitration', learned Advocate General submits that clause 7.2 provides for arbitration in terms of the Electricity Act, and as such the instant dispute falling under the said Act is therefore subject to clause 7.2.1 of the PPA. The learned Advocate General next refers to Section 79 (1) (f) of the Electricity Act which empowers the CERC to refer parties to arbitration in respect of any dispute falling under Section 79 (1) and in this context refers to Section 2 (4) of the Arbitration Act and also Sections 158 and 175 of the Electricity Act. He submits that a plain reading of the provisions, show that the law contemplates statutory arbitration and that provisions of Electricity Act also provides application of the arbitration act to statutory arbitration conducted under the Electricity Act and that moreover, the provisions of the Electricity Act are in addition to and not in derogation of any other law. He therefore contends that Section 9 of the Arbitration Act applies with full force to disputes governed by the Electricity Act, as Section 9 is a special provision that provides for interim measures before or during arbitral proceedings, or at any time after the making of the award. Rebutting the contentions of the appellant that relief can be availed of under Section 94 (2) of the Electricity Act for interim relief, the learned Advocate General submits that this provision is only a general power to provide for interim orders when the matter is before the CERC and as such will have no application in the present case. To reinforce his submissions, he asserts that Section 9 by itself is a special provision providing for interim measures before, during and after the arbitral award and that no such provision exists in the Electricity Act. In support of his arguments, learned Advocate General has relied on the case of Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited vs. Essar Power Limited, (2008) 4 SCC 755 and T.N. Generation and Distribution Corporation vs. PPN Power Generating Company, (2014) 11 SCC 53 to illustrate the point that application of Section 9 has not been excluded in cases pertaining to the Electricity Act. \n25. On the other aspect of the matter, the learned Advocate General submits that there is no challenge to the main order dated 22.04.2021 which stands independently and has not merged with the order dated 11.05.2021, therefore the main merit of the matter he contends, is not in issue before this Court. He further submits that the appellant has raised contentions on the merits, for the first time in the instant Commercial Appeal, while the same is yet to be argued by the appellant, nor any reply been filed against the Section 9 application before the learned Commercial Court. Even otherwise, it is submitted that the respondent has a good prima facie case on merits and is entitled to interim protection over the invocation of the Letter of Credit until the arbitration proceedings are initiated. The learned Advocate General briefly has also dwelt on the merits as regards the terms and conditions of the PPA and whether the respondent is entitled to terminate the same. \n26. In closing his submissions, learned Advocate General has laid great emphasis on the question maintainability of the appeal and prays that the same be dismissed on this ground alone. \n27. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and given our thoughtful consideration to the points raised keeping in mind the various issues surrounding the matter, especially on the procedural aspect which we note is of extreme importance, in adjudicating matters such as these. The main issue that confronts this Court is no doubt the question of the maintainability of the present commercial appeal filed under Section 37 (1) (b) of the Arbitration & Conciliation, 1996 as amended read with Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts, Act, 2015 as amended, against the order dated 11.05.2021 passed by the learned Commercial Court. \n28. The interplay of the Arbitration Act, the Electricity Act and the Commercial Courts Act will necessarily need to be examined along with the authorities so placed by the parties, to arrive at a decision or a finding as to whether the instant commercial appeal is at all maintainable before this Court. Coupled with this, what needs to be examined also is the nature of the order appealed against, whether it is interlocutory in nature or whether it has determined the competing rights of the parties in the Section 9 application, to make it competent to be an appeal under Section 37 (1) (b) of the Arbitration Act. Before embarking upon the discussion, it would be expedient if the relevant provisions of law that are to be taken into account in adjudicating the matter for the sake of convenience be reproduced herein below: -\n(i) \"THE COMMERCIAL COURTS ACT, 2015 8. Bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order.- Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the Commercial Court. \n13.

A plain reading of the provisions which are quoted above, maps out the contours of the procedural law to be applied in considering commercial appeals, which then have to be placed against a given set of facts and circumstances to determine the issue. In the instant case, the appeal is against an order dated 11.05.2021 whereby the learned Commercial Court has refused or rejected an application under Order 39 Rule 4, for vacation of an ad-interim status quo order dated 22.04.2021 passed in a Section 9 application. This Court on the question of maintainability therefore, has only to examine whether the appeal against the order dated 11.05.2021 is maintainable at all under the Commercial Courts Act read with the Arbitration Act. \n30. Section 37 (1) (b) contemplates appeals against final orders only and not against ad-interim orders and this stipulation is underlined by the fact that the words 'and from no others' has been used in the said provision. Read together with Section 8 of the Commercial Courts Act, the scope of an appeal is further narrowed down, inasmuch as, this provision bars any petition against an interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction. Further, it is stipulated that any such challenge will be subject to the provisions of Section 13, and shall be raised only in an appeal against a decree of a Commercial Court. Coming to Section 13 of the Commercial Court Act, this provision clearly does not confer an independent right of appeal and the proviso to Section 13 (1A) has circumscribed the types of appeals that can be preferred by making it subject to Order 43 CPC and Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. What emerges therefore, is that the instant appeal has to satisfy the test of Section 37 which as observed hereinabove, provides for a limited right of appeal against orders mentioned in Section 37 (1) and from no others.\n31. In the instant matter, the genesis of the dispute is the Section 9 application filed by the respondent for interim protection, to restrain the encashment of the Letter of Credit drawn in favour of the appellant. The learned Commercial Court by the interim order dated 22.04.2021, had directed for maintenance of status quo and fixed the matter for hearing, apart from granting liberty to the appellant to seek variation or modification of the status quo order. It is to be noted that the application under Section 9 had also at paragraph 10 disclosed the fact that the PPA provided for a provision of arbitration and that any disputes/differences or claims arising out of the said agreement was to be settled in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 read with the provisions of Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. \n32. The appellants admittedly have neither filed a show cause nor contested the application under Section 9 on merits, but had instead filed an application under Order 39 Rule 4 seeking vacation of the ad-interim order dated 22.04.2021 on the ground of suppression of facts and for dismissal of the Section 9 application on the question of jurisdiction. Section 37 (1) (b) of the Arbitration Act, provides that the granting or refusing to grant any measure under Section 9 is appealable, therefore in the light of this provision, what first needs to be examined is the nature of the interim order and as to whether it would amount to a final order or a step towards a final interim order under Section 9. A plain reading of the order dated 22.04.2021, clearly reveals the interim nature of the order, inasmuch as, it is not only ex parte but liberty was also granted to the appellant to seek appropriate orders for modification of the same. Para-10 to 12 of the order dated 22.04.2021 being relevant is quoted hereinbelow:-\n\"10. It appears that the Petitioner is seeking for an interim order on the ground that clause 2.2.6 of the agreement has been misunderstood and fixed capacity charges, is slapped against the Petitioner. The matter needs to be examined. \n11. At this stage the Respondent are directed to maintain status quo with regard to the encashment of Letter of Credit. This order is passed ex parte, the Petitioners shall communicate this order to the respondents and file an affidavit to that effect. \n12. Since this order has been passed ex parte, the Respondent is at liberty to approach this Court and file application for variation, modification, alteration of the status quo order. Thus, the purport and nature of the above quoted order leaves little room to arrive at any other conclusion, but that it is an order which is purely ad-interim in nature and is not conclusive as to the interim measure or reliefs prayed for under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act. \n33. The order dated 22.04.2021, however has not been put to challenge before this Court and the appeal, notwithstanding any submissions made to the contrary by the appellant, is limited to a challenge to the order dated 11.05.2021 rejecting the application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC. In this context, the other aspect as to the appeal being maintainable by virtue of proviso to Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Act, wherein Order 43 (1) (r) has been mentioned needs to be looked into. Coming again to Section 37 of the Arbitration Act which alone can be looked at for the purpose of filing appeals against orders granting or refusing any measure under Section 9, it is found that Order 43 does not find any mention in this provision. What follows therefore is that, if finality in a Section 9 application is to be arrived at to make any order passed thereon appealable, the facts and merits of the application filed by the respondent under Section 9 have to be gone into. In the instant case, there has been no final adjudication of the Section 9 application nor does the impugned order finally decide the same. The appellant as noted did not file any show cause or affidavit to contest the same but instead filed an application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC. The decision in the application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC has not conclusively decided the Section 9 application, thus making it un- appealable under Section 37(1)(b) of the Arbitration Act. \n34. In the case of BGS SGC Soma (supra) which in fact is directly applicable to the instant case, it has been held that no independent right of appeal under Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Court Act, 2015 exists and that an appeal if not maintainable under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, cannot be maintained by relying upon the Commercial Court, Act. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in paras 12, 13 and 14 which is partly extracted hereinbelow has laid down as follows: -\n\"12. The interplay between Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 and Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, has been laid down in some detail in the judgment in Kandla Export Corpn. The precise question that arose in Kandla Export Corpn. was as to whether an appeal, which was not maintainable under Section 50 of the Arbitration Act,1996, is nonetheless maintainable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. In this context, after setting out various provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and the Arbitration Act, 1996, this Court held: (SCC pp. 727, 729,731-34, paras 13-15, 20-22 & 27) \"13. Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, with which we are immediately concerned in these appeals, is in two parts. The main provision is, as has been correctly submitted by Shri Giri, a provision which provides for appeals from judgments, orders and decrees of the Commercial Division of the High Court. To this main provision, an exception is carved out by the proviso...\"\n14. The proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by the Commercial Division of the High Court that are specifically enumerated under Order 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure Code, 1908, and Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. It will at once be noticed that orders that are not specifically enumerated under Order 43 CPC would, therefore, not be appealable, and appeals that are mentioned in Section 37 of the Arbitration Act alone are appeals that can be made to the Commercial Appellate Division of a High Court. \n15. Thus, an order which refers parties to arbitration under Section 8, not being appealable under Section 37(1)(a), would not be appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. \nSimilarly, an appeal rejecting a plea referred to in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 16 of the Arbitration Act would equally not be appealable under Section 37(2)(a) and, therefore, under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. \n20. Given the judgment of this Court in Fuerst Day Lawson, which Parliament is presumed to know when it enacted the Arbitration Amendment Act, 2015, and given the fact that no change was made in Section 50 of the Arbitration Act when the Commercial Courts Act was brought into force, it is clear that Section 50 is a provision contained in a self-contained code on matters pertaining to arbitration, and which is exhaustive in nature. It carries the negative import mentioned in para 89 of Fuerst Day Lawson that appeals which are not mentioned therein, are not permissible. This being the case, it is clear that Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, being a general provision vis--vis arbitration relating to appeals arising out of commercial disputes, would obviously not apply to cases covered by Section 50 of the Arbitration Act. \n21 . However, the question still arises as to why Section 37 of the Arbitration Act was expressly included in the proviso to Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, which is equally a special provision of appeal contained in a self-contained code, which in any case would be outside Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. One answer is that this was done ex abundanti cautela. Another answer may be that as Section 37 itself was amended by the Arbitration Amendment Act, 2015, which came into force on the same day as the Commercial Courts Act, Parliament thought, in its wisdom, that it was necessary to emphasise that the amended Section 37 would have precedence over the general provision contained in Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. Incidentally, the amendment of 2015 introduced one more category into the category of appealable orders in the Arbitration Act, namely, a category where an order is made under Section 8 refusing to refer parties to arbitration. Parliament may have found it necessary to emphasise the fact that an order referring parties to arbitration under Section 8 is not appealable under Section 37(1)(a) and would, therefore, not be appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. Whatever may be the ultimate reason for including Section 37 of the Arbitration Act in the proviso to Section 13(1), the ratio decidendi of the judgment in Fuerst Day Lawson would apply, and this being so, appeals filed under Section 50 of the Arbitration Act would have to follow the drill of Section 50 alone. \n22. This, in fact, follows........ as laying down the forum which will hear and decide such an appeal. \n27. The matter can be looked ...... spheres other than arbitration.\" \n13. Given the fact that there is no independent right of appeal under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, which merely provides the forum of filing appeals, it is the parameters of Section 37 of the Arbitration Act,1996 alone which have to be looked at in order to determine whether the present appeals were maintainable. Section 37(1) makes it clear that appeals shall only lie from the orders set out in sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) and from no others. The pigeonhole that the High Court in the impugned judgement has chosen to say that the appeals in the present cases were maintainable is sub-clause (c). According to the High Court, even where a Section 34 application is ordered to be returned to the appropriate Court, such order would amount to an order \"refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section 34\".\n14. Interestingly, under the proviso to Section 13(1-A) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, Order 43 of the CPC is also mentioned. Order 43 Rule(1)(a) reads as follows:\n\"1. Appeal from orders.- An appeal shall lie from the following orders under the provisions of Section 104, namely- (a)an order under Rule 10 of Order 7 returning a plaint to be presented to the proper Court except where the procedure specified in rule 10-A of Order 7 has been followed;\"\nThis provision is conspicuous by its absence in Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, which alone can be looked at for the purpose of filing appeals against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the impugned judgment is the words \"under Section 34\". Thus, the refusal to set aside an arbitral award must be under Section 34, i.e. after the grounds set out in Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in question, and after the Court has turned down such grounds. Admittedly, on the facts of these cases, there was no adjudication under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special Commercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application filed under Section 151 read with Order 7 Rule 10 CPC, determining that the Special Commercial Court at Gurugram had no jurisdiction to proceed further with the Section 34 application, and therefore, such application would have to be returned to the competent court situate at New Delhi.\"\n35. In the same judgment itself, the question of what would amount to an interim order or a step towards an interim order, the principle laid down which would apply to the instant case has been set out in para 19 which is quoted hereinbelow:-\n\"19. It can be seen that the reasoning in this judgment would have no application to the facts of the present case. The Division Bench held that directing Antrix to file an affidavit, enclosing therewith its audited balance sheets and profit and loss account for the last three years, is itself an interim order passed under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. The further reasoning of the Court that the direction to Antrix to furnish an affidavit is to aid a future interim order, which would be just consequential, does not commend itself to us. A step towards an interim order would not amount to granting, or refusing to grant, any measure under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. The case is also distinguishable for the reason that, as regards the Bangalore Court, which cannot proceed further with the matter, the impugned order therein is really final and would, therefore, also be appealable under Section 37. For all these reasons, this judgment is wholly distinguishable and would not apply to the facts of the present case. We may also advert to the fact that our judgment in Kandla was delivered on 7-2-2018, and was missed by the Division Bench in Antrix Corpn. Ltd, as the Division Bench had reserved judgment on 6-12-2017, even though it ultimately pronounced the judgment on 30-5-2018. The judgment in South Delhi Municipal Corpn. was decided after reference was made to Kandla, resulting in a deposit order being held to be not appealable under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996.\" \n36. This judgment which is exhaustive and is holding the field in such matters, has also analyzed and distinguished the various judgments which have also been cited by the learned counsels for both the parties and as such it will not be necessary to discuss the various authorities that have been relied upon any further. What follows therefore is that as per the law interpreted and laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, there is no independent right of appeal under Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, the Arbitration Act is a complete code by itself and if an appeal is not maintainable under Section 37, the same cannot be sustained with the support of the Commercial Courts Act; that there is no independent right of appeal under Order 43 Rule (1) (r) CPC, and that interlocutory orders are not appealable, so also interim orders under Section 9.\n37. Apart from the application of law to the instant case on the question of maintainability, an aspect which cannot be overlooked is the fact that the interim order dated 22.04.2021, passed under Section 9 of the application is not under challenge in this appeal, which in our opinion is a core issue, as these proceedings commenced before the learned Commercial Court below on the Section 9 application itself. The adjudication under Section 9 is yet to be concluded and the appellant herein has yet to contest the same on merits to enable the learned Commercial Court to bring the proceedings to a conclusion. The appellant by choosing to impugn only the order dated 11.05.2021, by filing this appeal under Section 37 (1)(b) of the Arbitration Act read with Section 13 (1A) of the Commercial Courts Act, appears to be but an attempt to shortcut the process, by seeking to maintain that there was finality in the orders, that the Commercial Court had no jurisdiction and hence the appeal is maintainable. The judgements placed by the appellant such as ICCI Bank Limited vs. IVRCL Ltd.(supra) and Sati Oil Udyog Ltd vs. Avanti Projects (supra) apart from others, are no longer relevant with the advancement in law in such matters. These in our opinion goes against the very grain of the law as stipulated under Section 8 of the Commercial Court Act, inasmuch as, an appeal has to be only against a decree and further it has to meet the requirements of Section 37(1)(b). In fact, this exercise has only resulted in lengthening the process which should not be the case in commercial matters, where time is the essence and matters are supposed to be dealt with at the earliest. \n38. In view of the facts and circumstances and discussions hereinabove, we find that the instant appeal is not maintainable and the alternative arguments as noted at paragraph 10 of this judgment are also rejected. Accordingly, on the question of maintainability alone, without touching the merits of the case, this appeal fails. \n39. Before parting with the records it may be mentioned that though arguments have been advanced by both the parties with regard to jurisdiction of the Commercial Court to entertain the Section 9 application under the Arbitration Act, this argument and other arguments will be best made before the learned Commercial Court at the time of hearing of the Section 9 application, wherein the question of maintainability of the Section 9 application apart from the merits, will necessarily have to be gone into. It is further needed to be added herein, that though in the impugned order it has been observed that the Section 9 application is maintainable, the same appears to not have been made in the context of the issue in the application and is un-consequential as the question of jurisdiction has been left open. \n40. The appeal accordingly stands dismissed and the learned Commercial Court is directed to hear the Section 9 application in its entirety as expeditiously as possible. \n41. No order as to costs. \n(W.

commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high court act 2015, a challenge is made to a decision rendered by learned judge, commercial court, city civil court, ahmedabad dated 12.8.2022. the relief clause contained in the appeal reads as under:(a) admit this first appeal: (b) your lordships may be pleased to call for the records and proceedings of commercial civil misc. application no. 339 of 2021 from the court of learned. judge, commercial court, city civil court, ahmedabad and after examining the legality and propriety thereof, be pleased to quash and

arbitrator dated 21.2.2020 directing restoration of dealership is per se illegal, null and void and not binding on the appellants; d) pass any such other and/or further orders that may be thought just and proper, in the facts and circumstances of the present case. 2. the background of facts which has given rise to present appeal is that a dealership agreement came to be executed between indian oil corporation ltd. and opponents on neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined 21.3.2013 for retail sale of petrol/ hsd/ motor oil/ grease and such other petroleum products and pursuant to such dealership agreement, equipments were installed at the retail outlet which were in possession and control of the opponent herein. 3. it is the case of the appellant that on 16.1.2014, antiadulteration cell (aac) had visited the site of the opponent and observed that two dispensing units with pulsar cable, additional suspicious electronic chips were attached. cable and chips were removed and sealed by the officers of aac and on sealed cover, signature of the opponent was taken. report came to be prepared by aac, which was signed by the opponent and no objection was taken at the said relevant point of time. report has specifically contained the observations that chips were found during surprise checking. on 10.2.2014, a show cause notice came to be issued by the appellant to the opponent and in response thereto, reply was given by the opponents on 28.2.2014. it is the case of the appellant in the reply that a categorical admission reflects about factum of additional suspicious electronic chips. on 7.4.2014, opponent along with committee members were present at the office of original neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined equipment manufacturer, i.e. midco, for opening sealed envelop. but, the opponent insisted that iocl should took decision for carrying out scientific test and thereafter only envelop be opened. since no conclusion could take place in the same meeting, meeting was re-scheduled on 19.5.2014, wherein also, opponent reiterated the request as made earlier. in turn, on 20.5.2014, said two suspicious electronic components were handed over to midco, who in turn, stated that upon inspection of both the electronic components, it was certified that these were not part of midco dispensing unit. in view of such, a show cause notice was issued on 25.8.2014 to the opponent and after considering the reply dated 2.2.2015, an order of termination of dealership agreement came to be passed under the said letter. opponent preferred an appeal before the appellate authority, which came to be dismissed by a detailed order dated 30.3.2015. 4. feeling aggrieved by the said decision of the appellate authority, opponent filed special civil application no.6944 of 2015 and pursuant to order dated 26.7.2018, disputes were referred to learned arbitrator for arbitration. in response to the neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined said order, appellants appeared before learned arbitrator and submitted their reply to the statement of claim filed by the opponents. both the sides led their oral depositions before learned arbitrator. during the course of proceedings, written arguments were also submitted before learned arbitrator along with various decisions to justify the stand of appellants. it was specifically contended that termination has been effected within four corners of dealership agreement and marketing discipline guidelines. however, learned arbitrator was pleased to pass an award holding that termination was bad in law and was further pleased to direct restoration of supplies. learned arbitrator however was pleased not to grant any damages as prayed for. said award came to be delivered on 21.2.2020. 5. feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said award, appellant filed an application under section 34 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 before learned city civil courtcommercial court at ahmedabad which was registered as cma no.339 of 2021. after hearing both the sides, learned commercial courtcity civil court, ahmedabad was pleased to dismiss the said c.m.a. no.339 of 2021 by judgment and order neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined dated 12.8.2022 and it is against this order, appellants have filed present first appeal under section 37 of the act. 6. the coordinate bench of this court was pleased to call for the record and proceedings from the commercial courtcity civil court, ahmedabad by virtue of order dated 30.1.2023 and upon receipt of the same, learned advocates have requested the court to take up the hearing of present first appeal and as such, with request and concurrence of both learned advocates, the matter is heard by the court. 7. learned senior advocate mr. m.r. bhatt appearing on behalf of appellants has submitted that impugned award dated 21.2.2020 passed by learned arbitrator is unsustainable in view of the fact that not only termination of dealership has been held to be invalid but consequential direction to restore the supply of petroleum products has been awarded which is outside the purview of dispute. further, the award is contrary to the terms of contract itself and not in consonance with documentary evidence led by the claimants and as such award suffers from vice of perversity. since evidence has been construed in a neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined manner in which no reasonable man would construe and as such most basic norms of justice are breached while passing the award as per submission of mr. bhatt. 8. learned senior advocate mr. m.r. bhatt by relying upon the decision delivered by hon'ble the apex court reported in (2019) 15 scc 131 has submitted that certain findings which are recorded by learned arbitrator are completely out of place and in ignorance and as such award itself is perverse to the documentary evidence on record and when that be so, certainly court can examine said award irrespective of restricted scope of sections 34 and 37 of the arbitration act, as the case may be. according to mr. bhatt, in view of following decisions delivered by the hon'ble apex court, scope of interference under sections 34 and 37 is well defined and according to mr. bhatt, this is a clear case in which jurisdiction deserves to be exercised and for that purpose, mr. bhatt has placed reliance on following decisions:(1) patel engg. ltd. v. north eastern electric power corporation, reported in (2020) 7 scc 167; (2) associate builders v. delhi development authority, reported in (2015) 3 scc 49; neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined (3) south east asia marine engineering and construction limited (seamac) v. oil india limited reported (2020) 5 scc 164. 9. it has further been contended that though there was a clear admission on the part of claimants reflecting from the documents in the form of inspection report dated 16.1.2014, as also reply filed by respondent dated 28.2.2014, still learned arbitrator holds that presence of electronic chips was in dispute and as such finding which has been recorded is perverse to the record. 10. it has further been submitted that respondents contended that third part of clause 5.1.4 with regard to testing of seals has not been followed, but then two components given in midco were for the purpose of verification as to whether they were original equipment or not. in the event, they were original equipment, then only further question of testing would arise. here in the case on hand, mr. bhatt has submitted that midco under its letter dated 20.5.2014 clarified that they were original equipment of midco, there was no question of carrying out further testing and that learned arbitrator has erroneously construed such documentary evidence which clearly reflects neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined apparent perversity in passing the award impugned in the present proceedings. mr. bhatt has further submitted that contract in question was undisputedly terminable and as such by virtue of section 14 of the specific relief act, restoration of dealership is impermissible. clause 2, 12, 15 and and 45(o) in addition to other clauses of contract would clearly demonstrate that agreement was terminable and as such when that be so, prayer for restoration could not have been granted by learned arbitrator. for this purpose, mr. bhatt has relied upon the decision of the hon'ble apex court reported in (1991) 1 scc 533 and by referring to paragraphs 8, 12 and 14, an attempt has been made to substantiate the contentions since moment agreement is terminable, restoration of dealership cannot be granted by resorting to section 14 of the specific relief act. hence, learned arbitrator, according to mr. bhatt, has clearly misconstrued the provisions not only on the contract but has completely misread section 14 of the specific relief act. following decisions are tried to be relied by mr. bhatt and thereby it has been contended that serious error is committed by learned arbitrator in construing section 14 of the specific neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined relief act:(1) puravankara projects limited v. hotel venus international and others reported in (2007) 10 scc 33; (2) indian oil corporation limited v. vijay automative services, reported in 2012 scc online bom 1163; (3) captain guman singh v. indian oil corporation limited reported in 2016 scc online del 983; (4) indian oil corporation limited v. shree ram gas service reported in 1995 scc online del 2; (5) indian oil corporation limited v. bhagwan balasai enterprise reported in 2017 scc online mad 37266; (6) bharat petroleum corporation ltd. v. khayber transport private limited reported in 2011 scc online all 640; (7) e. venkatakrishna v. indian oil corporation limited and another reported in (2000) 7 scc 764. 11. learned senior advocate mr. m.r. bhatt has further submitted that once unauthorized electronic chip is found as a matter of fact in dispensing unit, burden was on respondent to prove that such electronic chips were not capable of manipulating delivery and had no intention to manipulate and as such by referring to clause 5.1.4 and 8.2 of mdg, it has been contended that respondent has miserably failed in discharging its initial burden of proof, hence interference in such a patently neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined unsustainable award desires in the interest of justice. 12. it has further been contended by learned senior advocate mr. bhatt that technician of roseman who filed an affidavit was not brought for the purpose of cross-examination and as such respondent has failed to put his defense independently rather said witness was on the contrary withdrawn from examination by filing a pursis. on the contrary, said witness was to be put forth by respondent if respondent so desirous of putting its case forward and that having not been done, respondent has not discharged its burden of proving the case. this material aspect has not been properly gone into by learned arbitrator, as a result of which award under challenge requires to be interfered with. 13. learned senior advocate mr. bhatt has submitted that learned arbitrator as well as the commercial court have also clearly erred in law by observing that order of termination made by an authority was not competent under mdg and this aspect has neither been pleaded nor even argued and as such issue of approval was outside the purview of pleadings and hence such a neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined finding is clearly perverse as not borne out from the record. mr. bhatt has submitted rather reiterated that finding with regard to restoration of dealership is clearly an error which can be said to be a patent error and hence when award itself is suffering from vice of perversity, court can exercise jurisdiction and set aside impugned award. aforesaid submissions were forming part of the written submissions which have been tendered on 6.3.2023. no other submissions have been made. 14. as against this, learned senior advocate mr. s.i. nanavati appearing on behalf of respondentsclaimants has vehemently opposed stand taken by the appellants and at the outset, mr. nanavati has referred to a decision of recent past delivered by hon'ble apex court reported in (2022) 1 scc 131 and has vehemently contended that even under section 34 of the arbitration act, jurisdiction is confined to a veryvery limited extent in which appreciation or re-appreciation of matter either on fact or law cannot be considered and hon'ble the apex court has also at length observed what can be said to be patent illegality. scope of section 37 of the arbitration act in which present proceedings have been brought is much narrow than neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined proceedings under section 34 of the act. hence, by referring to certain observations made in the aforesaid decision, mr. nanavati has vehemently contended that in the absence of any patent perversity or illegality of such nature, no interfere deserves in the present proceedings, hence requested to dismiss the first appeal. 15. learned senior advocate mr. nanavati has elaborated his submissions in the form of written submissions, gist thereof is reproduced hereunder, and has submitted that present first appeal being devoid of merits, deserves to be dismissed:1. the present appeal has been preferred by the appellants under section 13 of the commercial courts, commercial division and commercial appellate division of high court act 2015 and under the provisions of section 37 of the arbitration & conciliation act, 1996. it is submitted that as per the settled provisions of law, as enunciated in various judgements of this hon'ble court as well as the hon'ble supreme court of india, the scope of interference under section 37 of the arbitration act is within a very limited compass and, therefore, this hon'ble court may not disturb or interfere with the impugned judgement dated 12.08.2022 passed by the ld. judge, commercial court, city civil court, ahmedabad in commercial civil misc. application no.339/2021. 2. it is submitted that all the grounds which have been raised in facts and law in the present appeal have been already raised before the commercial court at ahmedabad in the commercial civil misc. application no.339/2021 preferred by the present appellants under the provisions of section 34 of the arbitration act, 1996 and the present appeal raises no substantive grounds which may warrant any interference at the appellate stage under section 37 of the arbitration act. neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined 3. it is submitted that in the proceedings under section 34 of the arbitration act, the ld. commercial court has considered all the grounds which have been raised by the appellants in the present appeal and there is no error or any omission which necessitates the grounds canvassed in the present appeal and, therefore also, no interference may be caused in the impugned judgement. 4. that the hon'ble commercial court while passing the impugned judgement dated 12.08.2022 has already appreciated the submissions made by the appellants on facts as well as on law and has appreciated all the judgements relied upon by the appellants as well as the respondents during the course of the hearings granted and having appreciated the same, has dismissed the application under section 34 of the arbitration act preferred by the appellants and, therefore also, the impugned judgement deserves no interference. 5. that the ld. arbitrator has set aside the order dated 02.02.2015 terminating the dealership and the order of the appellate authority dated 30.03.2015 passed by the respondent corporation and has as a consequence directed the respondents to restore the supply of petroleum products as per the dealership agreement within a period of one month after considering and discussing the factual and legal aspects of the disputes raised during the arbitration proceedings between the parties more particularly by giving findings on the fact of violation of principles of natural justice in the following paragraphs of the award dated 21.02.2020 para nos. 21, 22, 25, 44, 45, 46, 47 to 53, 58 and 59 of the arbitral award dated 21.02.2020 and has thereafter granted prayers in para 80 of the said award and thus the ld. arbitral tribunal has not committed any error while granting the prayers in para 80 of the said award. 6. the above mentioned appreciation of facts and law as stated in the above mentioned paragraphs of the award has been done by the hon'ble commercial court and it is only after the factual and legal appreciation done by the hon'ble commercial court in paras 6 to 11 as also the appreciation of law as discussed in paras 12 to 14 of the impugned judgement dated 12.08.2022 that the hon'ble commercial court has dismissed the application under section 34 of the arbitration act preferred by the present appellants. therefore, it is submitted that now under the exercise of section 37 of the arbitration act, this hon'ble court may not interfere with the findings given by the ld. arbitrator in the award dated 21.02.2020 as well as the impugned judgement dated 12.08.2022. neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined 7. it is submitted that the opponents would once again seek to place reliance on the ratio laid by the hon'ble supreme court of india in the case of delhi airport metro express pvt. ltd. vs. delhi metro rail corporation ltd. cited as (2022) 1 scc 131 wherein the hon'ble supreme court of india has reiterated that while deciding applications filed under section 34 of the arbitration act, the courts are mandated to strictly act in accordance with and within the confines of section 34 and ought to refrain from appreciation or reappreciation of matters of fact as well as law and as discussed in paras 27, 28 and 29 of the said judgement, the impugned judgement does not suffer from any patent illegality nor any perversity and, therefore also, this hon'ble court may not interfere with the impugned judgement. the very same judgement has been also appreciated and considered in the impugned judgement in para 13 and, therefore, the ld. commercial court having a conscious view of the law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court of india has passed the impugned judgement. 8. so far as the contention of the appellants that the hon'ble commercial court has given findings in para 11 of the impugned judgement which are erroneous in nature since it was not even the case of the opponents before the ld. arbitral tribunal, it is submitted that the ld. commercial court has appreciated the fact that before the ld. arbitral tribunal, the claimants in their statement of claims had sought prayers in which relief was sought to set aside the impugned orders therein passed by the corporation on various grounds including that the same are without jurisdiction. the prayers prayed by the claimants are reproduced at page 64 of the compilation in para 11 of the award. it has been further noted by the ld. commercial court that on page 65 of the compilation in para 12 of the award, the issues were framed with consent of both the parties wherein issue no.3 pertains to the legality or otherwise of the termination orders passed by the corporation and has, therefore, having considered the same, the ld. commercial court in paras 9 to 11 of the impugned judgement has rightly upheld the findings recorded in the arbitral award and, therefore also, no interference may be granted by this hon'ble court. 9. so far as the contention of the appellants regarding no sufficient notice of the violation of mdg and clauses 45(a), 45(k) and 45(o) of the dealership agreement despite the same being mentioned in the show cause notice dated 24.08.2014 is concerned, it is submitted that the ld. arbitrator has in very clear terms given a finding in para 46 of the arbitral award that it was for the first time while terminating the dealership with immediate effect that a finding was recorded that there is a violation of clause nos. 45(a), 45(k) and 45(o) of the dealership agreement and, therefore, there is a neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined violation of the principles of natural justice. the copies of the first show cause notice as well as the second show cause notice from the r&p are annexed hereto and marked as annexure \"r-1\" (colly.) for ready reference. it is submitted that upon bare perusal of the two notices, it is clear that the findings of the ld. arbitral tribunal as well as the hon'ble commercial court do not suffer from any factual or legal error. 10. so far as the contention of the appellants that the ld. commercial court has erred by not appreciating the decision of the hon'ble supreme court of india in the case of indian oil corporation ltd. versus amritsar gas services and others cited in 1991 (1) scc 533 is concerned, it is submitted that the ld. arbitral tribunal has in para 80 (b) of the arbitral award granted the relief only as a consequence of setting aside the termination letters/orders of the corporation. the ld. arbitral tribunal has only as a consequence directed to restore the supply of petroleum products as per the dealership agreement. it is humbly submitted that the ld. arbitral tribunal has not directed restoration of dealership but has only quashed and set aside the action of termination of the dealership by the corporation and granted a consequential relief and, therefore, the present case is not covered by the ratio laid down by the hon'ble supreme court as sought to be canvassed by the appellants. 11. so far as the submissions of the appellants regarding the reliance on the affidavit filed by technician of roseman limited is concerned, it is submitted that the affidavit of the technician dated 15.03.2015, a copy f which is annexed hereto and marked as annexure \"r-2\". was itself considered by the appellate authority (at page 317-318) of the corporation in its order dated 30.03.2015, a copy of which is annexed hereto and marked as annexure \"r-3\". thereafter when the present opponents had made an application for summoning the said mr. pipaliya as a witness during the arbitration proceedings, the present appellants itself had objected to such application for issuing summons to mr. pipaliya and, therefore, since there was an objection to summon and examine the author of the affidavit mr. pipaliya, the present opponents had to withdraw the said application in view of such objection. annexed hereto and marked as annexure \"r-4\" (colly.) are the copies of the application for summoning, the objection of the appellants and the withdrawal of application for summons. thus, the ld. arbitral tribunal having considered the fact that such witness was objected to be called upon and examined by the original claimants has rightly relied upon the same and it is submitted that it does not lie in the mouth of the appellants to cry foul about placing reliance by the ld. arbitral tribunal on the said affidavit when the appellate authority of the very same corporation neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined had relied upon/considered the affidavit of the technician of roseman. the appellants cannot be selective of their stand when the affidavit is considered by their appellate authority, the same is considered to be valid and when the ld. arbitral tribunal relies upon the same affidavit, the same amounts to perversity according to the appellants. such arguments stems out of convenience and reflects the selective approach of the appellants and, therefore, the same deserves to be ignored. 12. thus, it is humbly submitted that in view of the above facts and circumstances of the case and considering the catena of judgements and the limited scope under section 37 of the arbitration act, this hon'ble court may be kind enough to dismiss the appeal by not interfering in the impugned judgement dated 12.08.2022. 16. having heard learned senior advocates appearing for the respective sides and having gone through the material on record placed before us, before dealing with rival contentions, the court is mindful of proposition of law laid down by hon'ble apex court on the issue of scope of section 37 of the act of 1996 while examining the award passed by learned arbitrator as well as order passed under section 34 of the act. 17. in the very recent past, hon'ble apex court while analyzing sections 34 and 37 of the act of 1996 has well propounded the proposition by considering several judgments delivered by the court in past and said proposition since very relevant to the issue on hand we deem it proper to quote hereunder relevant observations contained in paragraphs 22 to neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined 29 and 32 of the decision in the case of delhi airport metro express private limited vs. delhi metro rail corporation limited reported in (2022) scc 131: contours of the court's power to review arbitral awards 20. 22. the 1996 act was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards and also to define the law relating to conciliation and for matters connected therewith, by taking into account the united nations commission on international trade law (uncitral) model law on international commercial arbitration and the uncitral conciliation rules. one of the principal objectives of the 1996 act is to minimize the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral process. with respect to part i of the 1996 act, section 5 imposes a bar on intervention by a judicial authority except where provided for, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force. an application for setting aside an arbitral award can only be made in accordance with provisions of section 34 of the 1996 act. 23. relevant provisions of section 34 (as they were prior to the arbitration and conciliation (amendment) act, 2015) read as under:\"34. application for setting aside arbitral award. -(1) recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and subsection (3). (2) an arbitral award may be set aside by the court only if-(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that-(i) a party was under some incapacity, or (ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or (iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration: provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or (v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this part from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this part; or (b) the court finds that-(i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force, or (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of india. explanation.--without prejudice to the generality of sub-clause (ii), it is hereby declared, for the avoidance of any doubt, that an award is in conflict with the public policy of india if the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81. 24. an amendment was made to section 34 of the 1996 act by the arbitration and conciliation (amendment) act, 2015 (hereinafter, 'the 2015 amendment act'). a perusal of the statement of objects and reasons of the 2015 amendment act would disclose that the amendment to the 1996 act became necessary in view of the interpretation of the provisions of the 1996 act by courts in certain cases which had resulted in delay of disposal of arbitration proceedings and increase in interference by courts in arbitration matters, which had the tendency to defeat the object of the 1996 act. 19 | p a g e initially, the matter was referred to the law commission of india to review the shortcomings in the 1996 act in detail. the law commission of india submitted its 176 th report, recommending various amendments to the 1996 act. however, the justice saraf committee on arbitration constituted by the government, was of the view that the proposed amendments gave neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined room for substantial intervention by the court and were also contentious. thereafter, on reference, the law commission undertook a comprehensive study of the amendments proposed by the government, keeping in mind the views of the justice saraf committee and other stakeholders. the 246 th report of the law commission was submitted on 05.08.2014. acting on the recommendations made by the law commission in its 246th report, amendments by way of the 2015 amendment act were made to several provisions of the 1996 act, including section 34. 25. the amended section 34 reads as under: \"34. application for setting aside arbitral award. -(1) recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with subsection (2) and subsection (3). (2) an arbitral award may be set aside by the court only if-(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that-(i) a party was under some incapacity, or (ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or (iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration: provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or (v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this part from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this part; or (b) the court finds that-(i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force, or (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of india. neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined explanation 1. --for the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the public policy of india, only if,-(i) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81; or (ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law; or (iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice. explanation 2. --for the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute. (2-a) an arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the court, if the court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the award: provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by re-appreciation of evidence. .\" 22. 26. a cumulative reading of the uncitral model law and rules, the legislative intent with which the 1996 act is made, section 5 and section 34 of the 1996 act would make it clear that judicial interference with the arbitral awards is limited to the grounds in section 34. while deciding applications filed under section 34 of the act, courts are mandated to strictly act in accordance with and within the confines of section 34, refraining from appreciation or re-appreciation of matters of fact as well as law. (see: uttarakhand purv sainik kalyan nigam limited. v. northern coal field limited. 2, bhaven construction through authorised signatory premjibhai k. shah v. executive engineer sardar sarovar narmada nigam ltd. and another3 and rashtriya ispat nigam limited v. dewan chand ram saran4). 27. for a better understanding of the role ascribed to courts in reviewing arbitral awards while considering applications filed under section 34 of the 1996 act, it would be relevant to refer to a judgment of this court in ssangyong engineering and construction company limited v. national highways authority of india (nhai) 5 wherein r.f. nariman, j. has in clear terms delineated the limited area for judicial interference, taking into account the amendments brought about by the 2015 amendment act. the relevant 2 (2020) 2 scc 455 3 2021 scc online sc 8 4 (2012) 5 scc 306 5 (2019) 15 scc 131 passages of the judgment in ssangyong (supra) are noted as under: \"34. what is clear, therefore, is that the expression \"public policy of neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined india\", whether contained in section 34 or in section 48, would now mean the \"fundamental policy of indian law\" as explained in paras 18 and 27 of associate builders [associate builders v. dda, (2015) 3 scc 49: (2015) 2 scc (civ) 204] i.e. the fundamental policy of indian law would be relegated to \"renusagar\" understanding of this expression. this would necessarily mean that western geco [ongc v. western geco international ltd., (2014) 9 scc 263 : (2014) 5 scc (civ) 12] expansion has been done away with. in short, western geco [ongc v. western geco international ltd., (2014) 9 scc 263 : (2014) 5 scc (civ) 12] ,as explained in paras 28 and 29 of associate builders [associate builders v. dda, (2015) 3 scc 49 : (2015) 2 scc (civ) 204] , would no longer obtain, as under the guise of interfering with an award on the ground that the arbitrator has not adopted a judicial approach, the court's intervention would be on the merits of the award, which cannot be permitted post amendment. however, insofar as principles of natural justice are concerned, as contained in sections 18 and 34(2) (a)(iii) of the 1996 act, these continue to be grounds of challenge of an award, as is contained in para 30 of associate builders [associate 24 | p a g e builders v. dda, (2015) 3 scc 49 : (2015) 2 scc (civ) 204] . 35. it is important to notice that the ground for interference insofar as it concerns \"interest of india\" has since been deleted, and therefore, no longer obtains. equally, the ground for interference on the basis that the award is in conflict with justice or morality is now to be understood as a conflict with the \"most basic notions of morality or justice\". this again would be in line with paras 36 to 39 of associate builders [associate builders v. dda, (2015) 3 scc 49 : (2015) 2 scc (civ) 204] , as it is only such arbitral awards that shock the conscience of the court that can be set aside on this ground. 36. thus, it is clear that public policy of india is now constricted to mean firstly, that a domestic award is contrary to the fundamental policy of indian law, as understood in paras 18 and 27 of associate builders [associate builders v. dda, (2015) 3 scc 49: (2015) 2 scc (civ) 204], or secondly, that such award is against basic notions of justice or morality as understood in paras 36 to 39 of associate builders [associate builders v. dda, (2015) 3 scc 49 : (2015) 2 scc (civ) 204] . explanation 2 to section 34(2)(b)(ii) and explanation 2 to section 48(2)(b)(ii) was added by the amendment act only so that western geco [ongc v. western geco international ltd., 25 | p a g e (2014) 9 scc 263 : (2014) 5 scc (civ) 12] ,as understood in associate builders [associate builders v. dda, (2015) 3 scc 49 : (2015) 2 scc (civ) 204] , and paras 28 and 29 in particular, is now done away with. 37. insofar as domestic awards made in india are concerned, an additional ground is now available under sub-section (2-a), neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined added by the amendment act, 2015, to section 34. here, there must be patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, which refers to such illegality as goes to the root of the matter but which does not amount to mere erroneous application of the law. in short, what is not subsumed within \"the fundamental policy of indian law\", namely, the contravention of a statute not linked to public policy or public interest, cannot be brought in by the backdoor when it comes to setting aside an award on the ground of patent illegality. 38. secondly, it is also made clear that reappreciation of evidence, which is what an appellate court is permitted to do, cannot be permitted under the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. 39. to elucidate, para 42.1 of associate builders [associate builders v. dda, (2015) 3 scc 49 : (2015) 2 scc (civ) 204] , namely, a mere contravention of the substantive law of india, by itself, is no longer a ground available to set aside an arbitral award. para 42.2 of associate builders [associate builders v. dda, (2015) 3 scc 49 : (2015) 2 scc (civ) 204] , however, would remain, for if an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award and contravenes section 31(3) of the 1996 act, that would certainly amount to a patent illegality on the face of the award. 40. the change made in section 28(3) by the amendment act really follows what is stated in paras 42.3 to 45 in associate builders [associate builders v. dda, (2015) 3 scc 49 : (2015) 2 scc (civ) 204] , namely, that the construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes the contract in a manner that no fair-minded or reasonable person would; in short, that the arbitrator's view is not even a possible view to take. also, if the arbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits an error of jurisdiction. this ground of challenge will now fall within the new ground added under section 34(2-a). 41. what is important to note is that a decision which is perverse, as understood in paras 31 and 32 of associate builders [associate builders v. dda, (2015) 3 scc 49 : (2015) 2 scc (civ) 204] , while no longer being a ground for challenge under \"public policy of india\", would certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. thus, a finding based on no evidence at all or an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. additionally, a finding based on documents taken behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator would also qualify as a decision based on no evidence inasmuch as such decision is not based on evidence led by the parties, and therefore, would also have to be characterised as perverse.\" neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined 28. this court has in several other judgments interpreted section 34 of the 1996 act to stress on the restraint to be shown by courts while examining the validity of the arbitral awards. the limited grounds available to courts for annulment of arbitral awards are well known to legally trained minds. however, the difficulty arises in applying the well-established principles for interference to the facts of each case that come up before the courts. there is a disturbing tendency of courts setting aside arbitral awards, after dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases to come to a conclusion that the award needs intervention and thereafter, dubbing the award to be vitiated by either perversity or patent illegality, apart from the other grounds available for annulment of the award. this approach would lead to corrosion of the object of the 1996 act and the endeavours made to preserve this object, which is minimal judicial interference with arbitral awards. that apart, several judicial pronouncements of this court would become a dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by categorising them as perverse or patently illegal without appreciating the contours of the said expressions. 29. patent illegality should be illegality which goes to the root of the matter. in other words, every error of law committed by the arbitral tribunal would not fall within the expression 'patent illegality'. likewise, erroneous application of law cannot be categorised as patent illegality. in addition, contravention of law not linked to public policy or public interest is beyond the scope of the expression 'patent illegality'. what is prohibited is for courts to re-appreciate evidence to conclude that the award suffers from patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, as courts do not sit in appeal against the arbitral award. the permissible grounds for interference with a domestic award under section 34(2-a) on the ground of patent illegality is when the arbitrator takes a view which is not even a possible one, or interprets a clause in the contract in such a manner which no fair-minded or reasonable person would, or if the arbitrator commits an error of jurisdiction by wandering outside the contract and dealing with matters not allotted to them. an arbitral award stating no reasons for its findings would make itself susceptible to challenge on this account. the conclusions of the arbitrator which are based on no evidence or have been arrived at by ignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. also, consideration of documents which are not supplied to the other party is a facet of perversity falling within the expression 'patent illegality'. 32. in light of the principles elucidated herein for interference with neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined an arbitral award by a court in exercise of its jurisdiction under section 34 of the 1996 act, we proceed to consider the questions that arise in these appeals as to whether the division bench of the high court was right in setting aside the award of the arbitral tribunal dated 11.05.2017. 18. in the light of the aforesaid observations of the hon'ble apex court in a very recent decision, we may peruse the circumstances which have been considered by learned arbitrator . first of all, the reliefs contained in the claim petition are required to be reproduced since there was some grievance raised by learned counsel appearing for appellants about traveling beyond the reliefs by learned arbitrator and as such, the reliefs are incorporated hereunder:a) to make an appropriate order declaring an order dated 2nd february, 2015 of termination of dealership made by respondent no.3 and subsequent order dated 30 march, 2015 made by respondent no. 1 as illegal, without jurisdiction and bad in law and the tribunal be pleased to make an order declaring that the claimants have not violated any of the provisions of the terms and conditions of the dealership agreement as well as marketing discipline guidelines, 2012. b) to make an appropriate award in favour of the claimants and against the respondents declaring that the respondents have to restore the supply of petroleum products to the petrol pump of the claimants as per the agreed terms and conditions of the dealership agreement; c) to make an award in favour of the claimants and against the respondents for an amount of rs.7,12,33,389/-(rupees seven crores twelve lakhs thirty three thousand three hundred eighty nine only) in favour of the claimants as indicated in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim with an interest at the @6% per annum from the date of termination of dealership agreement till the date of realisation; neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined d) to make an order of cost in favour of the claimants and against the respondents; e) to make such other and further order as may be deemed just and proper in the facts and circumstances of the present case. 19. in the context of this, for proper adjudication, learned arbitrator has also framed the issues which issues are reflecting in paragraph 12 of the decision. said issues which have been framed on 22.10.2018 read as under:1. whether the claimants prove that there is no violation of clause 8.2 (iv) of mdg-2012 and clause numbers 45 (a), 45 (k) and 45 (0) of the dealership agreement? 2. whether the claimants prove that there was no unauthorised fitting done by the claimants in respect of hsd dus sr. no. 177 v and 189 v and whether the claimants prove that there was no suspicious electronic chip attached to the pulsar cable in motherboard end? 3. whether the claimants prove that the order dated 2nd february, 2015 of the termination of dealership agreement passed by the respondent (no. 3 is illegal, improper and deserves to be quashed and set aside? 4. whether the claimants prove that the order dated 30th march, 2015 passed by respondent no. 1 is without considering the evidence on record in its proper perspective and, therefore, the same deserves to be quashed and set aside? 5. whether the claimants prove that they are entitled to get losses and damages from the respondents as claimed in paragraph (5) of the statement of claims? 6. what order as to interest and costs? 20. after allowing the parties to the proceedings full neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined opportunity to adduce material and lead their case, a detailed award came to be passed on 21.2.2020. perusal of the said award is indicating clearly that learned arbitrator has minutely examined each and every contention raised by the appellants and has thoroughly scrutinized the material in the context of even contractual terms and relevant guidelines framed for that purpose and after analyzing the material, learned arbitrator observed that on the visit on 16.1.2014, certain photographs were taken and it was understood that electronic chips were found. it appears from the observations that claimant has admitted that when aac wr inspected the retail outlet on 16.1.2014, there was an additional suspicious electronic chip found though claimant has stated that he came to know about the same for the first time, but nonetheless, said factum about existence of electronic chip was dealt with. learned arbitrator has then elaborately considered even the scope of arbitration in the context of the contentions raised by the claimant. further, chapter-v of the guidelines which was tried to be emphasized to indicate types of irregularities at the retail outlets, same has been dealt with specifically as can be seen from paragraph 38 neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined and it was clearly observed that as desired, under clause 8.2(iv), testing was not undertaken by midco. it was also noticed by learned arbitrator that a termination of dealership which took place under the letter dated 2.2.2015 for the first time there appears to be a violation of clauses 45(a), 45(k) and 45(o) of the dealership agreement though on general, a reference was made about vioiation of clause 8.2(iv) of mgt 2022. but, upon examination of the relevant records, it was categorically found by learned arbitrator that notices which have been given had no specific reference about breach of clauses 45(a), 45(k) and 45(o) in particular and as such, it was categorically found that respondent authority, i.e. present appellant, came out with such violation against the claimants for the for first time without issuance of specific notice and qua that, right of effective representation is considered to have been adversely affected. 21. yet another circumstance which has also been considered, which is tried to be emphasized about affidavit of shri pipaliya dated 15.3.2015 and after consideration of overall material, it was also observed by learned arbitrator that at the time of neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined inspection, there was shortage of delivery found nor there was any variation visible and as such, upon overall consideration of the stand of both the sides, the claimant was not called upon by way of any notice in specific and as such, order of termination was found to be in violation of principle of natural justice and without application of mind. 22. further, yet another material aspect which has been noticed by the learned arbitrator is that in the order passed by the appellants, there is nothing to indicate that action of termination on account of critical irregularities has ever been approved by the officer of the rank of general manager and it was also found that order of termination is made by an authority which made an order under mdg, was not competent to make an order and as such not only the order of termination was found to be in conflict with principles of natural justice but said order was found as without the authority and nullity and as such, cannot sustain in the eye of law. with regard to this issue about approval by general manager, it was observed also on the basis of the material on record that no-doubt, there is a reference in the order made by the appellate authority about neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined approval of general manager (in-charge) but it was clearly found by learned arbitrator that reading of clause 8.8 would indicate that action of termination is required to be approved by general manager and above and not below the rank of general manager and therefore in paragraph 75, after referring to such issue of lack of authority or approval, learned arbitrator found that the order and action is unsustainable in the eye of law and for coming to this conclusion, we are satisfied that relevant clauses of the guidelines as well as terms of the dealership have been kept in mind and also basic principle of natural justice and for arriving at such conclusion, material which has been placed before learned arbitrator have been analyzed and examined and only thereafter the award came to be passed which is in our considered opinion cannot be said to be perverse in any form. 23. in the recent past, hon'ble the apex court had an occasion to deal with the issue regarding what would be patent illegality or perversity. relevant observations contained in paragraph 46 of the decision of hon'ble the apex court in the case of anglo american metallurgical coal pvt. limited v. mmtc limited reported in (2021) 3 scc 308, read thus:neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined 46. the judgment in associate builders (supra) examined each of the heads set out in renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co., 1994 supp (1) scc 644, together with the addition of the fourth head of \"patent illegality\" laid down in ongc ltd. v. saw pipes ltd., (2003) 5 scc 705. since we are concerned with the \"perversity principle\", the relevant paragraphs of this judgment are set out as follows: \"29. it is clear that the juristic principle of a \"judicial approach\" demands that a decision be fair, reasonable and objective. on the obverse side, anything arbitrary and whimsical would obviously not be a determination which would either be fair, reasonable or objective.\" \"31. the third juristic principle is that a decision which is perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would have arrived at the same is important and requires some degree of explanation. it is settled law that where: (i) a finding is based on no evidence, or (ii) an arbitral tribunal takes into account something irrelevant to the decision which it arrives at; or (iii) ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision, such decision would necessarily be perverse. 32. a good working test of perversity is contained in two judgments. in excise and taxation officer-cum-assessing authority v. gopi nath & sons [1992 supp (2) scc 312], it was held: (scc p. 317, para 7) \"7. . it is, no doubt, true that if a finding of fact is arrived at by ignoring or excluding relevant material or by taking into consideration irrelevant material or if the finding so outrageously defies logic as to suffer from the vice of irrationality incurring the blame of being perverse, then, the finding is rendered infirm in law.\" in kuldeep singh v. commr. of police [(1999) 2 scc 10] , it was held: (scc p. 14, para 10) \"10. a broad distinction has, therefore, to be maintained between the decisions which are perverse and those which are not. if a decision is arrived at on no evidence or evidence which is thoroughly unreliable and no reasonable person would act upon it, the order would be perverse. but if there is some neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined evidence on record which is acceptable and which could be relied upon, howsoever compendious it may be, the conclusions would not be treated as perverse and the findings would not be interfered with.\" 33. it must clearly be understood that when a court is applying the \"public policy\" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court of appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. a possible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. thus an award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be invalid on this score. once it is found that the arbitrators approach is not arbitrary or capricious, then he is the last word on facts. in p.r. shah, shares & stock brokers (p) ltd. v. b.h.h. securities (p) ltd. [(2012) 1 scc 594], this court held: (scc pp. 601-02, para 21) \"21. a court does not sit in appeal over the award of an arbitral tribunal by reassessing or reappreciating the evidence. an award can be challenged only under the grounds mentioned in section 34(2) of the act. the arbitral tribunal has examined the facts and held that both the second respondent and the appellant are liable. the case as put forward by the first respondent has been accepted. even the minority view was that the second respondent was liable as claimed by the first respondent, but the appellant was not liable only on the ground that the arbitrators appointed by the stock exchange under byelaw 248, in a claim against a non-member, had no jurisdiction to decide a claim against another member. the finding of the majority is that the appellant did the transaction in the name of the second respondent and is therefore, liable along with the second respondent. therefore, in the absence of any ground under section 34(2) of the act, it is not possible to re-examine the facts to find out whether a different decision can be arrived at.\" 34. it is with this very important caveat that the two fundamental principles which form part of the fundamental policy of indian law (that the arbitrator must have a judicial approach and that he must not act perversely) are to be understood.\" (pages 75-77) \"42. in the 1996 act, this principle is substituted by the \"patent illegality\" principle which, in turn, contains three neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined subheads: 42.1. (a) a contravention of the substantive law of india would result in the death knell of an arbitral award. this must be understood in the sense that such illegality must go to the root of the matter and cannot be of a trivial nature. this again is really a contravention of section 28(1) (a) of the act, which reads as under: \"28. rules applicable to substance of dispute. --(1) where the place of arbitration is situated in india-(a) in an arbitration other than an international commercial arbitration, the arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute submitted to arbitration in accordance with the substantive law for the time being in force in india;\" 42.2. (b) a contravention of the arbitration act itself would be regarded as a patent illegality -for example if an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award in contravention of section 31(3) of the act, such award will be liable to be set aside. 42.3. (c) equally, the third subhead of patent illegality is really a contravention of section 28(3) of the arbitration act, which reads as under: \"28. rules applicable to substance of dispute. --(1)-(2)*** (3) in all cases, the arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract and shall take into account the usages of the trade applicable to the transaction.\" this last contravention must be understood with a caveat. an arbitral tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract, but if an arbitrator construes a term of the contract in a reasonable manner, it will not mean that the award can be set aside on this ground. construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide unless the arbitrator construes the contract in such a way that it could be said to be something that no fairminded or reasonable person could do.\" 24. based upon such broad proposition, we from the record here in the case on hand do not find any such patent illegality or perversity, since the findings of the learned arbitrator is based neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined upon evidence, has taken into consideration all the relevant circumstances and has not ignored any vital evidence. if the view of interpretation of any clause is not digestible to the appellants, same ipso facto would not construe the conclusion as perverse or suffering from any patent illegality. we have categorically found from the award passed by learned arbitrator that almost each and every issue has been dealt with and conclusion is arrived only after critical analysis of the stand of both the sides and as such, ex-facie we see no perversity in the award passed by learned arbitrator. 25. yet another issue which has been tried to be raised by learned senior counsel mr. bhatt for the appellants is that termination of dealership no-doubt is held to be bad in law, but then consequential direction which has been granted about restoration of supply of petroleum products as if dealership is in existence is outside the scope of even pleadings or the issue raised before it. now, at this stage, we may observe that learned arbitrator has specifically found on the basis of the material on record that termination of dealership agreement action is clearly in violation of the principles of natural justice and same neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined having been set aside, consequence is that situation would erupt as if there is no such order of termination of dealership and as such, consequential direction which has been given that has been clearly in the context of the reliefs which have been prayed for. it is not that learned arbitrator has moulded the reliefs or passed the award in absence of such reliefs and for that purpose, we may refer to the application in terms of paragraph 11(b), wherein specific restoration of supply request was made in the plaint and as such, by no stretch of imagination, it can be observed that learned arbitrator has overstepped and passed a direction beyond the reliefs. hence, said contention is ex-facie not available to the appellant. 26. so, from the overall consideration of the material on record, though this court is not expecting to re-appreciate or reexamine the merit, which had already been examined by learned arbitrator, still a perusal of overall material would clearly indicate that there is neither any perversity nor any irregularity patent in nature which may permit us to set at naught the conclusion which has been arrived at by learned arbitrator. as said earlier, a very limited scope is available to the court under neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined section 37 of the act while examining the award of learned arbitrator and a very limited open widow is provided by the hon'ble apex court, either it is patent illegality, perversity or against the public policy which none of the issues are established before us by learned counsel appearing for the appellants. 27. we could have understood if the finding was found on no evidence or totally against the weight of evidence, we would have probably examined differently, but here we saw no such circumstance visible from the record which persuaded us to come to a conclusion as suggested by learned senior counsel for the appellants. accordingly, the award is not found to be either perverse or suffering from any patent illegality and as such keeping in view the salutary proposition propounded in recent past in the decision of hon'ble the apex court on the scope of section 37 of the act, as referred to above, we are of the opinion that appellants have not made out any case for interference. as said by the hon'ble apex court that re-appreciation of matters on facts as well as on law is outside the purview of examination and if such exercise is to be undertaken, same would frustrate neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined the very purpose and object for which a separate alternative redressal mechanism is set up and as such on the basis of facts on hand, we are in complete conformity with the observations made by the hon'ble apex court in the case of delhi airport metro express private limited (supra) and have found that no case is made out to call for any interference. 28. a close perusal of section 14 indicates that case of the appellants is not possible to be brought within the purview as none of the contingencies stipulated in section 14 are attracted in the case on hand and such contention raised learned counsel for the appellants is devoid of merit. 29. even in the context of aforesaid discussion and analysis of the proposition of law on the issue, we are also quite satisfied that there is no error committed by the court below in not entertaining the application under section 34 of the act moved by present appellants. the view taken by the court below is also in consonance with spirit in which proposition is made hereinbefore by the hon'ble apex court. hence, in absence of any patent illegality or perversity, we are not inclined to exercise neutral citation c/fa/4226/2022 cav judgment dated: 14/03/2023 undefined our jurisdiction under section 37 of the act. hence, we deem it proper not to entertain the appeal. accordingly, appeal stands dismissed. 30. since the main appeal is dismissed, civil application is ordered to be consigned to record. sd/(ashutosh shastri, j) sd/(nisha m. thakore,j) omkar"
