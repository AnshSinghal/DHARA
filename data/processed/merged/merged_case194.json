There is delay of 04 days in filing appeal No.03/2019\n\n   and there are certain objections pointed out by the office. \n\n   2.             For the reasons mentioned in the application under\n\n   Section 5 of the Limitation Act, the same is allowed. Delay in filing\n\n   appeal No.03/2019 is thus condoned. \n\n   3.

With the consent of learned counsel for the parties, the\n\n   matters have been heard finally. \n\n   5.             These special appeals under Section 37 of the Act of\n\n   1996 read with Rule 134 of the Rajasthan High Court Rules have\n\n   been preferred claiming the following reliefs:\n\n\n          Sac No.3/2019:\n          \"It is, therefore, most humbly and respectfully prayed\n          that record of the case may kindly be called for and the\n          present appeal may kindly be allowed and the impugned\n          order    dated   02.05.2019         passed       in   Sb     Arbitration\n          Application No.06/2018 may kindly be set aside and the\n          writ petition filed by the appellants may kindly be ordered\n          to be allowed in toto. \n                  Any other order, which this Hon'ble Court deems fit,\n          just and proper in the facts and circumstances of this\n          case, may kindly be passed in favour of the appellants.\"\n\n\n                           (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm) \n                                                (3 of 46)                 [Sac-3/2019 ] \n\n\n\n\n     Sac No.2/2019: \n     \"It is, therefore, most humbly and respectfully prayed\n     that record of the case may kindly be called for and the\n     present appeal may kindly be allowed and the impugned\n     order    dated   02.05.2019         passed       in   Sb     Arbitration\n     Application No.28/2017 may kindly be set aside and the\n     writ petition filed by the appellants may kindly be ordered\n     to be allowed in toto. \n             Any other order, which this Hon'ble Court deems fit,\n     just and proper in the facts and circumstances of this\n     case, may kindly be passed in favour of the appellants.\" \n\n\n\n6.           The present appeals are arising out of a common\n\nimpugned order dated 02.05.2019 passed by learned Single Judge \n\nin S.B. Arbitration Applications No.28/2017 and 06/2018. Vide the\n\nsaid impugned order, the aforementioned applications under\n\nSection 34 read with Section 48 of the Arbitration and Conciliation\n\nAct, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 1996') have been\n\ndecided by the learned Single Judge while holding against the\n\nappellant-Hindustan Zinc Limited (for short, 'Hzl'), by giving a\n\nfinding that the applications against the impugned arbitral awards\n\ndated 17.08.2017 passed by the Arbitral Tribunal appointed by\n\nLondon Court of International Arbitration, as having been not\n\nmaintainable.\n\n7 .           Brief facts of the case, as noticed by this Court, are\n\nthat the parties had entered into an agreement that provided that\n\nthe contract and the arbitration clause were to be governed by law\n\nof England and Wales, and all the disputes were to be finally\n\nsettled by the arbitration venue in London, United Kingdom and in\n\naccordance with the Rules of the London Court of International\n\nArbitration (hereinafter referred to as 'the Lcia Rules'). The\n\n\n                      (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm) \n                                                  (4 of 46)                [Sac-3/2019 ] \n\n\n\narbitration clause was invoked by the Hzl and its request for\n\narbitration was made to the Registrar of London Court of\n\nInternational Arbitration (for short, 'Lcia'), wherein the Hzl\n\nindicated the seat of Arbitration to be London, while taking specific\n\nplea in regard thereto. The arbitration awards dated 17.08.2017\n\nwere passed against Hzl.\n\n8.         Mr. Sumeet Lall, learned counsel for the respondent, at\n\nthe threshold, has raised a preliminary objection with regard to\n\nmaintainability    of     the      appeals,        by     making    the     following\n\nsubmissions. \n\n9.         Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the\n\ninstant appeals are not maintainable inter alia being contrary to\n\nthe ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bgs Sgs\n\nSoma Jv Vs. Nhpc Ltd., reported in 2019 Scc Online Sc\n\n1585. Learned counsel for the respondent also submitted that the\n\nappellant-HZL itself had averred that the seat of arbitration was\n\nLondon, United Kingdom, thereby there was an express exclusion\n\nof Part I of the Act of 1996.\n\n10.        Learned counsel for the respondent further submitted\n\nthat an appeal under Section 37 of the Act of 1996 can only be\n\npreferred from the orders set out under clause a, b & c under\n\nSection 37 and from no others. \n\nSection 37(1) of the Act of 1996 reads as under:\n\n\n      \"37. Appealable Orders.- (1) An appeal shall lie from the\n      following orders (and from no others) to the Court\n      authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of\n      the Court passing the order, namely:-\n      (a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section\n      8;\n\n\n\n                        (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm) \n                                                   (5 of 46)                     [Sac-3/2019]\n\n      (b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under\n      section 9;\n      (c) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award\n      under section 34.\" \n\n11.        Learned counsel for the respondent also submitted that\n\nthe impugned order has been passed by the learned Single Judge\n\non the basis that since the seat of the Arbitration was London,\n\nUnited Kingdom, therefore, the arbitration applications under\n\nSection 34 of the Act of 1996 were not maintainable, which makes\n\nit all the more imperative that the jurisdiction of Section 37 of the\n\nAct of 1996 is not available to the present appellants. \n\n12.        Learned counsel for the respondent has principally\n\nrelied upon the judgment of Bgs Sgs Soma Jv (supra), to drive\n\nhome the issue of maintainability as well as the question\n\nregarding seat of arbitration. Relevant portion of the said\n\njudgment in Bgs Sgs Soma Jv (supra) reads as under:\n\n\n        \"2. Three appeals before us raise questions as to\n        maintainability of appeals under Section 37 of the\n        Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ( hereinafter\n        referred to as \"the Arbitration Act, 1996\"), and, given\n        the arbitration clause in these proceedings, whether\n        the \"seat\" of the arbitration proceedings is New Delhi\n        or Faridabad, consequent upon which a petition under\n        Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 may be filed\n        dependent on where the seat of arbitration is located.\n        6. Dr.      Abhishek       Manu       Singhvi,        learned      Senior\n        Advocate appearing on behalf of the Petitioner in Slp\n        (C) No. 25618 of 2018, has assailed the impugned\n        High Court judgment on both counts. According to him, \n        on a combined reading of Section 13 of the Commercial\n        Courts Act, 2015 and Section 37 of the Arbitration Act,\n        1996,      it   becomes      clear      that   Section       13    of   the\n        Commercial         Courts        Act,      2015       only        provides\n        the forum for challenge, whereas Section 37 of the\n\n                         (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm)\n                                        (6 of 46)                 [Sac-3/2019 ] \n\nArbitration Act, 1996 - which is expressly referred to in\nthe proviso to Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts\nAct, 2015 - circumscribes the right of appeal. He\ncontended that this when read with Section 5 of the\nArbitration Act, 1996, makes it clear that only certain\njudgments and orders are appealable, and no appeal\nlies under any provision outside Section 37 of the\nArbitration Act, 1996. He contended that the High\nCourt was manifestly wrong when it said that the\npresent appeal was appealable under Section 37(1)(c)\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996 as being an appeal against\nan order refusing to set aside an arbitral award under\nSection 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. According to\nDr. Singhvi, an order which allows an application under\nSection 151 read with Order Vii Rule 10 of the Cpc can\nby no stretch of the imagination amount to an order\nrefusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section\n34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. For this proposition, he\nstrongly relied upon on our judgment in Kandla Export\nCorporation v. Oci Corporation, (2018) 14 Scc 715. \nOn the second point, he read out the impugned\njudgment in detail, and stated that the ultimate\nconclusion that New Delhi was only a \"venue\" and not\nthe \"seat\" of the arbitration was incorrect, as the\nparties have chosen to have sittings at New Delhi, as a\nresult of which it is clear that the Arbitral Tribunal\nconsidered that the award made at New Delhi would be\nmade at \"the seat\" of the arbitral proceedings between\nthe parties. He further added that it was clear that\neven if both New Delhi and Faridabad had jurisdiction,\nNew Delhi being the choice of the parties, the principle\ncontained     in Hakam           Singh v. Gammon              (India)\nLtd., (1971) 1 Scc 286, would govern. He referred in\ncopious detail to many judgments of this Court,\nincluding the Five Judge Bench in Bharat Aluminium\nCo. (Balco) v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Service,\nInc., (2012) 9 Scc 552, Indus Mobile Distribution\nPrivate     Limited v. Datawind           Innovations         Private\nLimited, (2017)      7    Scc      678,     and     various    other\njudgments to buttress his submissions. According to \n\n              (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm) \n                                           (7 of 46)                     [Sac-3/2019]\n\nhim,    the     recent     judgment        delivered         in Union    of\nIndia v. Hardy         Exploration       and     Production         (India)\nInc., 2018 Scc OnLine Sc 1640 queers the pitch, in\nthat it is directly contrary to the Five Judge bench\ndecision in Balco (supra). It is only as a result of the\nconfusion       caused      by     judgments          such         as Hardy\nExploration and Production (India) Inc. (supra) that\nthe impugned judgment has arrived at the wrong\nconclusion that New Delhi is not the \"seat\", but only\nthe \"venue\" of the present arbitral proceedings. He,\ntherefore, in the course of his submissions argued that\nthis confusion should be removed, and exhorted us to\ndeclare that Hardy Exploration and Production (India)\nInc. (supra) was not correctly decided, being contrary\nto the larger bench in Balco (supra). \n13. The interplay between Section 37 of the Arbitration\nAct, 1996 and Section 13 of the Commercial Courts\nAct, 2015, has been laid down in some detail in the\njudgment in Kandla Export Corporation (supra). The\nprecise        question     that      arose       in Kandla          Export\nCorporation (supra) was as to whether an appeal,\nwhich was not maintainable under Section 50 of the\nArbitration Act, 1996, is nonetheless maintainable\nunder Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act,\n2015.     In    this   context,      after     setting       out    various\nprovisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and the\nArbitration Act, 1996, this Court held:\n\n\"13. Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, with\nwhich we are immediately concerned in these appeals,\nis in two parts. The main provision is, as has been\ncorrectly submitted by Shri Giri, a provision which\nprovides for appeals from judgments, orders and\ndecrees of the Commercial Division of the High Court. \nTo this main provision, an exception is carved out by\nthe proviso...\"\n\n14. The proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall\nlie from such orders passed by the Commercial Division\nof the High Court that are specifically enumerated\nunder Order 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure Code,\n\n                 (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm)\n                                                   (8 of 46)                  [Sac-3/2019]\n\n       1908, and Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. It will at\n       once be noticed that orders that are not specifically\n       enumerated under Order 43 Cpc would, therefore, not\n       be appealable, and appeals that are mentioned in\n       Section 37 of the Arbitration Act alone are appeals that\n       can be made to the Commercial Appellate Division of a\n       High Court. \n       16 . This provision is conspicuous by its absence in\n       Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, which alone\n       can be looked at for the purpose of filing appeals\n       against orders setting aside, or refusing to set aside\n       awards under Section 34. Also, what is missed by the\n       impugned judgment is the words \"under Section 34\".\n       Thus, the refusal to set aside an arbitral award must\n       be under Section 34, i.e., after the grounds set out in\n       Section 34 have been applied to the arbitral award in\n       question, and after the Court has turned down such\n       grounds. Admittedly, on the facts of these cases, there\n       was no adjudication under Section 34 of the Arbitration\n       Act, 1996 - all that was done was that the Special\n       Commercial Court at Gurugram allowed an application\n       filed under Section 151 read with Order Vii Rule 10\n       Cpc, determining that the Special Commercial Court at\n       Gurugram had no jurisdiction to proceed further with\n       the    Section     34     application,       and       therefore,    such\n       application      would      have      to    be     returned     to    the\n       competent court situate at New Delhi.\n       19. The reasoning in this judgment commends itself to\n       us, as a distinction is made between judgments which\n       either set aside, or refuse to set aside, an arbitral\n       award after the court applies its mind to Section 34 of\n       the Arbitration Act, 1996, as against preliminary orders\n       of condonation of delay, which do not in any way\n       impact the arbitral award that has been assailed.\n       22. It is clear, therefore, that the appeals filed in the\n       present case do not fall within Section 37 of the\n       Arbitration Act, 1996 and are not maintainable.\"\n\n13 .          Learned counsel for the respondent further submitted\n\nthat it is settled position of law that an appeal is a creature of\n\n                        (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm)\n                                               (9 of 46)           [Sac-3/2019 ] \n\n\n\nstatute and must either be found within the four corners of the\n\nstatute or it shall not be maintainable , and in this regard, he has\n\nrelied upon rendered by Division Bench of the Hon'ble Delhi High\n\nCourt   in   South   Delhi       Municipal          Corporation   Vs.   Tech\n\nMahindra, reported in 2019 Scc OnLine Del 11863, relevant\n\nportion of which reads as under:\n\n\n        \"2. The respondent's threshold contention was that the\n        appeal is per se not maintainable in view of the\n        phraseology of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts\n        Act, 2015. In answer, Mr. Sanjay Poddar, learned\n        senior counsel urges on behalf of Sdmc that the\n        impugned order in all intents and purposes amounts to\n        an attachment before judgment, as the awarded\n        amount is directed to be secured, and is therefore\n        covered by provisions of Order Xxxviii Rule 2 of Code\n        of Civil Procedure (C.P.C.). It is further submitted that\n        such order is appealable by virtue of Section 13(1) of\n        the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (hereafter \"the Cc\n        Act\") read with Order Xliii Rule 1(q) of the Cpc, given\n        that the mandate of Section 36 of the Act, Cpc applies\n        to proceedings under the Arbitration and Conciliation\n        Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Arbitration\n        Act\").\n        7. The judgment in Kandla Export Corporation (supra)\n        noticed the Statement of Objects and Reasons, of the\n        Commercial Courts Act. The Supreme Court had to deal\n        with an Enforcement Appeal before a commercial\n        appellate court , in regard to a foreign award, and its\n        maintainability . The Supreme Court noticed not only\n        the Statement of Objects and Reasons but also various\n        other provisions, especially the embargo placed upon\n        the courts, embodied in Sections 8 and 11 and the\n        overriding nature of the Cc Act, to conclude that once\n        appeals were held to be barred, an appeal to the\n        Division Bench appeal - against a Commercial Court's\n        order in an enforcement of a foreign award issue was\n\n\n                     (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm) \n                                        (10 of 46)                [Sac-3/2019 ]\n\nnot maintainable. The Court took into account its\nprevious rulings in Fuerst Day Lawson Limited v. Jindal\nExports Limited, (2011) 8 Scc 333 and some other\njudgments. \n8. The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the\nCommercial Courts Act, states that:\n\n\"The proposal to provide for speedy disposal of high\nvalue    commercial         disputes        has      been     under\nconsideration of the Government for quite some time. \nThe high value commercial disputes involve complex\nfacts and questions of law. Therefore, there is a need\nto provide for an independent mechanism for their\nearly   resolution.     Early     resolution        of    commercial\ndisputes shall create a positive image to the investor\nworld about the independent and responsive Indian\nlegal system. \n\nxxx \n\n6. It is proposed to introduce the Commercial Courts,\nCommercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division\nof High Courts Bill, 2015 to replace the Commercial\nCourts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate\nDivision of High Courts Ordinance, 2015 which inter\nalia, provides for the following namely:--\n\n(i) constitution of the Commercial Courts at District\nlevel except for the territory over which any High Court\nis having ordinary original civil jurisdiction;\n\n(ii) constitution of the Commercial Divisions in those\nHigh Courts which are already exercising ordinary civil\njurisdiction and they shall have territorial jurisdiction\nover such areas on which it has original jurisdiction; \n\n(iii) constitution of the Commercial Appellate Division\nin all the High Courts to hear the appeals against the\nOrders of the Commercial Courts and the Orders of the\nCommercial Division of the High Court;\n\n\n\n\n              (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm)\n                                         (11 of 46)                    [Sac-3/2019 ] \n\n(iv)    the   minimum       pecuniary         jurisdiction    of    such\nCommercial       Courts         and    Commercial          Division    is\nproposed as one crore rupees; and\n\n(v) to amend the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as\napplicable to the Commercial Courts and Commercial\nDivisions which shall prevail over the existing High\nCourts Rules and other provisions of the Code of Civil\nProcedure, 1908 so as to improve the efficiency and\nreduce delays in disposal of commercial cases.\n\n7. The proposed Bill shall accelerate economic growth,\nimprove the international image of the Indian Justice\ndelivery system, and the faith of the investor world in\nthe legal culture of the nation.\"\n\n9. It    is   quite     evident       that     the    legislative      or\nParliamentary         intent,    was     to     confer      upon      the\nCommercial Appellate Courts and Commercial appellate\nDivision Bench of a High Court, extremely limited\njurisdiction and circumscribe the appellate jurisdiction. \nThus, in interlocutory matters, as it were, Commercial\nAppellate Division possesses jurisdiction in matters\nenumerated in the Order Xliii Rule 1 - no less no\nmore. Likewise, with respect to the appeals against\norders made in the course of proceedings under the\nArbitration Act , the Court's power is delineated to what\nis enumerated in Section 37 of Cpc.\n10. In Kandla Export Corporation (supra), the Court\nheld as follows:\n\n\"14. Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, with\nwhich we are immediately concerned in these appeals,\nis in two parts. The main provision is, as has been\ncorrectly submitted by Shri Giri, a provision which\nprovides for appeals from judgments, orders and\ndecrees of the Commercial Division of the High Court. \nTo this main provision, an exception is carved out by\nthe proviso. The primary purpose of a proviso is to\nqualify the generality of the main part by providing an\nexception, which has been set out with great felicity\n\n\n\n               (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm) \n                                       (12 of 46)                   [Sac-3/2019]\n\nin Cit v. Indo Mercantile Bank Ltd., 1959 Supp (2)\nScr 256 at 266-267, thus:\n\n******** *********\n\n15. The proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall\nlie from such orders passed by the Commercial Division\nof the High Court that are specifically enumerated\nunder Order Xliii of the Code of Civil Procedure Code,\n1908, and Section 37 Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.\nIt will at once be noticed that orders that are not\nspecifically enumerated under Order Xliii of the Cpc\nwould, therefore, not be appealable, and appeals that\nare mentioned in Section 37 of the Arbitration Act\nalone are appeals that can be made to the Commercial\nAppellate Division of a High Court. \n\n16. Thus, an order which refers parties to arbitration\nunder Section 8, not being appealable under Section\n37(1)(a), would not be appealable under Section 13(1)\nof the Commercial Courts Act. Similarly, an appeal\nrejecting a plea referred to in sub-sections (2) and (3)\nof Section 16 of the Arbitration Act would equally not\nbe appealable under Section 37(2)(a) and, therefore,\nunder Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act.\"\n\n11. The reference to Order Xliii Rule 1 - relied upon\non behalf of Sdmc in the context of this case, in the\nopinion of this court, is misplaced. Order Xliii Rule\n1(q), upon which considerable emphasis was placed to\nsay that the appeals against directions to secure\namounts during pendency of proceedings applies to\nsuits and suits alone (as is evident from Order Xxxviii\nand   all   the   attendant        provisions),          and not    to\nproceedings in respect of an award. Thus, reference to\nOrder Xliii to \"draw in\" the jurisdiction of the Division\nBench, is wholly unjustified. Likewise, the Court also\nrejects the appellant's arguments that Section 36 of\nthe Arbitration Act attracts the provisions of the Code\nof Civil Procedure. In fact, Section 36 refers to and\ndirects courts to follow Cpc in proceedings relating to\nenforcement of arbitral awards. The logical corollary is\n\n             (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm) \n                                               (13 of 46)              [Sac-3/2019] \n\n      that the provisions of the Cpc that deal with the\n      proceeding for enforcement of decrees and orders\n      (such as in execution like Order Xxi Cpc), would be\n      attracted. \n      12. In view of the above discussions, we conclude that\n      the present appeal is not maintainable. The appellant's\n      remedy clearly lies elsewhere. An attempt was made to\n      urge that no litigant can be deprived of remedy if there\n      is a grievance: ubi jus ibi remedium; however, that\n      argument is wholly without substance because an\n      appeal, it has been repeatedly emphasised, is a specific\n      creation of statute and cannot be claimed as a matter\n      of    right.   This    was      explained        pithily   in Ganga\n      Bai v. Vijay Kumar, (1974) 2 Scc 393, in the following\n      terms:\n\n      \"There is a basic distinction between the right of suit\n      and the right of appeal. There is an inherent right in\n      every person to bring suit of a civil nature and unless\n      the suit is barred by statute one may, at one's peril,\n      bring a suit of one's choice. It is no answer to a suit\n      howsoever frivolous the claim, that the law confers no\n      such right to sue. A suit for its maintainability requires\n      no authority of law and it is enough that no statute\n      bars the suit. But the position in regard to appeals is\n      quite the opposite. The right of appeal inheres in no\n      one and therefore an appeal for its maintainability\n      must have the clear authority of law. That explains\n      why the right of appeal is described as a creature of\n      statute.\"\n\n      13. In view of the above discussion, it is held that the\n      present appeal is plainly not maintainable by virtue of\n      provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015; the\n      appeal is therefore dismissed. No costs.\" \n\n14.        Learned counsel for the respondent has further relied\n\nupon Harmanprit Singh Sidhu Vs. Arcadia Shares & Stock\n\nBrokers Pvt. Ltd., reported in 2016 Scc OnLine Del 5383,\n\nwhereby the Division Bench of Hon'ble Delhi High Court has\n\n\n                     (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm)\n                                              (14 of 46)         [Sac-3/2019 ]\n\n\n\nexpressly recognized a distinction between the judgments which\n\neither set aside or refuse to set aside an arbitral award after the\n\nCourt applies its mind to Section 37 of the Act of 1996 as against\n\nthe preliminary orders, including those deciding maintainability\n\nand condonation of delay, which do not in any way impact the\n\narbitral award that has been assailed. Relevant portion of said\n\njudgment reads as under:\n\n\n       \"8. Insofar as Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act\n       is concerned , while it is true that it speaks of appeals\n       from a judgment or order, the proviso to Section 13(1)\n       makes it clear that the appeal would lie from such\n       orders passed by, inter alia, a Commercial Division\n       that are specifically enumerated under Order 43 of the\n       Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (as amended by the\n       Commercial Courts Act) and Section 37 of the A&C Act.\n       The use of the word 'and' in the proviso to Section\n       13(1) is only to specify that an appeal would lie against\n       any order passed by, inter alia, a Commercial Division,\n       which finds mention in the list of orders specified in\n       Order 43, Cpc and Section 37 of the A&C Act. It is an\n       admitted position that the impugned order having been\n       passed in proceedings arising out of an arbitral award\n       would have to be governed by Section 37 of the A&C\n       Act. \n\n       9 . On a plain reading of Section 13 of the Commercial\n       Courts Act , it is evident that it does not amplify the\n       scope of appealable orders specified in Section 37 of\n       the A&C Act. It actually reiterates that, in a matter of\n       arbitration, an appeal shall lie only from the orders\n       specified in Section 37 of the A&C Act. In fact, Section\n       13(2) reinforces this by providing that notwithstanding\n       anything contained in any other law for the time being\n       in force or the Letters Patent of a High Court, no\n       appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a\n       Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise\n\n\n                    (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm) \n                                       (15 of 46)               [Sac-3/2019 ] \n\nthan   in   accordance      with     the     provisions   of   the\nCommercial Courts Act.\n\n10. Coming to Section 37(1), it is evident that an\nappeal can lie from only the orders specified in clauses\n(a), (b) or (c). In other words, an appeal under Section\n37 would only be maintainable against (a) an order\nrefusing to refer the parties to arbitration under\nSection 8 of the A&C Act; (b) an order granting or\nrefusing to grant any measure under Section 9 of the\nA&C Act; or (c) an order setting aside or refusing to set\naside an arbitral award under Section 34 of the A&C\nAct. The impugned order is clearly not relatable to\nSections 8 or 9 of the A&C Act. It was sought to be\ncontended by the learned counsel for the appellant that\nthe present appeal would fall within Section 37(1)(c)\nwhich relates to an order \"setting aside\" or \"refusing to\nset aside\" an arbitral award under Section 34. We are\nunable to accept this proposition. By virtue of the\nimpugned order, the arbitral award dated 10.09.2013\nhas not been set aside. Nor has the court, at this\nstage, refused to set aside the said arbitral award\nunder Section 34 of the A&C Act. In fact, the appellant\nin whose favour the award has been made, would only\nbe aggrieved if the award were to have been set aside\nin whole or in part. That has not happened. What the\nlearned single Judge has done is to have condoned the\ndelay in re-filing of the petition under Section 34. This\nhas not, in any way, impacted the award. \n\n13. In sum, the impugned order does not fall within\nthe category of appealable orders specified in Section\n37(1) of the A&C Act. Therefore, even if the provisions\nof Section 37(1) are read with Section 13 of the\nCommercial Courts Act, the present appeal is not\nmaintainable. This, however, does not mean that the\nappellant cannot take up the ground that is sought to\nbe urged before us if the decision in Omp 294/2014\n(under Section 34 of the A&C Act) goes against him. In\nother words, if the arbitral award is set aside in part or\nin whole and the appellant is aggrieved thereby, he\n\n             (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm) \n                                               (16 of 46)                [Sac-3/2019]\n\n      may prefer an appeal under Section 37 of the A&C Act\n      on merits as also on the ground that the delay in re-\n      filing ought not to have been condoned. This is in line\n      with the scheme of the A&C Act of not, in any way,\n      stalling the proceedings thereunder. For example,\n      under Section 13(4) of the A&C Act, if a challenge to\n      an arbitrator is not successful , the arbitral tribunal is\n      required to continue the arbitral proceedings and make\n      an arbitral award and, in such an instance, as provided\n      in Section 13(5) of the A&C Act, the party challenging\n      the arbitrator may make an application for setting\n      aside such an arbitral award in accordance with Section\n      34. In other words, recourse to a remedy for an\n      unsuccessful challenge to an arbitrator is deferred till\n      the stage of the making of the award. Similarly, under\n      Section 16, an arbitral tribunal may rule on its\n      jurisdiction. In a case where the arbitral tribunal\n      rejects a plea with regard to its jurisdiction, it is\n      enjoined by Section 16(5) of the A&C Act to continue\n      with the arbitral proceedings and to make the arbitral\n      award. Section 16(6) stipulates that a party aggrieved\n      by such an arbitral award may make an application for\n      setting aside the award in accordance with Section 34.\n      Here, too, the unsuccessful party, who challenges the\n      jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal, is asked to wait till\n      the award is made. The remedy of questioning the\n      decision of the arbitral tribunal with regard to the\n      arbitrator's   jurisdiction       in    such     a    case   is   not\n      extinguished but is merely deferred till the making of\n      the arbitral award. In similar vein, in the present case,\n      the remedy of challenging the decision of condoning\n      the delay in re-filing is not extinguished but is deferred\n      till the final decision of the court on the pending\n      Section 34 petition. \n\n      14. In view of the discussion above, the present\n      appeal is not maintainable and is dismissed.\"\n\n\n15.

Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, with\n       which we are immediately concerned in these appeals,\n       is in two parts. The main provision is, as has been\n       correctly submitted by Shri Giri, a provision which\n       provides for appeals from judgments, orders and\n       decrees of the Commercial Division of the High Court. \n       To this main provision, an exception is carved out by\n       the proviso.

The proper function of a proviso is to except and\ndeal with a case which would otherwise fall within the\ngeneral language of the main enactment, and its effect\nis confined to that case.

It has to operate in the same field and if the\nlanguage of the main enactment is clear it cannot be\nused     for    the    purpose       of   interpreting       the   main\nenactment or to exclude by implication what the\nenactment clearly says unless the words of the proviso\nare such that that is its necessary effect.

The proviso goes on to state that an appeal shall\nlie from such orders passed by the Commercial Division\nof the High Court that are specifically enumerated\n\n                 (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm)\n                                        (19 of 46)         [Sac-3/2019 ] \n\nunder Order 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure Code,\n1908, and Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. It will at\nonce be noticed that orders that are not specifically\nenumerated under Order 43 Cpc would, therefore, not\nbe appealable, and appeals that are mentioned in\nSection 37 of the Arbitration Act alone are appeals that\ncan be made to the Commercial Appellate Division of a\nHigh Court. \n15. Thus, an order which refers parties to arbitration\nunder Section 8, not being appealable under Section\n37(1)(a), would not be appealable under Section 13(1)\nof the Commercial Courts Act. Similarly, an appeal\nrejecting a plea referred to in sub-sections (2) and (3)\nof Section 16 of the Arbitration Act would equally not\nbe appealable under Section 37(2)(a) and, therefore,\nunder Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. \n20. Given the judgment of this Court in Fuerst Day\nLawson [Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. v. Jindal Exports Ltd.,\n(2011) 8 Scc 333 : (2011) 4 Scc (Civ) 178] , which\nParliament is presumed to know when it enacted the\nArbitration Amendment Act, 2015, and given the fact\nthat no change was made in Section 50 of the\nArbitration Act when the Commercial Courts Act was\nbrought into force, it is clear that Section 50 is a\nprovision contained in a self-contained code on matters\npertaining to arbitration, and which is exhaustive in\nnature. It carries the negative import mentioned in\npara 89 of Fuerst Day Lawson [Fuerst Day Lawson\nLtd. v. Jindal Exports Ltd., (2011) 8 Scc 333 : (2011)\n4 Scc (Civ) 178] that appeals which are not mentioned\ntherein, are not permissible. This being the case, it is\nclear that Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act,\nbeing a general provision vis--vis arbitration relating\nto appeals arising out of commercial disputes, would\nobviously not apply to cases covered by Section 50 of\nthe Arbitration Act. \n21 . However, the question still arises as to why\nSection 37 of the Arbitration Act was expressly\nincluded in the proviso to Section 13(1) of the\nCommercial Courts Act, which is equally a special\n\n              (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm)\n                                        (20 of 46)                [Sac-3/2019]\n\nprovision of appeal contained in a self-contained code,\nwhich in any case would be outside Section 13(1) of\nthe Commercial Courts Act. One answer is that this\nwas done ex abundanti cautela. Another answer may\nbe that as Section 37 itself was amended by the\nArbitration Amendment Act, 2015, which came into\nforce on the same day as the Commercial Courts Act,\nParliament   thought,      in    its   wisdom,       that   it   was\nnecessary to emphasise that the amended Section 37\nwould have precedence over the general provision\ncontained in Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts\nAct. Incidentally, the amendment of 2015 introduced\none more category into the category of appealable\norders in the Arbitration Act, namely, a category where\nan order is made under Section 8 refusing to refer\nparties to arbitration. Parliament may have found it\nnecessary to emphasise the fact that an order referring\nparties to arbitration under Section 8 is not appealable\nunder Section 37(1)(a) and would, therefore, not be\nappealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial\nCourts Act. Whatever may be the ultimate reason for\nincluding Section 37 of the Arbitration Act in the\nproviso to Section 13(1), the ratio decidendi of the\njudgment in Fuerst Day Lawson [Fuerst Day Lawson\nLtd. v. Jindal Exports Ltd., (2011) 8 Scc 333 : (2011)\n4 Scc (Civ) 178] would apply, and this being so,\nappeals filed under Section 50 of the Arbitration Act\nwould have to follow the drill of Section 50 alone. \n22. This, in fact, follows from the language of Section\n50 itself. In all arbitration cases of enforcement of\nforeign awards, it is Section 50 alone that provides an\nappeal. Having provided for an appeal, the forum of\nappeal is left \"to the Court authorised by law to hear\nappeals from such orders\". Section 50 properly read\nwould, therefore, mean that if an appeal lies under the\nsaid provision, then alone would Section 13(1) of the\nCommercial Courts Act be attracted as laying down the\nforum which will hear and decide such an appeal. \n27. The matter can be looked at from a slightly\ndifferent angle. Given the objects of both the statutes,\n\n             (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm)\n                                         (21 of 46)                     [Sac-3/2019]\n\nit is clear that arbitration itself is meant to be a speedy\nresolution     of    disputes       between       parties.      Equally,\nenforcement of foreign awards should take place as\nsoon as possible if India is to remain as an equal\npartner, commercially speaking, in the international\ncommunity. In point of fact, the raison d'tre for the\nenactment of the Commercial Courts Act is that\ncommercial disputes involving high amounts of money\nshould be speedily decided. Given the objects of both\nthe enactments, if we were to provide an additional\nappeal, when Section 50 does away with an appeal so\nas to speedily enforce foreign awards, we would be\nturning the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts\nAct on their heads. Admittedly, if the amount contained\nin a foreign award to be enforced in India were less\nthan Rs 1 crore, and a Single Judge of a High Court\nwere to enforce such award, no appeal would lie, in\nkeeping with the object of speedy enforcement of\nforeign    awards.      However,       if,   in     the    same        fact\ncircumstance, a foreign award were to be for Rs 1\ncrore     or   more,     if   the     appellants          are   correct,\nenforcement of such award would be further delayed\nby providing an appeal under Section 13(1) of the\nCommercial Courts Act. Any such interpretation would\nlead to absurdity, and would be directly contrary to the\nobject sought to be achieved by the Commercial Courts\nAct viz. speedy resolution of disputes of a commercial\nnature involving a sum of Rs 1 crore and over. For this\nreason also,        we feel that Section 13(1) of the\nCommercial          Courts    Act    must      be     construed          in\naccordance with the object sought to be achieved by\nthe Act. Any construction of Section 13 of the\nCommercial Courts Act, which would lead to further\ndelay, instead of an expeditious enforcement of a\nforeign award must, therefore, be eschewed. Even on\napplying the doctrine of harmonious construction of\nboth statutes, it is clear that they are best harmonised\nby   giving    effect    to   the    special      statute       i.e.   the\nArbitration Act, vis--vis the more general statute, \n\n\n\n               (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm)\n                                                   (22 of 46)               [Sac-3/2019 ] \n\n         namely, the Commercial Courts Act, being left to\n         operate in spheres other than arbitration . \" \n\nLearned counsel for the respondent also submitted that by the\n\nvirtue of the judgment in Kandla Export Corporation & Anr.\n\n(supra), it is clear that a joint reading of Section 13 of the\n\nCommercial Courts Act, 2015 and Section 37 of the Act of 1996\n\nmakes it amply clear that Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act\n\nonly provides the forum for challenge, whereas Section 37 of the\n\nAct of 1996 expressly referred to in the proviso to Section 13(1)\n\nof the Commercial Courts Act, circumscribes right of appeal, and\n\nthus, there can be no appeal under any provision outside Section\n\n37 of the Act of 1996.\n\n16.           Learned counsel for the respondent, regarding the\n\nexclusion of Part I of the Act of 1996 on account of seat of\n\narbitration in London, United Kingdom, referred to the judgment\n\nby    this    Hon'ble    Court      in    R.K.      Industries       Vs.    Maximus\n\nInternational General Trading & Anr., reported in 2019(1)\n\nRlw 347 (Raj.), relevant portion of which reads as under:\n\n\n         \"46. The contention of the appellant that though the\n         panel of arbitrator has kept a sitting in London and\n         commenced the proceedings in London, it is only a\n         venue of arbitration and the seat of arbitration remains\n         in   India,    is   equally     flawed     and     fallacious.   Such\n         argument of the appellant is contrary to the facts\n         involved in the case and the same has no legal basis or\n         support. Mere use of the words \"the said rules in\n         India\", does not shift the seat of arbitration to India,\n         particularly when, the venue of arbitration has been in\n         England. Various factors are required to be reckoned to\n         treat the venue to be a seat. Until and unless the\n         contract or the arbitration clause in express terms\n         defines or provides that the seat of arbitration shall be\n\n\n                         (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm) \n                                       (23 of 46)               [Sac-3/2019 ] \n\nIndia, the bare use of the words \"rules in India\", or the\nmere fact that the appellant operates from India, the\nseat of arbitration cannot be said to be situated in\nIndia. \n\n47. As the seat of arbitration is in London and not in\nIndia , in our considered view, the jurisdiction of this\nCourt to hear an application under Section 34 of the\nAct is clearly barred, as a result of the provision\ncontained in Section 2 (2) of the Act of 1996, which\nconfines the applicability of part first of the Act to the\ncases where the place of arbitration is in India. In the\npresent case even the seat of arbitration, much less\nthe venue of arbitration is in London, hence, the Courts\nin India cease to have jurisdiction to proceed under the\nprovisions of Part I of the Act of 1996, including the\njurisdiction to entertain the application under Section\n34 of the Act. \n\n53 . The learned Single Judge has relied upon the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Roger\nShashoua v. Mukesh Sharma reported in (2017) 14\nScc 722 and considered various relevant paragraphs\nof the said judgment, while holding that this Court has\nno jurisdiction to entertain an application under Section\n34 of the Act of 1996. A perusal of the judgment\nof Roger   Shashoua (supra)            reveals      that   Hon'ble\nSupreme Court has referred to and dealt with all the\njudgments on the subject and in almost identical fact\nsituation has held that the London has not been\nmentioned as the mere location, but it has been\nwritten that the Courts in London will have jurisdiction. \nIn the present facts also, if the arbitration clause is\nread in conjunction with rule 8 with the rules relating\nto arbitration of the Refined Sugar Association, it\nleaves no room for ambiguity that in the present case\nalso, the seat of arbitration is in London (England),\nhence all proceedings relating to challenge to the\naward shall take place in England. \n54. As an upshot of the above discussion, we concur\nwith and hence, confirm the view of learned Single\n\n\n             (Downloaded on 23/03/2020 at 08:24:34 Pm) \n                                               (24 of 46)         [Sac-3/2019 ] \n\n        Judge that in the present case seat of arbitration is in\n        England. \n\n        55. The appellant's grievance against the impugned\n        award dated 17.3.2017 can not be heard or redressed\n        by this Court or any of the Courts of India, as the\n        jurisdiction of the Courts of India is expressly barred.\"\n\n\n17 .         Learned counsel for the respondent has also referred to\n\nthe request for arbitration dated 03.06.2014, and for ready\n\nreference, the material portion thereof, as reflected in the record,\n\nreads as under:-\n\n\n      \"4. The Matters of the Arbitration\n      4.1. In accordance with the Arbitration Agreement, the\n      parties have agreed that :\n      (a) the seat of the arbitration is London;\n      ...\n(d) the procedural law of the arbitration is English law; and\n(e) the substantive law of the arbitration is English law.\"\n18. Learned counsel for the respondent has also relied upon the precedent law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Eitzen Bulk A/s Vs. Ashapura Minechem Limited & Anr., reported in (2016) 11 Scc 508, for demonstrating that in such cases, the English law can only apply for all purposes, once the same was applied for conduct of arbitration and grant of award, as it amounts to express exclusion of applicability of Part I of the Act of 1996. Relevant portion of the said judgment reads as under:\n\"33. We are thus of the view that by Clause 28, the parties chose to exclude the application of Part I to the arbitration proceedings between them by choosing London as the venue for arbitration and by making English law applicable to arbitration, as observed earlier. It is too well settled by now that where the parties choose a juridical seat of arbitration outside (25 of 46) [Sac-3/2019] India and provide that the law which governs arbitration will be a law other than Indian law, Part I of the Act would not have any application and, therefore, the award debtor would not be entitled to challenge the award by raising objections under Section 34 before a court in India. A court in India could not have jurisdiction to entertain such objections under Section 34 in such a case. \n34. As a matter of fact the mere choosing of the juridical seat of arbitration attracts the law applicable to such location. In other words, it would not be necessary to specify which law would apply to the arbitration proceedings, since the law of the particular country would apply ipso jure. The following passage from Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration contains the following explication of the issue: \n\"It is also sometimes said that parties have selected the procedural law that will govern their arbitration, by providing for arbitration in a particular country. This is too elliptical and, as an English court itself held more recently in Breas of Doune Wind Farm it does not always hold true. What the parties have done is to choose a place of arbitration in a particular country. That choice brings with it submission to the laws of that country, including any mandatory provisions of its law on arbitration. To say that the parties have \"chosen\" that particular law to govern the arbitration is rather like saying that an English woman who takes her car to France has \"chosen\" French traffic law, which will oblige her to drive on the right-hand side of the road, to give priority to vehicles approaching from the right, and generally to obey traffic laws to which she may not be accustomed. But it would be an odd use of language to say this notional motorist had opted for \"French traffic law\". What she has done is to choose to go to France. The applicability of French law then follows automatically. It is not a matter of choice. \n(26 of 46) [Sac-3/2019] Parties may well choose a particular place of arbitration precisely because its lex arbitri is one which they find attractive. Nevertheless, once a place of arbitration has been chosen, it brings with it its own law. If that law contains provisions that are mandatory so far as arbitration are concerned, those provisions must be obeyed. It is not a matter of choice any more than the notional motorist is free to choose which local traffic laws to obey and which to disregard.\"\n19. Learned counsel for the respondent has also placed reliance on the precedent law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India Vs. Reliance Industries Limited & Ors, reported in (2015) 10 Scc 213, whereby the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the seat of arbitration, as specified in the relevant arbitration clause, shall be the criteria. Relevant portion of the said judgment reads as under:\n\"20. It is interesting to note that even though the law governing the arbitration agreement was not specified, yet this Court held, having regard to various circumstances, that the seat of arbitration would be London and therefore, by necessary implication, the ratio of Bhatia International [Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A., (2002) 4 Scc 105] would not apply. \n21. The last paragraph of Balco [Balco v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 Scc 552 :\n(2012) 4 Scc (Civ) 810] judgment has now to be read with two caveats, both emanating from para 32 of Bhatia International [Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A., (2002) 4 Scc 105] itself -- that where the Court comes to a determination that the juridical seat is outside India or where law other than Indian law governs the arbitration agreement, Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996 would be excluded by necessary implication. Therefore, even in the cases governed by the Bhatia [Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A., (2002) 4 Scc 105] principle, it is only those cases in which agreements (27 of 46) [Sac-3/2019] stipulate that the seat of the arbitration is in India or on whose facts a judgment cannot be reached on the seat of the arbitration as being outside India that would continue to be governed by the Bhatia [Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A., (2002) 4 Scc 105] principle. Also, it is only those agreements which stipulate or can be read to stipulate that the law governing the arbitration agreement is Indian law which would continue to be governed by the Bhatia [Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A., (2002) 4 Scc 105] rule. \n22. On the facts in the present case, it is clear that this Court has already determined both that the juridical seat of the arbitration is at London and that the arbitration agreement is governed by English law. This being the case, it is not open to the Union of India to argue that Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996 would be applicable. A Section 14 application made under Part I would consequently not be maintainable. It needs to be mentioned that Shri Ranjit Kumar's valiant attempt to reopen a question settled twice over, that is, by dismissal of both a review petition [Union of India v. Reliance Industries Ltd., Review Petition (C) No. 1378 of 2014 in Civil Appeal No. 5765 of 2014, order dated 31-7-2014 (Sc), wherein it was directed:\"ORDER(Before Jagdish Singh Khehar And Dr A.K. Sikri, JJ.)The Union of India (respondent in Civil Appeal No. 5765 of 2014) has instituted the present petition seeking review of the judgment dated 28-5-2014  rendered by this Court in the abovementioned civil appeal. We have carefully perused the petition for review and the papers filed in support thereof. We do not find any reason to interfere with the judgment impugned. The review petition is, accordingly, dismissed.\"] and a curative petition [Union of India v. Reliance Industries Ltd., Curative Petition (C) No. 313 of 2014 in Review Petition (C) No. 1378 of 2014 in Civil Appeal No. 5765 of 2014, order dated 12-2-2015 (SC), wherein it was directed:\"ORDER(Before H.L. DATTU, C.J. AND T.S. THAKUR, S.J. MUKHOPADHAYA AND DR A.K. SIKRI, JJ.)\"We have gone through the curative petition and the (28 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out within the parameters indicated in the decision of this Court in Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra reported in (2002) 4 SCC 388. Hence, the curative petition is dismissed.\" ] on the very ground urged before us, must meet with the same fate. His argument citing Mathura Prasad Bajoo Jaiswal v. Dossibai N.B. Jeejeebhoy [(1970) 1 SCC 613] that res judicata would not attach to questions relating to jurisdiction, would not apply in the present case as the effect of Clause 34.2 of the PSC raises at best a mixed question of fact and law and not a pure question of jurisdiction unrelated to facts. Therefore, both on grounds of res judicata as well as the law laid down in the judgment dated 28-5-2014 [Reliance Industries Ltd. v. Union of India, (2014) 7 SCC 603 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 737] , this application under Section 14 deserves to be dismissed. It is also an abuse of the process of the Court as has rightly been argued by Dr Singhvi. It is only after moving under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and getting an adverse judgment from the Permanent Court of Arbitration dated 10-6-2013 that the present application was filed under Section 14 of the Arbitration Act two days later i.e. on 12-6-2013.\"\n20. Learned counsel for the respondent has also placed reliance on the precedent law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bharat Aluminium Company Vs. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., reported in (2016) 4 SCC 126, relevant portion of which reads as under:\n\"14. It is clear that the law applicable to arbitration agreement in the present case is English law. Once it is found that the law governing the arbitration agreement is English law, Part I of the Indian Arbitration Act stands impliedly excluded. This has been a long settled position and the latest judgment in Union of India v. Reliance Industries Ltd. [Union of India v. Reliance Industries Ltd., (2015) 10 SCC 213 :\n(29 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] (2016) 1 SCC (Civ) 102 ] reaffirms the same. In the words of R.F. Nariman, J.: (SCC pp. 228-29, para 21)\n\"21. The last paragraph of BALCO [BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 :\n(2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] judgment has now to be read with two caveats, both emanating from para 32 of Bhatia International [Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A., (2002) 4 SCC 105] itself--that where the Court comes to a determination that the juridical seat is outside India or where law other than Indian law governs the arbitration agreement, Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996 would be excluded by necessary implication. Therefore, even in the cases governed by the Bhatia [Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A., (2002) 4 SCC 105] principle, it is only those cases in which agreements stipulate that the seat of the arbitration is in India or on whose facts a judgment cannot be reached on the seat of the arbitration as being outside India that would continue to be governed by the Bhatia [Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A., (2002) 4 SCC 105] principle. Also, it is only those agreements which stipulate or can be read to stipulate that the law governing the arbitration agreement is Indian law which would continue to be governed by the Bhatia [Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A., (2002) 4 SCC 105] rule.\"\n21. Learned counsel for the respondent has further relied upon the precedent law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Roger Shashoua & Ors. Vs. Mukesh Sharma & Ors., reported in (2017) 14 SCC 722, relevant portion of which reads as under: \n\"37 . The learned Judge further observed:\n\"33. Whilst there is no material before me which would fully support an argument on estoppel, it is interesting to note that at an earlier stage of the history of this matter, the defendant had no difficulty in putting (30 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] forward London as the seat of the arbitration. On 14-2- 2006 the defendant's lawyers, when writing to the Arbitral Tribunal stated 'the seat of the arbitration is London and the first respondent submits that the curial law of the arbitration is English law. That means the arbitration is governed by the Arbitration Act, 1996'. Further, when challenging the appointment of Mr Salve as an arbitrator, in its application to the ICC, the defendant said that 'the fact that the present arbitration is an English seated ICC arbitration is undisputed. Accordingly the ICC Rules shall be paramount in adjudicating the present challenge. Further, the curial seat of arbitration being London, settled propositions of English law shall also substantially impinge upon the matter. This position is taken without prejudice to the first respondent's declared contention that the law of the arbitration agreement is Indian law, as also that the substantive law governing the dispute is Indian law'.\n34. \"London arbitration\" is a well-known phenomenon which is often chosen by foreign nationals with a different law, such as the law of New York, governing the substantive rights of the parties. This is because of the legislative framework and supervisory powers of the courts here which many parties are keen to adopt. When therefore there is an express designation of the arbitration venue as London and no designation of any alternative place as the seat, combined with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is, to my mind, that London is the juridical seat and English law the curial law. In my judgment it is clear that either London has been designated by the parties to the arbitration agreement as the seat of the arbitration or, having regard to the parties' agreement and all the relevant circumstances, it is the seat to be determined in accordance with the final fallback provision of Section 3 of the Arbitration Act.\"\nAnd again:\n(31 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] \"37. None of this has any application to the position as between England and India. The body of law which establishes that an agreement to the seat of an arbitration is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause remains good law. If the defendant is right, C v. D [C v. D, 2008 Bus LR 843 : 2007 EWCA Civ 1282 (CA)] would now have to be decided differently. Both the USA (with which C v. D [C v. D, 2008 Bus LR 843 : 2007 EWCA Civ 1282 (CA)] was concerned) and India are parties to the New York Convention, but the basis of the Convention, as explained in C v. D [C v. D, 2008 Bus LR 843 : 2007 EWCA Civ 1282 (CA)] , as applied in England in accordance with its own principles on the conflict of laws, is that the courts of the seat of arbitration are the only courts where the award can be challenged whilst, of course, under Article V of the Convention there are limited grounds upon which other contracting States can refuse to recognise or enforce the award once made. \n***\n39. In my judgment therefore there is nothing in the European Court decision in Front Comor [West Tankers Inc. v. Allianz Spa, 2009 AC 1138 : (2009) 3 WLR 696 (ECJ)] which impacts upon the law as developed in this country in relation to anti-suit injunctions which prevent parties from pursuing proceedings in the courts of a country which is not a Member State of the European Community, whether on the basis of an exclusive jurisdiction clause, or an agreement to arbitrate (in accordance with the decision in Angelic Grace [Aggeliki Charis Compania Maritima SA v. Pagnan SpA, (1995) 1 Lloyd's Rep 87 (CA)] or the agreement of the parties to the supervisory powers of this court by agreeing on London as the seat of the arbitration (in accordance with the decision in C v. D [C v. D, 2008 Bus LR 843 : 2007 EWCA Civ 1282 (CA)] ).\" \n(32 of 46) [SAC-3/2019]\n54. We had earlier extracted extensively from the said judgment, as we find, the Court after adverting to various aspects, has categorically held that the High Court had not followed the Shashoua [Roger Shashoua v. Mukesh Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm)] principle. The various decisions referred to in Enercon (India) Ltd. [Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH, (2014) 5 SCC 1 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 59] , the analysis made and the propositions deduced leads to an indubitable conclusion that Shashoua [Roger Shashoua v. Mukesh Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm)] principle has been accepted by Enercon (India) Ltd. [Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH, (2014) 5 SCC 1 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 59] It is also to be noted that in BALCO [BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] , the Constitution Bench has not merely reproduced few paragraphs from Shashoua [Roger Shashoua v. Mukesh Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm)] but has also referred to other decisions on which Shashoua [Roger Shashoua v. Mukesh Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm)] has placed reliance upon. As we notice, there is analysis of earlier judgments, though it does not specifically state that \"propositions laid down in Shashoua [Roger Shashoua v. Mukesh Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm)] are accepted\". On a clear reading, the ratio of the decision in BALCO [BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] , in the ultimate eventuate, reflects that the Shashoua [Roger Shashoua v. Mukesh Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm)] principle has been accepted and the two-Judge Bench in Enercon (India) Ltd. [Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH, (2014) 5 SCC 1 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 59] , after succinctly analysing it, has stated that the said principles have been accepted by the Constitution Bench. Therefore, we are unable to accept the submission of Mr Chidambaram that the finding recorded in Enercon (33 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] (India) Ltd. [Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH, (2014) 5 SCC 1 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 59] that Shashoua [Roger Shashoua v. Mukesh Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm)] principle has been accepted in BALCO [BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] should be declared as per incuriam. \n60. Tested on the aforesaid principle, we find that the question that arose in BALCO [BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 :\n(2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] and the discussion that has been made by the larger Bench relating to Shashoua [Roger Shashoua v. Mukesh Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm)] and C v. D [C v. D, 2008 Bus LR 843 : 2007 EWCA Civ 1282 (CA)] are squarely in the context of applicability of Part I or Part II of the Act. It will not be erroneous to say that the Constitution Bench has built the propositional pyramid on the basis or foundation of certain judgments and Shashoua [Roger Shashoua v. Mukesh Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm)] and C v. D [C v. D, 2008 Bus LR 843 : 2007 EWCA Civ 1282 (CA)] are two of them. It will be inappropriate to say that in Enercon (India) Ltd. [Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH, (2014) 5 SCC 1 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 59] the Court has cryptically observed that observations made in Shashoua [Roger Shashoua v. Mukesh Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm)] have been approvingly quoted by the Court in BALCO [BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 :\n(2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] in para 110. We are inclined to think, as we are obliged to, that the Shashoua [Roger Shashoua v. Mukesh Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm)] principle has been accepted in BALCO [BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] as well as Enercon (India) Ltd. [Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH, (2014) 5 SCC 1 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 59 ] on proper ratiocination and, therefore, the submission advanced on this score by Mr (34 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent, is repelled. \n72. It is worthy to note that the arbitration agreement is not silent as to what law and procedure is to be followed. On the contrary, Clause 14.1. lays down that the arbitration proceedings shall be in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of ICC. \nIn Enercon (India) Ltd. [Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH, (2014) 5 SCC 1 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 59] , the two-Judge Bench referring to Shashoua case [Roger Shashoua v. Mukesh Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm)] accepted the view of Cooke, J. that the phrase \"venue of arbitration shall be in London, UK\"\nwas accompanied by the provision in the arbitration clause or arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the Rules of ICC in Paris. The two-Judge Bench accepted the Rules of ICC, Paris which is supranational body of Rules as has been noted by Cooke, J. and that is how it has accepted that the parties have not simply provided for the location of hearings to be in London. To elaborate, the distinction between the venue and the seat remains. But when a court finds that there is prescription for venue and something else, it has to be adjudged on the facts of each case to determine the juridical seat. As in the instant case, the agreement in question has been interpreted and it has been held that London is not mentioned as the mere location but the courts in London will have the jurisdiction, another interpretative perception as projected by the learned Senior Counsel is unacceptable. \n75. We respectfully concur with the said view, for there is no reason to differ. Apart from that, we have already held that the agreement in question having been interpreted in a particular manner by the English courts and the said interpretation having gained acceptation by this Court, the inescapable conclusion is that the courts in India have no jurisdiction.\"\n22. Reliance has also been placed by learned counsel for the respondent on the judgment rendered by High Court of Justice (35 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] Queen's Bench Division Commercial Court, Royal Courts of Justice, Strand, London in Roger Shashoua & Ors. Vs. Mukesh Sharma, reported (2009) EWHC 957 (Comm), relevant portion of which reads as under:\n\"30. The two authorities relied on by the defendant, the Dubai Islamic Bank decision of Mr Justice Aikens and the Braes of Doune decision of Mr Justice Akenhead do not take the defendant's argument any further. In the Dubai Islamic case, there was no designation of any seat or venue at all. Having decided that there were no provisions indicating expressly or impliedly what law governed the arbitration agreement (in the governing Visa Regulations) or the arbitral procedure itself and that there was no specific reference to either the seat or the place of any arbitration under the Visa Regulations, the judge held that the seat had to be determined by the court at the date of commencement of the arbitration. He held that the location of the board meeting at which the appeal was heard was entirely adventitious, since it could have taken place in any number of places. Having weighed the various factors that are ordinarily taken into account in determining the proper law of an agreement, in looking for the law with which the Arbitration had its closest and most real connection, he concluded that this was California. The critical point was that the Visa Regulations which set up the dispute procedure appeared to contemplate that the appeal arbitral process would be handled through the Visa offices in California, but additional factors also supported that conclusion. \n31. In the Braes of Doune decision, the EPC contract, under which the dispute arose, was governed by the laws of England and Wales and, subject to the arbitration clause, the contract provided that the courts of England and Wales were to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of or in connection with the contract. The arbitration clause provided for arbitration pursuant to (36 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] the CIMA Rules and then stated in terms that \"this arbitration agreement is subject to English law and the seat of the arbitration shall be Glasgow, Scotland\". The CIMA Rules expressly referred to the Arbitration Act 1996 in many places. In looking therefore for the \"juridical seat\", the Judge searched for the jurisdiction which the parties are taken to have chosen to supervise the arbitration. Given the express references to English law as the law of the arbitration agreement itself and to the Arbitration Act, it is hardly surprising that the Judge found that there was a conflict between that and the reference to Glasgow as \"the seat of the arbitration\". As I pointed out at paragraph 26 in C v D and as the Court of Appeal accepted in paragraphs 22-26 in that case, it is rare for the law of the arbitration agreement to be different from the law of the seat of the arbitration. Mr Justice Akenhead was therefore persuaded that the reference to the \"seat\"\nof the arbitration was merely a designation of the place where the arbitration was to be held, whereas all the other references showed that the parties were agreeing that the seat and the curial law or law which governed the arbitral proceedings was that of England and Wales. \n32. In Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws, the authors at paragraph 16-035 state that the seat \"is in most cases sufficiently indicated by the country chosen as the place of the arbitration. For such a choice of place not to be given effect as a choice of seat, there will need to be clear evidence that the parties...agreed to choose another seat for the arbitration and that such a choice will be effective to endow the courts of that country with jurisdiction to supervise and support the arbitration\". Although the concept of the seat of the arbitration is a juridical concept and the legal seat must not be confused with the geographically convenient place chosen to conduct particular hearings, I can see no reason for not giving the express choice made in clause 14.4 full weight. \n33. Whilst there is no material before me which would fully support an argument on estoppel, it is interesting to note that at an earlier stage of the history of this matter, (37 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] the defendant had no difficulty in putting forward London as the seat of the arbitration. On 14th February 2006 the defendant's lawyers, when writing to the arbitral tribunal stated \"the seat of the arbitration is London and the first respondent submits that the curial law of the arbitration is English law. That means the arbitration is governed by the Arbitration Act 1996\". Further, when challenging the appointment of Mr Salve as an arbitrator, in its application to the ICC, the defendant said that \"the fact that the present arbitration is an English seated ICC arbitration is undisputed. Accordingly ICC Rules shall be paramount in adjudicating the present challenge. Further, the curial seat of arbitration being London, settled propositions of English law shall also substantially impinge upon the matter. This position is taken without prejudice to the first respondent's declared contention that the law of the arbitration agreement is Indian law, as also that the substantive law governing the dispute is Indian law\".\n34. \"London arbitration\" is a well known phenomenon which is often chosen by foreign nationals with a different law, such as the law of New York, governing the substantive rights of the parties. This is because of the legislative framework and supervisory powers of the courts here which many parties are keen to adopt. When therefore there is an express designation of the arbitration venue as London and no designation of any alternative place as the seat, combined with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is, to my mind, that London is the juridical seat and English law the curial law. In my judgment it is clear that either London has been designated by the parties to the arbitration agreement as the seat of the arbitration or, having regard to the parties' agreement and all the relevant circumstances, it is the seat to be determined in accordance with the final fall back provision of section 3 of the Arbitration Act.\" \n(38 of 46) [SAC-3/2019]\n23. Learned counsel for the respondent has also referred to the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Vijay Karia & Ors. Vs. Prysmian Cavi E Sistemi SRL & Ors. (Civil Appeal No.1544 of 2020 decided on 13.02.2020) , also upholds the earlier position of the precedent laws already cited hereinabove, and is the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the same issue. Relevant portion of the said judgment reads as under:-\n\"23. As Section 50 of the Arbitration Act does not provide an appeal when a foreign award is recognised and enforced by a judgment of a learned Single Judge of a High Court, the Appellants have appealed against the said judgment under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.\"\n24. Learned counsel for the respondent concluded his submissions by submitting that the BGS SGS Soma JV (supra) proposition is a clear affirmation of the settled principle that the present appeal is not maintainable, as the venue of the seat for arbitration was London, United Kingdom. \n25. Since at the threshold, learned counsel for the respondent was permitted to raise the objections regarding maintainability of the present appeals, therefore, at the outset, Dr. Sachin Acharya with Mr. Manvendra Krishan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants responded by submitting that the Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgment rendered in Bhatia International Vs. Bulk Trading S.A. & Ors., reported in AIR 2002 SC 1432, while dealing with the jurisdiction of courts in India in international commercial matters and applicability of Part I to International Commercial Arbitration (ICA), after a detailed deliberation, laid the controversy at rest and concluded that the (39 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] laws and the rules chosen by the parties would prevail. Relevant portion of the said judgment reads as under:-\n\"32. To conclude, we hold that the provisions of Part I would apply to all arbitrations and to all proceedings relating thereto. Where such arbitration is held in India the provisions of Part I would compulsorily apply and parties are free to deviate only to the extent permitted by the derogable provisions of Part I. In cases of international commercial arbitrations held out of India provisions of Part I would apply unless the parties by agreement, express or implied, exclude all or any of its provisions. In that case the laws or rules chosen by the parties would prevail. Any provision, in Part I, which is contrary to or excluded by that law or rules will not apply. \" \n26. Learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that where the parties have unless agreed contrary expressly or impliedly, Part I of the Act of 1996 will be applicable in International Commercial Arbitration (ICA). He has also relied upon the position of the judgment in Bharat Aluminium Company Vs. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., reported in (2012) 9 SCC 552, which had overruled the earlier judgment of Bhatia International (supra). Relevant portion of Bharat Aluminium Company (supra) reads as under:\n\"197. The judgment in Bhatia International [(2002) 4 SCC 105] was rendered by this Court on 13-3-2002. Since then, the aforesaid judgment has been followed by all the High Courts as well as by this Court on numerous occasions. In fact, the judgment in Venture Global Engg. [(2008) 4 SCC 190] has been rendered on 10-1- 2008 in terms of the ratio of the decision in Bhatia International [(2002) 4 SCC 105] . Thus, in order to do complete justice, we hereby order, that the law now declared by this Court shall apply prospectively, to all the arbitration agreements executed hereafter.\"\n27. Learned counsel for the appellants also submitted that in light of the decision rendered in Bharat Aluminium Company (40 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] (supra), a cut off date has been prescribed, i.e. agreements entered prior to 06.09.2012 and agreements entered into after 06.09.2012, and in the case in hand the agreements were entered acted upon in the year 2011. \n28. Learned counsel for the appellants has drawn the attention of this Court towards the English Arbitration Act, 1996, particularly Section 4(3) thereof, which allows the party to agree on arrangement of application of institutional rules, in the present case like LCIA, and further, Section 4(2) of the English Arbitration Act obligates applicability of those rules as far as non-mandatory provisions are concerned.\n29. Learned counsel for the appellants also submitted that except 21 provisions of Schedule I, all provisions of English Arbitration Act, 1996 have become non-mandatory. \n30. Learned counsel for the appellants also submitted that Section 26.8 of LCIA Rules clarify that parties waive their right to any form of appeal, review, recourse to any State Court or other legal authority, in so far as such waiver shall not be prohibited under any applicable law. \n31. Learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that as there is no appeal provided under LCIA Rules, there shall not be any prohibition in any applicable law, which can be construed as law applicable to either parties to the arbitration. \n32. Learned counsel for the appellants also submitted that since the English Arbitration Act, by virtue of Public Policy in Section 81, already releases from any restrictions under Sections 4(2) and 4(3) of the English Arbitration Act, therefore, in a case of Public Policy issue, LCIA waiver against an appeal or review is prohibited in light of Section 81 of the English Arbitration Act, and (41 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] award cannot be construed as final and binding as per Rule 26.8 of the LCIA Rules.\n33. Learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that since LCIA is clearly barring any remedy of appeal, therefore, the appellant has been rendered remediless, and as a consequence whereof, the case of the appellant has to be heard and decided on merits.\n34. Learned counsel for the appellants also tried to distinguish the applicability of BGS SGS Soma JV (supra) on the ground that it deals with a situation of domestic arbitration, where the issue was not with respect to refusal to set aside an award under Section 34 of the Act of 1996, but the question was as to whether an order under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC directing the party to approach the commercial court can be challenged under Section 37 of the Act of 1996 or not. As per learned counsel for the appellants, the issue did not pertain to maintainability before deciding on the substantive rights under Section 34 of the Act of 1996. \n35. Learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that in BGS SGS Soma JV (supra), applicability of Section 34 of the Act of 1996 was not adjudicated on merits, but was merely returned on a technicality, while in the instant case, the matter has been considered on merits by the learned Single Judge in the impugned order. Learned counsel thus submitted that the present appeals are maintainable. \n36. In support of his submissions, learned counsel for the appellants has also relied upon the precedent law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Venture Global Engineering Vs. (42 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] Satyam Computer Services Ltd. & Ors., reported in AIR 2008 SC 1061, relevant portion of which reads as under:-\n\"29. In terms of the decision in Bhatia International [Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A., (2002) 4 SCC 105] we hold that Part I of the Act is applicable to the award in question even though it is a foreign award. We have not expressed anything on the merits of claim of both the parties.\" \n37. Reliance has also been placed by learned counsel for the appellants on the precedent law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bharat Aluminium Company Vs. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., reported in (2016) 4 SCC 126, relevant portion of which reads as under:\n\"1. The residue of the Constitution Bench judgment in BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc. [BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] is the subject-matter of the present appeal. At the instance of the appellant, the Bench resolved the conflicting, if not, confusing views on the applicability of Part I of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Arbitration Act\") and held that: (SCC p. 647, para 196) \"196. ... Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996 is applicable only to all the arbitrations which take place within the territory of India.\" \n(emphasis in original) overruling a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A. [Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A., (2002) 4 SCC 105] Exercising its power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, the Constitution Bench however, held that the law declared by it would only operate prospectively. In other words, all agreements executed prior to 6-9-2012 were to be governed by the decision in Bhatia International [Bhatia International (supra).\" \n(43 of 46) [SAC-3/2019]\n38. Learned counsel for the appellants has also relied upon the precedent law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Venture Global Engineering Vs. Satyam Computer Services Ltd. & Anr., reported in (2010) 8 SCC 660, relevant portion of which reads as under:-\n46. The concept of public policy in the A&C Act, 1996 as given in the Explanation has virtually adopted the aforesaid international standard, namely, if anything is found in excess of jurisdiction and depicts a lack of due process, it will be opposed to public policy of India. When an award is induced or affected by fraud or corruption, the same will fall within the aforesaid grounds of excess of jurisdiction and a lack of due process. Therefore, if we may say so, the Explanation to Section 34 of the A&C Act is like \"a stable man in the saddle\" on the unruly horse of public policy. \n51. Therefore, this Court is unable to accept the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent that the expression \"fraud in the making of the award\" has to be narrowly construed. This Court cannot do so primarily because fraud being of \"infinite variety\" may take many forms, and secondly, the expression \"the making of the award\" will have to be read in conjunction with whether the award \"was induced or affected by fraud\".\" \n39. Reliance has also been placed by learned counsel for the appellants on the precedent law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Roger Shashoua & Ors. Vs. Mukesh Sharma & Ors., reported in (2017) 14 SCC 722, relevant portion of which reads as under:\n\"68. It is worthy to note that the arbitration agreement is not silent as to what law and procedure is to be followed. On the contrary, Clause 14.1 lays down that the arbitration (44 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] proceedings shall be in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the ICC. In Enercon (India) Ltd. (supra), the two-Judge Bench referring to Shashoua case accepted the view of Cooke, J. that the phrase \"venue of arbitration shall be in London, UK\" was accompanied by the provision in the arbitration Clause or arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the Rules of ICC in Paris. The two-Judge Bench accepted the Rules of ICC, Paris which is supernational body of Rules as has been noted by Cooke, J. and that is how it has accepted that the parties have not simply provided for the location of hearings to be in London. To elaborate, the distinction between the venue and the seat remains. But when a Court finds there is prescription for venue and something else, it has to be adjudged on the facts of each case to determine the juridical seat. As in the instant case, the agreement in question has been interpreted and it has been held that London is not mentioned as the mere location but the courts in London will have the jurisdiction, another interpretative perception as projected by the learned senior Counsel is unacceptable.\"\n40. Learned counsel for the appellants has further placed reliance on the precedent law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India Vs. Hardy Exploration and Production (India) INC (Civil Appeal No.4628 of 2018 decided on 25.09.2018), relevant portion of which reads as under:\n\"23. In view of the aforesaid development of law, there is no confusion with regard to what the seat of arbitration and venue of arbitration mean. There is no shadow of doubt that the arbitration clause has to be read in a holistic manner so as to determine the jurisdiction of the Court. That apart, if there is mention of venue and something else is appended thereto, depending on the nature of the prescription, the Court can come to a conclusion that there is implied exclusion of Part I of the Act. The principle laid down in (45 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. (supra) has been referred to in Reliance Industries Limited (II) and distinguished. In any case, it has no applicability to a controversy under the Act. The said controversy has to be governed by the BALCO principle or by the agreement or by the principle of implied exclusion as has been held in Bhatia International.\"\n41. After hearing learned counsel for the parties as well as perusing the record of the case, alongwith the precedent laws cited at the Bar, this Court is of the clear opinion that the present appeals are not maintainable, as the judgment of BGS SGS Soma JV (supra), quoted hereinabove, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has clearly held that an appeal under Section 37 of the Act of 1996 is not maintainable, in absence of sanction of law, is clearly applicable in the present case on account of the fact that in this case, when the appellant made a request on 03.06.2014 to invoke arbitration, the appellant himself averred that the seat of arbitration to be London, United Kingdom, and thus, expressly excluded Part I of the Act of 1996.\n42. This Court finds that the appellants have tried to assail the arbitral awards by filing arbitration applications under Section 34 of the Act of 1996, which remedy was not available to them, and thus, when such underlying remedy was not available to the appellants, then in those circumstances, an appeal under Section 37 of the Act of 1996 is not maintainable. Furthermore, the judgments of Harmanprit Singh Sidhu (supra) and Kandla Export Corporation & Anr. (supra) are also very clear in terms of the jurisdiction at the place of seat of the arbitration, particularly in regard to assailment of a foreign award. \n43. This Court, on a careful perusal, finds that the exclusion of Part I of the Act of 1996 has also been affirmed by the Hon'ble (46 of 46) [SAC-3/2019] Apex Court in R.K. Industries (supra), Eitzen Bulk (supra) and Union of India Vs. Reliance Industries Limited & Ors.\n(supra).\n44. This Court further finds that the judgment of Bhatia International (supra), which is the principal argument made on behalf of the appellants, cannot be relied upon, as the same has been clarified by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the subsequent judgment rendered in Union of India Vs. Reliance Industries Limited & Ors, wherein it has been held that, \"It is interesting to note that even though the law governing the arbitration agreement was not specified, yet this Court held, having regard to various circumstances, that the seat of arbitration would be London and therefore, by necessary implication, the ratio of Bhatia International [Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading S.A., (2002) 4 SCC 105] would not apply\".\n45. Thus, while adhering to BGS SGS Soma JV (supra) and all the precedent laws reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the latest judgment of Vijay Karia (supra), this Court does not find any reason to make any interference in the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge. \n46. Consequently, the present appeals are dismissed. All pending applications also stand dismissed. \n(DR. PUSHPENDRA SINGH BHATI),J (INDRAJIT MAHANTY),CJ SKant/-\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",

the supervisory jurisdiction is wide and can be used to meet the ends of justice, also to interfere even with an interlocutory order, but however expressed that the said power must be exercised sparingly, only to move subordinate courts and tribunals within the bounds of their authority to see that they obey the law. the apex court further held that the power is not available to be exercised to correct mere errors (whether on the facts or laws) and also cannot be exercised \"as the cloak of an appeal in disguise\". 8) in suryadev rai v. ram chander rai and others the apex court reiterated the principle laid down in the judgments referred to above, and held as under: we are of the opinion that the curtailment of revisional jurisdiction of the high court does not take away and could not have taken away the constitutional jurisdiction of the high court to issue a writ of certiorari to a civil court nor the power of superintendence conferred on the high court under article 227 of the constitution is taken away or whittled down. the power exists, untrammelled by the amendment in section 115 of the cpc, and is available to be exercised subject to rules of self discipline and practice which are well settled. 9) in shalini shyam shetty and another v. rajendra shankar patil , after considering the history the power of superintendence under article 227 of the constitution of india, held as under: 62. on an analysis of the aforesaid decisions of this court, the following principles on the exercise of high court's jurisdiction under article 227 of the constitution may be formulated: (a) a petition under article 226 of the constitution is different from a petition under article 227. the mode of exercise of power by high court under these two articles is also different. (b) in any event, a petition under article 227 cannot be called a writ petition. the history of the conferment of writ jurisdiction on high courts is substantially different from the history of conferment of the power of superintendence on the high courts under article 227 and have been discussed above. (c) high courts cannot, on the drop of a hat, in exercise of its power of superintendence under article 227 of the constitution, interfere with the orders of tribunals or courts inferior to it. nor can it, in exercise of this power, act as a court of appeal over the orders of court or tribunal subordinate to it. in cases where an alternative statutory mode of redressal has been provided, that would also operate as a restrain on the exercise of this power by the high court. (d) the parameters of interference by high courts in exercise of its power of superintendence have been repeatedly laid down by this court. in this regard the high court must be guided by the principles laid down by the constitution bench of this court in waryam singh (air 1954 sc 215) and the principles in waryam singh (supra) have been repeatedly followed by subsequent constitution benches and various other decisions of this court. (e) according to the ratio in waryam singh (supra), followed in subsequent cases, the high court in exercise of its jurisdiction of superintendence can interfere in order only to keep the tribunals and courts subordinate to it, `within the bounds of their authority'. (f) in order to ensure that law is followed by such tribunals and courts by exercising jurisdiction which is vested in them and by not declining to exercise the jurisdiction which is vested in them. (g) apart from the situations pointed in (e) and (f), high court can interfere in exercise of its power of superintendence when there has been a patent perversity in the orders of tribunals and courts subordinate to it or where there has been a gross and manifest failure of justice or the basic principles of natural justice have been flouted. (h) in exercise of its power of superintendence high court cannot interfere to correct mere errors of law or fact or just because another view than the one taken by the tribunals or courts subordinate to it, is a possible view. in other words the jurisdiction has to be very sparingly exercised. (i) high court's power of superintendence under article 227 cannot be curtailed by any statute. it has been declared a part of the basic structure of the constitution by the constitution bench of this court in the case of l. chandra kumar vs. union of india & others reported in (1997) 3 scc 261 and therefore abridgement by a constitutional amendment is also very doubtful. (j) it may be true that a statutory amendment of a rather cognate provision, like section 115 of the civil procedure code by the civil procedure code (amendment) act, 1999 does not and cannot cut down the ambit of high court's power under article 227. at the same time, it must be remembered that such statutory amendment does not correspondingly expand the high court's jurisdiction of superintendence under article 227. (k) the power is discretionary and has to be exercised on equitable principle. in an appropriate case, the power can be exercised suo motu. (l) on a proper appreciation of the wide and unfettered power of the high court under article 227, it transpires that the main object of this article is to keep strict administrative and judicial control by the high court on the administration of justice within its territory. (m) the object of superintendence, both administrative and judicial, is to maintain efficiency, smooth and orderly functioning of the entire machinery of justice in such a way as it does not bring it into any disrepute. the power of interference under this article is to be kept to the minimum to ensure that the wheel of justice does not come to a halt and the fountain of justice remains pure and unpolluted in order to maintain public confidence in the functioning of the tribunals and courts subordinate to high court. (n) this reserve and exceptional power of judicial intervention is not to be exercised just for grant of relief in individual cases but should be directed for promotion of public confidence in the administration of justice in the larger public interest whereas article 226 is meant for protection of individual grievance. therefore, the power under article 227 may be unfettered but its exercise is subject to high degree of judicial discipline pointed out above. (o) an improper and a frequent exercise of this power will be counter-productive and will divest this extraordinary power of its strength and vitality. 10) the issue raised in the instant case as to the maintainability of the civil revision petition under article 227 of the constitution of india, vis--vis section 8 and 13 of the commercial courts act, 2015, came up for consideration recently before a bench of gujarath high court in state of gujarat v. union of india (r/special civil application no.737 of 2018). it was also a case where a preliminary objection was raised as to the power of high court under article 227 of the constitution of india to entertain a civil revision petition against an order passed by the commercial court. referring to the judgments of the apex court on the issue, the bench of gujarat high court held as under: considering the law laid down by the apex court, we are of the opinion that bar contained under section 8 of the commercial courts act shall not affect the jurisdiction of the high court under article 227 of the constitution of india. if the contention on behalf of the respondents that considering section 8 of the commercial courts act, even the writ jurisdiction under article 227 of the constitution of india is barred, in that case, such a provision would suffer from the vice of unconstitutionality as observed by the honble supreme court in the aforesaid decisions. the power vested in the high courts to exercise judicial superintendence over the decision of the courts and tribunals within their respective jurisdictions is part of the basic structure of the constitution and no legislature can take away such power of superintendence conferred under article 227 of the constitution of india. it is required to be noted that therefore, even the legislature, while enacting section 8 of the commercial courts act, seems to have wisely not used the word maintainable but has used the word entertained. at this stage, it is also required to be noted that where the statute specifically provided that against the decision of the tribunal, only an appeal under article 136 of the constitution before the honble supreme court would be maintainable, the honble supreme court in the case of l.chandra kumar v. union of india and others (supra) has specifically observed and held that the powers of the supervisory jurisdiction of the high court under article 227 of the constitution against the decision of the tribunals shall still be available and the aggrieved party can approach the high court under article 227 of the constitution. therefore, it is observed and held that section 8 of the commercial courts act shall not affect the powers of the high court under article 227 of the constitution of india against the order passed by the commercial court. however, at the same time, the powers under article 227 of the constitution of india must be exercised sparingly and in exceptional cases only, more particularly, looking to the object and purpose of section 8 of the commercial courts act, ie., speedy disposal of commercial disputes. 11) in view of the judgments referred to above the argument that the high court cannot entertain a civil revision petition under article 227 of the constitution of india in view of section 8 of the act, cannot be accepted. 12) one other objection, which came to be raised is that if revisions are sought to be entertained under article 227 of the constitution of india, the purpose for which the commercial courts act has been enacted would get defeated. in other words it is pleaded that floodgates would be opened permitting every order passed by the commercial court be challenged under article 227 of the constitution of india. 13) in coal india ltd. and others v. saroj kumar mishra the apex court observed that merely because there is possibility of flood-gate litigation, a valuable right of a citizen cannot be taken away. in para no.19, the apex court observed as under: 19. the floodgate argument also does not appeal to us. the same appears to be an argument of desperation. only because, there is possibility of floodgate litigation, a valuable right of a citizen cannot be permitted to be taken away. this court is bound to determine the respective rights of the parties. 14) it is also to be noted that every application filed under article 227 of constitution of india shall not be entertained. in fact, the law does not contemplate that a civil revision petition under article 227 of the constitution of india is a statutory right which should be entertained. as observed by us earlier, in surya dev rai case (3 supra) the honble supreme court has observed that care, caution and circumspection needs to be exercised when the supervisory jurisdiction is sought to be invoked, during the pendency of any suit or proceedings in a subordinate court and the error though calling for correction is yet capable of being corrected and the conclusion of the proceedings in an appeal or revision preferred there against and entertaining a petition invoking supervisory jurisdiction of the high court would obstruct the smooth flow and/or early disposal of the suit or proceedings. therefore, the court would interfere only where the error is such, that if not corrected at that very moment, may become incapable of correction at a later stage. 15) keeping in view the object and purpose of enactment of commercial courts act, the courts would exercise their power under article 227 of the constitution of india. therefore, we hold that the supervisory power of the high court under article 227 of the constitution of india is not taken away by section 8 of the commercial courts act and the same cannot be restricted on the ground that it would open flood-gates of litigation in the high court. in view of the above, i.a.no.1 of 2018 is allowed permitting the petitioners to convert the appeal into a civil revision. 16) coming to the facts in issue. as stated by us earlier, the present c.r.p. came to be filed questioning the order of the commercial court terminating the mandate of the arbitrator on the ground that arbitration proceedings were not completed within the time fixed by the high court in the review petition. 17) for the sake of convenience the parties will hereinafter referred to as arrayed in c.o.p.no.81 of 2017. 18) an application under section 14 (2) and section 15 of the arbitration act, came to be filed by the petitioners therein and respondents herein seeking to terminate the mandate of the 6th respondent therein (8th respondent herein) on the ground that he has become de jure and de facto, unable to perform his functions and failed to act without un-due delay. petitioners 6 and 7 are companies registered under the companies act, 1956, organized and controlled by the family of petitioner nos.1 to 3. petitioner no.5 is a partnership entity. petitioner no.1 is the wife of petitioner no.3 and mother of petitioner no.4 and petitioner no.2 is the mother of petitioner no.3. during the years 2007-2010, the petitioners lent a sum of rs.20.00 crores to the respondents. as the said amount was not returned, the petitioners filed suits for recovery of money and also a complaint under section 138 of the negotiable instrument act. it is said that as a counter blast, the respondents got registered a criminal case vide cr.no.59 of 2012, against the petitioners. in the said case, petitioners 3 and 4 were arrested by the central crime station, hyderabad and while in custody they were forced to agree to pay a sum of rs.9.00 crores to the respondent. under duress and force, the petitioners are alleged to have signed the settlement deed dated 30.04.2012, letter of guarantee dated 30.04.2012 and ratification deed dated 03.05.2012. it is said that the petitioners were not allowed to read the contents of the documents, which they signed and they were not aware about the contents, including the appointment of the arbitrator. it is said that only after their release on bail, they were able to read the contents of the documents signed by them, were shocked to learn about the appointment of an arbitrator. as such, an application under section 11 (5) and (6) of the arbitration act, came to be filed questioning the appointment of arbitrator, which was dismissed by this court on 15.03.2013. a review application came to be filed, which was also dismissed on 13.09.2013. the learned arbitrator issued notices dated 25.07.2012 and passed orders on 15.03.2013 and 13.09.2013 initiating arbitration proceedings. on 23.02.2014, an application under section 12 of the arbitration act came to be filed before the sole arbitrator, to direct the arbitrator to withdraw himself from the proceedings with immediate effect on the ground of bias. pending application under section 12 of the arbitration act, the petitioners filed s.l.p. (civil) nos, 14146 and 14147 of 2014 before the honble supreme court against the orders passed in arbitration application no.54 of 2012 and review application no.493 of 2013. 19) on 11.08.2014, the apex court dismissed the said s.l.p.s, directing the arbitrator to dispose of the application in accordance with law, without being influenced by the observations of the high court. subsequent to the order passed by the apex court, the petitioners filed an application seeking to amend the grounds in section 12 application. on 15.11.2014, the said application came to be dismissed. challenging the same, arbitration o.p.no.2889 of 2014 came to be filed before the city civil court, hyderabad, seeking termination of the sole arbitrator on the ground of bias, and also to direct the arbitrator to terminate his mandate as per sections 12 and 14 of the arbitration act. it was further pleaded that a retired judge may be appointed as an arbitrator, to resolve the dispute. 20) on 25.03.2015 the proceedings before the arbitrator were stayed by the civil court and on 30.04.2015 the arbitration o.p.no.2889 of 2014 was dismissed. challenging the same, c.r.p.no.1861 of 2015 came to be filed before this court. since the plea of undue delay on the part of the arbitrator to act ie., to complete the arbitral proceedings within the stipulated time of five months was raised for the first time during the course of arguments before the court below and a passing reference was made there to and referred to few judgments by the petitioners therein in that regard, held that the court could not have recorded any finding on facts such as to whether the delay of the arbitrator to act was undue or not; and, if so, whether the petitioners therein had waived such a right. observing so, and rejecting the plea of bias, the said c.r.p. was dismissed. the operative portion of the order is as under: viewed from any angle, the mandate of the 6th respondent-arbitrator cannot be terminated, on the basis of the contentions urged by the petitioner, in the petition filed by them before the court below under section 14 (2) of the act. suffice it to make it clear that the order now passed by us shall not preclude the petitioners herein from agitating their claim of undue delay on the part of the arbitrator, in concluding arbitration proceedings and in passing the award, in appropriate legal proceedings; or to raise all the contentions urged before this court, on whether circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrators independence or impartiality, in proceedings under section 34 of the act, after an award is passed. subject to the observations made hereinabove, the civil revision petition fails and is, accordingly, dismissed. 21) it is to be noted here that pending c.r.p. before this court, there was stay of arbitration proceedings from 04.05.2015 till 16.03.2016. 22) from the narration of events till now, it is very clear that the arbitration proceedings were stayed from 25.03.2015 to 30.04.2015 and again from 04.05.2015 till 16.03.2016. in view of the liberty given by this court, the petitioners filed arbitration o.p.no.752 of 2016 (renumbered as c.o.p.no.81 of 2017), as a result of which the arbitration proceedings were again stayed from 13.04.2016, till the said c.o.p. was disposed of by the impugned order on 29.12.2017. 23) learned counsel for the petitioners herein would submit that there was no undue delay on the part of the sole arbitrator in conducting the arbitral proceedings and on the other hand, it is the respondents/petitioners, who are responsible for the delay. in other words it is pleaded that though in the review application, this honble court fixed a time limit of five months for disposing of the arbitral proceedings, but the matter was being stayed by one forum or the other, at the instance of the petitioners. it is further pleaded that there was no justification for the petitioners to plead the said ground, since the time granted gets automatically extended, due to the conduct of the parties in participating in the arbitration proceedings even after expiry of the said period, by waiving their right to insist on the time period to be followed by the arbitrator. 24) it is further pleaded that in the s.l.p., filed before the honble supreme court, assailing the order passed in review application and in arbitration application no.54 of 2012, the petitioners have specifically pleaded in ground no.s, that the honble high court was not correct in directing the arbitrator to conclude the proceedings within a period of five months, as the issue is complicated and that the arbitrator would require more time to adjudicate the dispute. that being so, whether it is permissible for the respondents herein now to contend that the proceedings before the arbitrator stand terminated, as he failed to complete the proceedings within the time fixed. it is further urged that in the petition filed under section 12 of the arbitration act, the petitioners never raised any objection with regard to undue delay. their main plea before the arbitrator was of bias. it is further urged that though section 14 (1) of the arbitration act provides for termination of the mandate of the arbitrator in the event the arbitrator unable to act without undue delay but not in a case where the delay was at the instance of a party to the proceedings. in support of the said plea taken, learned counsel for the petitioners relies upon the following citations. 1. m/s. hindustan wires limited v. mr. r.suresh 2. jayesh h.pandya v. subhtex india limited 3. bhupinder singh bindra v. union of india and another 4. vijay hiralal v. j.n.port trust 5. snehadeep auto centre v. hindustain petroleum corporation limited 6. shyam telecom ltd., v. arm ltd. 25) on the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents would contend that when the order passed by this honble high court in a review fixing the time limit for completing the arbitral proceedings was communicated to the arbitrator on 28.09.2013, itself there was no justification for him to continue with the proceedings even after 28.02.2014. it is further urged that though the arbitrator in the docket orders dated 07.02.2014 and 16.02.2014, observed that the arbitral proceedings have to be completed within the time fixed, but no application came to be filed by either of the party or the arbitrator, seeking extension of time. it is further urged that even assuming that the period of five months is to be calculated from 11.08.2014 ie., when the s.l.p.s were dismissed and the said order was communicated to the arbitrator in the month of september, 2014, the period of five months gets expired in the month of february, 2015. in the absence of any stay after september, 2014, it is urged that the order impugned herein cannot be found fault with. 26) insofar as the argument on delay, the petitioners are now estopped from raising such plea, since it is pleaded that after filing of appearance on 26.10.2013, the respondents therein took time for filing vakalath and counters to the memo filed by the petitioners on 10.11.2013 and 23.11.2013. thereafter, a claim-petition was filed on 25.01.2014 to which the respondents sought adjournment on 07.02.2014. on 16.12.2014 the petitioners/respondents therein failed to appear, and on 23.02.2014, an application under section 12 of the arbitration act came to be filed before the arbitrator. in view of the above, it is pleaded that the delay on the part of the petitioners/respondents is misconceived and lacks merit. 27) insofar as the plea of waiver by conduct, while explaining the purport of the judgments relied upon by the counsel for the petitioners, he would contend that in all the cases referred to above, time was fixed in the agreements entered into by the parties and the objecting party had rightly and willingly participated in the proceedings without any objection. under those circumstances, the courts held that by conduct the parties waived the time fixed under the agreement. since the time was fixed by the court and as the petitioners have opposed the appointment of arbitrator from the date of his appointment; never willingly participated in the said proceedings and as the office of the arbitrator has become functus officio after expiry of five months, pleads that his mandate will automatically get terminated. in support of his plea, he placed reliance on the judgment of the apex court in nbcc ltd. v. j.g.engineering and haryana packaids pvt. ltd., v. indian oil corporation limited and b.c.c.i. vs. kochi cricket private limited . stressing on the word to appearing in the first part of proviso to section 26 of the arbitration act, which is not there in second part of section 26 of the arbitration act and which reads as in relation to coupled with the judgment of the apex court in b.c.c.i. (14 supra) the counsel would contend that since c.o.p.no.81 of 2017 was filed under section 14 (1) of the arbitration act on 11.04.2016, after coming into effect of the arbitration and conciliation act, 2015, the amended act shall apply to the present case as well and in view of section 12 (5) of the arbitration act read with 7th schedule of the amended act, the arbitrator is de jure disqualified. 28) having regard to the arguments advanced by both the counsel, it would be necessary to go into the events which took place prior to the order passed in arbitration application no.54 of 2012. by an order dated 15.03.2013, this honble high court in arbitration application no.54 of 2012 passed the following order: as agreed, the applicants and the respondents shall refer their disputes to mr. ravinder singh sarma, whom they have already appointed as sole arbitrator, for resolution of dispute between them, in terms of the arbitration clause in the settlement deed. the arbitrator so appointed is at liberty to take the assistance of an advocate/legal counsel/expert, if required, for assessing the damaged caused. he is at liberty to fix his fee as also that of the fee of the advocate/legal counsel/expert, if he so chooses to take his or her assistance, for assessing the damage caused. 29) from a reading of the above, it is clear that basing on the agreement arrived at by the applicants and respondents the court referred the dispute to mr. ravinder singh sarma, who was already appointed as a sole arbitrator, for resolving the disputes between the parties in terms of the arbitration clause in the settlement deed. this order which was passed in the month of march, 2013, was sought to be reviewed by way of review application no.494 of 2013. the said review application was dismissed holding that the application for review was thoroughly misconceived, as by the earlier order, the arbitration mechanism and appointment of arbitrator have been activated. the court further held that there is no dispute that the arbitration agreement is valid and subsisting and there is no allegation that the consent recorded by the court was not correct. the court further observed that recording of consent earlier by the court was not required to be set at naught, when the parties have chosen an arbitrator and the same arbitrator was appointed by the court. therefore, the court held that there was no illegality or infirmity in the order passed, which was impugned in the review application. however, the court directed the learned arbitrator to proceed with the arbitration proceedings and to complete the same within five months from the date of communication of the said order. it would be useful to refer to the relevant portion of the order, which is as under: this application for review is thoroughly misconceived as by the earlier order the arbitration mechanism and appointment of arbitrator have been activated. there is no dispute that the arbitration agreement is valid and subsisting. there is no allegation that the consent recorded by the court is not correct. moreover, the recording of consent earlier by the court was not required to be set at naught. when the parties have chosen in agreement an arbitrator and the same arbitrator has been accepted by this court. therefore, no illegality or infirmity in the order passed by this court. the review application is therefore dismissed. i direct the learned arbitrator to proceed with the arbitration proceedings and complete the same within five months from the date of communication of this order. 30) after the dismissal of the review application, in the month of september, 2013, an application under section 12 of the arbitration act came to be made before the arbitrator. though five months period would expire by 29.02.2014, no objection was raised with regard to the said aspect. the contents of the application were on bias and the manner in which the consent was obtained for appointment of an arbitrator. after filing this application on 23.02.2014, s.l.p.s came to be preferred before the apex court challenging the order passed in arbitration application no.54 of 2012 and review application no.494 of 2013, which were dismissed on 11.08.2014, directing the arbitrator to dispose of the application un-influenced by the orders passed by the high court. 31) it is to be noted here that on 09.05.2014, the apex court stayed the proceedings before the arbitrator and thereafter on 11.08.2014 the said slps were dismissed with observations referred to earlier. on receipt of the order passed by the apex court, the arbitrator issued notices to the parties on 22.09.2014. on 11.10.2014, time was sought by the respondents herein and then on 01.11.2014 an application came to be filed to amend the grounds in section 12 application. on 15.11.2014, the application filed under section 12 of the arbitration act was dismissed and the matter was adjourned to 22.11.2014 for filing of written statement of the respondents herein. against the said orders, arbitration o.p.no.2889 of 2014 came to be filed and the said court stayed the proceedings before the arbitrator on 25.03.2015. 32) from the facts narrated above, it is clear that from 13.09.2013 there was no stay till 09.05.2014 and again from 11.08.2014 till 23.05.2015. at the same time, it is also to be noted that though the period of five months elapsed, no objection was raised by the respondents for termination of the mandate of the arbitrator on the ground of undue delay. on the other hand, in the slps filed before the apex court, it was specifically pleaded that the time limit of five months prescribed by the high court in the review application will not be sufficient to complete the arbitration proceedings, as it involves intricate questions in fact and law. it would be useful to refer to the said paragraph, which is as under: for that the honble high court has wrongly directed the learned arbitrator to conclude the arbitration proceedings between the parties within five months from the date of communication. it is most respectfully submitted, that the honble high court has further failed to appreciate that the dispute between the parties involves huge stakes and therefore needs fair and proper adjudication to provide justice to the parties. it would be unjust for the parties, if the arbitrator without application of mind would just rush to comply with the directions of the honble high court. it is submitted that looking into the complex issues of fact and law are involved in the matter, therefore oral evidence and crossexamination are required in the matter. the fixing of time limit in the matter has seriously prejudiced the case of the petitioners and the petitioners do not apprehend justice. further, it is very inconvenient for the petitioners to move from delhi to hyderabad nearly every week and take appropriate remedies under pressure and paucity of time. 33) it is also to be observed here that this plea was not raised in the application filed under section 12 of the arbitration act and also in the amendment sought to section 12 application. 34) the narration of events, which are undisputed till now, go to show that though the period of five months elapsed, but the party, who is raising the objection now, participated in the said proceedings without raising their finger on this aspect. the proceedings referred to till now, more particularly the order in arbitration application no.54 of 2012 and review application no.494 of 2013, makes it very clear that both the parties have consented for appointment of sri ravinder singh sarma, as an arbitrator and the parties also did not dispute the contents of arbitration agreement, or in words their plea with regard to appointment of an arbitrator has become final long back. 35) coming to the aspect of undue delay in completing the proceedings, as observed by us earlier, the objecting party participated in the said proceedings even after expiry of five months, as fixed by this court in the month of september, 2013 and also took a contra plea to the effect that the period of five months fixed by the high court may not be sufficient to complete the proceedings, thereby giving an implied consent, for continuation of the proceedings after expiry of five months, more so, when such a plea was never raised even in an application filed under section 12 of the arbitration act and also in the amendment sought to the said application. for the first time such an objection came to be raised in arbitration o.p.no.2889 of 2014. 36) it is also an admitted fact that though the respondents herein entered their appearance before the arbitrator on 26.10.2013, written statement came to be filed before him only on 16.05.2015. therefore, it is clear that no written statement came to be filed even after dismissal of the s.l.p. by the supreme court on 11.08.2014. 37) thereafter, c.r.p.no.1861 of 2015 came to be filed challenging the order in arbitration o.p.no.2889 of 2014, wherein this court granted stay on 04.05.2015 which was in force till it was dismissed on 16.03.2016. immediately thereafter the present o.p. 752 of 2016 (renumbered as c.o.p.no.81 of 2017) came to be filed on the ground of undue delay, wherein the proceedings before the arbitrator were stayed from 13.04.2016 till it was allowed on 29.12.2017. 38) from the above, it is clear that except for few pockets of period during the last five years, proceedings were pending either before the courts or stay of the arbitration proceedings was in operation. it is also to be observed here that though counsel for the respondents herein tried to contend that in spite of there being no stay from 13.09.2013 till 09.05.2014 and again from 11.08.2014 till 25.03.2015 and from 04.05.2015 till 16.03.2016, the arbitrator failed to complete the proceedings within the time fixed, but as observed by us earlier, written statement came to be filed only on 16.05.2015, after their right to file written statement, which was forfeited was subsequently set aside. 39) as observed by us, the arbitrator has been cautioning the parties to complete the proceedings before the expiry of the period. the delhi parties, who are the respondents herein, were directed to cooperate with the arbitral tribunal in completing the proceedings within the time, but the matter was getting postponed on one pretext or the other and it cannot be said that the arbitrator was at fault. 40) section 14 of the arbitration act deals with failure or impossibility to act. the said section prescribe that the mandate of an arbitrator shall get terminated and he shall be substituted by another arbitrator, if he becomes de jure or de facto unable to perform his functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay and that he withdraws from his office or the parties agree to the termination of his mandate. 41) section 14 of the arbitration act would attract only when there is undue delay. sub section (1) (2) and 3 of section 14 of the arbitration act, envisage a situation where the arbitrator may, on his own, recuse himself on objection being taken about his functioning as an arbitrator, or where both the parties agree to his mandate being terminated. section 14 (1) prescribe an automatic termination of the mandate of the arbitrator. in the prescribed eventualities, there is a statutory termination of the arbitrators mandate. in state of arunachal pradesh v. subhash projects and marketing limited a division bench of calcutta high court held that if the facts constituting the eventualities in section 14 (1) are neither in dispute nor demand any proof to be established, termination of the mandate of the arbitrator takes place on statutory prescription. the court held that where there is a controversy regarding the grounds, which entails the termination of the mandate, the party has to invariably approach the court to decide on the termination of the mandate. 42) dealing with the concept of undue delay and the meaning of word de jure and defacto and section 14 (1) (a), a division bench of this court in c.r.p.no.1861 of 2015, after referring to the authorities on subject and to the dictionary meaning of word dejure and defacto and relying upon the judgments in priknit retails limited (supra) and shyam telecom limited v. arm limited, observed that the incapacities referred in section 14 (1) (a) of the arbitration act, are such as to have a direct nexus with the inability of the arbitrator to perform his functions. this incapacity or disability should occur to the arbitrator himself so that he becomes, as a matter of law or fact, unable to perform his function. the dejure impossibility referred to in section 14 (1) (a) is the impossibility which occurs due to factors personal to the arbitrator, and de facto inability occurs due to factors beyond the control of the arbitrator. it has been observed that mere legal disability is not a condition precedent for invocation of section 14 of the act. the dejure inability must relate to his ability to function. 43) insofar as usage of word delay in section 14 (1) of the act, which relates to termination of the mandate of arbitrator, if it is for other reasons fails to act without undue delay. the division bench observed that the word delay is qualified by the word undue. undue delay, and not mere delay, would alone justify the court to declare the mandate of the arbitrator as terminated. the division bench held that the word undue means unjustified, unwarranted, unreasonable, excessive and inordinate. in order to declare that the mandate of the arbitrator stands terminated, the court must be satisfied that the delay on the part of the arbitrator, was unjustified, inordinate or unwarranted. it has also held that for the court, exercising jurisdiction under section 14 (2) of the act, to declare that the mandate of the arbitrator stands terminated, the petitioner was not only required to plead but also to prove that the arbitrator had failed to act without undue delay. the word fail means neglect, go wrong or fall short of what is expected. what is required to plead and prove is that the arbitrator had neglected to act without excessive or inordinate delay. the division bench further held that even if there is a delay on the part of the arbitrator in completing the proceedings, and to pass an award, it was open to the parties to waive their right to object. 44) section 4 of the act deal with waiver of right to object, ie., a party who knows that any provision of this part from which the parties may derogate, or any requirement under the arbitration agreement, has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating his objection to such non-compliance without undue delay or, if the time limit is provided for stating that objection, within that period of time, shall be deemed to have waived his right to so object. (c.r.p.no.1861 of 2015). 45) in mascon multiservices and consultants private limited vs. bharat oman refineries limited the bombay high court held that the parties, that raise questions as to jurisdiction, must be held to have given a go bye to the stipulation as to time within which an award is to be made; if a party attends a number of meetings, after the time for making the award has expired, it would be a strong indication of waiver. the strength of an indication of waiver is not necessarily directly proportional to the number of meetings attended by a party after the stipulated time for making the award. it is the nature of the meeting and the nature of the conduct of a party which is as, if not more, important. 46) in hindustan wires limited v. r.suresh (6 supra) a learned single judge of bombay high court held that, in view of the consent of both the parties for enlargement of time to complete the arbitration proceedings and to make an award, the mandate of the arbitrator does not come to an end; the arbitrator does not cease to have jurisdiction to proceed with the matter and to make an award; and even by the conduct of both parties, the time to complete arbitration proceeding and to make an award, stand extended. 47) in jayesh h.pandya v. subhtex india limited (7 supra) the bombay high court held as under: where a party intends to assert a right of adherence to the time prescribed by the arbitration agreement, it must, at the earliest opportunity, make its intention know to ensure compliance with the rigid standard as to time; to hold otherwise would be to encourage a lack of candour on the part of the parties in their dealings before the arbitrator. the arbitrator was justified in coming to the conclusion that the petitioners had, by their conduct, waived their objection to enforce a punctilious observance of the time schedule of four months. it is held that to adopt any other construction would frustrate the object and the purpose of arbitral proceedings and being the whole machinery provided by the act, to facilitate an efficacious recourse to arbitration, into grave peril. 48) in bhupinder singh bindra v. union of india and another (8 supra) the apex court held that the court interpose and interdict the appointment of an arbitrator, when the parties have chosen under the terms of the contract unless legal misconduct of the arbitrator, fraud, disqualification etc. is pleaded and proved. the court held that there must be just and sufficient cause for revocation. in the said case, though there was no allegation of misconduct, fraud or disqualification but due to noncooperation of one of the parties the delay occurred in making the award. under those circumstances, it has been held that the court has no jurisdiction to revoke the appointment of an arbitrator on the ground of latches and appoint another person as arbitrator without consent of both the parties to the contract. 49) in snehadeep auto centre v. hindustan petroleum corporation limited (10 supra) a division bench of bombay high court held that in n.b.c.c.limited (12 supra) the apex court did not lay down an absolute proposition that the moment the award is made, after the stipulated period, it must be set aside; the observation of the supreme court, that the arbitrator was bound to make and publish his award within the time mutually agreed upon by the parties unless the parties consented to further enlargement of time, did not rule out a contingency where the conduct of the parties could be implied with certainty to mean that they had consented not to insist on the mandatory time limit. the court also held that no unambiguous stand can be taken that the arbitrator cannot proceed to declare the award, as his mandate had come to an end; and this conduct amounted to waiver of the objection of time limit, being a mandatory requirement for pronouncement of the award. in nbcc limited (12 supra) the apex court recognized the importance of imposition of a time limit for conclusion of arbitration proceedings. it was a case where the arbitrator could not conclude the proceeding as agreed upon by the parties. the court held that the arbitrator has extended the time provided to it without any concrete reasons whatsoever and thus his mandate was liable to be terminated. the apex court held that even assuming that the arbitration process involves highly technical and complex issues, which are time consuming, it was open for the arbitrator or for the parties to approach the court for extension of time to conclude the arbitration proceedings, which was not done either by the arbitrator or by any of the parties. there was no cogent reason for the delay in making and publishing the award by the arbitrator, as he already had relevant material at his disposal and could base his finding, on the observation made by the three arbitrators, who were appointed prior to him. 50) ramchandra rungta v. ram swarup rungta and jayesh h.pandya (7 supra), the arbitration proceedings continued and the parties were regularly appearing before the respective arbitrators, by seeking extension of time to file their pleadings, for adjournment etc. in both the cases it was held that a clear intention had been evinced by the parties, waiving their right to insist on the time limit contained in the respective arbitration agreements for making and publishing the award. hence, the bombay and delhi high courts, in the facts of those cases, held that there was waiver of the stipulation in the arbitration agreement for publication of the award, within the specific period of time, by the parties. 51) the learned counsel for the respondents relied upon the judgment of in hindustan wires limited v. r.suresh (6 supra) and also n.b.c.c. limited (12 supra), to contend that as the time period for conclusion of proceedings had expired and in the absence of any application seeking extension of time, the arbitrator ceases to have jurisdiction. according to him, since the time limit is fixed by the court, the period of participation cannot be waived on mere participation even after the expiry of the period. 52) the judgment of the apex court in nbcc limited (12 supra) which is relied to show that the time limit fixed can only be extended after obtaining necessary orders from the court which has imposed the time, was a case where the parties initially agreed to extend the time till 31.10.1994 for making and publishing the award and the same was further extended till 30.09.2005, but the arbitrator failed to pass an award by 30.09.2005. 53) situation here is some what different. here the proceedings have commenced and no reply to the claimpetition was filed till 16.05.2015 and the stay was in operation during the period from 25.03.2015 to 30.04.2015 and again from 04.05.2015 till 16.03.2016 and most importantly the respondents herein, who are raising the objection of time limit now, participated in the proceedings even after the expiry of time limit and also took the plea before the apex court that the time limit as fixed by the high court is not sufficient to complete the proceedings. further, written statement came to be filed on 16.05.2015 after their right to file which was earlier forfeited and then restored. such being the position, the plea now taken by the very same party to terminate the mandate of the arbitrator on the ground of delay, cannot be accepted and the judgment of the apex court in nbcc limited (12 supra), in our view may not apply to the case on hand. 54) from this, it is clear that the respondents herein were not co-operating with the arbitrator in filing the written statement to the claim-petition and only after they were unsuccessful before the apex court, a written statement came to be filed and thereafter again initiated proceedings before the civil court and then in high court, where there was a stay till 16.03.2016. 55) further, the time limit for completing the arbitration proceedings was not fixed at the time when the arbitrator was appointed by the court at the earliest point of time. the time limit came to be fixed, in a review application filed by the respondents herein questioning the appointment of an arbitrator. 56) therefore, the arbitrator cannot be found fault with for the delay in arbitration proceedings more so when the record clearly shows that the respondents waived their right in not raising any objection with regard to continuation of the proceedings or seeking termination of the mandate of the arbitrator on the ground that the time prescribed for making the award expired. in fact the docket entries before the arbitrator dated 07.02.2014 and 16.02.2014 show that he was pleading the parties more particularly the delhi parties (respondents herein) to cooperate with the arbitration so as to complete the proceedings within the specified time to the maximum possible extent. hence, the ground on which the mandate of the arbitrator came to be terminated, in our view, cannot be accepted. 57) one other ground which is sought to be raised by the learned counsel for the respondents is as to whether the arbitration and conciliation amendment act, 2015 will apply to the case on hand. 58) the learned counsel took us through section 26 of the amended act, 2015 to show that only the act as it stands after 2015 shall apply to the present case. learned counsel for the respondents placed reliance on the judgment of bcci vs. kochi cricket pvt. ltd. (14 supra) and also the judgment of calcutta high court in tufan chatterjee v. rangan dhar and the judgment of delhi high court in raffles design international india private limited and others v. educomp professional education limited and others in support of his plea. 59) before dealing with the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, it would be appropriate to refer to section 26 of the amended act, which is as under: 26. act not to apply to pending arbitral proceedings: nothing contained in this act shall apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced, in accordance with the provisions of section 21 of the principal act, before the commencement of this act unless the parties otherwise agree but this act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of this act. 60) section 26 of the amendment act postulates that nothing contained in the said amendment act is to apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced in accordance with the provisions of section 21 of the principal act, unless the parties otherwise agree. but the amendment act would apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced, on or after the date of commencement of the amended act. 61) according to him, the above provision has to be read in two parts. the first part being, nothing contained in this act shall apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced in accordance with the provisions of section 21 of the principal act, before the commencement of the amendment act, unless the parties otherwise agree and the second part which is in continuation of the first part is to be read as that this act would apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of 2015 act. according to him, the word to appearing in the first part of the provision is not there in second part, which reads instead as in relation to, which thereby signifies that both the parts have a corresponding different interpretation to the above provision. according to him, the first part refers to arbitral proceedings before the tribunal and the second part in relation to arbitral proceedings. in view of the judgment of the apex court in bcci (14 supra), it is urged that the amendment act, 2015 will not apply to the arbitral proceedings that have commenced before the date of coming into effect of the amendment act and it will apply to the court proceedings which have commenced on or after the amendment act came into force. 62) in other words, his plea is that the amendment act which came into force with effect from 23.10.2015, would apply to the arbitral proceedings which commenced after 23.10.2015 but not to arbitral proceedings which commenced before 23.10.2015. having regard to the above, it is urged that in view of section 12 (5) read with 7 schedule of the amended act, the arbitrator is de jure disqualified. 63) a plain reading of section 26 of the amendment act, would indicate that nothing contained in the amended act shall apply to arbitral proceedings commenced, in accordance with provisions of section 21 of the principal act, before commencement of this act, unless parties otherwise agree, but this act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings on or after the date of commencement of the amended act. 64) though the learned counsel for the respondents relied upon the judgments of calcutta high court and delhi high court namely tufan chatterjee (18 supra) and raffles design international india private limited and others (19 supra), but in view of the judgment of the apex court in bcci v. kochi cricket private limited (14 supra), it may not be necessary to refer to the said judgments. 65) the judgment of the apex court in bcci v. kochi (14 supra) was a case where a notice dated 18.01.2012 was sent by kochi cricket pvt. limited, invoking the arbitration under a franchise agreement dated 12.03.2011. a sole arbitrator was appointed, who delivered two arbitral awards dated 22.06.2015 against the appellant and in favour of the respondents. on 16.09.2015, the appellants filed an application under section 34 of arbitration act, 1996 in the bombay high court challenging the aforesaid arbitral awards. on 26.11.2015, the respondents filed two execution applications in the high court, for payment of the amounts awarded under the two awards, pending enforcement of such awards. these were resisted by two chamber summons filed by the appellants dated 3.12.2015, seeking dismissal of the aforesaid execution applications on the ground that the old section 36 would be applicable and that, therefore there would be an automatic stay of the awards until section 34 proceedings are decided. having regard to the above, the question before the court was as to the construction of section 26 of the amendment act, 2015. in other words, the apex court was dealing with the effect of an application under section 34 of the arbitration 1996 act after the amendment act came into force. further, the question with which the bench was confronted was whether section 36, which was substituted by the amendment act, would apply in its amended form or in its original form to the appeals in question. after referring to the authorities on the subject and interpreting the provisions under old and new act, the apex court dismissed the appeals. 66) dealing with the provisions of the old act and the amendment act, 2015, the honble court in para nos.24 and 25 came to the following conclusions, which are as under: 24. what will be noticed, so far as the first part is concerned, which states, nothing contained in this act shall apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced, in accordance with the provisions of section 21 of the principal act, before the commencement of this act unless the parties otherwise agree.. is that: (1) the arbitral proceedings and their commencement is mentioned in the context of section 21 of the principal act; (2) the expression used is to and not in relation to; and (3) parties may otherwise agree. so far as the second part of section 26 is concerned, namely, the part which reads but this act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of this act makes it clear that the expression in relation to is used; and the expression the arbitral proceedings and in accordance with the provisions of section 21 of the principal act is conspicuous by its absence. 25. that the expression the arbitral proceedings refers to proceedings before an arbitral tribunal is clear from the heading of chapter v of the 1996 act, which reads as follows: conduct of arbitral proceedings the entire chapter consists of sections 18 to 27 dealing with the conduct of arbitral proceedings before an arbitral tribunal. what is also important to notice is that these proceedings alone are referred to, the expression to as contrasted with the expression in relation to making this clear. also, the reference to section 21 of the 1996 act, which appears in chapter v, and which speaks of the arbitral proceedings commencing on the date on which a request for a dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent, would also make it clear that it is these proceedings, and no others, that form the subject matter of the first part of section 26. also, since the conduct of arbitral proceedings is largely procedural in nature, parties may otherwise agree and apply the amendment act to arbitral proceedings that have commenced before the amendment act came into force. in stark contrast to the first part of section 26 is the second part, where the amendment act is made applicable in relation to arbitral proceedings which commenced on or after the date of commencement of the amendment act. what is conspicuous by its absence in the second part is any reference to section 21 of the 1996 act. whereas the first part refers only to arbitral proceedings before an arbitral tribunal, the second part refers to court proceedings in relation to arbitral proceedings, and it is the commencement of these court proceedings that is referred to in the second part of section 26, as the words in relation to the arbitral proceedings in the second part are not controlled by the application of section 21 of the 1996 act. section 26, therefore, bifurcates proceedings, as has been stated above, with a great degree of clarity, into two sets of proceedings arbitral proceedings themselves, and court proceedings in relation thereto. the reason why the first part of section 26 is couched in negative form is only to state that the amendment act will apply even to arbitral proceedings commenced before the amendment if parties otherwise agree. if the first part of section 26 were couched in positive language (like the second part), it would have been necessary to add a proviso stating that the amendment act would apply even to arbitral proceedings commenced before the amendment if the parties agree. in either case, the intention of the legislature remains the same, the negative form conveying exactly what could have been stated positively, with the necessary proviso. obviously, arbitral proceedings having been subsumed in the first part cannot reappear in the second part, and the expression in relation to arbitral proceedings would, therefore, apply only to court proceedings which relate to the arbitral proceedings. the scheme of section 26 is thus clear: that the amendment act is prospective in nature, and will apply to those arbitral proceedings that are commenced, as understood by section 21 of the principal act, on or after the amendment act, and to court proceedings which have commenced on or after the amendment act came into force. 67) from the judgment of the apex court, it is clear that the first part deals with reference to arbitral proceedings before the arbitrary tribunal and the amendment act would apply even to arbitral proceedings commenced before the amendment, if the parties otherwise agree. in the instant case, we do not find any such consent being given by any of the parties warranting applicability of the amended act, since the arbitration proceedings came to be initiated prior to the amendment. further section 29-a of the amendment act, prescribes time limit for completion of arbitral proceedings. therefore the parties may opt to deal under the new act even in cases which are pending before the arbitrator as on the date of commencement of the amendment act. on such option being exercised, the parties are bound under the provisions of new act. 68) as observed by us earlier, in the instant case, we do not find any such consent being given by the parties seeking applicability of the amendment act, 2015. therefore, the argument of the learned counsel for the respondents that the arbitrator is de jure disqualified in view of section 12 (5) of the act cannot be accepted. 69) for the aforesaid reasons, the civil revision petition is allowed holding that the order under challenge terminating the mandate of the arbitrator is illegal and incorrect, and accordingly, the same is set aside. 70) there shall be no order as to costs. miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending, shall stand closed. ____________________ c.praveen kumar, j ____________ t.
