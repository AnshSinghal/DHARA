The present Petitioner is also the Petitioner in Arbp No. 07 of 2022 filed under Sec. 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 (in short \"Act\") with a prayer to set aside the interim order/award dtd.11.12.2020 and also the award dtd.30.11.2021 passed by the learned Arbitration Tribunal in Arbitration Proceeding No. 68 of 2019. The Petitioner was the Respondent in Arbp No. 68 of 2019 filed by the Claimant/the present Opp. Party. \nThe Petitioner subsequent to filing of the proceeding in Arbp No. 07 of 2022 filed a Petition under Sec. 36(3) of the Act vide Annexure-4 with a prayer to stay the operation of the award dtd.30.11.2021 passed by the leaned Arbitration Tribunal (in short \"Tribunal\") in Arbp No. 68 of 2019 till disposal of the proceeding in question. Learned Commercial Court vide the impugned order dtd.29.07.2022 under Annexure-1 while staying the enforcement of the award dt.30.11.2021 since directed the Petitioner to deposit 100% of the awarded amount i.e. 18,43,48,401/- (Eighteen crore forty three lakh forty eight thousand four hundred one), the Petitioner being aggrieved by the said stipulation is before this Court in the present writ petition. \n// 3 //\n2. The factual backdrop giving rise to filing of the proceeding in Arbp No. 07 of 2022 is that the Department of Commerce & Transport (Govt. of Odisha) vide its Request For Proposal (Rfp) dtd.14.12.2009 invited proposals for the development of Baramunda Bus Terminal along with commercial facilities on Ppp Mode. Pursuant to such invitation M/s. Arss Infrastructure Project Ltd. (\"Arss Infra\") was selected as the preferred bidder of Rs.56,00,00,000/- (Rupees fifty six crore) towards concession fee. Subsequently on 25.08.2010 Arss Infra made payment of Rs.18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) towards the first installment of concession fee and Rs. 2,33,24,038/- (Rupees Two crore thirty three lakh twenty four thousand thirty eight) towards non-refundable project development fee. \nAs per the Rpf, a Special Purpose Vehicle Entity by the name of Arss Bus Terminal Pvt. Ltd.-Opp. Party herein (a Joint Venture between Arss Infra & one Welspun Infratech Ltd. (\"Welspun\")) was incorporated, who was made the 'concessionaire' and was to implement the project. \nAccordingly, the concession agreement was executed between the Petitioner and the Opp. Party and Arss Infra on // 4 // 16.03.2011, wherein lease of 14.43 acres of land was granted to the Opp. Party. As per the said agreement 90 years lease was granted with respect to 40% land over which it was to build the commercial complex and further a lease of 15 years was granted to the Opp. Party with respect to the balance 60% of the land over which the bus terminal was to come up. The Concessionaire was also granted the right to collect user fee, entry fee etc. from users of those facilities. In the said agreement at Clause 16.3 contained the arbitration clause, which provides for dispute resolution by a panel of three (3) Arbitrators. \n2.1.  But subsequent to execution of the agreement on 16.03.2011, the same was challenged before this Court in W.P.(C) No. 30961 of 2011. This Court initially vide order dtd.30.03.2012 passed an order of status quo and because of that the project work came to a stand still. Subsequently, this Court vide order dtd.20.12.2012 declared the Concession Agreement to be void ab initio and quashed the same on different grounds. The said order passed by this Court on 20.12.2012 was never challenged by any of the Parties to the agreement dtd.16.03.2011 and accordingly it attained finality in the eye of law. \n// 5 // 2.2. As this Court declared the concession agreement dtd.16.03.2011 as void ab initio, the Parties to the agreement terminated the concession agreement on 30.04.2013. Thereafter, Welspun moved the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in Arbitration Petition (L) No. 711 of 2013, filed under Sec. 9 of the Act on 20.05.2013 against ARSS Infra taking into account the Joint Venture Agreement executed in between them for restraining the Petitioner herein to return the amount to the present Opp. Party i.e. ARSS Bus Terminal Pvt. Ltd. In the said proceeding Hon'ble Bombay High Court passed an interim order on 30.05.2013 restraining the Petitioner from making payment of the amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) either to the ARSS Infra or to the Private Opp. Party. The order dtd.30.05.2013 is reproduced hereunder:-\n\"5. I am thus not inclined to accept the submissions made by the 1st respondent that in view of pendency of the application made by the 2nd respondent before the High Court of Orissa, this application need not be entertained. \nXXX XXX XXX 6. In view of the fact that the concession agreement has already been declared void by the High Court of Orissa, it is likely that 3rd respondent may release the payment made by the 2nd respondent in favour of the 1st respondent. In my view, prima facie case is made out for grant of ad-interim relief. If the 3rd respondent makes any payment to the 1st respondent directly, in my view, rights of the petitioner would be seriously affected.\" \n// 6 // 2.3. The matter in Arbitration Petition No. 711 of 2013 was finally disposed of by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court on 03.08.2015 with the following order:-\n\"52. 1, therefore, pass the following order :-\n(a) Respondent no.3 is restrained from making payment of amount of Rs.18,66,66,667/- or any other amount in relation to the project on account of cancellation of the concession agreement to respondent no.1, petitioner or respondent no.2. \n(b) Respondent no.3 is directed to deposit the aforesaid amount with the Prothonotary and Senior Master of this court within two weeks from the date of communication of this order by the petitioner. Upon such deposit of the amount by the respondent no.3 as directed, Prothonotary and Senior Master shall invest the said amount in a fixed deposit of any nationalized bank initially for a period of two years and for like period after obtaining further orders from this court. The deposit of the said amount would be subject to further orders as may be passed by the arbitral tribunal. \n(c) Petitioner, respondent no.1 and respondent no.2 are directed to proceed with the arbitral proceedings without any further delay. \n(d) Parties to the present proceedings to act on the authenticated copy of this order.\"\n2.4. In terms of the final order passed by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court on 03.08.2015 the Petitioner as directed deposited the entire amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) before the said Court on 05.10.2015 and the said amount subsequently was released in favour of Welspun on 28.10.2015. But in the meantime the Opp. Party herein filed a Petition under Sec. 11 of the Act before this Court in ARBP No. 53 of 2016. This Court vide order dtd.15.11.2019 // 7 // appointed Sri Justice Basudev Panigrahi and Dr. Justice A.K. Rath, former Judges of this Court as the Arbitrators for the Parties. The said two Arbitrators were permitted to nominate a third arbitrator and to commence the proceeding thereafter. Though the order passed by this Court on 15.11.2019 was challenged by the Petitioner herein before the Hon'ble Suprement Court in Special Leave petition (Civil) Diary No(S). 10086 of 2020, but the said SLP was dismissed vide order dtd.10.06.2020. The Opp. Party thereafter filed the statement of claim before the learned Arbitrators. On being noticed the Petitioner herein also filed the written statement in Arbitration Proceeding No. 68 of 2019. Learned Arbitrators initially passed an order/interim award on 11.12.2020 and dispose of the matter with passing of the final award on 30.11.2021. As per the said award, the Petitioner was directed to pay award amount of Rs.18,43,48,401/- (Rupees eighteen crore forty three lakh forty eight thousand four hundred one). \n2.5. The Petitioner being aggrieved by the said award as stated hereinabove approached the learned Commercial Court in ARBP No. 07 of 2022. In the said proceeding when the prayer of the Petitioner to stay the operation of the award was allowed subject to deposit of the entire award amount vide the impugned order // 8 // dtd.29.07.2022 the present writ petition has been filed challenging the said stipulation to deposit 100% of the awarded amount. \n3. It is the case of the Petitioner that pursuant to the order passed by he Hon'ble Bombay High Court on 03.08.2015 the Petitioner herein has already deposited the first installment amount of Rs.18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) on 05.10.2015. But the learned Arbitrators while passing the final award, held the Petitioner liable on different counts more particularly mentioned under the heading Nos. (A) to (DD) amounting to Rs. 17,93,48,401/- (Rupees Seventeen crore ninety three lakh forty eight thousand four hundred one) and litigation expenses of Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty lakhs) in total Rs. 18,43,48,401/- (Rupees eighteen crore forty three lakh forty eight thousand four hundred one). \n3.1. Mr. Parija, learned Sr. Counsel appearing for the Petitioner along with Mr. A. Tripathy, vehemently contended that learned Arbitrators while passing the award under different headings have committed wrong in allowing interest @ 7% per annum from 23.08.2010 to 05.10.2015 on the first installment amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven). Learned Sr. Counsel also contended that learned // 9 // Arbitrators also illegally awarded interest @ 7% per annum from 28.08.2010 to 30.10.2021 on the non-refundable amount deposited by the ARSS Infra amounting to Rs.2,33,24,038/- (Rupees Two crore thirty three lakh twenty four thousand thirty eight). It is contended that on those two counts interest on the first installment amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) & interest on the non- refundable amount of Rs.2,33,24,038/- (Rupees Two crore thirty three lakh twenty four thousand thirty eight) which comes to Rs.6,68,51,806/- (Rupees Six crore sixty eight lakhs fifty one thousand eight hundred six) and Rs.1,82,40,567/- (Rupees One crore eight two lakh forty thousand five hundred sixty seven) respectively has been awarded. \n3.2. It is further contended that since in view of the interim order passed by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court on 30.05.2013 the Petitioner was restrained from making the payment till the Petitioner is directed to deposit the said amount before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court as per order dt.03.08.2015, the Petitioner is not liable to pay interest on the above said amount for the period from 30.05.2013 to 05.10.2015. It is also contended that since the amount of Rs.2,33,24,038/- (Rupees Two crore thirty three lakh twenty four // 10 // thousand thirty eight) was non-refundable in nature, the Petitioner is not liable to pay any interest on the same for the period from 28.08.2010 to 30.10.2021. Because of such wrong committed by the learned Arbitrators in awarding interest on the amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) for the period from 23.08.2010 to 05.10.2015 & the interest on the non-refundable amount of Rs. 2,33,24,038/- (Rupees Two crore thirty three lakh twenty four thousand thirty eight) for the period from 28.08.2010 to 30.10.2021, the Petitioner has been directed to deposit Rs. 17,93,48,401/- (Rupees Seventeen lakh ninety three lakh forty eight thousand four hundred one) towards the claim on different counts under headings (A) to (DD).\n3.3. Learned Sr. Counsel also contended that if the interest calculated on the above said two deposits made by ARSS Infra will be deducted for the present without prejudice to the claim of either of the Parties, the Petitioner is ready to deposit the balance amount. All those points though were raised before the learned Commercial Court while filing the petition under Sec. 36(3) of the Act, but the learned Commercial Court without proper appreciation of the grounds taken in the petition in ARBP No. 07 of 2022 as well as the grounds taken // 11 // in the petition filed under Sec. 36(3) of the Act while allowing the petition directed for deposit of the entire awarded amount of Rs. 18,43,48,401/- (Rupees eighteen crore forty three lakh forty eight thousand four hundred one). It is fairly submitted by the learned Sr. Counsel that if the Petitioner for the present and without prejudice to the rights of the Parties will be permitted to deposit the balance amount save and except the interest awarded on the amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) and Rs. 2,33,24,038/- (Rupees Two crore thirty three lakh twenty four thousand thirty eight) vide headings B & C of the award dtd.30.11.2021, the Petitioner is ready to deposit the amount in question. \n4. Mr. Manish Panda, learned counsel appearing for the Opp. Party on the other hand raised the question of maintainability of the present writ petition against the impugned order passed by the learned Commercial Court on 29.07.2022. In view of such stand taken by the learned counsel appearing for the Opp. Party with regard to maintainability of the present writ petition against the impugned order, this Court thinks it proper to decide the same at the first instance prior to going into the merits of the case. \n// 12 // 4.1. Learned counsel for the Opp. Party contended that in view of the provision contained under Sec. 5 of the Act there is very limited scope of judicial intervention save and except as prescribed under the Act only. For better appreciation Sec. 5 of the Act is reproduced hereunder:-\n\"Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this Part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part.\" \n4.2. It is also contended by the learned counsel appearing for the Opp.\nParty that although an order passed under Sec. 36(3) of the Act is not appealable and therefore, the writ petition can be preferred against the same, but the scope of interference by the writ court is only by the way of exceptional rarity and where there must be a patent lack of inherent jurisdiction. It is also contended that since the learned Commercial Court has directed the Petitioner herein to deposit the entire award amount in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court rendered in the case of Navayuga Engineering Company v. Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (2021 SCC OnLine SC 469), no illegality can be found with the impugned order passed by the learned Commercial Court on 29.07.2022. 4.3. On the question of maintainability of the writ petition learned counsel appearing for the Opp. Party relied on the decision of the // 13 // Hon'ble Apex Court rendered in the case of Bhaben Construction v. Executive Engineer Sardar Sarovar Nigam (2021 SCC OnLine SC 8) and the decision in the case of Deep Industries Ltd. Vs. ONGC Ltd. & Anr. ((2020) 15 SCC 706). Learned counsel appearing for the Opp. Party also relied on another decision in the case of Radhey Shyam & Anr. Vs. Chhabi Nath & Ors. (2015) 5 SCC 423. The decision in the case of Shalini Shyam Shetty & Anr. Vs. Rajendra Shankar Patil ((2010) 8 SCC 329) was also relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the Opp. Party. 4.4. In the case of Navayuga Engineering Company (supra) Hon'ble Apex Court in Para 3 & 4 has held as follows:-\n\"3. An Arbitral Award dated 16.08.2018 was made in favour of the appellant allowing 10 out of 16 claims which amounted to Rs. 175.32 Crores. The Award was made of a sum of Rs. 122.76 Crores amounting to Rs. 56.23 Crores principal and Rs. 66.53 Crores on various heads. A Section 34 petition that has been filed by the respondent is pending before the learned Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge at Bengaluru. On 21.12.2019, execution of the said Award was stayed on deposit of 60% of the figure of Rs. 122.76 Crores and security being given for the balance. Both parties filed writ petitions against the aforesaid order. The writ petition filed by the appellant was dismissed. The writ petition filed by the respondent was allowed in which a deposit of 50% of the principal amount of Rs. 56.23 Crores was ordered. \nXXX XXX XXX 4. Despite this Court repeatedly referring to Section 5 of the Arbitration Act in particular and the Arbitration Act in general and despite this Court having laid down in Deep Industries Ltd. v. ONGC (2020) 15 SCC 706 that the High Court under Article 226 and 227 should be extremely // 14 // circumspect in interfering with orders passed under the Arbitration Act, such interference being only in cases of exceptional rarity or cases which are stated to be patently lacking in inherent jurisdiction, we find that High Courts are interfering with deposit orders that have been made. This is not a case of exceptional rarity or of any patent lack of inherent jurisdiction.\" \n4.5. Similarly in the case of Bhaben Construction (supra) Hon'ble Apex Court in Para 17 to 19 has held as follows:-\n\"17. In any case, the hierarchy in our legal framework, mandates that a legislative enactment cannot curtail a Constitutional right. In Nivedita Sharma v. Cellular Operators Association of India, (2011) 14 SCC 337, this Court referred to several judgments and held:\n\"11. We have considered the respective arguments/submissions. There cannot be any dispute that the power of the High Courts to issue directions, orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, certiorari, mandamus, quo warranto and prohibition under Article 226 of the Constitution is a basic feature of the Constitution and cannot be curtailed by parliamentary legislation L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261. However, it is one thing to say that in exercise of the power vested in it under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court can entertain a writ petition against any order passed by or action taken by the State and/or its agency/instrumentality or any public authority or order passed by a quasi-judicial body/authority, and it is an altogether different thing to say that each and every petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution must be entertained by the High Court as a matter of course ignoring the fact that the aggrieved person has an effective alternative remedy. Rather, it is settled law that when a statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievances, a writ petition should not be entertained ignoring the statutory dispensation. \nXXX XXX XXX 18. It is therefore, prudent for a Judge to not exercise discretion to allow judicial interference beyond the procedure established under the enactment. This power needs to be exercised in exceptional rarity, wherein one party is left remediless under the statute or a clear 'bad faith' shown by one of the parties. This high standard set by // 15 // this Court is in terms of the legislative intention to make the arbitration fair and efficient. \nXXX XXX XXX 19. In this context we may observe Deep Industries Limited v. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1602, wherein interplay of Section 5 of the Arbitration Act and Article 227 of the Constitution was analyzed as under:\n\"15. Most significant of all is the nonobstante clause contained in Section 5 which states that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, in matters that arise under Part I of the Arbitration Act, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part. Section 37 grants a constricted right of first appeal against certain judgments and orders and no others. Further, the statutory mandate also provides for one bite at the cherry, and interdicts a second appeal being filed (See Section 37(2) of the Act). \n16. This being the case, there is no doubt whatsoever that if petitions were to be filed under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution against orders passed in appeals under Section 37, the entire arbitral process would be derailed and would not come to fruition for many years. At the same time, we cannot forget that Article 227 is a constitutional provision which remains untouched by the non-obstante clause of Section 5 of the Act. In these circumstances, what is important to note is that though petitions can be filed under Article 227 against judgments allowing or dismissing first appeals under Section 37 of the Act, yet the High Court would be extremely circumspect in interfering with the same, taking into account the statutory policy as adumbrated by us herein above so that interference is restricted to orders that are passed which are patently lacking in inherent jurisdiction.\" \n4.6. In the case of Deep Industries (supra) Hon'ble Apex Court in Para 16, 17 & 18 has held as follows:-\n\"16. Most significant of all is the non obstante clause contained in Section 5 which states that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, in matters that arise under Part I of the Arbitration Act, no judicial authority shall // 16 // intervene except where so provided in this Part. Section 37 grants a constricted right of first appeal against certain judgments and orders and no others. Further, the statutory mandate also provides for one bite at the cherry, and interdicts a second appeal being filed [see Section 37(2) of the Act].\nXXX XXX XXX 17. This being the case, there is no doubt whatsoever that if petitions were to be filed under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution against orders passed in appeals under Section 37, the entire arbitral process would be derailed and would not come to fruition for many years. At the same time, we cannot forget that Article 227 is a constitutional provision which remains untouched by the non obstante clause of Section 5 of the Act. In these circumstances, what is important to note is that though petitions can be filed under Article 227 against judgments allowing or dismissing first appeals under Section 37 of the Act, yet the High Court would be extremely circumspect in interfering with the same, taking into account the statutory policy as adumbrated by us hereinabove so that interference is restricted to orders that are passed which are patently lacking in inherent jurisdiction. \nXXX XXX XXX 18. In Nivedita Sharma v. COAP, this Court referred to several judgments and held: (SCC pp. 343-45, paras 11-16) \"11. We have considered the respective arguments/submissions. There cannot be any dispute that the power of the High Courts to issue directions, orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, certiorari, mandamus, quo warranto and prohibition under Article 226 of the Constitution is a basic feature of the Constitution and cannot be curtailed by parliamentary legislation- L Chandra Kumar v. Union of India'. However, it is one thing to say that in exercise of the power vested in it under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court can entertain a writ petition against any order passed by or action taken by the State and/or its agency/instrumentality or any public authority or order passed by a quasi- judicial body/authority, and it is an altogether different thing to say that each and every petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution must be entertained by the High Court as a matter of course ignoring the fact that the aggrieved person has an effective alternative remedy. Rather, it is settled law that when a statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievances, a writ petition should not be entertained ignoring the statutory dispensation. \n// 17 //\n12. In Thansingh Nathmal v. Supt. of Taxes, this Court adverted to the rule of self-imposed restraint that the writ petition will not be entertained if an effective remedy is available to the aggrieved person and observed: (AIR p. 1423, para 7) '7. ... The High Court does not therefore act as a court of appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal, to correct errors of fact, and does not by assuming jurisdiction under Article 226 trench upon an alternative remedy provided by statute for obtaining relief. Where it is open to the aggrieved petitioner to move another tribunal, or even itself in another jurisdiction for obtaining redress in the manner provided by a statute, the High Court normally will not permit by entertaining a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution the machinery created under the statute to be bypassed, and will leave the party applying to it to seek resort to the machinery so set up.'\n13. In Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Orissa\", this Court observed:\n'11. It is now well recognised that where a right or liability is created by a statute which gives a special remedy for enforcing it, the remedy provided by that statute only must be availed of. This rule was stated with great clarity by Willes, J. in Wolverhampton New Waterworks Co. v. Hawkesford10 in the following passage: (ER p. 495) \" ... There are three classes of cases in which a liability may be established founded upon a statute..... But there is a third class viz. where a liability not existing at common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it.... the remedy provided by the statute must be followed, and it is not competent to the party to pursue the course applicable to cases of the second class. The form given by the statute must be adopted and adhered to.\" \nThe rule laid down in this passage was approved by the House of Lords in Neville v. London Express Newspapers Ltd.11 and has been reaffirmed by the Privy Council in Attorney General of Trinidad & Tobago v. Gordon Grant & Co. Ltd. 12 and Secy of State v. Mask & Co.13 It has also been held to be equally applicable to enforcement of rights, and has been followed by this Court throughout. The High // 18 // Court was therefore justified in dismissing the writ petitions in limine.'\n14. In Mafatlal Industries Ltd. v. Union of India, B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J. (speaking for the majority of the larger Bench) observed:\n'77. ... So far as the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 or for that matter, the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 is concerned, it is obvious that the provisions of the Act cannot bar and curtail these remedies. It is, however, equally obvious that while exercising the power under Article 226/Article 32, the Court would certainly take note of the legislative intent manifested in the provisions of the Act and would exercise their jurisdiction consistent with the provisions of the enactment.\" \n15. In the judgments relied upon by Shri Vaidyanathan, which, by and large, reiterate the proposition laid down in Baburam Prakash Chandra Maheshwari v. Antarim Zila Parishad, Muzaffarnagaris, it has been beld that an alternative remedy is not a bar to the entertaining of writ petition filed for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights or where there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice or where the order under challenge is wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of the statute is under challenge. \n16. It can, thus, be said that this Court has recognised some exceptions to the rule of alternative remedy. However, the proposition laid down in Thansingh Nathmal v. Supt. of Taxes and other similar judgments that the High Court will not entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution if an effective alternative remedy is available to the aggrieved person or the statute under which the action complained of has been taken itself contains a mechanism for redressal of grievance still holds the field.\"\n4.7. In the case of Radhey Shyam (supra) Hon'ble Apex Court in Para 25 and 26 has held as follows:-\n\"25. It is true that this Court has laid down that technicalities associated with the prerogative writs in England have no role to play under our constitutional scheme. There is no parallel system of King's Court in India and of all the other courts having limited jurisdiction subject to the supervision of the King's Court. Courts are set up under the Constitution or the // 19 // laws. All the courts in the jurisdiction of a High Court are subordinate to it and subject to its control and supervision under Article 227. Writ jurisdiction is constitutionally conferred on all the High Courts. Broad principles of writ jurisdiction followed in England are applicable to India and a writ of certiorari lies against patently erroneous or without jurisdiction orders of tribunals or authorities or courts other than judicial courts. There are no precedents in India for the High Courts to issue writs to the subordinate courts. Control of working of the subordinate courts in dealing with their judicial orders is exercised by way of appellate or revisional powers or power of superintendence under Article 227. Orders of the civil court stand on different footing from the orders of authorities or tribunals or courts other than judicial/civil courts. While appellate or revisional jurisdiction is regulated by the statutes, power of superintendence under Article 227 is constitutional. The expression \"inferior court\" is not referable to the judicial courts, as rightly observed in the referring order! in paras 26 and 27 quoted above. \nXXX XXX XXX 26. The Bench in Surya Dev Rai also observed in para 25 of its judgment that distinction between Articles 226 and 227 stood almost obliterated. In para 24 of the said judgment distinction in the two articles has been noted. In view thereof, observation that scope of Articles 226 and 227 was obliterated was not correct as rightly observed by the referring Bench in para 32 quoted above. We make it clear that though despite the curtailment of revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 CPC by Act 46 of 1999, jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 remains unaffected, it has been wrongly assumed in certain quarters that the said jurisdiction has been expanded. Scope of Article 227 has been explained in several decisions including Waryam Singh v. Amarnath45, Ouseph Mathai v. M. Abdul Khadir, Shalini Shyam Shetty v. Rajendra Shankar Patil and Sameer Suresh Gupta v. Rahul Kumar Agarwals In Shalini Shyam Shetty7 this Court observed: (SCC p. 352, paras 64-67) \"64. However, this Court unfortunately discerns that of late there is a growing trend amongst several High Courts to entertain writ petition in cases of pure property disputes. Disputes relating to partition suits, matters relating to execution of a decree, in cases of dispute between landlord and tenant and also in a case of money decree and in various other cases where disputed questions of property are involved, writ courts are entertaining such disputes. In some cases the High Courts, in a routine manner, entertain petitions under // 20 // Article 227 over such disputes and such petitions are treated as writ petitions. \n65. We would like to make it clear that in view of the law referred to above in cases of property rights and in disputes between private individuals writ court should not interfere unless there is any infraction of statute or it can be shown that a private individual is acting in collusion with a statutory authority. \n66. We may also observe that in some High Courts there is a tendency of entertaining petitions under Article 227 of the Constitution by terming them as writ petitions. This is sought to be justified on an erroneous appreciation of the ratio in Surya Dev and in view of the recent amendment to Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code by the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1999. It is urged that as a result of the amendment, scope of Section 115 CPC has been curtailed. In our view, even if the scope of Section 115 CPC is curtailed that has not resulted in expanding the High Court's power of superintendence. It is too well known to be reiterated that in exercising its jurisdiction, High Court must follow the regime of law. \n67. As a result of frequent interference by the Hon'ble High Court either under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution with pending civil and at times criminal cases, the disposal of cases by the civil and criminal courts gets further impeded and thus causing serious problems in the administration of justice. This Court hopes and trusts that in exercising its power either under Article 226 or 227, the Hon'ble High Court will follow the time-honoured principles discussed above. Those principles have been formulated by this Court for ends of justice and the High Courts as the highest courts of justice within their jurisdiction will adhere to them strictly.\"\n4.8. In the case of Shalini Shyam Shetty (supra) Hon'ble Apex Court in Para 37, 43, 48 & 49(d) to (o) has held as follows:-\n\"37. The Constitution Bench in Nagendra Nath, unanimously speaking through B.P. Sinha, J. (as His Lordship then was) pointed out that High Court's power of interference under Article 227 is not greater than its power under Article 226 and the power of interference under Article 227 of the // 21 // Constitution is limited to ensure that the tribunals function within the limits of its authority. (emphasis supplied) XXX XXX XXX 43. In a rather recent decision of the Supreme Court in Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai, a two-Judge Bench of this Court discussed the principles of interference by the High Court under Article 227. Of course in Surya Dev Rai this Court held that a writ of certiorari is maintainable against the order of a civil court, subordinate to the High Court (SCC p. 688, para 19 of the Report). The correctness of that ratio was doubted by another Division Bench of this Court in Radhey Shyam v. Chhabi Nath and a request to the Hon'ble Chief Justice for a reference to a larger Bench is pending. But insofar as the formulation of the principles on the scope of interference by the High Court under Article 227 is concerned, there is no divergence of views. \nXXX XXX XXX 48. The jurisdiction under Article 226 normally is exercised where a party is affected but power under Article 227 can be exercised by the High Court suo moto as a custodian of justice. In fact, the power under Article 226 is exercised in favour of persons or citizens for vindication of their fundamental rights or other statutory rights. The jurisdiction under Article 227 is exercised by the High Court for vindication of its position as the highest judicial authority in the State. In certain cases where there is infringement of fundamental right, the relief under Article 226 of the Constitution can be claimed ex debito justitiae or as a matter of right. But in cases where the High Court exercises its jurisdiction under Article 227, such exercise is entirely discretionary and no person can claim it as a matter of right. From an order of a Single Judge passed under Article 226, a letters patent appeal or an intra-court appeal is maintainable. But no such appeal is maintainable from an order passed by a Single Judge of a High Court in exercise of power under Article 227. In almost all the High Courts, rules have been framed for regulating the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226. No such rule appears to have been framed for exercise of High Court's power under Article 227 possibly to keep such exercise entirely in the domain of the discretion of High Court. \nXXX XXX XXX 49. On an analysis of the aforesaid decisions of this Court, the following principles on the exercise of High Court's // 22 // jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution may be formulated: \n(d) The parameters of interference by High Courts in exercise of their power of superintendence have been repeatedly laid down by this Court. In this regard the High Court must be guided by the principles laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Waryam Singh and the principles in Waryam Singh have been repeatedly followed by subsequent Constitution Benches and various other decisions of this Court. \n(e) According to the ratio in Waryam Singh', followed in subsequent cases, the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction of superintendence can interfere in order only to keep the tribunals and courts subordinate to it, \"within the bounds of their authority\". \n(f) In order to ensure that law is followed by such tribunals and courts by exercising jurisdiction which is vested in them and by not declining to exercise the jurisdiction which is vested in them.\n(g) Apart from the situations pointed in (e) and (). High Court can interfere in exercise of its power of superintendence when there has been patent perversity in the orders of the tribunals and courts subordinate to it or where there has been a gross and manifest failure of justice or the basic principles of natural justice have been flouted. \n(h) In exercise of its power of superintendence High Court cannot interfere to correct mere errors of law or fact or just because another view than the one taken by the tribunals or courts subordinate to it, is a possible view. In other words the jurisdiction has to be very sparingly exercised. \n(i) The High Court's power of superintendence under Article 227 cannot be curtailed by any statute. It has been declared a part of the basic structure of the Constitution by the Constitution Bench of this Court in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India and therefore abridgment by a constitutional amendment is also very doubtful. \n(j) It may be true that a statutory amendment of a rather cognate provision, like Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code by the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1999 does not and cannot cut down the ambit of High Court's power under Article 227. At the same time, it must be remembered that such statutory amendment does not correspondingly expand the High Court's jurisdiction of superintendence under Article 227. (k) The power is // 23 // discretionary and has to be exercised on equitable principle. In an appropriate case, the power can be exercised suo motu. \n(l) On a proper appreciation of the wide and unfettered power of the High Court under Article 227, it transpires that the main object of this article is to keep strict administrative and judicial control by the High Court on the administration of justice within its territory. \n(m) The object of superintendence, both administrative and judicial, is to maintain efficiency, smooth and orderly functioning of the entire machinery of justice in such a way as it does not bring it into any disrepute. The power of interference under this article is to be kept to the minimum to ensure that the wheel of justice does not come to a halt and the fountain of justice remains pure and unpolluted in order to maintain public confidence in the functioning of the tribunals and courts subordinate to the High Court. \n(n) This reserve and exceptional power of judicial intervention is not to be exercised just for grant of relief in individual cases but should be directed for promotion of public confidence in the administration of justice in the larger public interest whereas Article 226 is meant for protection of individual grievance. Therefore, the power under Article 227 may be unfettered but its exercise is subject to high degree of judicial discipline pointed out above. (0) An improper and a frequent exercise of this power will be counterproductive and will divest this extraordinary power of its strength and vitality.\"\n5. Learned Sr. Counsel appearing for the Petitioner along with Mr. A. Tripathy on the other hand while relying on the decision reported in Bhaben Construction (supra) as well as Deep Industries (supra) so relied on by the learned counsel appearing for Opp. Party also relied on the decision in the case of Punjab Agro Industries Corporation Vs. Kewal Singh Dhillon (2008) 10 SCC 128 and the order passed by this Court on 24.11.2022 in W.P.(C) No. 31938 of 2021 (National Aluminum Company Ltd. Vs. UBV Infrastructure Ltd.).\n// 24 // 5.1. In the case of Punjab Agro Industries (supra) Hon'ble Apex Court in Para 7 and 9 has held as follows:-\n\"7. The Act does not provide for an appeal against the order of the Chief Justice or his designate made under sub-section (4) or sub-sections (5) and (6) of Section 11. On the other hand, sub-section (7) of Section 11 makes it clear that a decision of the designate under sub-sections (4), (5) or (6) of Section 11 is final. As no appeal was maintainable against the order of the designate and as his order was made final, the only course available to the appellant was to challenge the order, even if it is a judicial order, by a writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. \nXXX XXX XXX 9. We have already noticed that though the order under Section 11(4) is a judicial order, having regard to Section 11(7) relating to finality of such orders and the absence of any provision for appeal, the order of the Civil Judge was open to challenge in a writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution. The decision in SBP [(2005) 8 SCC 618] does not bar such a writ petition. The observations of this Court in SBP [(2005) 8 SCC 618] that against an order under Section 11 of the Act, only an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution would lie, is with reference to the orders made by the Chief Justice of a High Court or by the designate Judge of that High Court. The said observations do not apply to a subordinate court functioning as designate of the Chief Justice.\" \n5.2. In the case of National Aluminum Company (supra) this Court in Para 6 has held as follows:-\n\"6. The Supreme Court in Bhaven Construction (supra) had said interference in writ jurisdiction will only be in exceptional rarity, where one party is remediless under the statute or clear bad faith is shown by one of the parties. Here, both contingencies appear to have happened. An illegal order made by the Court hearing the application for stay of operation of the award is not appealable under the Act of 1996. On the other hand, opposite party having chosen to stay away and move for execution with different address than given in the reference, has shown bad faith.\" \n// 25 //\n6. I have heard Mr. Ashok Parija, learned Senior Counsel appearing along with Mr. A. Tripathy for the Petitioner and Mr. M. Panda, leaned counsel appearing for the Opp. Party. On the consent of the learned counsels appearing for the Parties, matter was taken up for disposal at the stage of admission. \n7. This Court after going through the view expressed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the aforementioned cases, finds that though intervention of this Court with regard to the order passed under the Act is very limited, but there is not a clear bar for such intervention by this Court in exercise of its power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, this Court placing reliance on the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court as cited supra held the writ petition as maintainable before this Court. \n7.1. On the question of merit, this Court finds that in terms of the concession agreement executed on 16.03.2011, ARSS Infra deposited a sum of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) towards first installment as concession fee and Rs. 2,33,24,038/- (Rupees Two crore thirty three lakh twenty four thousand thirty eight) towards non-refundable project development fee. Though the Parties to the concession agreement dtd.16.03.2011 were very much interested to // 26 // proceed with the work in question, but in view of the order passed by this Court on 30.03.2012 and the final order passed on 20.12.2012 in W.P.(C) No. 30961 of 2011, the Parties to the agreement could not proceed with the work. Subsequent to such order passed by this Court on 20.12.2012 in declaring the concession agreement dtd.16.03.2011 as void ab initio, the Petitioner though was willing to refund the first installment of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) during April 2013, but in view of the interim order passed by the Bombay High Court on 30.05.2013 in Arbitration Petition No. 711 of 2013, the Petitioner could not refund the said amount. The said fact is also reflected in Para 17 of the order passed by the Bombay High Court on 03.08.2015. 7.2. Subsequently, pursuant to the order passed by the Bombay High Court on 03.08.2015 while disposing the Arbitration Petition No. 711 of 2013, the Petitioner as directed deposited the entire amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) before the said Court on 05.10.2015. This Court however, finds that learned Arbitrators while passing the final award on 30.11.2021 has allowed interest on the amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh // 27 // sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) for the period from 23.08.2010 to 05.10.2015 @ 7% per annum and that comes to Rs.6,68,51,806/- (Rupees Six crore sixty eight lakh fifty one thousand eight hundred six) under heading 'B'. Similarly, this Court also finds that though the amount of Rs. 2,33,24,038/- (Rupees Two crore thirty three lakh twenty four thousand thirty eight) was a non- refundable one, but the learned Arbitrators under Heading 'C' has held the Petitioner liable to pay interest @ 7% per annum from 28.08.2010 to 30.10.2021 amounting to Rs.1,82,40,567/- (Rupees One crore eighty two lakh forty thousand five hundred sixty seven). 7.3. Though the interest awarded on those two counts under heading 'B' & 'C' were contested by the Petitioner by submitting that the Petitioner cannot be held liable to pay interest for the entire period on the amount of Rs. 2,33,24,038/- (Rupees Two crore thirty three lakh twenty four thousand thirty eight) and for the period from 30.05.2013 to 05.10.2015 on the amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven), but learned Commercial Court has not taken that point into consideration while passing the impugned order with a direction to deposit the entire awarded amount. \n// 28 // 7.4. Since pursuant to the order passed by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court the Petitioner has already deposited the first installment amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) on 05.10.2015, the stand taken by the learned Sr. Counsel that the petitioner is not liable to pay interest for the period from 30.05.2013 to 05.10.2015 on the aforesaid amount & interest for the entire period from 28.07.2010 to 30.10.2021 on the non-refundable amount of Rs. 2,33,24,038/- (Rupees Two crore thirty three lakh twenty four thousand thirty eight) as per the view of this Court has not been considered by the learned Commercial Court in its proper prospective. 7.5. In view of such material irregularity committed by the learned Commercial Court, this Court placing reliance on the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court as cited Supra while holding the present writ petition as maintainable, this Court on the question of merit finds that the Petitioner since was restrained by the Bombay High Court from making the deposit of the first installment amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) for the period from 30.05.2013 to 03.08.2015, the interest awarded by the learned Arbitrators for the said period from 30.05.2013 to 03.08.2015 under Heading 'B' is an // 29 // issue to be decided finally by the learned Commercial Court in the proceeding in question. Similarly, the interest awarded on the non- refundable amount of Rs.2,33,24,038/- (Rupees Two crore thirty three lakh twenty four thousand thirty eight) for the entire period by the learned Arbitrators under heading 'C' is also an issue to be decided by the learned Commercial Court while deciding the matter in ARBP No. 07 of 2022. However, this Court expresses no opinion on the merits and contentions so raised by the learned counsels appearing for the Parties and learned commercial Court is free to take its own view. \n7.6. The stand taken by the learned counsel appearing for the Opp. Party relying on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Navayuga Engineering Company (supra) with regard to direction by the Commercial Court to deposit the entire award amount, it is the view of this Court that since the Petitioner has already deposited the first installment amount of Rs. 18,66,66,667/- (Rupees Eighteen crore sixty six lakh sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven) before the Bombay High Court, the direction to deposit the entire award amount of Rs.18,43,48,401/- (Rupees eighteen crore forty three lakh forty eight thousand four hundred one) is not just and proper. In view of the same, this Court while interfering with the impugned // 30 // order, permits the Petitioner to deposit 60% of the award amount within a period of one (1) month from today. However, it is observed that any view expressed by this Court on any of the issues will not be treated as binding on the learned Commercial Court and the said Court is to decide the matter in ARBP No. 07 of 2022 on its own merit. The writ petition is disposed of with the aforesaid observation and direction. \n(Biraja Prasanna Satapathy) Judge Orissa High Court, Cuttack Dated the 6th of January, 2023/Sneha",

respondents. 2. present petition has been filed challenging the order dated 08.08.2022 passed by commercial court, varanasi i.e. respondent no. 1 in execution case no. 24 of 2020 (old case no. 21/2012) and additional award dated 21.02.2006 passed by arbitrator in the matter of m/s vidhyawati construction col vs. iocl and another. 3. since, only legal question is involved in the present petition and pleadings have been exchanged between the parties, therefore, with the consent of parties, petition is being decided at the admission stage itself. 4. brief facts of the case are that original suit no. 436 of 1989 was filed on 01.07.1989 for appointment of arbitrator in accordance with provision of arbitration act, 1940 (hereinafter referred to as the ' old act, 1940), which was applicable at that time. vide order dated 12.8.1991, learned civil court appointed hon'ble mr. justice r.p. singh (retired) sole arbitrator to decide the dispute. due to pending litigation proceedings, arbitration could only commence in the year 2001 and arbitrator has issued notice dated 07.05.2001. statement of claim was filed by the respondent no.2 on 24.5.2001 before the arbitrator upon which petitioner had filed a detailed objection and also counter claim. arbitrator has passed order dated 14.04.2002 to continue the proceeding as per provision of arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the 'new act, 1996). ultimately, arbitration proceeding was completed and award was given on 27.04.2005 partly in favour petitioner and respondents both. after calculating the amount, it was found that respondent has to pay rs. 7,79,871/to the petitioner. thereafter, arbitrator has sent the original records to additional district judge,-ix, civil court, varanasi on the same day i.e. 27.04.2005. respondent had moved application under section 33 of the new act, 1996 for modification of award. arbitrator has additional the award vide order dated 21.02.2006. 5. the said award was challenged before this court by filing petition under article 227 no. 30461 of 2006, which was dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated 08.05.2012 with liberty to file application under section 34 of act, 1996. application was filed under section 34 of new act, 1996, which was registered as arbitration case no. 79 of 2012 and the same was dismissed vide order dated 23.03.2013. against that order, petitioner has preferred first appeal from order no. 1584 of 2013, which was also dismissed vide order dated 08.04.2016. as respondent was also aggrieved with the certain observations made in the award, therefore, he has preferred special leave to appeal (c) no. 681 of 2017, which was dismissed vide order dated 20.01.2017 after deleting the certain observations made in the order dated 8.4.2016 passed in first appeal from order no. 1584 of 2013. ultimately, award has attained finality. 6. respondents have filed execution application no. 21 of 2012 (renumbered as execution application no. 24 of 2020), in which petitioner has filed objection under section 47 of cpc and same was rejected vide order dated 08.08.2022. hence, order dated 08.08.2022 is under challenge before this court. 7. aforesaid facts are not disputed between the parties. 8. sri anil sharma, learned senior counsel submitted that arbitration proceedings was initiated under old act, 1940 and award was given on 27.4.2005. he further submitted that as provided in section 14 of old act, 1940, vide letter dated 15.5.2005, arbitrator has sent the entire record alongwith the award in a locked and sealed box to the court of district judge, varanasi and also claimed the expenses. after that, arbitrator became functus officio and having no authority to entertain any application. he also submitted that now respondent no.2 has filed an application on 21.10.2005 under section 33 of new act, 1996 for modification of award beyond limitation, i.e. after 30 days from the date of receipt of award unless another period of time has been agreed upon by the parties. in the present case, there is no such agreement and it is required on the part of arbitrator to reject the application on the ground of limitation alone, but contrary to that, application was accepted and additional award dated 21.2.2006 has been given excepting the claim of respondent. he pointed out that arbitrator proceeded to allow the much higher amount in additional award even which was never sought in the claim petition. the additional award was also given beyond limitation without obtaining the consent of the parties as provided under section 33 of the act. against the additional award, he has preferred writ c no. 30461 of 2006, in which earlier interim order was passed on 26.05.2006, but ultimately petition was dismissed vide order dated 8.5.2012 with liberty to petitioner to challenge the additional award under section 34 of new act, 1996. 9. he next submitted that as per section 85 of new act, 1996, arbitrator has no jurisdiction to decide the claim in new act, 1996, once the proceeding has been initiated under the old act, 1940 unless there is an agreement between the parties. in the present case, agreement has never been sought or given, therefore, any award given by the arbitrator under the new act, 1996 is without jurisdiction. in support of his contention, learned senior counsel placed reliance on the judgment of apex court in the matter of thyssen stahlunion gmbh etc. vs. steel authority of india ltd. : 1999 9 scc 334, n d nayak vs. state of goa: 2003(6) scc 56 and neeraj munjal vs. atul grover minor: 2005 5 scc 404. 10. he next submitted that as the award is without jurisdiction, therefore, this issue can be raised even at the stage of execution and for that, there is no bar. in support of his contention, learned senior counsel placed reliance on the judgment of apex court in the matter of kiran singh and others vs. chaman paswan and others: air supreme court 340, bhavan vaja vs. solanki hanuji khodaji mansang: 1973(2) scc 40, harsad chiman lal modi vs. dlf universal ltd. 2005(7) scc 791 and chief engineer hydel project vs. ravinder nath: air 2008 supreme court 1315. 11. he lastly submitted that in case a judgment has been given without jurisdiction or contrary to existing law, principle of res judicata shall not be applicable. in support of his contention he placed reliance on the judgment smt. shakuntala devi vs. smt. vimla reported in 2005 (59) alr 5999. 12. sri manish goyal, learned senior counsel has vehemently opposed and submitted that petitioner cannot be permitted to blow hot and cold both as once order dated 14.04.2002 has been passed to proceed with the proceedings under new act, 1996 and never challenged. he further submitted that first award dated 27.4.2005 has also been given under new act, 1996, which was never been challenged by petitioner. therefore, petitioner-plaintiff cannot said to be aggrieved person on the ground that additional award has been been given under section 33 of the new act, 1996 for that arbitrator has no authority. petitioner has also preferred appeal under section 34 of the new act, 1996 in compliance of order of writ court dated 8.5.2012 rather filing appeal under section 30 of the old act, 1940. 13. so far as submission of record under section 14 of old act, 1940 is concerned, he firmly submitted that in case of appointment of arbitrator, record has been submitted to the court which appointed the arbitrator. in present case, the arbitrator was appointed by the district judge and further section 14 of old act, 1940 requires issuance of of notice by the court to the parties, but in the present case, notice has never been issued, nor pressed by the petitioner-defendant. therefore, the record has never been accepted by the court under the provision of old act, 1940 as argued by learned counsel for the petitioner. 14. he next submitted that there is agreement of contract between the parties and section 9 of agreement of contract contains arbitration clause. section 9.1.1.0 of agreement of contract act itself provides provision of indian arbitration act, 1940, all its re-enactments and modification thereof and rules made thereunder shall apply to all such arbitration, subject to certain conditions. he pointed out that section 9.1.1.0 provides agreement of applicability of all statutory re-enactments or modification as provided in section 85(2)(a) new act, 1996. 15. he also submitted that in the judgment of apex court in the matter of thyssen stahlunion gmbh (supra), three issues are decided by the court and the third issue is almost pari materia to the issue involved in the present petition. paragraphs 9 of the said judgment is dealing with the matter of rani constructions having the similar language of arbitration agreement as in the case of petitioner. it was replied in paragraph 35 of the judgment, where the court has held that new act, 1996 shall be applicable in the matter of rani constructions. therefore, the same ratio of law as laid down by the apex court shall also be applicable in the present case. relying upon the same, in present matter arbitrator has passed order dated 14.04.2002 to continue the proceeding. he also submitted that from the perusal of order dated 14.04.2002, it is apparently clear that while passing the said order, it was very well accepted by the petitioner-defendant and it has never been objected. petitioner-defendant proceeded to file four affidavits to proceed with the arbitration proceeding. therefore, ratio of law laid down in paragraph 9 of judgment of apex court in the matter of thyssen stahlunion gmbh etc.(supra), there is agreement and in light of section 85(a)(2) of the new act, 1996, arbitrator has rightly proceeded to pass order dated 14.04.2002 to commence the arbitration proceeding under new act, 1996. 16. learned senior counsel next submitted that from the perusal of the impugned order, it is apparently clear that petitioner-defendant has never disputed clause 9.1.1.0 of clause 9 of arbitration agreement and further never filed any application before the arbitrator that new act, 1996 shall not be applicable. not only this, he has proceeded to file appeal under section 34 of the new act, 1996 and not taken this ground, while filing the appeal. in objection filed under section 47 of cpc in execution proceeding, he has also concealed this fact. he firmly submitted that once there is such factual situation, petitioner-defendant cannot raise these grounds either before the execution court or before this court. 17. learned senior advocate submitted that there is an agreement between the parties which provides for arbitration clause and learned counsel for the petitioner is only relying upon the part of arbitration clause. he next submitted that so far it provides for arbitration as per existing act, i.e. act, 1940, he is having no objection. on other hand, the same agreement also provides consent for new enactment, which is objected by the petitioner. he next submitted that petitioner has no choice to accept the agreement in part, either he has to accept to complete agreement or discard the same. in support of his contention, he has placed reliance upon the judgment of the apex court in the case of caravel shipping services privated limited vs. premier sea foods exim private limited reported in (2019) 11 scc 461. 18. so far as, judgment of ns naik (supra) is concerned, he firmly submitted that in that case, award was pronounced in the year 1991 and only execution was remaining. therefore, the court is of the view that appellate proceeding may not be initiated under the provision of new act, 1996 and while deciding the issue in the case of ns naik (supra), it appears that court has not considered the matter of rani construction referred in the judgment in the matter of thyssen stahlunion gmbh etc.(supra), which is similar to this case. 19. he further submitted that scope of interference by the high court under article 227 regarding arbitration is extremely limited. in support of his contention, he placed reliance upon the judgment of this court in the matter of trading engineers internation ltd. vs. u.p. power transmission corp. ltd.: 2022(10) adj 176(lb). 20. he next submitted that while filing appeal under section 34 and fafo under section 37, petitioner has not taken any ground, which are taken here, therefore at a belated stage, he cannot be permitted to take such ground. in support of his contention, he placed reliance upon the judgment of apex court in the matter of sweta construction vs. chhatisgarh state power generation company limited: 2022 scc online sc 1447. 21. he next submitted that the arbitral award is not a decree as defined under section 2, sub-section (e) of c.p.c and there is difference between decree and award. an award is enforceable under section 36 of the new act, 1996 applying the provisions of c.p.c. this issue was dealt in detail by the apex court in the matter of padmajeet singh patheja vs. icds ltd: (2006) scc 322. 22. he next submitted that as the award is not a decree within the meaning of section 2(e) of c.p.c., therefore, objection under section 47 of c.p.c. is also not maintainable. this issue was earlier considered by this court in the matter of larsen & tubro limited vs. maharaji educational trust: 2010 scc online aii 1866, relying upon the judgment of padmajeet singh patheja (supra). the judgment of padmajeet singh patheja (supra) was again followed by this court in civil revision no. 53 of 2022: bharat pumps and compressors ltd. vs. chopra fabricators and manufactures pvt. ltd. here the court has reiterated the law that arbitral award is not a decree within the meaning of section 2(e) of the c.p.c. and further, objection under section 47 of cpc is not maintainable. 23. against the judgment of bharat pumps and compressors ltd. (supra), opposite party preferred slp in the apex court, but the apex court did not interefere with the ratio of law laid down by this court and only started monitoring of earlier disposal of dispute pending under section 34. therefore, law is on date settled that arbitral award is not a decree within the meaning of section 2(e) and objection under section 47 of cpc is not maintainable. 24. he lastly submitted that so far as issue of jurisdiction in arbitral proceeding is concerned, it cannot be raised at any stage of proceeding. there is specific provision for objections under section 34 as well as 36, therefore once the objection has not been taken at the earlier stage, petitioner cannot be permitted to raise this issue before this court. 25. in his rejoinder argument, mr. anil sharma, learned senior counsel submitted that it is never his case that first award is valid and as arbitrator lacks jurisdiction, both the awards are nullity. in support of his contention, he has placed reliance upon the section 3 of act, 1940 read with paragraph 3 of first schedule, which provides that award has to be given within four months, whereas in the present case it has not been given within the time prescribed in aforesaid schedule, therefore, awards are nullity. in support of his contention, he has placed reliance upon the judgment of the apex court in the case of hari shankar lal vs. shairtbhu nath reported in 1962 0 air (sc) 78 (paragraph nos. 10, 11 & 12). in light of aforesaid judgement, in case award is not given within the prescribed time, it is required on the part of parties to get the time extended under section 28 of old act, 1940, in lack of that award would be nullity. he further submitted that with the consent of party under section 28 of old act, 1940, arbitrator may extend the time, which was never extended in present case. 26. being confronted by the court as to whether he has lodge his dissent after continuance of award after four months upon which he has replied that his consent or dissent has no meaning for this purpose. 27. so far as argument with regard to section 3 of act, 1940 read with paragraph 3 of first schedule as well as section 28 of old act, 1940 is concerned, mr. manish goyal, learned senior advocate submitted that counsel for petitioner neither pleaded nor argued earlier about the nullity of first award, therefore, same cannot accepted in rejoinder argument. he has occasion to raise this objection while filing application under section 34 of new act, 1996 and fafo before this court 28. i have considered the rival submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record as well as judgment relied by the learned counsel for the parties. it is undisputed that present petition has been filed against the rejection of objection under section 47 of cpc in execution proceedings of arbitral award. 29. mr. anil sharma, learned senior counsel for the petitioner had argued that the provisions of new act, 1996 shall not be applicable in which arbitration award has been given, therefore, award is nullity and he can raise this objection at any stage. 30. now, the court is coming to the issue as to whether that in light of fact that arbitration proceedings was started under the provisions of old act, 1940 may continue in new act, 1996 or not. for that purpose section 85 (2) (a) of new act, 1996 is relevant and same is being quoted hereinbelow:\"85 (2)(a). repeal and saving. (2) notwithstanding such repeal, (a) the provisions of the said enactments shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings which commenced before this act came into force unless otherwise agreed by the parties but this act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings which commenced on or after this act comes into force;\" 31. from perusal of the same, there is no doubt that in case arbitral proceedings is commenced before this act shall continue in old act, 1940 unless otherwise agreed between the parties. now the question is as to whether in the present matter, parties agreed for continuance of proceeding or not. for that i have to see the section 9 of the agreement of contract, which contains arbitration clause and for present dispute section 9.1.1.0 is very relevant and same is being quoted hereinbelow:section 9.1.1.0. \"the provisions of the indian arbitration act, 1940 and all statutory re-enactments and modifications thereof and the rules made thereunder shall apply to all such arbitrations, subject further to the following conditions: (a) the arbitrator shall given his award separately in respect of each claim\" (b) insofar as any dispute or difference referred to arbitration shall related to or involves any matter or thing in respect of which the decision, opinion, or determination (howsoever expressed of the owner or general manager or engineer-in-charge or site engineer or any other person has been expressed to be final in terms of the contract. such decision, opinion and/or determination as the case may be, shall be binding upon the arbitrator.\" 32. section 9.1.1.0 of agreement of contract provides the provision of indian arbitration act, 1940 i.e. old act, 1940 and all statutory re-enactments or modification thereof and rules made thereunder shall be applicable. 33. section 9.1.1.0. itself provides an agreement not only for old act, 1940, but all statutory re-enactments and modification thereof and rules framed thereunder. the said agreement is undisputed between the parties, therefore, it cannot be said that there is no agreement between the parties for applicability of new act, 1996, in light of section 9 of agreement of contract. 34. mr. anil sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon the paragraph 32 of the thyssen stahlunion (supra). relevant paragraph of the said judgment is quoted hereinbelow:\"32. principles enunciated in the judgments show as to when a right accrues to a party under the repealed act. it is not necessary that for the right to accrue that legal proceedings must be pending when the new act, 1996, 1996 comes into force. to have the award enforced when arbitral proceedings commenced under the old act, 1940 under that very act is certainly an accrued right. consequences for the parties against whom award is given after arbitral proceedings have been held under the old act, 1940 though given after the coming into force of the new act, 1996, 1996, would be quite grave if it is debarred from challenging the award under the provisions of the old act, 1940. structure of both the acts is different. when arbitral proceedings commenced under the old act, 1940 it would be in the mind of everybody, i.e., arbitrators and the parties that the award given should not fall foul of sections 30 and 32 of the old act, 1940. nobody at that time could have thought that sections 30 of the old act, 1940 could be substituted by section 34 of the new act, 1996, 1996. as a matter of fact appellant thyssen in civil appeal no. 6036/98 itself understood that the old act, 1940 would apply when it approached the high court under sections 14 and 17 of the old act, 1940 for making the award rule of the court. it was only later on that it changed the stand and now took the position that new act, 1996, 1996 would apply and for that purpose filed an application for execution of the award. by that time limitation to set aside the award under the new act, 1996, 1996 had elapsed. appellant itself led the respondent sail in believing that the old act, 1940 would apply. sail had filed objections to the award under section 30 of the old act, 1940 after notice for filing of the award was received by it on the application filed by the thyssen under sections 14 and 17 of the old act, 1940. we have been informed that numerous such matters are pending all over the country where the award in similar circumstances is sought to be enforced or set aside under the provisions of the old act, 1940. we, therefore, cannot adopt a construction which would lead to such anomalous situations where the party seeking to have the award set aside finds himself without any remedy. we are, therefore, of the opinion that it would be the provisions of the old act, 1940 that would apply to the enforcement of the award in the case of civil appeal no. 6036 of 1998. any other construction on the section 85(2) (a) would only lead to the confusion and hardship. this construction put by us is consistent with the wording of section 85(2) (a) using the terms \"provision\" and \"in relation to arbitral proceedings\" which would mean that once the arbitral proceedings commenced under the old act, 1940 it would be the old act, 1940 which would apply for enforcing the award as well. 35. mr. manish goyal, learned senior counsel has also placed reliance upon the very same judgment and submitted before this court that there are three issues, which has to be decided. so far as issue no.3 rani constructions pvt. ltd. is concerned, the same is pari materia to the issue before this court. paragraph 9 of the said judgment is dealing with the issue of rani constructions pvt. ltd. and same is being quoted hereinbelow:\"in the case of m/s. rani constructions pvt. ltd. (ca no. 61 of 1999) under the contract which was for the construction of certain works of the himachal pradesh state electricity board, there was an arbitration agreement contained in clause 25 which, in relevant part, is as under : \"subject to the provisions of the contract to the contrary as aforesaid, the provisions of the indian arbitration act, 1940 or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof and the rules made thereunder and for the time being in force shall apply to all arbitration proceedings under this clause.\" 36. from perusal of the same, it is apparently clear that language of section 9.1.1.0. of arbitration clause is almost identical to the matter of rani constructions pvt. ltd. this issue was very well considered by the apex court and replied in its paragraphs 35 to 38 of the judgment of thyssen stahlunion (supra). relevant paragraph of the said judgment is quoted hereinbelow:-. \"35. parties can agree to the applicability of the new act even before the new act comes into force and when the old act is still holding the field. there is nothing in the language of section 85(2)(a) which bars the parties from so agreeing. there is, however, a bar that they cannot agree to the applicability of the old act after the new act has come into force when arbitral proceedings under the old act have not commenced though the arbitral agreement was under the old act. arbitration clause in the contract in the case of rani constructions (civil appeal 61 of 1999) uses the expression \"for the time being in force\" meaning thereby that provision of that act would apply to the arbitration proceedings which will be in force at the relevant time when arbitration proceedings are held. we have been referred to two decisions one of bombay high court and the other of madhya pradesh high court on the interpretation of the expression \"for the time being in force\" and we agree with them that the expression aforementioned not only refers to the law in force at the time the arbitration agreement was entered into but also to any law that may be in force for the conduct of arbitration proceedings, which would also include the enforcement of the award as well. expression \"unless otherwise agreed\" as appearing in section 85(2)(a) of the new act would clearly apply in the case of rani construction in civil appeal no. 61 of 1999. parties were clear in their minds that it would be the old act or any statutory modification or re-enactment of that act which would govern the arbitration. we accept the submission of the appellant rani construction that parties could anticipate that the new enactment may come into operation at the time the disputes arise. we have seen section 28 of the contract act. it is difficult for us to comprehend that arbitration agreement could be said to be in restraint of legal proceedings. there is no substance in the submission of respondent that parties could not have agreed to the application of the new act till they knew the provisions thereof and that would mean that any such agreement as mentioned in the arbitration clause could be entered into only after the new act had come into force. when the agreement uses the expressions \"unless otherwise agreed\" and \"law in force\" it does give option to the parties to agree that new act would apply to the pending arbitration proceedings. that agreement can be entered into even before the new act comes into force and it cannot be said that agreement has to be entered into only after coming into force of the new act.36. mr. desai had referred to a decision of the bombay high court (goa bench), rendered by single judge in reshma constructions v. state of goa, (1999) 1 mlj 462. in that case arbitration clause in the contract provided as under : \"subject as aforesaid, the provisions of the arbitration act, 1940 or any statutory modification or reenactment thereof and the rules made thereunder and for the time being in force shall apply to the arbitration proceeding under this clause.\" 37. the court held that these terms in the clause disclosed that the parties had agreed to be governed by the law which was in force at the time of execution of the arbitration agreement as well as by any further statutory changes that may be brought about in such law. this is how the high court considered the issue before it : \"considering the scheme of the act, harmonious reading of the said provision contained in sub-section (2) of sec. 85 thereof would disclose that the reference \"otherwise agreed\" necessarily refers to the intention of the parties as regards the procedure to be followed in the matter of arbitration proceedings and not to the time factor as regards execution of the agreements. it provides that though the law provides that the provisions of the old act would continue to apply to the pending proceedings by virtue of the said saving clause in sec. 85, it simultaneously provides that the parties can agree to the contrary. such a provision leaving it to the discretion of the parties to the proceedings to decide about the procedure to be followed other in terms of the new act or the old act is certainly in consonance with the scheme of the act, whereunder most of the provisions of the new act, the procedure regarding various stages of the arbitration proceedings is made subject to the agreement to the contrary between the parties, thereby giving ample freedom to the parties to decide about the procedure to be followed in such proceedings; being so, it is but natural that the legislature in its wisdom has left it to the option of the parties in the pending proceedings to choose the procedure for such pending proceedings. the reference \"otherwise agreed by the parties\" in sec. 85(2)(c) of the new act, therefore, would include an agreement already entered into between the parties even prior to enforcement of the new act as also the agreement entered into after enforcement of the new act. such a conclusion is but natural since the expression \"otherwise agreed\" do not refer to the time factor but refers to the intention of the parties regarding applicability of the provisions of the new or old act.\" we agree with the high court on interpretation put to the arbitration clause in the contract. 38. section 28 of the contract act contains provision regarding agreements in the restraint of legal proceedings. exception 1 to section 28 of the contract act does not render illegal a contract by which the parties agree that any future dispute shall be referred to arbitration. that being so parties can also agree that the provisions of the arbitration law existing at that time would apply to the arbitral proceedings. it is not necessary for the parties to know what law will be in force at the time of the conduct of arbitration proceedings. they can always agree that provisions that are in force at the relevant time would apply. in this view of the matter, if the parties have agreed that at the relevant time provisions of law as existing at that time would apply, there cannot be any objection to that. thus construing the clause 25, in rani constructions (ca 61/99) new act will apply.\" 37. as the language of both the matters are similar and apex court after considering in detail has held that an agreement can be made even before enactment of new act, 1996 for its applicability and in arbitration clause there is such agreement already present, therefore, there is no need to have any new agreement for compliance of section 85(2)(a) and proceedings can be continued in new act, 1996. therefore, submission of learned counsel for the petitioner that there is no agreement between the parties as required under section 85(2)(a) cannot be accepted. judgment of thyssen stahlunion (supra) is not in favour of petitioner rather in favour of respondent as the similar issue has been considered and replied. 38. once the court is of the view that proceedings though initiated in old act, 1940 may continue in new act, 1996, therefore, there is no requirement to return the finding about the other arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner upon the applicability of new act, 1996. 39. now coming to the another issue as to whether arbitral award is decree or not as defined under section 2(2) of cpc and in case it is not a decree, objection filed under section 47 of cpc is maintainable or not. it has also to be seen as to whether arbitral award can be enforced invoking the section 36 of new act, 1996 with the provision of cpc in the same manner as if it is decree of court. 40. to opine on this issue, section 2(2) and section 36 of new act, 1996 of cpc are required to be seen and same is being quoted hereinbelow:\"decreesection 2 (2) of cpc \"decree\" means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. it shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint and the determination of any question within section 144, but shall not include(a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order, or (b) any order of dismissal for default. explanation a decree is preliminary when further proceedings have to be taken before the suit can be completely disposed of. it is final when such adjudication completely disposes of the suit, it may be partly preliminary and partly final;\" section 36 of new act, 1996 \"36. (1) where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under section 34 has expired, then, subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), such award shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court. (2) where an application to set aside the arbitral award has been filed in the court under section 34, the filing of such an application shall not by itself render that award unenforceable, unless the court grants an order of stay of the operation of the said arbitral award in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3), on a separate application made for that purpose. (3) upon filing of an application under sub-section (2) for stay of the operation of the arbitral award, the court may, subject to such conditions as it may deem fit, grant stay of the operation of such award for reasons to be recorded in writing: provided that the court shall, while considering the application for grant of stay in the case of an arbitral award for payment of money, have due regard to the provisions for grant of stay of a money decree under the provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).] 2[provided further that where the court is satisfied that a prima facie case is made out,--(a) that the arbitration agreement or contract which is the basis of the award; or (b) the making of the award, was induced or effected by fraud or corruption, it shall stay the award unconditionally pending disposal of the challenge under section 34 to the award. explanation.-for the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that the above proviso shall apply to all court cases arising out of or in relation to arbitral proceedings, irrespective of whether the arbitral or court proceedings were commenced prior to or after the commencement of the arbitration and conciliation (amendment) act, 2015.]\" 41. arbitral award is decree or not in the meaning of section 2(2) of cpc is concerned, has been considered by the apex court in the matter of paramjeet singh patheja (supra). relevant paragraph of the same are quoted hereinbelow:20 to 29 \"sections 2(2) and 2(14) of the cpc define what 'decree' and 'order' mean. for seeing whether a decision or determination is a decree or order, it must necessarily fall in the language of the definition. section 2(2) of the cpc defines 'decree' to mean \"the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. it shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint and the determination of any question within section 144, but shall not include(a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order, or (b) any order of dismissal for default. explanation : a decree is preliminary when further proceedings have to be taken before the suit can be completely disposed of. it is final when such adjudication completely disposes of the suit. it may be partly preliminary and partly final.\" the words 'court', 'adjudication' and 'suit' conclusively show that only a court can pass a decree and that too only in suit commenced by a plaint and after adjudication of a dispute by a judgment pronounced by the court. it is obvious that an arbitrator is not a court, an arbitration is not an adjudication and, therefore, an award is not a decree. section 2(14) defines 'order' to mean \"the formal expression of any decision of a civil court which is not a decree;\" the words 'decision' and 'civil court' unambiguously rule out an award by arbitrators. the above view has been consistently taken in decisions on section 15 of the indian arbitration act, 1899 viz. tribhuvandas kalidas vs. jiwan chand 1911(35) bombay 196, manilal vs. the bharat spinning & weaving (35) bom. l.r. 941, ramshai v. joylall, air 1928 calcutta 840, ghulam hussein vs. shahban air 1938 sindh 220. in ramshai v. joylall (supra), the calcutta high court held as follows: \"(a) presidency town insolvency act, s.9 (e) attachment in execution of award is not one in executive of a decree. attachment in execution of an award is not attachment in the execution of a decree within the meaning of s.9(e) for the purpose of creating an act of insolvency: re. bankruptcy notice, (1907) 1 k.b. 478, ref. (b) arbitration act, s.15 award, an award is a decree for the purpose of enforcing that award only.\" in ghulam hussein vs. shahban air 1938 sindh 220, the court observed as follows: \"section 9(e) must be strictly construed in favour of the debtor to whom the matter of adjudication as an insolvent under the insolvency law is one of vital importance. any inconvenience arising out of such a construction is for the legislature to consider and remedy if they think proper by amendment; it is not for the court to enlarge the meaning of the words used by the legislature. an attachment in execution of an award is not an attachment in execution of the decree of a court within the meaning of s.9(e) for the purpose of creating an act of insolvency: air 1928 cal.840 approved and followed; 35 bom. 196 relied on.\" \".the words: \"in execution of the decree of any court for the payment of money\" cannot be extended by analogy. they must be extended, if at all, by the legislature and we cannot hold that there has been an act of insolvency when the definition given by the legislature has not been complied with. these are strong words and strong language, and as i have said above the judgment of rankin c.j. must be treated with the greatest respect. the case of ramsahai vs. joylall is referred to by sir d. mulla in his commentary on the law of insolvency at p. 94. in para 123 sir d. mulla states: \"an award for the payment of money filed in court under s.11 of i.a.a. 1890 is not a 'decree' within the meaning of the present clause although it is enforceable under that act as if it were a decree. no insolvency petition can therefore be founded on an attachment or sale in execution of an award.\" in support of this proposition sir d. mulla cites the case of ramasahai v. joylall (supra). the commentator proceeds: it is therefore for consideration whether cl.(e) should not be amended by adding the words 'or in execution of an award for the payment of money.' now, it cannot be disputed that sir d. mulla as a commentator on the law of insolvency is universally regarded as an authority, and in the course of his commentary on the law of insolvency sir d. mulla has not hesitated in several places to record his respectful dissent when he has considered that the judgment of any high court in india is doubtful or incorrect. it is significant that in referring to the case in air 1928 cal. 840, the learned commentator has not recorded any dissent, but on the contrary states that it is for consideration whether cl.(e) should not be amended by adding the words 'or in execution of an award for the payment of money.' in this part of his commentary sir d. mulla has also referred to the case in 35 bom 196, where it was held by a bench of the bombay high court that an award filed in court under s.11, arbitration act, was nothing more than an award although it was enforceable as if it were a decree. in that case an application had been made under o.21, r.29, for stay of execution of a decree. the application was dismissed on the following grounds set out in the judgment of sir basil scott c.j.: now, such an order can only be made by the court, if there is a suit pending on the part of a person against whom a decree has been passed, against the holder of a decree of the court. it appears to me that the petitioner is not a holder of a decree of the courtfor the award, to which the applicants seek to give the force of a decree, is nothing more than an award, although it is enforceable as if it were a decree.\" the same view was taken on section 36 of the 1996 act in sidharth srivastava v. k.k. modi investment & financial service p.ltd. 2002(4) mah. l.j. 281. it was held thus: \"where the award in favour of the petitioning creditor came to be passed on the basis of the consent terms and not on the basis of an adjudication, the award which has the force of decree does not fulfil the essential conditions of decree as contemplated by section 2(2) of the civil procedure code. even though the award dated 5.9.1997 is enforceable as if it were a decree still it is not a decree within the meaning of the term as defined in section 2(2) of the civil procedure code and, therefore, obtaining of such as award does not fulfil the requisite conditions contemplated by clause (i) of section 9(1) of the presidency towns insolvency act. consequently, on that basis the respondent cannot be said to have committed act of insolvency, either under clause (i) of sub-section 9(1) or sub-section (2) of section 9 of the act. air 1928 cal.840, air 1938 sind 220, air 1975 cal 169 and air 1976 sc 1503, ref.\" it is settled by decisions of this court that the words 'as if' in fact show the distinction between two things and such words are used for a limited purpose. they further show that a legal fiction must be limited to the purpose for which it was created. section 36 of the arbitration & conciliation act, 1996 which is in pari materia with section 15 of the 1899 act, is set out hereinbelow: \"36. enforcement where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under section 34 has expired, or such application having been made, it has been refused, the award shall be enforced under the code of civil procedure, 1908 in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court.\" in fact, section 36 goes further than section 15 of the 1899 act and makes it clear beyond doubt that enforceability is only to be under the cpc. it rules out any argument that enforceability as a decree can be sought under any other law or that initiating insolvency proceeding is a manner of enforcing a decree under the cpc. therefore the contention of the respondents that, an award rendered under the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 if not challenged within the requisite period, the same becomes final and binding as provided under section 35 and the same can be enforced as a decree as it is as binding and conclusive as provided under section 36 and that there is no distinction between an award and a decree does not hold water.\" 42. from perusal of the hereinabove, it is apparently clear that apex court has firmed view that though the arbitral award can be enforced under section 36 of new act alongwith the provisions of cpc, but arbitral award is not a decree under section 2(2) of cpc. in the present case, there is no dispute on the point that execution proceeding is initiated under section 36 of new act, 1996 for enforcement of an award, which is not a decree in light of discussion made hereinabove. 43. now the second issue is as to whether in execution proceedings under section 36 of new act, 1996, objection under section 47 of cpc is maintainable or not. the very same issue for consideration was before the apex court in the matter of larsen & tubro limited (supra). 44. this court in the matter of larsen & tubro limited (supra) relying upon the judgment of padmajeet singh patheja (supra) has considered this issue that once the stage of section 34 of new act, 1996 is over and the question that were raised or could have been raised at that stage cannot be allowed to be raised again by filing objection under section 47 of cpc at the time of execution of award. relevant paragraph of the judgment larsen & tubro limited (supra) is being quoted hereinbelow:\"the question which arises for consideration is whether the validity of arbitral award can be challenged in proceeding for its enforcement under section 36 of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 (herein after referred to as the ''act') taking recourse to section 47 c.p.c. the matter can be viewed from another angle. section 47 cpc provides for questions to be determined by the court executing the decree. the said section reads as under : \"47. questions to be determined by the court executing decree.(1) all questions arising between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed, or their representatives, and relating to the execution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree, shall be determined by the court executing the decree and not by a separate suit. (2)omitted by the code of civil procedure (amendment act, 1976, s. 20 (w.e.f. 1.2.1977) (3)where a question arises as to whether any person is or is not the representative of a party, such question shall, for the purposes of this section, be determined by the court. explanation i.for the purposes of this section, a plaintiff whose suit has been dismissed and a defendant against whom a suit has been dismissed are parties to the suit. explanation ii.(a) for the purposes of this section, a purchaser of property at a sale in execution of a decree shall be deemed to be a party to the suit in which the decree is passed; and (b) all questions relating to the delivery of possession of such property to such purchaser or his representative shall be deemed to be questions relating to the execution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree within the meaning of this section.\" it is, thus, clear that in order to invoke section 47 cpc, there must be a decree. section 2 (2) cpc defines the decree. for a decision or determination to be a decree, it must necessarily fall within the fore-corners of the language used in the definition. section 2 (2) cpc defines decree to mean \"formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. it shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint and the determination of any question within section 144, but shall not include (a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order, or (b) any order of dismissal for default.\" explanation. _ a decree is preliminary when further proceedings have to be taken before the suit can be completely disposed of. it is final when such adjudication completely disposes of the suit. it may be partly preliminary and partly final. the use of words ''adjudication' and ''suit' used by legislature clearly goes to show that it is only a court which can pass a decree in a suit commenced by plaint adjudicating the dispute between the parties by means of a judgment pronounced by the court. the hon'ble apex court in the case of paramjeet singh patheja vs. icds ltd., air 2007 sc 168 after considering the definition of decree as contained in cpc in paragraph 29 has held that \"it is obvious that an arbitrator is not a court, an arbitration is not an adjudication and, therefore, an award is not a decree\". again in paragraph 31, it has been held that words ''decision', and ''civil court' unambiguously rule out an award by arbitrators to be a decree. in the said case, the hon'ble apex court while considering the question as to whether an insolvency notice under section 9 of the presidency town insolvency act, 1909 can be issued on the basis of an arbitration award, held that such notice cannot be issued for the reason the arbitration award is neither a decree nor an order for payment within the meaning of section 9(2) of the insolvency act and it is not rendered in a suit. thus, the award not being covered under the definition of a decree, objection with respect to its validity can only be raised as provided under section 34 of the act and not by taking resort to section 47 c. p. c. apart from above, the extent of judicial intervention has been circumscribed by section 5 of the act. in other words, judicial interpretation is prohibited except as provided under the act. section 5 of the act reads as under : \"section 5. extent of judicial intervention._ notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this part. section 5 of the act falls under part-i which includes within its ambit section 2 to section 43 of the act. thus, sections 34 and 36 are also included in part-i of the act. the judicial intervention having been limited by the legislature, the court cannot interfere at any and every stage on a ground other than those available in the act itself. thus, once stage of section 34 is over and the award becomes final under section 35, judicial intervention in the execution of the award under section 36 cannot be held to be permissible on any ground, whatsoever, in view of the limitation imposed by section 5 of the act. thus, having regard to the provisions of sections 5, 12, 13, 16, 34, 35 and 36 of the act, the irresistible conclusion is only grounds which can be pressed into service for challenge to an award is within the ambit and scope of section 34 of the act. once the stage of section 34 is over and the questions that were raised or could have been raised at that stage cannot be allowed to be raised again and again by pressing into service section 47 of the code of civil procedure at the time of execution of award under section 36 of the act. in view of the aforesaid facts and discussions, the applicant did not have any right to challenge the enforceability of the award by taking recourse to section 47 c. p. c. and the same were liable to be dismissed. it is altogether different question that the objections have been dismissed by the court below on different grounds and reasons but since they are liable to be dismissed, the impugned order does not require any interference. the revision accordingly stands dismissed. however, in the facts and circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.\" 45. so far as present case is concerned, position is same as discussed in the matter of larsen & tubro limited (supra). petitioner had full occasions to raise all these issues while filing appeal in section 34 of new act, 1996 and fafo, but the same has never been raised. therefore, by way of objection under section 47 of cpc, he cannot be permitted to raise this issues nullifying the provision of section 36 of act, 1996. 46. again the very same issue of filing of objection under section 47 of cpc came before this court in the matter of bharat pumps and compressors ltd. (supra) and court following the ratio of law laid down by this court in the matter of larsen & tubro limited (supra) has held as follows:\"22. the arbitration act, 1940 is self-contained, complete code and section 17 thereof is in pari-materia with section 36 of the arbitration & conciliation act, 1996. section 20 thereof, provides for challenging the appointment of an arbitrator. the revisionist never challenged appointment of the arbitrator under section 20 thereof. sections 30/33 and 37 of the arbitration act, 1940, read with article 119 of the limitation act, give provision for an application to be filed within 30 days of notice of award; however, no such application within the said period was filed by the revisionist. 23. the arbitration award by way of friction is executed as decree, but it is not a decree as defined under section 2(2) of cpc and therefore, the objection under section 47 of cpc, which was filed only in execution of decree (as defined under section 2(2) cpc), is not maintainable in the proceedings seeking execution of award.\" 47. this court has again taken view that arbitral award is not a decree under section 2(2) of cpc, therefore, objection filed under section 47 of cpc is not maintainable. 48. to conclude this point on the basis of undisputed fact, objection under section 47 of cpc filed against the arbitral award is not maintainable as the same is not a decree under section 2(2) of cpc. further, arbitral award can be executed invoking section 36 of new act, 1996 alongwith the provisions of cpc in the same manner as if it is decree of the court. 49. therefore, in light of facts of the case, provisions of law as well as pronouncements made by the apex court as well as this court, i found no good reason to interfere with the impugned orders. writ petition lacks merit and is, accordingly, dismissed with the cost of rs.1,00,000/to be paid by the petitioners to respondent no.2. order date :6.9.2023 junaid"
