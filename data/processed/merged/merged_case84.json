Chakravarthy, learned counsel for the petitioners, and Sri Duvva Pavan Kumar, learned counsel for the respondents.\n2. The 1st respondent filed A .O.P.No.40 of 2020 in the Court of IX Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court at Hyderabad (the Trial Court), under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (the short, 'the Act of 1996') praying to grant injunction restraining petitioners/respondent Nos.2 and 3 from taking action or exercising the rights in connection with the management of M/s. Sagarasia Global LLP (the LLP), changing the management of the LLP and direct the petitioners/respondent Nos.2 and 3 to keep the petitioners informed about the operations and management of the LLP. The Trial Court granted ex-parte injunction and directions as prayed by the 1st respondent. \n3. The Petitioners filed I.A.No.551 of 2020 under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure, praying the Trial Court to reject the A.O.P.No.40 of 2020. The petitioners contended that the subject matter of A.O.P., is a commercial dispute and therefore, only the Commercial Court has jurisdiction to entertain and consider the said application under Section 9 of the Act of 1996. Repelling their contentions, the I.A., was dismissed by order dated PNR,J & PSS,J 09.11.2020. Challenging the said decision, this Civil Revision Petition is filed. \n4. According to the learned counsel for petitioner, the first respondent holds 15 % stake in the LLP, which comes to Rupees fifteen lakhs and total contribution of all partners is Rupees one crore. There is an inter se dispute among the partners arising out of LLP and therefore the dispute is a commercial dispute and all applications under the Act, 1996 have to be moved only before a Commercial Court and not before a Civil Court. He would submit that deliberately the first respondent did not specify the value when he first presented application under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 before the Commercial Court. Further, as facts are clear and as understood by the first respondent, in Arbitration Application No.61 of 2020 filed before this Court under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 to appoint an Arbitrator and for allied reliefs what is urged in the A.O.P 40 of 2020 is a commercial dispute and Civil Court has no jurisdiction to deal with such application. \n5. Per contra, according to learned counsel for the first respondent, the dispute is purely among the partners and is limited to the extent of failure of commitments and obligations under the LLP and by the time A.O.P No. 40 of 2020 was filed valuation was not quantified, as such, the Commercial Court has no jurisdiction. Therefore, the Civil Court alone has jurisdiction to decide the application under Section 9 of the Act, 1996. \n6. The Trial Court held that the dispute is between the partners of LLP and other documents which relate to independent agreements are no way connected to the dispute among the PNR,J & PSS,J partners on functioning of the LLP. The Trial Court also agreed with the contention of 1st respondent that as of now, the value is not quantified and therefore, the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court cannot be ascertained. \n7. The issue for consideration is whether the Civil Court erred in entertaining A.O.P No.40 of 2020 under Section 9 of the Act of 1996. \n8. To the extent relevant to decide the issue, the facts are as under:\nPetitioners and respondents formed the LLP by executing Limited Liability Partnership Agreement dated 19.04.2019 under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. As per the terms of Agreement LLP was formed by investing Rs.10,00,000.00/- (rupees ten lakhs). On 16.05.2019, supplementary agreement was executed raising the capital contribution to Rs.1,00,00,000.00/- (rupees one crore). The contribution of first respondent was Rs. 15,00,000/- (Rupees fifteen lakhs only) which comes to 15 % of the total contribution of all partners. His share in profits/losses of the LLP is pegged at 15 %. Differences arose among the partners leading to 1st respondent filing A.O.P.No.40 of 2020 in the Trial Court to seek protection of his interest pending commencement of arbitral proceedings. The 1st respondent also filed Arbitration Application No.61 of 2020 before this Court, praying to appoint sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the claims and disputes and to declare the appointment of 5th respondent therein as Arbitrator as null and void. \nPNR,J & PSS,J 9. To appreciate the respective submissions, it is necessary to consider the scope of Section 2 (1) (c)1, Section 2 (1) (i)2, Sections 63, 10 (3)4, and 125 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015; Section 96 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. To the extent relevant the provisions are extracted in the footnote. The Commercial Courts Act, 2015:\nSection 2-Definitions: (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires:-\n... (c) \"commercial dispute\" means a dispute arising out of-- ....\n(xv) partnership agreements;\n.... \nSection 2 (1) (i) \"Specified Value\", in relation to a commercial dispute, shall mean the value of the subject-matter in respect of a suit as determined in accordance with section 12 1[which shall not be less than three lakh rupees] or such higher value, as may be notified by the Central Government.\n6. Jurisdiction of Commercial Court.--The Commercial Court shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value arising out of the entire territory of the State over which it has been vested territorial jurisdiction. Explanation.--For the purposes of this section, a commercial dispute shall be considered to arise out of the entire territory of the State over which a Commercial Court has been vested jurisdiction, if the suit or application relating to such commercial dispute has been instituted as per the provisions of sections 16 to 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).\n4 10. Jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters.--Where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a Specified Value and-- (3) If such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district (not being a High Court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial Court has been constituted. 5 12. Determination of Specified Value.--(1) The Specified Value of the subject-matter of the commercial dispute in a suit, appeal or application shall be determined in the following manner:--\n(a) where the relief sought in a suit or application is for recovery of money, the money sought to be recovered in the suit or application inclusive of interest, if any, computed up to the date of filing of the suit or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining such Specified Value;\n(b) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to movable property or to a right therein, the market value of the movable property as on the date of filing of the suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining such Specified Value;\n(c) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to immovable property or to a right therein, the market value of the immovable property, as on the date of filing of the suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining Specified Value; 1[and]\n(d) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to any other intangible right, the market value of the said rights as estimated by the plaintiff shall be taken into account for determining Specified Value; 2* * * 3* * * * * (2) The aggregate value of the claim and counterclaim, if any as set out in the statement of claim and the counterclaim, if any, in an arbitration of a commercial dispute shall be the basis for determining whether such arbitration is subject to the jurisdiction of a Commercial Division, Commercial Appellate Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be. \nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996:\n9. Interim measures, etc., by Court.--3[(1) ] A party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36, apply to a court-- (i).....\n(ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely:--\n(a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement;\n(b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration;\n(c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence;\n(d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver;\n(e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the Court to be just and convenient, and the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it.\n4[(2) Where, before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, a Court passes an order for any interim measure of protection under sub-section (1), the arbitral proceedings shall be commenced within a period of ninety days from the date of such order or within such further time as the Court may determine. \n(3) Once the arbitral tribunal has been constituted, the Court shall not entertain an application under sub-section (1), unless the Court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under section 17 efficacious.] PNR,J & PSS,J 10. The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 is enacted with avowed object of ensuring speedy disposal of Commercial Disputes. It now vests exclusive jurisdiction to decide commercial disputes on the Commercial Courts at the District level and on the Commercial Division in the High Court. The Commercial Courts have jurisdiction to deal with all disputes which are commercial in nature, a dispute including among the partners of the LLP, whose specified value is not less than rupees three lakhs. In a commercial dispute the Commercial Court alone has jurisdiction to deal with applications filed under Section 9 of the Act of 1996. \n11. The definition of \"commercial dispute\" as incorporated in Clause (c) of Section 2 (1) has very wide amplitude, limited only by Sub Clause (i), i.e., 'specified value'. The definition includes disputes arising out of partnership agreements. \n12. Clause (i) of Section 2 (1) of the Act of 2015, defines determination of \"specified value\" in accordance with Section 12 of the Act of 2015. A dispute inter parties can become a commercial dispute only when the specified value is more than Rs.3,00,000/-, ousting the jurisdiction of Civil Courts.\n13. Section 6 deals with jurisdiction of Commercial Court. The Commercial Court has jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to 'commercial disputes' of a 'specified value'.\n14. Section 12 envisages how to determine 'specified value'. Sub- Clause (a) and (d) of Sub Section (1) are relevant for the purpose of this case. Clause (a) deals with recovery of money. In a claim to recover money, the specified value has to be determined based on PNR,J & PSS,J the money sought to be recovered in the suit or application, inclusive of interest if any, computed up to the date of filing of the suit or application. According to Clause (d), where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to any other \"intangible right\", the market value of the said right as estimated by the plaintiff should be taken into account for determining Specified Value. \n15. Sub-section 2 deals with different contingency. It envisages the aggregate value as set out in the claim and counterclaim. The statement of claim and the counterclaim, if any, in an arbitration application in a commercial dispute can be the basis for determining whether such dispute is amenable to the jurisdiction of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court. \n16. Section 12 employs the derivatives of the word 'determine', i.e., 'determination' and 'determining'. 'Determine' literally means 'to decide', 'to come to a conclusion'. It is apparent from plain reading of Section 12, it mandates the Court to 'determine' the 'specified value' of the dispute. It does not leave it to the claimant/ petitioner/ applicant to decide. The factors mentioned in clauses (a) and (d) of sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) are intended to aid and assist the Court to 'determine' the 'specified value'. As a corollary, the thrust of the Section is on the Court to 'determine' 'specified value' even when the claimant/petitioner/applicant does not state the value of his claim. The intendment of the Act is clearly discernible from the text and the texture of the provisions. \n17. The Court is relieved of its assignment to 'determine' when the litigant is fair and honest in his pleadings. It has onerous PNR,J & PSS,J responsibility to determine whether the dispute in a given case is a commercial dispute or a civil dispute when the litigant resorts to 'hide and seek', 'pick and choose' the facts he likes to disclose and to suppress/keep back other facts which are germane to decide the jurisdiction. \n18. The legislature seemingly left a vacuum on a situation as in this case. Then the question is, can it be left to the vagaries of litigant and allow him to choose the forum by playing around. When there is a vacuum, seemingly or otherwise, in the statute, Court can take recourse to interpretative process to understand the objective of the Act and intendment of the legislature. \n19. In Shailesh Dhairyawan Vs Mohan Balkrishna Lulla7, Hon'ble Justice A.K.Sikri in his concerning judgment, eloquently dealt with principles of statutory interpretation. Learned Judge said as under:\n\"31. ..The principle of \"purposive interpretation\" or \"purposive construction\" is based on the understanding that the court is supposed to attach that meaning to the provisions which serve the \"purpose\" behind such a provision. The basic approach is to ascertain what is it designed to accomplish? To put it otherwise, by interpretative process the court is supposed to realise the goal that the legal text is designed to realise. As Aharon Barak puts it: \n\"Purposive interpretation is based on three components: language, purpose, and discretion. Language shapes the range of semantic possibilities within which the interpreter acts as a linguist. Once the interpreter defines the range, he or she chooses the legal meaning of the text from among the (express or implied) semantic possibilities. The semantic component thus sets the limits of interpretation by restricting the interpreter to a legal meaning that the text can bear in its (public or private) language.\" [ Aharon Barak, Purposive Interpretation in Law (Princeton University Press, 2005).] \n32. Of the aforesaid three components, namely, language, purpose and discretion \"of the court\", insofar as purposive component is concerned, this is the ratio juris, the purpose at the (2016) 3 SCC 619 PNR,J & PSS,J - 10 - core of the text. This purpose is the values, goals, interests, policies and aims that the text is designed to actualise. It is the function that the text is designed to fulfil. \n33. We may also emphasise that the statutory interpretation of a provision is never static but is always dynamic. Though the literal rule of interpretation, till some time ago, was treated as the \"golden rule\", it is now the doctrine of purposive interpretation which is predominant, particularly in those cases where literal interpretation may not serve the purpose or may lead to absurdity. If it brings about an end which is at variance with the purpose of statute, that cannot be countenanced. Not only legal process thinkers such as Hart and Sacks rejected intentionalism as a grand strategy for statutory interpretation, and in its place they offered purposivism, this principle is now widely applied by the courts not only in this country but in many other legal systems as well. \n20. In State of U.P. vs. Dr. Vijay Anand Maharaj8, Hon'ble Supreme court observed that, \"8. .... But it is said, relying upon certain passsages in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, at p. 68, and in Crawford on \"Statutory Construction\" at p. 492, that it is the duty of the Judge \"to make such construction of a statute as shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy\", and for that purpose the more extended meaning could be attributed to the words so as to bring all matters fairly within the scope of such a statute even though outside the letter, if within its spirit or reason. But both Maxwell and Crawford administered a caution in resorting to such a construction. Maxwell says at p. 68 of his book:\n\"The construction must not, of course, be strained to include cases plainly omitted from the natural meaning of the words.\" \nCrawford says that a liberal construction does not justify an extension of the statute's scope beyond the contemplation of the legislature. The fundamental and elementary rule of construction is that the words and phrases used by the legislature shall be given their ordinary meaning and shall be construed according to the rules of grammar. When a language is plain and unambiguous and admits of only one meaning, no question of construction of a statute arises, for the Act speaks for itself. It is a well-recognized rule of construction that the meaning must be collected from the expressed intention of the legislature.\" (emphasis supplied) \n21. In New India Assurance Co. Ltd., v. Nusli Neville Wadia9 \"51. .....With a view to read the provisions of the Act in a proper and effective manner, we are of the opinion that literal interpretation, if given, may give rise to an anomaly or absurdity which must be avoided. So as to enable a superior court to interpret a statute in a reasonable manner, the court must place itself in the chair of a reasonable legislator/author. So done, the AIR 1963 SC 946 (2008) 3 SCC 279 PNR,J & PSS,J - 11 - rules of purposive construction have to be resorted to which would require the construction of the Act in such a manner so as to see that the object of the Act is fulfilled, which in turn would lead the beneficiary under the statutory scheme to fulfil its constitutional obligations as held by the Court inter alia in Ashoka Marketing Ltd. [(1990) 4 SCC 406]\".\n22. The principles that can be culled out from precedent decisions are:\n(i) By interpretative process the court is supposed to realize the goal that the legal text is designed to realize;\n(ii) The purpose of the Act is values, goals, interests, policies and aims it intends to achieve;\n(iii) Court should resort to purposive interpretation and not literal interpretation that may lead to absurdity;\n(iv) It shall be the duty of the Court to make such construction of a statute as shall suppress mischief and advance the remedy;\n(v) More extended meaning can be attributed to the words so as to bring all matters fairly within the scope of a statute even though outside the letter, if within its spirit or reason;\n(vi) Meaning must be collected from the expressed intention of the legislature;\n(vii) Court must place itself in the chair of a reasonable legislator/author.\n23. In Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd. v. K.S. Infraspace10, Hon'ble Justice R.Banumathi, in her concurring judgment observed as under:\n\"42. The object and purpose of the establishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that the cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost (2020) 15 SCC 585 PNR,J & PSS,J - 12 - to the litigants. Keeping in view the object and purpose of the establishment of the Commercial Courts and fast tracking procedure provided under the Act, the statutory provisions of the Act and the words incorporated thereon are to be meaningfully interpreted for quick disposal of commercial litigations so as to benefit the litigants especially those who are engaged in trade and commerce which in turn will further economic growth of the country. On the above reasonings, I agree with the conclusion arrived at by my esteemed Brother A.S. Bopanna, J.\" (emphasis supplied) \n24 . The Commercial Courts are established with avowed object to fast tract all disputes which have commercial stake. The Act intends to erase the impression world over that in India, litigation takes long years. Multinational companies were reluctant to invest in India for fear of litigation taking long time to resolve. Therefore, the Act gives wide import to 'commercial dispute' and brings within its fold all disputes commercial in nature whose specific value is more than three lakhs, so that such disputes can be put into fast track mode. It is to be noted that commercial Courts are not inferior to civil Courts. They are presided over by experienced judicial officers. It envisages detailed procedure of adjudication and above all, early disposal of dispute. Having regard to object of Commercial Courts Act, 2015, even when a party to a claim or application or suit does not specify the value of claim in an application filed under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 before a Commercial Court, and/or before a Civil Court, the Court has to 'determine' whether the dispute is a commercial dispute or a civil dispute. \n25. In the case on hand, when first respondent filed application under Section 9 of Act, 2016 before the Civil Court, he has not specified the value of the claim. Therefore, it is for the civil Court to 'decide' the 'specified value'.\nPNR,J & PSS,J - 13 - 26. From the narrative of 1st respondent in his pursuit of litigation against his partners in LLP, it is apparent that he was subjected to huge loss in monetary terms by actions and conduct of his partners and the same to be recovered. In A.O.P.No.40 of 2020, the 1st respondent alleged that his partners were unjustly enriching themselves at his cost and the application is filed to protect his interests and to prevent further loss/wrongful loss. Though, in the application under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 he does not quantify the alleged loss caused to him, in his application under Section 11 of the Act, 1996, he has assessed the losses sustained by him at Rs.20 crores. \n27. In the absence of disclosure of value by the first respondent, deliberate or otherwise, the Court is required to take up the onerous responsibility of 'deciding' the 'specified value'. For this purpose, the Court is required to look into the surrounding facts to assess whether the Civil Court has jurisdiction or aggrieved person has to go before the Commercial Court. The contribution by all the partners to the LLP is now Rs.1,00,00,000/-(Rupees one crore) and contribution of first respondent is Rs.15,00,000 (Rupees fifteen lakhs). His share in profit and loss is pegged at 15%. He alleges that he is subjected to losses due to conduct of business by other partners. Further, in column 8 of Arbitration Application No.61 of 2020 under Section 11 of the Act of 1996 before this Court for appointment of Arbitrator, the first respondent has specified the tentative value of his claim as Rs.20,00,00,000/- (Rupees twenty crores only) subject to final computation. He has also admitted that his capital contribution to LLP was Rs.15,00,000/-. This application was filed on 24.09.2020 i.e., within two months of filing PNR,J & PSS,J - 14 - of arbitration O.P.No.40 of 2020. Within two months the value cannot multiply from unspecified / zero to Rs.20,00,00,000/-. Thus, the 1st respondent was aware that he was subjected to huge losses due to the conduct of partners in the LLP and that his interests are required to be protected to recoup the loss caused to him, compelling him to move applications, under Sections 9 and 11 of the Act, 1996. \n28. Thus, admittedly, there is a dispute between the partners of LLP, arising out of the partnership agreement and according to first respondent he was subjected to huge loss of Rs,20,00,00,000 (Rupees twenty crore). This is the \"specified value\". That being so, what is agitated by the 1st respondent is a commercial dispute. \n29. The Civil Court misdirected itself in not appreciating the contentions urged and confining its consideration to non-disclosure of the value. The Trial Court failed to appreciate that by the time the I.A.No.551 of 2021 was considered, the 1st respondent already filed the Arbitration Application before this Court, where his contribution to LLP is claimed as Rs.15,00,000/- (Rupees fifteen lakhs only) and alleged loss caused to him tentatively quantified at Rs.20,00,00,000/- (Rupees twenty crore). The fact that 1st respondent filed Arbitration Application with above claim was also noticed by the trial Court. The Trial Court also failed to appreciate that there is a dispute inter-se the partners of LLP and that dispute arises out of the terms of partnership agreement. The Trial Court misdirected itself in observing that other agreements were independent of the LLP agreement. While considering the issue of jurisdiction of civil Court to entertain an PNR,J & PSS,J - 15 - application under section 9 of the Act, 1996 in a dispute among the partners of LLP, the Court need not go into the question whether the other agreements are independent of LLP agreement. The dispute among the petitioners and respondents forming part of LLP arising out of partnership agreement, whose specified value is more than Rs.3,00,000/- is a commercial dispute and the Commercial Court alone has jurisdiction to deal with application filed by the first respondent under section 9 of the Act, 1996.\n30. For the aforesaid reasons, the order in I.A.No.551 of 2020 in Arbitration O.P.No.40 of 2020 on the file of IX Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court at Hyderabad is set aside, Arbitration O.P. No. 40 of 2020 on the file of IX Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court at Hyderabad is dismissed and the Civil Revision Petition is allowed. However, liberty is granted to 1st respondent to avail remedy under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 before the Commercial Court, if so advised and if otherwise entitled in law. Pending miscellaneous petitions if any shall stand closed. \n__________________________ JUSTICE P.NAVEEN RAO __________________________ JUSTICE P.SREE SUDHA Date: 07.01.2022 PT/KKM Note: L.R.copy to be marked: Yes PNR,J & PSS,J - 16 - HONOURABLE SRI JUSTICE P.NAVEEN RAO & HONOURABLE SMT JUSTICE P.SREE SUDHA CIVIL REVISION PETITION NO.21 OF 2021 Date:7.01.2022 Pt/kkm",

'joint venture' literally means 'a contractual agreement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity' ; 'a joint venture' is 'an association of two or more persons to carry out a single business enterprise for profit' [advanced law lexicon 3rd edition by ramnathan iyer]. 'a joint venture' means 'a business undertaking by two or more persons engaged in a single defined project. the necessary elements are: (1) an express or implied agreement; (2) a common purpose that the group intends to carry out; (3) shared profits and losses; and (4) each member's equal voice in controlling the project'. [blacks law dictionaryninth edition]. 15. in faqir chand gulati (supra), hon'ble supreme court considered definition of term 'joint venture' in various dictionaries. the 6. jurisdiction of commercial court.--the commercial court shall have jurisdiction to try all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute of a specified value arising out of the entire territory of the state over which it has been vested territorial jurisdiction. explanation.--for the purposes of this section, a commercial dispute shall be considered to arise out of the entire territory of the state over which a commercial court has been vested jurisdiction, if the suit or application relating to such commercial dispute has been instituted as per the provisions of sections 16 to 20 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908). pnrj & jsrj crp no.3018 of 2022 appellant is the owner of land in new delhi. he entered into an agreement with the respondents to develop his land and construct apartments on it. owing to several unauthorized deviations made by the respondent, the appellant filed a complaint before the district consumer disputes redressal forum seeking reliefs against the respondent, which was dismissed. on appeal to the state forum, the appeal was dismissed again on the ground that the agreement between the appellant and respondents was in the nature of a joint venture. this was upheld by the national commission as well. while considering the question of law before the hon'ble supreme court whether a landowner entering into agreement with a builder for construction of apartment building and for sharing of the constructed area is a 'consumer' entitled to maintain complaint against builder as service provider hon'ble supreme court noted the definition of 'joint venture' as defined in few journals. paras 22 and 23 read as under: \"22. the following definition of \"joint venture\" occurring in american jurisprudence (2nd edn., vol. 46, pp. 19, 22 and 23) is relevant: \"a joint venture is frequently defined as an association of two or more persons formed to carry out a single business enterprise for profit. more specifically, it is in association of persons with intent, by way of contract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single business venture for joint profit, for which purpose such persons combine their property, money, effects, skill, and knowledge, without creating a partnership, a corporation or other business entity, pursuant to an agreement that there shall be a community of interest among the parties as to the purpose of the undertaking, and that each joint venturer must stand in the relation of principal, as well as agent, as to each of the other coventurers within the general scope of the enterprise. joint ventures are, in general, governed by the same rules as partnerships. the relations of the parties to a joint venture and the nature of their association are so similar and closely akin to a partnership that their rights, duties, and liabilities are generally tested by rules which are closely analogous to and substantially the same, if not exactly the same as those which govern partnerships. since the legal consequences of a joint venture are equivalent to those of a partnership, the courts freely apply partnership law to joint ventures pnrj & jsrj crp no.3018 of 2022 when appropriate. in fact, it has been said that the trend in the law has been to blur the distinctions between a partnership and a joint venture, very little law being found applicable to one that does not apply to the other. thus, the liability for torts of parties to a joint venture agreement is governed by the law applicable to partnerships. a joint venture is to be distinguished from a relationship of independent contractor, the latter being one who, exercising an independent employment, contracts to do work according to his own methods and without being subject to the control of his employer except as to the result of the work, while a joint venture is a special combination of two or more persons where, in some specific venture, a profit is jointly sought without any actual partnership or corporate designation.\" 23. to the same effect is the definition in corpus juris secundum (vol. 48-a, pp. 314-15): \" joint venture', a term used interchangeably and synonymous with 'joint adventure', or coventure, has been defined as a special combination of two or more persons wherein some specific venture for profit is jointly sought without any actual partnership or corporate designation, or as an association of two or more persons to carry out a single business enterprise for profit or a special combination of persons undertaking jointly some specific adventure for profit, for which purpose they combine their property, money, effects, skill, and knowledge. among the acts or conduct which are indicative of a joint venture, no single one of which is controlling in determining whether a joint venture exists, are : (1) joint ownership and control of property; (2) sharing of expenses, profits and losses, and having and exercising some voice in determining division of net earnings; (3) community of control over, and active participation in, management and direction of business enterprise; (4) intention of parties, express or implied; and (5) fixing of salaries by joint agreement.\" (emphasis supplied) 16. learned counsel for defendant asserted that in order to know the real nature of the document, one has to look into the recitals and not the title of the document. learned counsel relied on b.k.muniraju. in the said decision, hon'ble supreme court held as under: \"18. the document in question which is filed as annexure p-3, has been styled or titled as \"certificate of grant\". in order to know the real nature of the document, one has to look into the recitals of the document and not the title of the document. the intention is to be gathered from the recitals in the deed, the conduct of the parties and the evidence on record. it is settled law that the question of construction of a document is to be decided by finding out the intention of the executant, firstly, from a comprehensive reading of the terms of the document itself, and then, by looking into--to the extent permissible--the prevailing circumstances which persuaded the author of the document to execute it. with a view to ascertain the nature of a transaction, the document has to be read as a whole. a sentence or term used may not be determinative of the real nature of transaction. reference in this regard can be made to the following cases pnrj & jsrj crp no.3018 of 2022 i.e. vidhyadhar v. manikrao [(1999) 3 scc 573], subbegowda v. thimmegowda [(2004) 9 scc 734] and bishwanath prasad singh v. rajendra prasad [(2006) 4 scc 432] . 19. the above principles make it clear that we have to see terms and conditions and recitals in the document and not the title alone. though the document, according to the appellant, \"certificate of grant\", perusal of the clauses therein, clearly shows that the land was sold on 4-3-1948 in a public auction and motappa purchased the same for a price of rs 408.12. in addition to the recitals, the \"darkhast register extract\" produced as annexure 'c' before the high court also shows that the land in question was sold for a \"price\". form i also indicates that the land in question was purchased and what was paid by the purchaser under the said document was the purchase price.\" (emphasis supplied) 17. in bunga daniel babu v sri vasudeva constructions and others9, the appellant is the owner of 1347 sq yards of land in visakhapatnam. he entered into an mou with the respondents for development of his land by constructing a multi-storeyed apartment, which were to be shared between them in a proportion of 40:60. however, the work was completed and flats handed over to the appellants with a lot of delay. the appellant also had grievance pertaining to deviations from sanction plans and non-completion of various other works. his claim for compensation was rejected by the respondents. he approached the district consumer disputes redressal forum. the district forum held that the project could not be considered to be a joint venture and thus excluded from the purview of the act, and awarded compensation to the appellant. the state commission and national commission did not agree with the district forum on the ground that the flats were built for commercial purposes, and not personal use. the issue for consideration was whether the (2016) 8 scc 429 pnrj & jsrj crp no.3018 of 2022 appellant falls within the definition of 'consumer' in the consumer protection act? 17.1. the hon'ble supreme court held: \"14. in kalpavruksha charitable trust v. toshniwal brothers (bombay) pvt. ltd, reiterating the principles stated in laxmi engineering works (supra), the court ruled whether a person would fall within the definition of \"consumer\" or not would be a question of fact in every case. . \"21. on a studied scrutiny of the aforesaid clauses, it is clear as day that the appellant is neither a partner nor a co-adventurer. he has no say or control over the construction. he does not participate in the business. he is only entitled to, as per the mou, a certain constructed area. the extent of area, as has been held in faqir chand gulati (supra) does not make a difference. therefore, the irresistible conclusion is that the appellant is a consumer under the act.\" 18. in ambalal sarabhai enterprises ltd v ks infraspace llp and ors10 the appellant filed the commercial civil suit so as to enforce the execution of a mortgage deed. consequently, the relief of permanent injunction and other related reliefs were sought. the defendant filed application under order vii rule 10 of code of civil procedure, 1908 contending that the dispute involved in the case is not a commercial dispute. the commercial court while rejecting the application had referred to the memorandum of articles of association of the appellant company and taking note of the business that they were entitled to undertake had arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff seems to be carrying on the business as an estate agent and in that circumstance has further arrived at its conclusion that it was a commercial dispute. the high court on the other hand had found fault with the manner in (2020) 15 scc 585 =manu/sc/1378/2019 pnrj & jsrj crp no.3018 of 2022 which the commercial court had rested its consideration on the memorandum and articles of association and had examined the matter in detail to come to a conclusion that the immovable property in the instant case was not being used for trade or commerce. the high court had accordingly directed the return of the plaint to be presented in an appropriate court. in the said case, hon'ble supreme court was considering the scope of section 2(1)(c)(vii) agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. 18.1. the hon'ble supreme court held: \"10. at the outset, it is noticed that the consideration required in the instant case is as to whether the transaction between the parties herein which is the subject matter of the suit could be considered as a \"commercial dispute\" so as to enable the commercial court to entertain the suit. in that regard, it is necessary to take note of section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the cc act, 2015. the said provision to the extent relevant is extracted here below for reference. section 2(1) in this act, unless the context otherwise requires,(c) \"commercial dispute\" means a dispute arising out of (vii) agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce; from a perusal, of the provision relied upon by the learned senior advocates it is noticed that the disputes arising out of agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce will qualify to be a commercial dispute to be tried by commercial courts. the question therefore would be that, in the instant case though the parties have entered into a sale transaction of the immovable property and presently in the suit the registration of a mortgage deed pertaining to the immovable property is sought, whether the immovable property involved could be considered as being used exclusively in trade or commerce. 13. [.] the very purpose for which the cc act of 2015 has been enacted would be defeated if every other suit merely because it is filed before the commercial court is entertained. this is for the reason that the suits which are not actually relating to commercial dispute but being filed merely because of the high value and with the intention of seeking early disposal would only clog the system and block the way for the genuine commercial disputes which may have to be entertained by the commercial courts as intended by the law makers. in commercial disputes as defined a special procedure is provided for a class of litigation and a strict procedure will have to be followed to entertain only that class of litigation in that jurisdiction. if the same is strictly interpreted it is not as if those pnrj & jsrj crp no.3018 of 2022 excluded will be non-suited without any remedy. the excluded class of litigation will in any event be entertained in the ordinary civil courts wherein the remedy has always existed. 14. in that view it is also necessary to carefully examine and entertain only disputes which actually answers the definition \"commercial disputes\" as provided under the act. in the instant case, as already taken note neither the agreement between the parties refers to the nature of the immovable property being exclusively used for trade or commerce as on the date of the agreement nor is there any pleading to that effect in the plaint. further the very relief sought in the suit is for execution of the mortgage deed which is in the nature of specific performance of the terms of memorandum of understanding without reference to nature of the use of the immovable property in trade or commerce as on the date of the suit. therefore, if all these aspects are kept in view, we are of the opinion that in the present facts the high court was justified in its conclusion arrived through the order dated 01.03.2019 impugned herein. the commercial court shall therefore return the plaint indicating a date for its presentation before the court having jurisdiction.\" 19. in sandhya hotels pvt ltd v amritha sharma11 also hon'ble supreme court was considering the word 'used' in section 2(1)(c)(vii). in the said case, the second applicant, the managing director of sandhya hotels pvt ltd, approached the respondent/plaintiff asking her to purchase a house situated within the approved layout of the jubilee hills cooperative house building society limited, claiming that his company had entered into an agreement with smt. m. jayasree, and that the amount towards sale consideration has to be paid to the vendor and he will get the sale deed directly conveyed from smt. m. jayasree to the plaintiff. believing this, the plaintiff entered into an agreement with the second defendant and paid the amounts through cheques and rtgs to the second defendant and to its company, amounting to 14.00 crores. though the second defendant has put the plaintiff in possession of the schedule property, in which the plaintiff setup a manu/hy/0288/2018 pnrj & jsrj crp no.3018 of 2022 boutique, the property was still not registered in the name of the plaintiff. the plaintiff found out that the defendant had executed a sale deed in the name of the first defendant. the second defendant promised to register a sale deed in favour of the plaintiff, but did not even turn up for registration. referring to certain incidents where the defendants cheated the plaintiff and others, the plaintiff filed a suit for specific performance in the civil court. later on, the defendants filed a memo before the civil court to transfer the case to the commercial court since the value involved is more than rupees one crore and that the said court has become functus officio. rejection of this request led to filing of the present appeal under section 9 of the act. 19.1. the hon'ble supreme court held: \"5. the question that arises for consideration is \"whether in the given set of facts, the dispute between the parties can be termed as a commercial dispute? 8. explanation (a) to section 2(1)(c) states that a commercial dispute shall not cease to be a commercial dispute merely becausea) it also involves action for recovery of immovable property or for realization of monies out of immovable property given as security or involves any other relief pertaining to immovable property; 11. merely because, there was a transaction involving immovable property worth more than one crore and merely because an amount of rs. 14 crores was paid, the dispute would not become a commercial dispute, it requires to be qualified with other conditions. 12. the word \"used\" in section 2(1)(c)(vii) would mean \"actually used\" or \"being used\" as held by the gujarat high court in vasu healthcare private limited v. gujarat akruti tcg biotech limited and others (2012) 4 scc 327 and bombay high court in dineshkumargulabchand agrawal v. commissioner of income tax and another (2001) 6 scc 407 the court held that if the intention of the latter was to expand, the scope of the phraseology used, would have been different. the word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and it cannot be said to be either \"ready for use\" or likely to be used\"; or \"to be used\". it was also held that the word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and not merely \"ready for use\". pnrj & jsrj crp no.3018 of 2022 13. it has been brought to our notice that the s.l.p. filed against the judgment of nagpur bench of the bombay high court and also against the judgment of the gujarat high court, were also dismissed by the apex court. therefore, the word \"used\" therein must be such property which is being \"actually used\" or \"being used\" and not likely to be used or to be used at a later point of time.\" 20. from the above decisions, it is noticed that hon'ble supreme court was dealing with specific aspects of what constitutes a commercial dispute in the peculiar facts of those cases. in none of these cases, scope of section 2(1)(c)(xi) was considered. 21. it is beyond pale of doubt that a 'joint venture' presupposes an association by two or more persons to join together to undertake an economic activity. further, the clause (xi) of section 2(1)(c) of the act, 2015 only uses the term 'joint venture', plain and simple, it is very exhaustive and does not give scope to any other interpretation. therefore, whenever a dispute arises in pursuance to a 'joint venture' it is a commercial dispute. 22. to test the validity of the submissions of learned counsel for the defendant we have also looked into the clauses of the agreement. 23. on 2.4.2009 plaintiff and defendant have entered into joint venture agreement which was filed along with the plaint. the title assigned to the agreement is 'joint venture agreement'. 24. the terms of agreement disclose that the defendant has identified a land for development for commercial use and estimated investment required to execute the project at 35 crores. plaintiff agreed to invest pnrj & jsrj crp no.3018 of 2022 2 crores. he has also undertaken to sell flats constructed as per the terms of agreement. the maximum period of completion of the project was three years. the clauses also talk of sharing of profits. default clause also envisages payment of irr @ 18 % per annum to plaintiff. thus, it is not a simple agreement to buy land and put the land to use, but to develop a land identified for the purpose to earn profits. 25. the further contention of learned counsel for defendant that the land was 'not put to use', and that in fact there was no land, therefore the dispute is not a commercial dispute is stated to be rejected as it has no application to the facts of this case. putting the land for commercial use is relevant, if section 2(1)(c)(vii) clause is attracted. clause (xi) of section 2(1)(c) governs the case, which does not envisage land being put to use as pre-requisite to make the dispute as commercial dispute. on the contrary, as noticed in the earlier paragraphs, joint venture agreement binds the commercial relationship. at any rate definition clause is open ended and does not impose any restraint or application to specified instances of joint ventures. 26. further, court is not venturing into merits of respective claims on scope of their joint venture and obligations flowing there from. these aspects require consideration by the trial court. court has only considered whether the dispute raised in the suit is a commercial dispute and whether the commercial court has jurisdiction to decide the dispute in the instant suit. pnrj & jsrj crp no.3018 of 2022 27. on thorough analysis of statutory scheme and precedent decisions, we hold that the commercial court has jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute flowing out of 'joint venture agreement' in the instant suit. we uphold the decision of commercial court. civil revision petition fails. it is accordingly dismissed. miscellaneous applications, if any pending stand closed. _____________________ p.naveen rao,j _____________________ j.sreenivas rao,j date: 24.03.2023 tvk/kkm note: lr copy to be marked: yes pnrj & jsrj crp no.3018 of 2022 hon'ble sri justice p.naveen rao & hon'ble sri justice j.sreenivas rao civil revision petition no.3018 of 2022 date: 24.03.2023 tvk/kkm"
