KARIA\n                           5th September 2018\n\nORAL JUDGMENT                (PER : HONOURABLE Mr. JUSTICE AKIL KURESHI)\nPetitioner-Indian Overseas Bank [hereinafter to be referred to as, \"the petitioner Bank\"] has challenged an order dated 2nd April 2018 passed by the learned Judge, C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT Commercial Court, Ahmedabad below Exh. 16 in Commercial Civil Suit No. 152 of 2017.\nFacts leading to the said challenge are as under :\nThe petitioner is a public sector Bank. The respondents- original plaintiffs had availed credit facilities from the petitioner-Bank. According to the Bank, the borrowers committed default in making repayment, due to which the Bank had taken steps under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 [\"SARFESI Act\" for short] and the Recovery of Debts & Bankruptcy Act, 1993 [\"RDBA Act\" for short] and after which the respondents instituted Commercial Civil Suit No. 152 of 2017 against the Bank and prayed that the Bank may be directed to pay a sum of Rs. 30 Crores by way of damages and loss caused to the plaintiffs and a further sum of Rs. 10 Crores for loss of reputation. In the plaint, the plaintiffs have averred that the Bank had instituted proceedings for recovery of a sum of Rs. 18,89,05,602/= under the SARFESI Act and symbolic possession of the properties of the plaintiffs has been taken on 11th May 2017. According to the plaintiffs, there was non cooperation from the Bank which led to caused C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT damage to the plaintiffs on account of non sanctioning and non disbursing further working capital, and loss of reputation on account of such non advances. It is further averred that the plaintiffs had written series of letters to the Bank, despite which the Bank refused to release further working capital which severely affected the operations of the plaintiffs' factory for which the Bank is directly responsible. The summons of this suit was served on the Bank on 9th August 2017. As per the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure [\"CPC\" for short], as amended by the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division & Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 [\"Act of 2015\" for short], the defendant was required to file its written statement within a maximum period of 120 days from the date of service of summons. This was admittedly not done. The defendant filed application Exh. 16 in the said Civil Suit on 1st February 2018 and requested the learned Judge to condone delay caused in filing the written statement. Along with the application, written statement was presented and a request was made to take it on the record and exhibit the same. Though in this application, the Bank has computed such delay to the extent of 153 days, counsel for the petitioner clarified that the C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT delay actually was only of 33 days. He explained that the total period of 153 days is computed; including maximum period of 120 days available for filing the written statement. On 1st February 2018 itself, the appellant also filed an application for rejection of the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.\nThe Commercial Court passed the impugned order on application Exh. 16 and rejected prayer of the defendant for condoning delay, and taking the written statement on record. The learned Judge referred to provisions of Order VIII CPC; as amended by the Act of 2015 and came to the conclusion that he has no power to extend the time, beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons, to enable defendant to file the written statement. This order of the Commercial Court is challenged before us in the present petition.\nLearned advocate Shri Tejas Satta for the petitioner submitted that the suit is frivolous and vexatious, filed by the plaintiff in order to avoid the liability of repayment of Bank's dues. He submitted that the Bank had already initiated proceedings under the SARFESI Act and also taken symbolic possession of the secured assets at which stage, the suit came to be filed on wholly frivolous and vexatious grounds. Counsel C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT further submitted that the provisions of CPC in relation to filing of the written statement and time for such purpose are procedural in nature and cannot defeat the substantive rights. He, therefore, submitted that such provision should be construed liberally and the time limit should be held to be directory in nature. Counsel further submitted that the petitioner Bank had shown sufficient cause for not being able to file the written statement within time. Learned Judge of the Commercial Court should have considered such explanation and condoned the delay, failing which enormous damage would be caused to the Bank.\nIn support of his contentions, counsel relied upon the following judgments :\n[i] In case of Kalpesh R Jain & Ors. vs. Mandev Tubes Private Limited, reported in MANU/MH/1967/2017, in which the Division Bench of Bombay High Court in the context of delay in filing the appeal, held that Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 could be invoked and applied while requesting the Commercial Appellate Court to condone delay beyond sixty days in presenting the appeal, provided sufficient cause is shown.\nC/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT [ii] In case of Shri Balaji Industrial Products Limited v. AIA Engineering Limited [Judgment dated 2nd July 2018], the Division Bench of Rajasthan High Court permitted the written statement to be taken on the record belatedly by awarding cost of Rs. 50,000/=.\n[iii] In case of Sunil Alagh v. Shivraj Puri & Anr., [Civil Suit [Comm] No. 1495 of 2016 :: Dated 14/12/2017], the learned Single Judge of Delhi High Court held that service of the defendant in a suit cannot be said to be complete unless complete paper book of the suit is supplied to the defendant. In this context, written statement of the defendant no. 1 was ordered to be taken on record.\n[iv] In case of Topline Shoes Limited v. Corporation Bank Limited, reported in 2002 [6] SCC 33, in which, the Supreme Court held that proviso contained in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 providing that the extended time for filing reply shall not exceed 45 days is directory in nature. Counsel, however, candidly pointed out that the Supreme Court in the case of Dr. JJ Merchant & Ors. v. Shrinath Chaturvedi, reported in 2003 [1] GLH 608 in this context has taken somewhat different view, opining that such proviso C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT cannot be interpreted in such a manner that speedy and expeditious remedy to the consumer is frustrated. He also drew our attention to a decision in the latter judgment of the Supreme Court in case of New India Assurance Company Limited v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage Private Limited, reported in 2015 [16] SCC 20 in which, it was held that the district forum under the Consumer Protection Act can grant a further period of 15 days to the opposite party for filing his version or reply and not beyond that.\nReliance was also placed on a decision of the Supreme Court in case of Sejal Glass Limited v. Navilan Merchants Private Limited, AIR 2017 SC 4477 in which, the Supreme Court, while reversing the judgment of the Commercial Court; as confirmed by the High Court rejecting the suit under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, granted further time for filing the written statement.\nA short question that calls for consideration is - Does the Commercial Court have power to take on record, the written statement which is presented beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons on sufficient grounds, preventing the defendant from filing the same being made out.\nC/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT Before any further debate, we must record that this issue is settled by a judgment of Division Bench of this Court in the case of Jayatma Informatics Pvt. Ltd v. HCL Infosystems Limited [Special Civil Application No. 13430 of 2017 ::\nDecided on 2nd November 2017]. It was a case in which the petitioner, who was defendant in a Commercial Civil Suit, had attempted to present the written statement beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons. The Commercial Court refused to take written statement on the record, upon which writ petition came to be filed before the High Court challenging the order of the Commercial Court. In context of this controversy, the Division Bench observed as under :-\n\"13. On conjoint reading of second proviso to sub-\nrule [1] of Order V; proviso to Rule 1 Order VIII and proviso to Rule 10 of Order VIII CPC, a defendant is required to file the written statement within a period of thirty days from the date of service of summons of the suit. However, he shall be allowed to file written statement on such other day; as may be specified by the Court, for the reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such cost as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be later than 120 days from the date of service of summons. It also further provides C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT that on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. Proviso to Order VIII Rule 10 CPC provides that no Court shall make an order to extend the time provided under rule-1 of Order VIII for filing of the written statement. Thus, taking on record the written statement beyond period of 120 days from the date of service of the summons is strictly barred/ prohibited and there is a mandate that the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record, if the same is submitted beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of the summons. It also further mandates that on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit his right to file written statement. There is a specific bar as per first proviso to Rule 10 of Order VIII by which the Court is strictly prohibited to extend the time provided under Rule 1 of Order VIII CPC for filing the written statement.\n13. In the present case, it is an admitted position that the written statement was submitted/presented beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons. Therefore as such, considering the provisions of CPC referred to hereinabove, more particularly Order V Rule 1; Order VIII Rule 1 and Order VIII Rule 10, it cannot be said that the learned Judge has committed any error in not taking on record the written statement filed by the defendant C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT which as such was submitted beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of the summons. As observed hereinabove, even learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has also fairly conceded and/or admitted that the learned Judge, Commercial Court by not taking on record the written statement which was submitted beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons is justified in his action.\n13.1 However, Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has requested this Court to exercise powers under Article 226 to do substantial justice and in the facts and circumstances of the case when in the meantime, the defendant was trying to settle the dispute with the plaintiff and therefore did not file written statement in time and thereafter when the written statement was submitted, one hundred twenty days period has expired, and therefore, it is requested to exercise powers under Article 226 and to direct the learned Judge, Commercial Court to take on record the written statement and/or permit the petitioner herein-original defendant to place on record, the written statement. It is the case on behalf of the petitioner herein-original defendant that as such by not permitting the petitioner herein-original defendant to place on record the written statement, the necessary consequences of non filing of written statement shall follow which would be very drastic and would simultaneously cause undue hardship to C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT the defendant. It is also the case on behalf of the petitioner that by the aforesaid proviso High Court's powers under Article 226 of the Constitution are not taken away and still the High Court can in exercise of power under Article 226 of the Constitution to do substantial justice can permit the defendant to place on record written statement. It is also the case on behalf of the petitioner that as such the aforesaid provision is procedural law, and therefore, the procedural law may not be construed very strictly and as such the procedure law cannot take away substantial right of a party to defend the suit/proceedings.\n13.2 Now so far as submission/request on behalf of the petitioner to exercise power under Article 226 of the Constitution and to permit the petitioner herein-original defendant to place on record the written statement to do substantial justice is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that as such there is no such prayer in the petition. The present petition is as such filed under Article 227 of the Constitution challenging the impugned order passed by the learned Judge, Commercial Court, Ahmedabad passed below Application Exh. 14 in Commercial Civil Suit No. 328 of 2016 by which the learned Judge has rejected the said application preferred by the petitioner-original defendant and has refused to take on record the written statement which as such was submitted/ presented beyond the period of 120 days of the C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT service of summons There is no such prayer and/or averments made in the petition requesting to exercise power under Article 226 of the Constitution and to permit the defendant to place on record the written statement Even in the cause title also the petition is described as the one preferred under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Even otherwise, as per the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Radhey Shyam & Anr. vs. Chhabi Nath & Ors. [Supra] and in the case of Jogendrasinhji Vijaysinghji v. State of Gujarat & Ors. [Supra], the order passed by a Civil Court is only amendable to be scrutinized by the High Court in exercise of powers under Article 227 of the Constitution only which is different from Article 226 of the Constitution.\n14. In view of the aforesaid facts and even the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid two decisions, the submission on behalf of the petitioner to exercise power under Article 226 of the Constitution and to permit the petitioner- original defendant to place on record the written statement is not required to be accepted.\n15. Now so far as submission on behalf of the petitioner and the request to exercise powers under Article 226 of the Constitution and to permit the petitioner-original defendant to place on record the written statement beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of the summons to do substantial justice and the submission on behalf of C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT the petitioner that as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kailash v. Nanhku & Ors. [Supra] and in the case of Salem Advocate Bar Association, T.N v. Union of India [Supra], the time limit provided in CPC is directory is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kailash v. Nanhku & Ors.[Supra] and in the case of Salem Advocate Bar Association, T.N v. Union of India [Supra] relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner referred to hereinabove and which are relied upon in his submission that the time limit prescribed under the CPC to file written statement in a particular time limit is directory and not mandatory shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand more particularly while dealing with the amended provisions of CPC; more particularly Order V Rule 1; Order VIII Rule 1 and Order VIII Rule 10 CPC which as such are exclusively and specifically amended for commercial dispute to which Commercial Courts Act, 2015 shall be applicable. The earlier language used in CPC providing the time limit for filing the written statement which fell for consideration before the Apex Court in the aforesaid two decisions are altogether different than that of the amended CPC, which is exclusively applicable to the commercial disputes.\n16. As observed hereinabove, now as per second proviso to sub-rule [1] of Order V and substituted C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT proviso of Rule 1 of Order VIII CPC, the written statement is required to be filed within a period of thirty days and the Court can allow the defendant to file written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for the reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be more than 120 days from the date of service of summons. It also further provides that on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. As per proviso to sub-rule [10] of Rule VIII CPC, no Court shall make an order to extend the time provided under rule 1 of Order VIII for filing of the written statement. Thus, as such, the aforesaid provisions are not only mandatory in nature but it also provides for consequences of not filing the written statement within the time prescribed under the aforesaid provisions and there is a specific bar by the Court not to extend the time provided under Rule 1 of Order VIII for filing the written statement beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons. Thus, in any case, no written statement can be permitted to be taken on record beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons. No such provision fell for consideration before the Apex Court in the aforesaid two decisions. Therefore, considering the aforesaid provisions as such, the Commercial Court is prohibited from taking written statement on C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT record, if it is submitted beyond the period of 120 days. Looking to the object and purpose of enactment of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division & Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 and the special provisions/ mechanism for disposal of the commercial disputes, even granting of 120 days cannot be said to be unreasonable. In other words, not permitting the defendant to file written statement, if submitted beyond the period of 120 days from the date of submission of the summons cannot be said to be unreasonable. The object and purpose to provide such a time limit is required to be considered while considering the object and purpose of enactment of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 which is enacted for speedy disposal of the commercial disputes and which provides for special mechanism for speedy disposal of the commercial disputes. Under the circumstances, the aforesaid decisions taking the view that time limit provided under the Code of Civil Procedure to file written statement within a particular time limit is directory and not mandatory shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand, more particularly with respect to the aforesaid provisions viz., Order V Rule 1; Order VIII Rule 1 and Order VIII Rule 10 CPC which shall be applicable to the commercial disputes only. Even the observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kailash v. Nanhku [Supra] that the rules of procedure are the handmaid of justice, the provisions of CPC or any other procedural C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT enactment ought not to have been construed in a manner which shall leave the Court helpless to meeting extraordinary situations in the ends of justice, also shall not be applicable while construing and/or considering the time limit prescribed under the amended provisions, more particularly Order V Rule 1; Order VIII Rule 1 and Order VIII Rule 10 CPC more particularly while considering the object and purpose for which the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 has been enacted and the aforesaid provisions are made applicable only to the commercial disputes to which the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 shall be applicable.\"\nThe issue therefore should ordinarily rest here, without further ado. However, since further arguments were advanced before us citing certain judgments which may not have been cited before the Court earlier and also looking to the importance of the issue, we would like to add a few words of our own.\nThe said Act of 2015 was enacted based on the recommendations of the Law Commission made in its 253rd report which envisaged constitution of the Commercial Courts at district level; constitution of Commercial Divisions in the High Courts where ordinary civil jurisdiction exists and C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT constitution of Commercial Appellate Division to hear appeals against the orders of the Commercial Courts. The Act envisages amendment in the CPC, as applicable to the Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions, which would prevail over the existing High Court Rules and other provisions of the CPC \"so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases.\" The proposed law was aimed to accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the Indian Justice delivery system and the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation. With these objects, the Act was enacted. The Act envisages that the commercial disputes of specified value shall be dealt with by the Commercial Courts. Appeals against the judgment of the Commercial Court would lie before the High Court Appellate Commercial Division. Section 8 of the Act of 2015 provides for a bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order. It provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction and any such challenge; subject to C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT the provisions of Section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against a decree of the Commercial Court.\nSection 16 of the Act of 2015 provides for amendment to the CPC in its application to commercial disputes and reads as under :-\n\"16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes - [1] The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 [5 of 1908] shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule. [2] The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 [5 of 1908], as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value.\n[3] Where any provision of any rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 [5 of 1908], by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 [5 of 1908], as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail.\"\nAs per this section, thus, the provisions of the CPC, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of specified value would stand amended in the manner specified in the Schedule. As per sub-section [2] of Section 16, the Commercial Divisions and Commercial Courts would C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT follow the provisions of CPC; as amended by the Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value. Sub-section [3] of Section 16 further clarifies that in case of any conflict between any rule of the concerned High Court or an amendment in the CPC by the State Government, the provisions of the CPC; as amended by the Act of 2015, shall prevail. Section 16 thus makes it abundantly clear that in relation to a suit of specified value in respect of a commercial dispute, the CPC shall stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule to the Act of 2015. The Schedule to the Act of 2015 contains various amendments in the CPC. In the context of pleadings, disclosure, discovery and inspection of documents, etc. Order 15A has been inserted, which pertains to the \"Case Management Hearing\" which contains detailed provisions to ensure timely progress and speedy disposal of a commercial suit.\nWith this bird's eye view, we may refer to the specific provisions contained in the Schedule to the Act of 2015 amending the CPC. As is well known, Order VIII CPC pertains to written statement, set off and counter claim. Rule 1 thereof pertains to written statement. This rule was substituted by an C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT Act No. 22 of 2002 w.e.f 1st July 2002. In the current form, Rule 1 of Order VIII CPC reads as under :\n\"1. Written Statement - The defendant shall, within thirty days from the date of service of summons on him, present a written statement of his defence :\nProvided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the same on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, but which shall not be later than ninety days from the date of service of summons.\"\nAs per clause 4 [D] (i) of the Schedule to the Act of 2015, proviso to Rule 1 of Order VIII CPC would be substituted as under :\n\"Provided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.\"\nOrder X Rule 8 of CPC pertains to procedure when party fails to present written statement, and reads as under :\n\"10. Procedure when party fails to present written statement called for by Court - Where any party from whom a written statement is required under rule 1 or rule 9 fails to present the same within the time permitted or fixed by the Court, as the case may be, the Court shall pronounce judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit and on the pronouncement of such judgment, a decree shall be drawn up.\"\nBy virtue of Clause 4 [D] (iv), the following proviso is added to Rule 10 :\n\"Provided further that no Court shall make an order to extend the time provided under rule 1 of this Order for filing of the written statement.\"\nAs noted, the Act of 2015 has been enacted providing separate Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions for C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT dealing with commercial disputes of specified value in order to achieve timely disposal thereof. In furtherance of such objective, various provisions have been made in the Act of 2015; including making some significant amendments in the CPC.\nWe may recall, the CPC was amended extensively by the Act of 2002 which included imposition of time limit for filing the written statement. As per the amended Rule 1 of Order VIII, a defendant would have thirty days' time from the date of service of summons to present the written statement. As per the proviso, if the defendant failed to file written statement within such period, he would be allowed to file the written statement on some other day, as may be specified by the Court, for the reasons to be recorded in writing, but which shall not be later than ninety days from the date of service of summons. This proviso thus envisages time of thirty days which could be further extended by ninety days for filing the written statement. This and several other provisions amending the CPC came up for consideration before the Supreme Court in the case of Salem Advocate Bar Association, Tamil Nadu v. Union of India, reported in [2005] 6 SCC 344, wherein, a C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court held that the use of word \"shall\" in Rule 1 of Order VIII CPC by itself is not conclusive to determine whether the provision is mandatory or directory. A reference was made to Rule 10 of Order VIII, which as noted, provides that where any party from whom a written statement is required under Rule 1 or Rule 9 fails to present the same within the time permitted or fixed by the Court; as the case may be, the Court shall pronounce the judgment against him or make such order in relation to the suit, as it thinks fit. The Court was of the opinion that by virtue of the said proviso, on failure of the defendant to file written statement, the Civil Court had been given discretion either to pronounce the judgment against the defendant or make such order in relation to the suit, as it thinks fit. Therefore, in the context of the proviso, despite use of the word \"shall\", the Court has been given discretion either to pronounce or not to pronounce the judgment against the defendant, even if the written statement is not filed and instead pass such an order; as it thinks fit, in relation to the suit. Consequently, the time limit envisaged in Rule 1 of Order VIII CPC for filing the written statement was held to be directory and not mandatory in nature. The Court C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT concluded this issue as under :\n\"21. In construing this provision, support can also be had from Order 8 Rule 10 which provides that where any party from whom a written statement is required under Rule 1 or Rule 9, fails to present the same within the time permitted or fixed by the court, the Court shall pronounce judgment against him,or make such other order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. On failure to file written statement under this provision, the court has been given the discretion either to pronounce judgment against the defendant or make such other order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. In the context of the provision, despite use the word \"shall\", the Court has been given the discretion to pronounce or not to pronounce the judgment against the defendant even if the written statement is not filed and instead pass such order as it may think fit in relation to the suit. In construing the provision of Order 8 Rule 1 and Rule 10, the doctrine of harmonious construction is required to be applied. The effect would be under Rule 10 Order 8, the Court in its discretion would have the power to allow the defendant to file written statement even after expiry of the period of 90 days provided in Order 8 Rule 1. There is no restriction in Order 8 Rule 10 that after expiry of ninety days, further time cannot be granted. The court has wide power to \"make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit.\" Clearly, therefore, the provision of Order 8 Rule 1 providing for the upper limit of 90 days to file written statement is directory. Having said so, we wish to make it clear that the order extending time to file written statement cannot be made in routine. The time can be extended only in exceptionally hard cases. While extending time, it has to be borne in mind that the legislature has fixed the upper time limit of 90 days. The discretion of the court to extend the time shall not be so frequently and routinely exercised so as to nullify the period fixed by Order 8 Rule1.\"\nThis view was reiterated by the Supreme Court in case of Zolba vs. Keshao & Ors., reported in [2008] 11 SCC 769 C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT and in case of R.N Jadi & Brothers & Ors. vs. Subhash Chandra, [2007] 6 SCC 420, in which however, it was emphasized that filing the written statement within time envisaged would be a rule and departure therefrom an exception, made for satisfactory reasons only.\nThus, the Supreme Court in the case of Salem Advocate Bar Association, Tamil Nadu [Supra] interpreted the existing provisions of Rule 1 of Order VIII CPC as to laying down merely a discretionary time limit for filing the written statement, broadly with the aid of powers of the Civil Court under Rule 10 of Order VIII CPC.\nIn the present case, however, we are concerned with entirely different scheme of statutory provisions. Significantly, the legislature was conscious of decision of the Supreme Court in case of Salem Advocate Bar Association [Supra] and interpretative process adopted therein. In the context of time limit for filing written statement under schedule to the Act of 2015, the legislature has therefore made two significant amendments in the CPC. Firstly, the proviso to Rule 1 of Order VIII is substituted. In the substituted form, this proviso provides that where the defendant fails to file the written statement C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT within a period of thirty days, he would be allowed to file the written statement on such other day as may be specified by the court, for the reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such cost as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be later than 120 days from the date of service of summons. The proviso further provides that on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit their right to file written statement and the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. Simultaneously, the schedule also amends Rule 10 of Order VIII CPC by inserting a proviso which; as noted above, provides further that no court shall make an order to extend the time limit provided under Rule 1 of Order VIII CPC for filing the written statement.\nCombined effect of these amendments is clear and precise. All the powers of a Court dealing with the commercial disputes of a specified value for extending time for filing the written statement beyond the period of 120 days of service of summons are taken away. The language of the proviso to Rule 1 of Order VIII CPC has been materially altered. In addition to providing for extension beyond 30 days [but not beyond 120 C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT days from service of summons] on payment of cost; as may be specified by the Court, two more significant changes have been made namely, that on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file written statement and that the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. In addition to providing with the maximum time permissible for filing written statement upto 120 days from the date of service of summons, these two additional elements inserted in the proviso to Rule 1 make the legislative intent abundantly clear. There is no escape from the position that the legislature desired to put a ceiling on the maximum time that a Court can grant to the defendant in a suit involving commercial dispute of a specified value to file the written statement. The legislature has mandated both - in a positive as well as negative terms. Positively, by providing that on completion of 120 days, the defendant shall forfeit their right to file the written statement and negative, by providing that the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record after such period. For good measure, the legislature has also amended Rule 10 of Order VIII by providing that in exercise of such rule, no Court C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT shall make an order to extend the time for filing the written statement. This proviso is in the nature of an explanation, putting limitation on the powers of a Court to make such an order in relation to the suit; as it thinks fit. By virtue of this proviso, such power would not include power to extend the time provided under Rule 1 for filing the written statement.\nThe golden rule of statutory interpretation is that the statute must be read in its plain grammatical manner and be applied accordingly. In the case of Afcons Infrastructure Limited v/s. Cherian Varkey Construction Company Private Ltd., reported in 2010 (8) SCC 24, it was observed that the principles of statutory interpretation are well settled. Where the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, the provision must be given its plain and normal meaning, without adding or rejecting any words. Departure from this literal rule, by making structural changes or substituting words in a clear statutory provision, under the guise of interpretation would pose a great risk, as the changes may not be what the legislature intended or desired. It was further observed that an exception to the general rule is - where the words used in the statutory provision are vague and ambiguous or where the C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT plain and normal meaning of the words or grammatical construction thereof would lead to confusion, absurdity, repugnancy with other provisions, the Courts may use the interpretative tools to set right the situation. In the present case, we find the words used in the statute have no ambiguity or possibility of even two interpretations. We are conscious that the use of word 'shall' in a statute is not always conclusive of the legislative intention. Often times, the courts have even in face of the use of such expression held a proviso to be directory instead of mandatory. However, in the present case, from all angles, the legislative intent which emerges is that the prescription of time limit for filing the written statement applicable to a Commercial Court is mandatory. Such an interpretation would also be in consonance with the scheme of the Act of 2015 and the objects for enactment of the said act.\nWe may now refer to the judgments cited by learned counsel for the petitioner.\nIn case of Kalpesh R. Jain [Supra], the Bombay High Court was dealing with different situation. It was a case in which an appeal was filed before the Commercial Appellate Court set up under the Act of 2015. Such appeal was filed C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT beyond the period of limitation prescribed. The Court held that applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 is not ruled out and delay can be condoned on sufficient ground being made out.\nThe Rajasthan High Court in case of Shri Balaji Industrial Products Ltd [Supra] has not dealt with the question of powers of a Commercial Court to extend the time limit for filing written statement in face of amended provisions of Rule 1 Order VIII CPC. This judgment therefore does not lay down any proposition contrary to what we have discussed.\nThe learned Judge of Delhi High Court in case of Sunil Alagh [Supra] came to a conclusion that the service of summons on the defendant cannot be said to be complete unless complete paper book of the suit is supplied. In this context, it was held that period of 120 days for filing written statement will not commence, when the defendant has not been supplied complete paper book of the suit.\nThe decisions of Supreme Court in relation to provisions of the Consumer Courts Act, 1986 would throw no further light, since the statutory provisions are vastly different.\nC/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT In case of Sejal Glass Limited [Supra]; as noted, the Supreme Court allowed appeal of the plaintiff, setting aside the order passed by the Courts below, rejecting the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC and while doing so, additional time was granted to the defendant to file written statement. The Court, however, stated that the question of law in so far as Commercial Courts Act is concerned, had not been touched and was consequently kept open. This act of granting the defendants time of eight weeks for filing the written statement, can thus be seen as the Court's exercising power under Article 141 of the Constitution.\nThe contention of counsel for the petitioner that till the petitioner's application for rejection of plaint under Rule 11 of Order VII CPC is decided, the petitioner is not obliged to file the written statement, needs some comments. If the petitioner had filed such an application within 120 days of service of the summons, we would have further examined the petitioner's contention that as long as such application for rejection of plaint was pending, it was not necessary for the defendant to file the written statement and in a given case, a defendant may also take a stand that he was not obliged to present his full C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT defence, till such application was decided by the Court. However, in the present case, the defendant-petitioner Bank before us presented application for rejection of the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC simultaneously with an application for filing the written statement belatedly. Both these events thus took place after the maximum time permissible for filing the written statement ie.. 120 days had expired. Surely, the defendant cannot file application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC after time limit for filing the written statement has expired and then take a stand that till such application is decided, the defendant would have no obligation to file written statement and once such application is decided, and if decided against the defendant, he should be given additional time to file the written statement.\nFor all these reasons, we do not find any error in the order of the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad. Petition is, therefore, dismissed.\nBefore closing, we may record that nothing stated in this order would prevent the petitioner from vigorously pursuing application for rejection of the plaint filed under Order VII Rule 11 which we are informed is still pending and which will C/SCA/11710/2018 JUDGMENT be decided on its own merits, since in any case, we have not made any observations with respect to the same.\n[Akil Kureshi, J.] [B.N Karia, J.] Prakash",

including maximum period of 120 days available for filing the written statement. on 1st february 2018 itself, the appellant also filed an application for rejection of the plaint under order vii rule 11 cpc. the commercial court passed the impugned order on application exh. 16 and rejected prayer of the defendant for condoning delay, and taking the written statement on record. the learned judge referred to provisions of order viii cpc; as amended by the act of 2015 and came to the conclusion that he has no power to extend the time, beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons, to enable defendant to file the written statement. this order of the commercial court is challenged before us in the present petition. learned advocate shri tejas satta for the petitioner submitted that the suit is frivolous and vexatious, filed by the plaintiff in order to avoid the liability of repayment of bank's dues. he submitted that the bank had already initiated proceedings under the sarfesi act and also taken symbolic possession of the secured assets at which stage, the suit came to be filed on wholly frivolous and vexatious grounds. counsel c/sca/11710/2018 judgment further submitted that the provisions of cpc in relation to filing of the written statement and time for such purpose are procedural in nature and cannot defeat the substantive rights. he, therefore, submitted that such provision should be construed liberally and the time limit should be held to be directory in nature. counsel further submitted that the petitioner bank had shown sufficient cause for not being able to file the written statement within time. learned judge of the commercial court should have considered such explanation and condoned the delay, failing which enormous damage would be caused to the bank. in support of his contentions, counsel relied upon the following judgments : [i] in case of kalpesh r jain & ors. vs. mandev tubes private limited, reported in manu/mh/1967/2017, in which the division bench of bombay high court in the context of delay in filing the appeal, held that section 5 of the limitation act, 1963 could be invoked and applied while requesting the commercial appellate court to condone delay beyond sixty days in presenting the appeal, provided sufficient cause is shown. c/sca/11710/2018 judgment [ii] in case of shri balaji industrial products limited v. aia engineering limited [judgment dated 2nd july 2018], the division bench of rajasthan high court permitted the written statement to be taken on the record belatedly by awarding cost of rs. 50,000/=. [iii] in case of sunil alagh v. shivraj puri & anr., [civil suit [comm] no. 1495 of 2016 :: dated 14/12/2017], the learned single judge of delhi high court held that service of the defendant in a suit cannot be said to be complete unless complete paper book of the suit is supplied to the defendant. in this context, written statement of the defendant no. 1 was ordered to be taken on record. [iv] in case of topline shoes limited v. corporation bank limited, reported in 2002 [6] scc 33, in which, the supreme court held that proviso contained in the consumer protection act, 1986 providing that the extended time for filing reply shall not exceed 45 days is directory in nature. counsel, however, candidly pointed out that the supreme court in the case of dr. jj merchant & ors. v. shrinath chaturvedi, reported in 2003 [1] glh 608 in this context has taken somewhat different view, opining that such proviso c/sca/11710/2018 judgment cannot be interpreted in such a manner that speedy and expeditious remedy to the consumer is frustrated. he also drew our attention to a decision in the latter judgment of the supreme court in case of new india assurance company limited v. hilli multipurpose cold storage private limited, reported in 2015 [16] scc 20 in which, it was held that the district forum under the consumer protection act can grant a further period of 15 days to the opposite party for filing his version or reply and not beyond that. reliance was also placed on a decision of the supreme court in case of sejal glass limited v. navilan merchants private limited, air 2017 sc 4477 in which, the supreme court, while reversing the judgment of the commercial court; as confirmed by the high court rejecting the suit under order vii rule 11 cpc, granted further time for filing the written statement. a short question that calls for consideration is does the commercial court have power to take on record, the written statement which is presented beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons on sufficient grounds, preventing the defendant from filing the same being made out. c/sca/11710/2018 judgment before any further debate, we must record that this issue is settled by a judgment of division bench of this court in the case of jayatma informatics pvt. ltd v. hcl infosystems limited [special civil application no. 13430 of 2017 :: decided on 2nd november 2017]. it was a case in which the petitioner, who was defendant in a commercial civil suit, had attempted to present the written statement beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons. the commercial court refused to take written statement on the record, upon which writ petition came to be filed before the high court challenging the order of the commercial court. in context of this controversy, the division bench observed as under :\"13. on conjoint reading of second proviso to subrule [1] of order v; proviso to rule 1 order viii and proviso to rule 10 of order viii cpc, a defendant is required to file the written statement within a period of thirty days from the date of service of summons of the suit. however, he shall be allowed to file written statement on such other day; as may be specified by the court, for the reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such cost as the court deems fit, but which shall not be later than 120 days from the date of service of summons. it also further provides c/sca/11710/2018 judgment that on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file written statement and the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. proviso to order viii rule 10 cpc provides that no court shall make an order to extend the time provided under rule-1 of order viii for filing of the written statement. thus, taking on record the written statement beyond period of 120 days from the date of service of the summons is strictly barred/ prohibited and there is a mandate that the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record, if the same is submitted beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of the summons. it also further mandates that on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit his right to file written statement. there is a specific bar as per first proviso to rule 10 of order viii by which the court is strictly prohibited to extend the time provided under rule 1 of order viii cpc for filing the written statement. 13. in the present case, it is an admitted position that the written statement was submitted/presented beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons. therefore as such, considering the provisions of cpc referred to hereinabove, more particularly order v rule 1; order viii rule 1 and order viii rule 10, it cannot be said that the learned judge has committed any error in not taking on record the written statement filed by the defendant c/sca/11710/2018 judgment which as such was submitted beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of the summons. as observed hereinabove, even learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has also fairly conceded and/or admitted that the learned judge, commercial court by not taking on record the written statement which was submitted beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons is justified in his action. 13.1 however, shri kamal trivedi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has requested this court to exercise powers under article 226 to do substantial justice and in the facts and circumstances of the case when in the meantime, the defendant was trying to settle the dispute with the plaintiff and therefore did not file written statement in time and thereafter when the written statement was submitted, one hundred twenty days period has expired, and therefore, it is requested to exercise powers under article 226 and to direct the learned judge, commercial court to take on record the written statement and/or permit the petitioner herein-original defendant to place on record, the written statement. it is the case on behalf of the petitioner herein-original defendant that as such by not permitting the petitioner herein-original defendant to place on record the written statement, the necessary consequences of non filing of written statement shall follow which would be very drastic and would simultaneously cause undue hardship to c/sca/11710/2018 judgment the defendant. it is also the case on behalf of the petitioner that by the aforesaid proviso high court's powers under article 226 of the constitution are not taken away and still the high court can in exercise of power under article 226 of the constitution to do substantial justice can permit the defendant to place on record written statement. it is also the case on behalf of the petitioner that as such the aforesaid provision is procedural law, and therefore, the procedural law may not be construed very strictly and as such the procedure law cannot take away substantial right of a party to defend the suit/proceedings. 13.2 now so far as submission/request on behalf of the petitioner to exercise power under article 226 of the constitution and to permit the petitioner herein-original defendant to place on record the written statement to do substantial justice is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that as such there is no such prayer in the petition. the present petition is as such filed under article 227 of the constitution challenging the impugned order passed by the learned judge, commercial court, ahmedabad passed below application exh. 14 in commercial civil suit no. 328 of 2016 by which the learned judge has rejected the said application preferred by the petitioner-original defendant and has refused to take on record the written statement which as such was submitted/ presented beyond the period of 120 days of the c/sca/11710/2018 judgment service of summons there is no such prayer and/or averments made in the petition requesting to exercise power under article 226 of the constitution and to permit the defendant to place on record the written statement even in the cause title also the petition is described as the one preferred under article 227 of the constitution of india. even otherwise, as per the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of radhey shyam & anr. vs. chhabi nath & ors. [supra] and in the case of jogendrasinhji vijaysinghji v. state of gujarat & ors. [supra], the order passed by a civil court is only amendable to be scrutinized by the high court in exercise of powers under article 227 of the constitution only which is different from article 226 of the constitution. 14. in view of the aforesaid facts and even the law laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in the aforesaid two decisions, the submission on behalf of the petitioner to exercise power under article 226 of the constitution and to permit the petitioneroriginal defendant to place on record the written statement is not required to be accepted. 15. now so far as submission on behalf of the petitioner and the request to exercise powers under article 226 of the constitution and to permit the petitioner-original defendant to place on record the written statement beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of the summons to do substantial justice and the submission on behalf of c/sca/11710/2018 judgment the petitioner that as held by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of kailash v. nanhku & ors. [supra] and in the case of salem advocate bar association, t.n v. union of india [supra], the time limit provided in cpc is directory is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that the decisions of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of kailash v. nanhku & ors.[supra] and in the case of salem advocate bar association, t.n v. union of india [supra] relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner referred to hereinabove and which are relied upon in his submission that the time limit prescribed under the cpc to file written statement in a particular time limit is directory and not mandatory shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand more particularly while dealing with the amended provisions of cpc; more particularly order v rule 1; order viii rule 1 and order viii rule 10 cpc which as such are exclusively and specifically amended for commercial dispute to which commercial courts act, 2015 shall be applicable. the earlier language used in cpc providing the time limit for filing the written statement which fell for consideration before the apex court in the aforesaid two decisions are altogether different than that of the amended cpc, which is exclusively applicable to the commercial disputes. 16. as observed hereinabove, now as per second proviso to sub-rule [1] of order v and substituted c/sca/11710/2018 judgment proviso of rule 1 of order viii cpc, the written statement is required to be filed within a period of thirty days and the court can allow the defendant to file written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the court, for the reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the court deems fit, but which shall not be more than 120 days from the date of service of summons. it also further provides that on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file written statement and the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. as per proviso to sub-rule [10] of rule viii cpc, no court shall make an order to extend the time provided under rule 1 of order viii for filing of the written statement. thus, as such, the aforesaid provisions are not only mandatory in nature but it also provides for consequences of not filing the written statement within the time prescribed under the aforesaid provisions and there is a specific bar by the court not to extend the time provided under rule 1 of order viii for filing the written statement beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons. thus, in any case, no written statement can be permitted to be taken on record beyond the period of 120 days from the date of service of summons. no such provision fell for consideration before the apex court in the aforesaid two decisions. therefore, considering the aforesaid provisions as such, the commercial court is prohibited from taking written statement on c/sca/11710/2018 judgment record, if it is submitted beyond the period of 120 days. looking to the object and purpose of enactment of the commercial courts, commercial division & commercial appellate division of high courts act, 2015 and the special provisions/ mechanism for disposal of the commercial disputes, even granting of 120 days cannot be said to be unreasonable. in other words, not permitting the defendant to file written statement, if submitted beyond the period of 120 days from the date of submission of the summons cannot be said to be unreasonable. the object and purpose to provide such a time limit is required to be considered while considering the object and purpose of enactment of the commercial courts act, 2015 which is enacted for speedy disposal of the commercial disputes and which provides for special mechanism for speedy disposal of the commercial disputes. under the circumstances, the aforesaid decisions taking the view that time limit provided under the code of civil procedure to file written statement within a particular time limit is directory and not mandatory shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand, more particularly with respect to the aforesaid provisions viz., order v rule 1; order viii rule 1 and order viii rule 10 cpc which shall be applicable to the commercial disputes only. even the observations made by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of kailash v. nanhku [supra] that the rules of procedure are the handmaid of justice, the provisions of cpc or any other procedural c/sca/11710/2018 judgment enactment ought not to have been construed in a manner which shall leave the court helpless to meeting extraordinary situations in the ends of justice, also shall not be applicable while construing and/or considering the time limit prescribed under the amended provisions, more particularly order v rule 1; order viii rule 1 and order viii rule 10 cpc more particularly while considering the object and purpose for which the commercial courts act, 2015 has been enacted and the aforesaid provisions are made applicable only to the commercial disputes to which the commercial courts act, 2015 shall be applicable.\" the issue therefore should ordinarily rest here, without further ado. however, since further arguments were advanced before us citing certain judgments which may not have been cited before the court earlier and also looking to the importance of the issue, we would like to add a few words of our own. the said act of 2015 was enacted based on the recommendations of the law commission made in its 253rd report which envisaged constitution of the commercial courts at district level; constitution of commercial divisions in the high courts where ordinary civil jurisdiction exists and c/sca/11710/2018 judgment constitution of commercial appellate division to hear appeals against the orders of the commercial courts. the act envisages amendment in the cpc, as applicable to the commercial courts and commercial divisions, which would prevail over the existing high court rules and other provisions of the cpc \"so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases.\" the proposed law was aimed to accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the indian justice delivery system and the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation. with these objects, the act was enacted. the act envisages that the commercial disputes of specified value shall be dealt with by the commercial courts. appeals against the judgment of the commercial court would lie before the high court appellate commercial division. section 8 of the act of 2015 provides for a bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory order. it provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be entertained against any interlocutory order of a commercial court, including an order on the issue of jurisdiction and any such challenge; subject to c/sca/11710/2018 judgment the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against a decree of the commercial court. section 16 of the act of 2015 provides for amendment to the cpc in its application to commercial disputes and reads as under :\"16. amendments to the code of civil procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes [1] the provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 [5 of 1908] shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the schedule. [2] the commercial division and commercial court shall follow the provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 [5 of 1908], as amended by this act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value. [3] where any provision of any rule of the jurisdictional high court or any amendment to the code of civil procedure, 1908 [5 of 1908], by the state government is in conflict with the provisions of the code of civil procedure, 1908 [5 of 1908], as amended by this act, the provisions of the code of civil procedure as amended by this act shall prevail.\" as per this section, thus, the provisions of the cpc, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of specified value would stand amended in the manner specified in the schedule. as per sub-section [2] of section 16, the commercial divisions and commercial courts would c/sca/11710/2018 judgment follow the provisions of cpc; as amended by the act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value. sub-section [3] of section 16 further clarifies that in case of any conflict between any rule of the concerned high court or an amendment in the cpc by the state government, the provisions of the cpc; as amended by the act of 2015, shall prevail. section 16 thus makes it abundantly clear that in relation to a suit of specified value in respect of a commercial dispute, the cpc shall stand amended in the manner as specified in the schedule to the act of 2015. the schedule to the act of 2015 contains various amendments in the cpc. in the context of pleadings, disclosure, discovery and inspection of documents, etc. order 15a has been inserted, which pertains to the \"case management hearing\" which contains detailed provisions to ensure timely progress and speedy disposal of a commercial suit. with this bird's eye view, we may refer to the specific provisions contained in the schedule to the act of 2015 amending the cpc. as is well known, order viii cpc pertains to written statement, set off and counter claim. rule 1 thereof pertains to written statement. this rule was substituted by an c/sca/11710/2018 judgment act no. 22 of 2002 w.e.f 1st july 2002. in the current form, rule 1 of order viii cpc reads as under : \"1. written statement the defendant shall, within thirty days from the date of service of summons on him, present a written statement of his defence : provided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the same on such other day, as may be specified by the court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, but which shall not be later than ninety days from the date of service of summons.\" as per clause 4 [d] (i) of the schedule to the act of 2015, proviso to rule 1 of order viii cpc would be substituted as under : \"provided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of c/sca/11710/2018 judgment service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.\" order x rule 8 of cpc pertains to procedure when party fails to present written statement, and reads as under : \"10. procedure when party fails to present written statement called for by court where any party from whom a written statement is required under rule 1 or rule 9 fails to present the same within the time permitted or fixed by the court, as the case may be, the court shall pronounce judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit and on the pronouncement of such judgment, a decree shall be drawn up.\" by virtue of clause 4 [d] (iv), the following proviso is added to rule 10 : \"provided further that no court shall make an order to extend the time provided under rule 1 of this order for filing of the written statement.\" as noted, the act of 2015 has been enacted providing separate commercial courts and commercial divisions for c/sca/11710/2018 judgment dealing with commercial disputes of specified value in order to achieve timely disposal thereof. in furtherance of such objective, various provisions have been made in the act of 2015; including making some significant amendments in the cpc. we may recall, the cpc was amended extensively by the act of 2002 which included imposition of time limit for filing the written statement. as per the amended rule 1 of order viii, a defendant would have thirty days' time from the date of service of summons to present the written statement. as per the proviso, if the defendant failed to file written statement within such period, he would be allowed to file the written statement on some other day, as may be specified by the court, for the reasons to be recorded in writing, but which shall not be later than ninety days from the date of service of summons. this proviso thus envisages time of thirty days which could be further extended by ninety days for filing the written statement. this and several other provisions amending the cpc came up for consideration before the supreme court in the case of salem advocate bar association, tamil nadu v. union of india, reported in [2005] 6 scc 344, wherein, a c/sca/11710/2018 judgment three-judge bench of the apex court held that the use of word \"shall\" in rule 1 of order viii cpc by itself is not conclusive to determine whether the provision is mandatory or directory. a reference was made to rule 10 of order viii, which as noted, provides that where any party from whom a written statement is required under rule 1 or rule 9 fails to present the same within the time permitted or fixed by the court; as the case may be, the court shall pronounce the judgment against him or make such order in relation to the suit, as it thinks fit. the court was of the opinion that by virtue of the said proviso, on failure of the defendant to file written statement, the civil court had been given discretion either to pronounce the judgment against the defendant or make such order in relation to the suit, as it thinks fit. therefore, in the context of the proviso, despite use of the word \"shall\", the court has been given discretion either to pronounce or not to pronounce the judgment against the defendant, even if the written statement is not filed and instead pass such an order; as it thinks fit, in relation to the suit. consequently, the time limit envisaged in rule 1 of order viii cpc for filing the written statement was held to be directory and not mandatory in nature. the court c/sca/11710/2018 judgment concluded this issue as under : \"21. in construing this provision, support can also be had from order 8 rule 10 which provides that where any party from whom a written statement is required under rule 1 or rule 9, fails to present the same within the time permitted or fixed by the court, the court shall pronounce judgment against him,or make such other order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. on failure to file written statement under this provision, the court has been given the discretion either to pronounce judgment against the defendant or make such other order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. in the context of the provision, despite use the word \"shall\", the court has been given the discretion to pronounce or not to pronounce the judgment against the defendant even if the written statement is not filed and instead pass such order as it may think fit in relation to the suit. in construing the provision of order 8 rule 1 and rule 10, the doctrine of harmonious construction is required to be applied. the effect would be under rule 10 order 8, the court in its discretion would have the power to allow the defendant to file written statement even after expiry of the period of 90 days provided in order 8 rule 1. there is no restriction in order 8 rule 10 that after expiry of ninety days, further time cannot be granted. the court has wide power to \"make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit.\" clearly, therefore, the provision of order 8 rule 1 providing for the upper limit of 90 days to file written statement is directory. having said so, we wish to make it clear that the order extending time to file written statement cannot be made in routine. the time can be extended only in exceptionally hard cases. while extending time, it has to be borne in mind that the legislature has fixed the upper time limit of 90 days. the discretion of the court to extend the time shall not be so frequently and routinely exercised so as to nullify the period fixed by order 8 rule1.\" this view was reiterated by the supreme court in case of zolba vs. keshao & ors., reported in [2008] 11 scc 769 c/sca/11710/2018 judgment and in case of r.n jadi & brothers & ors. vs. subhash chandra, [2007] 6 scc 420, in which however, it was emphasized that filing the written statement within time envisaged would be a rule and departure therefrom an exception, made for satisfactory reasons only. thus, the supreme court in the case of salem advocate bar association, tamil nadu [supra] interpreted the existing provisions of rule 1 of order viii cpc as to laying down merely a discretionary time limit for filing the written statement, broadly with the aid of powers of the civil court under rule 10 of order viii cpc. in the present case, however, we are concerned with entirely different scheme of statutory provisions. significantly, the legislature was conscious of decision of the supreme court in case of salem advocate bar association [supra] and interpretative process adopted therein. in the context of time limit for filing written statement under schedule to the act of 2015, the legislature has therefore made two significant amendments in the cpc. firstly, the proviso to rule 1 of order viii is substituted. in the substituted form, this proviso provides that where the defendant fails to file the written statement c/sca/11710/2018 judgment within a period of thirty days, he would be allowed to file the written statement on such other day as may be specified by the court, for the reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such cost as the court deems fit, but which shall not be later than 120 days from the date of service of summons. the proviso further provides that on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit their right to file written statement and the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. simultaneously, the schedule also amends rule 10 of order viii cpc by inserting a proviso which; as noted above, provides further that no court shall make an order to extend the time limit provided under rule 1 of order viii cpc for filing the written statement. combined effect of these amendments is clear and precise. all the powers of a court dealing with the commercial disputes of a specified value for extending time for filing the written statement beyond the period of 120 days of service of summons are taken away. the language of the proviso to rule 1 of order viii cpc has been materially altered. in addition to providing for extension beyond 30 days [but not beyond 120 c/sca/11710/2018 judgment days from service of summons] on payment of cost; as may be specified by the court, two more significant changes have been made namely, that on expiry of 120 days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file written statement and that the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. in addition to providing with the maximum time permissible for filing written statement upto 120 days from the date of service of summons, these two additional elements inserted in the proviso to rule 1 make the legislative intent abundantly clear. there is no escape from the position that the legislature desired to put a ceiling on the maximum time that a court can grant to the defendant in a suit involving commercial dispute of a specified value to file the written statement. the legislature has mandated both in a positive as well as negative terms. positively, by providing that on completion of 120 days, the defendant shall forfeit their right to file the written statement and negative, by providing that the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record after such period. for good measure, the legislature has also amended rule 10 of order viii by providing that in exercise of such rule, no court c/sca/11710/2018 judgment shall make an order to extend the time for filing the written statement. this proviso is in the nature of an explanation, putting limitation on the powers of a court to make such an order in relation to the suit; as it thinks fit. by virtue of this proviso, such power would not include power to extend the time provided under rule 1 for filing the written statement. the golden rule of statutory interpretation is that the statute must be read in its plain grammatical manner and be applied accordingly. in the case of afcons infrastructure limited v/s. cherian varkey construction company private ltd., reported in 2010 (8) scc 24, it was observed that the principles of statutory interpretation are well settled. where the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, the provision must be given its plain and normal meaning, without adding or rejecting any words. departure from this literal rule, by making structural changes or substituting words in a clear statutory provision, under the guise of interpretation would pose a great risk, as the changes may not be what the legislature intended or desired. it was further observed that an exception to the general rule is where the words used in the statutory provision are vague and ambiguous or where the c/sca/11710/2018 judgment plain and normal meaning of the words or grammatical construction thereof would lead to confusion, absurdity, repugnancy with other provisions, the courts may use the interpretative tools to set right the situation. in the present case, we find the words used in the statute have no ambiguity or possibility of even two interpretations. we are conscious that the use of word 'shall' in a statute is not always conclusive of the legislative intention. often times, the courts have even in face of the use of such expression held a proviso to be directory instead of mandatory. however, in the present case, from all angles, the legislative intent which emerges is that the prescription of time limit for filing the written statement applicable to a commercial court is mandatory. such an interpretation would also be in consonance with the scheme of the act of 2015 and the objects for enactment of the said act. we may now refer to the judgments cited by learned counsel for the petitioner. in case of kalpesh r. jain [supra], the bombay high court was dealing with different situation. it was a case in which an appeal was filed before the commercial appellate court set up under the act of 2015. such appeal was filed c/sca/11710/2018 judgment beyond the period of limitation prescribed. the court held that applicability of section 5 of the limitation act, 1963 is not ruled out and delay can be condoned on sufficient ground being made out. the rajasthan high court in case of shri balaji industrial products ltd [supra] has not dealt with the question of powers of a commercial court to extend the time limit for filing written statement in face of amended provisions of rule 1 order viii cpc. this judgment therefore does not lay down any proposition contrary to what we have discussed. the learned judge of delhi high court in case of sunil alagh [supra] came to a conclusion that the service of summons on the defendant cannot be said to be complete unless complete paper book of the suit is supplied. in this context, it was held that period of 120 days for filing written statement will not commence, when the defendant has not been supplied complete paper book of the suit. the decisions of supreme court in relation to provisions of the consumer courts act, 1986 would throw no further light, since the statutory provisions are vastly different. c/sca/11710/2018 judgment in case of sejal glass limited [supra]; as noted, the supreme court allowed appeal of the plaintiff, setting aside the order passed by the courts below, rejecting the plaint under order vii rule 11 cpc and while doing so, additional time was granted to the defendant to file written statement. the court, however, stated that the question of law in so far as commercial courts act is concerned, had not been touched and was consequently kept open. this act of granting the defendants time of eight weeks for filing the written statement, can thus be seen as the court's exercising power under article 141 of the constitution. the contention of counsel for the petitioner that till the petitioner's application for rejection of plaint under rule 11 of order vii cpc is decided, the petitioner is not obliged to file the written statement, needs some comments. if the petitioner had filed such an application within 120 days of service of the summons, we would have further examined the petitioner's contention that as long as such application for rejection of plaint was pending, it was not necessary for the defendant to file the written statement and in a given case, a defendant may also take a stand that he was not obliged to present his full c/sca/11710/2018 judgment defence, till such application was decided by the court. however, in the present case, the defendant-petitioner bank before us presented application for rejection of the plaint under order vii rule 11 cpc simultaneously with an application for filing the written statement belatedly. both these events thus took place after the maximum time permissible for filing the written statement ie.. 120 days had expired. surely, the defendant cannot file application under order vii rule 11 cpc after time limit for filing the written statement has expired and then take a stand that till such application is decided, the defendant would have no obligation to file written statement and once such application is decided, and if decided against the defendant, he should be given additional time to file the written statement. for all these reasons, we do not find any error in the order of the commercial court, ahmedabad. petition is, therefore, dismissed. before closing, we may record that nothing stated in this order would prevent the petitioner from vigorously pursuing application for rejection of the plaint filed under order vii rule 11 which we are informed is still pending and which will c/sca/11710/2018 judgment be decided on its own merits, since in any case, we have not made any observations with respect to the same.
