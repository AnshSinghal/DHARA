SHAH) [1.0] Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order dated  08.08.2017 passed by the learned Judge, Commercial Court, City Civil  Court,   Ahmedabad   below   Exhs.6­7   in   Commercial   Trade   Mark   Suit  No.8/2017 by which the learned Commercial Court has partly allowed  the said applications - notice of motion and has granted the temporary  injunction   against   the   appellants   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   in  terms of para 38A of the application for interim injunction, the original  defendant No.1 has preferred the present Appeal From Order. \n[2.0] The facts leading to the present Appeal From Order in nut­shell  are as under: \n[2.1] That   the   respondent   herein   -   original   plaintiff   has   instituted  Commercial Trade Mark Suit No.8/2017 against the appellant herein -  original defendant in the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad for passing off,  seeking permanent injunction and relief of damages. That in the said suit  the   plaintiff   submitted  an  interim   injunction  application  -   took   out  a  Notice of Motion seeking interim injunction restraining the defendants,  their   agents,   partners,   proprietors,   servants   etc.   from   in   any   manner  using the impugned design including the shape, get­up, layout, which is  identical   with   or   colourably   /   deceptively   similar   to   the   plaintiff's  product   and   from   passing   off   their   goods   viz.   Maharaja   Whiteline  Blizzard 50 and Blizzard 50 DLX as also Blizzard 20 and Blizzard 20 DLX  as those of the plaintiff.\n[2.2] It is the case on behalf of the plaintiff so pleaded in the plaint that  earlier the plaintiff Company was incorporated in the name of Sanskrut  Comfort Systems Pvt. Ltd. which subsequently came to be converted into  a Public Limited Company by passing a special resolution and thereafter  the name of the company was changed from Sanskrut Comfort Systems  Pvt. Ltd. to Symphony Comfort Systems Ltd. It is the case on behalf of  the   plaintiff   Company   that   plaintiff   Company   is   in   the   business   of  marketing, selling, trading and exporting of a range of air coolers under  the name of \"SYMPHONY\" nationally and internationally for high quality  products   with   excellent   performance,   aesthetic   outlook   and   unique  design  wherein  in  the  year ending 2015­16, the total turnover of the  plaintiff exceeded approximately Rs.523.98 crores. 7. It was also averred  in the plaint that considering the worldwide business of the plaintif with  warehouses servicing almost all states, dealers, retailers and distributors  in almost all towns, cities and villages are established and on the basis of  the   well   orchestered   effort   at   constant   innovation   and   consistent  performance, the plaintiff company has been honoured with the award  by   the   Ministry   of   Commerce   and   Industry,   Government   of   India   by  granting a Certificate of Recognition as an Export House in 2009 which  came to be upgraded to a Star Export House. It was also averred that the  plaintiff   is   also   having   a   well­established   Research   &   Development  Division (RDD) comprising of highly qualified and experienced engineers  so as to develop better and more efficient products as well as unique and  eye catching designs for their air coolers and other consumer products.\n[2.3] It   was   further   averred   and   submitted   that   apart   from   various  models of air coolers sold by the plaintiff, the plaintiff is also selling the  \"Diet\" model which has a unique design. It was further averred that the  plaintiff   Company   and   the   Founder   /   M.D.   Shri   Achal   Bakeri   is   the  holder of the design registration certificate for the said designs of \"Diet\"  model   under   the   Designs   Act,   2000   whereby   the   Registrar   has   duly  registered the unique designs of various models for sole and exclusive  use of the proprietor and the models in question are \"Diet 50T\" which  has   been   registered   on   04.02.2009   under   Classification   23­04   (Air  Cooler) under Design Registration  No.221068;  that \"Diet 22T\" is also  registered on 05.02.2009 under Classification 23­04 (Air Cooler) under  Design   Registration   No.221084   \"Diet   8T\"   has   been   registered   on  29.01.2009   under   Classification   23­04   (Air   Cooler)   under   Design  Registration   No.220948.   It   is   further   averred   that   pursuant   to   the  Assignment Deed of Design, the same have been assigned in favour of  the plaintiff Company so as to enable the plaintiff Company to market  the said products under the registered designs. It was further averred  that the plaintiff Company has been selling and marketing the air coolers  in   different   shapes   and   models   and   in   order   to   make   the   air   coolers  attractive, eye catching, novel and impressionable to the customers, the  plaintiff developed a novel shape, configuration and pattern for the air  coolers   and   the   said   shape,   configuration,   ornament,   composition   of  lines and pattern have been registered as per the registration details. It  was further averred and the case on behalf of the plaintiff that as the  plaintiff came to know that the defendant No.1 is illegally and without  any   permission   or   authority   manufacturing,   selling   and   marketing   air  coolers   that   are   the   unauthorised   replicas   and   imitations   of   the   air  coolers of the plaintiff viz. \"Diet\" (variants 50T and 22T as also 50i and  22i),  through  its  respective  manufacturing  units  and  retail   outlet and  thereby  passing   off  its   goods   i.e.  air   coolers   viz.  \"Maharaja   Whiteline  Blizzard   50,   Maharaja   Whiteline   Blizzard   20\"   as   well   as   \"Maharaja  Whiteline Blizzard 50 DLX and Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard 20 DLX\",  stating and contending that the air coolers manufactured and marketed  by   defendant   No.1   are   so   strikingly   similar   to   the   air   coolers   of   the  plaintiff i.e. Diet 50T and Diet 22T as well as Diet 50i and Diet 22i which  may   entail   the   purchaser   /   consumer   to   believe   the   products   of  defendant No.1 to be the products of the plaintiff.\n[2.4] It was further averred in the plaint and it was submitted on behalf  of the plaintiff Company that defendant No.1 has recently launched the  aforesaid models as reflects from the model features in February 2017  catalogue and the defendant No.1 has been extensively advertising and  offering   for   sale   the   impugned   air   coolers   through   its   website  www.maharajawhiteline.com. Therefore, it was the case on behalf of the  plaintiff that since the plaintiff has established a unique and well­known  design which has acquired a secondary meaning by virtue of its use and  goodwill generated in the course of trade or business and therefore, the  same  can  be  considered as   \"Trade   Marks\"  under  the  Shape  of  Goods  category and the same is required to be protected by an action in the  nature of passing off as the overall visual impression which creates in the  minds of customers as to the source and origin of the goods is from the  shape/aesthetic appearance of the goods and consequently an unwary or  a gullible customer may easily get confused between the product of the  plaintiff   and   defendant   No.1   due   to   striking   similarity   in   its   shape,  pattern and overall get­up. Therefore, with above particular averments  and   contentions   the   plaintiff   has   instituted   the   suit   for   passing   off  damages, permanent injunction etc. As observed hereinabove in the said  suit   the   plaintiff   has   taken   out   the   Notice   of   Motion   vide   Exhs.6­7  restraining the defendants, their agents, servants etc. by way of interim  injunction   restraining   them   from   in   any   manner   using   the   impugned  design  including   the   shape,  get­up,  layout,   which   is   identical   with   or  colourably   /   deceptively   similar   to   the   plaintiff's   product   and   from  passing off their goods viz. Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard 50 and Blizzard  50 DLX as also Blizzard 20 and Blizzard 20 DLX as those of the plaintiff. \n[2.5] That on being served with the process the defendants appeared  before the learned Commercial Court. The original defendant No.1 filed  its   written   statement   and   reply   to   interim   injunction   application   vide  Exh.19. It was submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1 that the entire  suit and application for interim injunction suffers from suppression of  material  fact  which   disentitles   the  plaintiff   to  claim  any  discretionary  relief. It was also submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1 that the  plaintiff   has   miserably   failed   to   establish   similarities   between   its  products and the products of the defendant No.1 so as to maintain an  action of passing off.\n[2.6] It was further submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1 that the  defendant No.1 was earlier known as Maharaja Whiteline Industries Pvt.  Ltd., which was subsequently taken over by a Group SEB, France in the  year 2014 and accordingly wholly owned subsidiary of Group SEB which  is   one   of   world's   leading   small   domestic   appliances   company   having  global turnover of 5000 Million Euro (approximately Rs.35,000 crores)  in the year 2016 which launches more than 300 products and sell over  200   million   products   every   year   across   the   globe   with   operations  spreading out to 150 countries. It was further submitted on behalf of the  defendant   No.1   that   the   defendant   No.1   has   created   a   distinct   and  unmistakable   image   on   the   basis   of   its   innovative   products   in   home  appliance industries and is also having goodwill and reputation in the  market. It was further averred on behalf of the defendant No.1 that for  having the aesthetic look, new, novel and creative design to the products  in   question,   the   work   of   conceptualizing   and   developing   the   design,  shape, etc. as entrusted to a specialized design firm viz. \"Story Design\" \nand the responsibility for the design front panel and deco control panel  for   the   air   coolers  and   the  adoption  thereof   have   been   raised  by   the  defendant No.1. It was further submitted that the defendant No.1 has  incurred   considerable   expenditure   in   developing,   designing,  manufacturing,   selling   and   marketing   the   product   in   question.  It   was  submitted   that   therefore   the   defendant   No.1   cannot   be   said   to   have  merely   copied   /   imitated   the   design   of   the   plaintiff's   products   (Diet  Model in the case on hand). \n[2.7] It was further submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1 that even  prior to the filing of the suit, the plaintiff was aware of the shape as well  as design of the products in question developed by defendant No.1 way  back   in   January   2016   and   no   grievances   whatsoever   have   been  ventilated by the plaintiff against the defendant No.1 with regard to the  products in question. It was further submitted that even the Controller  General  of  Patent,   Design   and  Trademark  (Authority)   was   pleased   to  register the design developed by defendant No.1 under the Designs Act,  2000 and the certificate to that effect has been issued in favour of the  defendant No.1 which is nothing but a prima facie proof of the defendant  No.1's originality, uniqueness and distinctiveness and the very fact as to  the registration of defendant No.1's design has been suppressed by the  plaintif. It was further submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1 that  even   the   cancelation   proceedings   initiated   by   the   plaintiff   for  cancellation of the registered design of defendant No.1 under Section 19  of   the   Designs   Act,   2000   (vice   versa)   have   not   been   disclosed.   It   is  submitted that therefore, non­disclosure of the aforesaid fact amounts to  suppression   and   concealment   of   the   material   fact   and   therefore,   the  plaintiff is not entitled to the discretionary relief of interim injunction /  injunction.   In   context   of   the   case   of   the   plaintiff   as   to   the  misrepresentation   was   created   in   the   minds   of   the   purchasers   /  customers, it was submitted on behalf of the  original defendant  No.1  that the products in question are materially distinct from each other. It  was   submitted   that   there   is   no   true   comparison   of   the   competing  products. Relying upon the chart prepared by the defendant No.1 and  produced   with   the   list   appended   with   the   written   statement,   it   was  submitted   that   there   is   no   question   of   any   misrepresentation   by   the  defendant   No.1.   It   was   submitted   that   even   a   look   at   the   competing  products through an ordinary purchaser's eye would make it abundantly  clear that there is no chance of any confusion or deceit in the minds of  general   public   regarding   the   origin   of   the   product.   Referring   to   the  products in question and showing the patterns and the distinctiveness of  the products in question, it was submitted on behalf of the defendant  No.1 that there is no possibility of misrepresentation on the part of the  defendant No.1 as the defendant No.1 is selling its products in the brand  name and trade name \"MAHARAJA WHITELINE\" which is distinctively  visible on each of its products. It was submitted that the brand name is  otherwise   well­known   in   the   home   appliance   industry   and   having   a  distinct reputation and goodwill among the general public.\n[2.8] With   regard   to   the   issue   as   to   shape   and   configuration   of   the  products in question, it was submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1  that both the products in question are materially distinct and different  from each other as is evident from the height, width, length and overall  structure of the products and therefore the same rules out the possibility  of the defendant No.1 having indulged in passing off its goods as those  of   the   plaintiff.   Therefore,   it   was   requested   to   reject   the   interim  injunction application / Notice of Motion.\n[2.9] The   interim   injunction   application   was   also   opposed   by   the  original defendant No.2 by filing detailed reply at Exh.30. The defendant  No.2   supported   the   case   of   the   defendant   No.1   and   made   same  submissions which were made on behalf of the defendant No.1. \n[2.10] That thereafter by impugned order the learned Commercial  Court has partly allowed the Notice of Motion application Exhs.6­7 and  has   granted   the   temporary   injunction   in   terms   of   para   38A   of   the  application for interim injunction. Clause 38A of the Notice of Motion  Exhs.6­7   which   has   been   granted   by   the   learned   Judge   by  impugned  order as temporary injunction reads as under: \n\"38A. Pending the hearing and final disposal of the present  Civil Suit, THIS HON'BLE COURT be pleased to restrain each  of   the   Defendants   by   themselves,   its   Directors,   servants,  representatives,   agents,   stockists,   distributors,   retailers   etc.  from   in   any   manner   manufacturing,   marketing,   selling   or  advertising   for   sales   thereby   passing   of   the   goods   viz.  Maharaja   Whiteline   Blizzard   50   and   Maharaja   Whiteline  Blizzard   20   and   Maharaja   Whiteline   Blizzard   50   DLX   and  Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard 20 DLX;\"\nThat   while   allowing   the   Notice   of   Motion   and   granting   the  injunction in terms of Para 38(A) of the Notice of Motion, the learned  Judge has observed as under: \n\"1. That the plaintiff is not only a prior user, but the first who  introduced into the market a completely distinct shape which had  not been introduced earlier and it is this novelty that has been the  engine and cause for numerous sales and the popularity that the  plaintif has earned;\n2. That the plaintiff has created a good reputation nationally  and internationally;\n3. That the sales turnover of the plaintiff for the Diet Model for  the   year  2009   till  2016  is  Rs.73,197  lakh  in  total  and that  the  plaintiff has averred to have spent huge amount on promotion of  its   business   for   the   year   2014­15   by   spending   more   than  Rs.3134.23 lakh;\n4. That   the   Diet   model   in   question   appears   to   have   been  registered way back in the year 2009 and therefore, admittedly  the   plaintiff   seems   to   be   a   prior   user   with   the   goodwill   and  reputation with respect not only to the other products in question  but also with regard to the Diet Model in question;\n5. That   as   the   design   registration   of   the   plaintiff   and   the  novelty thereof rests and confined to the surface pattern of the  products  in question  and not to the shape and configuration as  submitted   by   the   defendant   No.1   cannot   be   a   sole   ground   to  deprive the plaintiff to subserve its legitimate right;\n6. That the defendant No.1 appears to have recently launched  the product in question in the market as per the invoices issued by  the   defendant   No.1   in   favour   of   the   defendant   No.2   dated  28.03.2017.  Even assumed to have launched its product in 2016,  then also the product so introduced by the plaintiff is of the year  2009;\n7. A comparison of both the products show a striking similarity  considering overall structure, phonetic similarity and idea thereto,  visual test of products in question.\"\nMaking   above   broad   findings   /   observations   the   learned  Commercial Court has granted the interim injunction in terms of para  38(A) of the Notice of Motion Exhs.6­7.\n[2.11] Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order  passed   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court,   below   Notice   of   Motion  Exhs.6­7, original defendant No.1 has preferred the present Appeal From  Order. \n[3.0] Shri   Shalin   Mehta,   learned   Senior   Advocate   has   appeared   on  behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1 and Shri Kamal  Trivedi,   learned   Senior   Advocate   has   appeared   on   behalf   of   the  respondent No.1 herein - original plaintiff. \n[4.0] Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant  herein - original defendant No.1 has vehemently submitted that in the  facts and circumstances of the case the learned Commercial Court has  materially erred in allowing the Notice of Motion Exh.6­7 and granting  the   temporary   injunction   against   the   appellant   herein   -   original  defendant No.1 in  terms  of  para 38(A)  of  the  application   for  interim  injunction. \n[4.1] It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Mehta,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1  that as such while granting interim injunction application, the learned  Commercial Court has not properly appreciated and considered the fact  that as such the plaintiff had not approached the Court with clean hands  and as such suppressed the material fact more particularly with respect  to the date of knowledge of the appellant herein - original defendant  No.1 in the market with its products in question viz. Maharaja Whiteline  Blizzard 50 and Blizzard 50 DLX as also Blizzard 20 and Blizzard 20  DLX.   It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Mehta,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1  that as such the plaintiff made a false statement in the plaint and interim  injunction application to the extent of its knowledge vis­a­vis shape and  configuration of the appellant's Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard series of air  coolers. It is submitted that the planitiff made a false statement that he  become   aware   of   the   shape   and   configuration   of   the   appellant's  Maharaja Blizzard series of air coolers in February 2017. It is submitted  that the learned Commercial Court has failed to appreciate that infact in  the cancelation petition filed by the original plaintiff against the original  defendant No.1's registered design No.269833, it was admitted by the  plaintiff about the knowledge of the appellant's products in question and  in the plaint misrepresented its date of knowledge with respect to the  said   products   as   February   2017.   It   is   submitted   that   therefore   the  learned Commercial Court ought to have rejected the interim injunction  application on the said ground alone as it is a settled proposition of law  that   a   party   who   conceals   and   suppress   facts   from   the   Court   is   not  entitled to any relief, much less any equitable relief. \n[4.2]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1 that even  otherwise the learned Commercial Court ought to have appreciated that  the delay in bringing an action of passing off also disentitles the plaintiff  from the equitable relief of injunction. \n[4.3]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1 that even  otherwise on merits also the learned Commercial Court has materially  erred in granting the interim injunction in terms of para 38(A) of the  interim injunction. \n[4.4]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1 that to be  successful in an action of passing off, the claimant has to establish classic  trinity i.e. (1) reputation and goodwill attached to the goods or services  that   the  claimant  supplies   -   goodwill   being   attached  to   the   badge   of  origin,   (ii)   misrepresentation   (whether   or   not   intentional)   by   the  defendant to the public leading or likely to lead public to believe that the  goods or services offered by the defendant are the goods or services of  the claimant and (iii) consquent damage to the goodwill of the claimant.  It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Mehta,   learned   Counsel   appearing   on  behalf   of   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that   it   is   a  settled principle of law that the absence of even one element of passing  off disentitles the claimant from any relief.   It is submitted that in the  present case the plaintiff has infact failed to establish any element of  passing off. It is submitted that therefore the plaintiff has no even prima  facie  case establishing any of the test of passing off and therefore, the  impugned   order   ought   not   to   have   been   passed   by   the   learned  Commercial Court. \n[4.5] It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that  the  learned Commercial Court has failed to appreciate that the plaintiff had  miserably failed to establish that the shape of its 'Diet 50T', 'Diet 22T',  'Diet 50i' and 'Diet 22i' air coolers has acquired distinctiveness  in the  minds of the relevant pubilc as being indicative of the source denoting  plaintiff's products and no one else. \n[4.6]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that   the  learned Commercial Court has failed to appreciate that the plaintiff has  miserably failed to even prima facie establish goodwill in the shape of its  'Diet 50T', 'Diet 22T', 'Diet 50i' and 'Diet 22i' air coolers much less that  the   said   that   the   said   shape   of   the   air   coolers   has   become   a   source  indicator of the plaintiff's products and no one else. \n[4.7]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that   the  learned Commercial Court has materially erred in observing and holding  that the plaintiff is a prior user of the shape of the air coolers - Diet  series air coolers. It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel  appearing on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1  that even the plaintiff has failed to establish and prove the goodwill in  their favour emanating from the shape of the 'Diet series' of air coolers in  India. It is submitted that whatever the documents of sale and goodwill  are   produced   are   that   of   foreign   countries   and   not   in   India.   It   is  submitted that therefore the finding recorded by the learned Commercial  Court   that   the   plaintiff   has  earned   the   goodwill  with   respect   to  'Diet  series' of air coolers and therefore, the learned Commercial Court has  materially erred in granting the injunction in favour of the plaintiff and  against the defendants. \n[4.8]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that   the  learned   Commercial   Court   has   erred   in   not   appreciating   that   the  registration   of   design   of   the   plaintiff   in   relation   to   its   air   coolers   is  admittedly in the \"surface pattern\", whereas, the registration of design of  the  defendant No.1  in  relation  to  its  air  coolers   is  in   the  \"shape   and  configuration\".   It   is   submitted   that   therefore   the   entire   action   of   the  plaintiff is completely misplaced and therefore, no injunction could have  been granted in favour of the plaintiff.\n[4.9]  It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that   the  learned  Commercial   Court   has   materially   erred   by   wrongly   placing  reliance   on   the   advertisements   placed   by   the   plaintiff   for   appointing  distributors and dealers in India. It is submitted that apart from the fact  that the said advertisement was not produced alongwith the plaint even  the   said   advertisements   are   with   respect   to   the   air   coolers   of   all   the  shapes,   dimensions   and   sizes.   It   is   submitted   that   therefore   these  advertisements would have no bearing on the mind of the purchasing  public qua the shape of the 'Diet series' of air coolers as being a source  indicated   by   the   plaintiff.   It   is   submitted   that   similarly   the   brochure  placed   on   record   by   the   plaintiff   contains   air   coolers   of   all   shapes,  dimensions and sizes and therefore, cannot be considered as indicative  of the goodwill of the shape of the 'Diet series' of air coolers.  It is further  submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the  appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   that   as   such   the   learned  Commercial   Court   has   materially   erred   in   equating   the   goodwill   and  reputation knowledge by the plaintiff with the goodwill and reputation  associated with the shape of 'Diet series' air coolers. It is submitted that  the   same  cannot be  equated or considered  on  the  same footing.  It is  further submitted that  as such the  learned Commercial Court has not  properly appreciated the distinction and difference between the goodwill  and reputation.  It is  submitted  that goodwill  and reputation  are both  distinct and separate. It is submitted that in a given case the plaintiff  might   have   got   the   reputation   but   may   not   have   acquired   /   got   the  goodwill with respect to particular goods with respect to the passing off  action. \n[4.10]   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Mehta,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1  that even otherwise the learned Commercial Court has materially erred  in   not   properly   appreciating   the   fact   that   the   there   can   be   no  misrepresentation or confusion in the mind of purchaser when they go to  purchase the  air coolers, as the  appellant herein - original defendant  No.1 is selling its products which are subject matter of the many order  under its own distinct trade mark / name \"Maharaja Whiteline\" and the  distinct name of the product \"Blizzard\" is also prominently displayed on  the product. It is submitted that trade mark / name which has been in  use   by   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   No.1   since   the   year  1976 and the defendant No.1 has an annual turnover of approximately  231 Crores for the year 2015­16 itself and therefore, the defendant No.1  is a well­known brand with a huge reputation and goodwill amongst the  public. It is submitted that thus when the appellant - original defendant  No.1's goodwill is itself immense, the likelihood of public confusing the  defendant No.1's good as those of the plaintiff or being associated with  the plaintiff is negligible. \n[4.11]   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Mehta,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the appellant herein - original defendant No.1  that even otherwise there can be no misrepresentation or confusion in  the  minds  of  the  purchasing  public  as  the  competing  products  of  the  defendant No.1 ­ \"Maharaja Whiteline\" the air coolers are visually and  aesthetically different. It is submitted that the impugned products of the  defendant   No.1   bear   no   resemblance   whatsoever   in   the   shape   and  configuration,   pattern,   ornamentation   or   overall   appearance   with   the  products of the plaintiff. It is submitted that in the present case despite  the   learned   Judge   observing   that   these   similarities   exist   between  competing products which are the subject matter of the present dispute,  the learned Commercial Court has wrongly concluded that the shape,  configuration and overall appearance of the products in question of the  defendant No.1 - Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard series of air coolers are  strikingly similar. It is submitted that considering the aforesaid facts and  circumstances,   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   wrongly   concluded  that   the   plaintiff   has   a  prima   facie  case,   the   balance   of   convenience  favours the plaintiff and that irreparable harm or injury would be caused  to the plaintiff if the appellant herein - original defendant No.1 is not  restrained by an order of injunction. \nMaking above submissions and relying upon following decisions, it  is requested to allow the  present appeal and quash and set aside  the  impugned order of interim injunction passed by the learned Commercial  Court. \n1.

John & another (2008) 152 DLT 405 Delhi High Court  [5.0] Present   appeal   is   vehemently   opposed   by   Shri   Kamal   Trivedi,  learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff. \n[5.1] Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the original  plaintiff has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of  the case the learned Commercial Court has rightly granted the interim  injunction   against   the   defendant   No.1   and   the   same   is   granted  considering the material on record and having  prima facie  observed in  favour   of   the   plaintiff   that   plaintiff   has   made   out   a   case   against   the  defendant with respect to passing off its \"Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard  50,   Maharaja   Whiteline   Blizzard   20\"   as   well   as   \"Maharaja   Whiteline  Blizzard 50 DLX and Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard 20 DLX\" air coolers in  question.   It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned  Counsel  appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such the plaintiff is  the pioneer in the business of coolers. It is submitted that the plaintiff  came out with a specially designed Tower Coolers in the year 2009 and  their products - Diet Series air coolers are in market since 2009 which  looking to its special design and shape has acquired a unique identity in  the market in the field of air coolers.   \n[5.2] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   original   plaintiff   that   as   such   the   plaintiff   has   been  successful in establishing and proving all the three conditions required  for the purpose of getting the injunction with respect to passing off its  goods, 1) prior user; 2) having acquired goodwill and reputation. It is  submitted   that   therefore   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   rightly  granted the injunction. \n[5.3] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such goodwill signifies the value  of business in terms of turnover. It is submitted that reputation follows  the goodwill. It is submitted that the plaintiff has both, goodwill and also  reputation   and   therefore,   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   rightly  granted the injunction against the defendant No.1 with respect to the  products in question. \n[5.4] Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the original  plaintiff has taken us to findings recorded by the learned Commercial  Court on prior user, on the plaintiff's acqiuring goodwill and reputation  and also the goodwill with respect to their Diet Series air coolers more  particularly with respect to the shape - unique shape and tower coolers  and   the   relevant   documents   /   material   on   record   which   should   have  been considered by the learned Commercial Court. \n[5.5] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such the suit is for passing off  action and the injunction is against the defendants for passing off their  goods  in  question.  It is  submitted  that  while  considering  the  case  for  passing off only, as per catena of decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court  as well as this Court only the particular similarities are to be looked at  and the microscopic dissimilarities are not required to be considered. It  is submitted that by and large overall similarities are to be considered. It  is   submitted   that   on   considering   both   the   products   in   question   the  learned Commercial Court has specifically given a finding that both the  products - products in question of the plaintiff as well as products in  question   of   the   defendant   No.1   are   by   and   large   having   overall  similarities. It is submitted that therefore when there are by and large  overall similarities there are all chances of confusion amongst the people  purchasing air coolers and therefore, the learned Commercial Court has  rightly granted the injunction. \n[5.6] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such there are no suppression of  material facts more particularly with respect to the date of knowledge of  goods   in   question   of   the   defendant   No.1   as   alleged   on   behalf   of   the  defendant   No.1.   For   the   aforesaid   he   has   taken   us   to   the   relevant  documents / material on record namely cancelation petition as well as  the averments in the plaint as well as the rejoinder before the learned  Commercial Court on the allegation of suppression. It is submitted that  therefore it can be said that defendant No.1 is not right in submitting  that   the   plaintiff   is   not   entitled   for   grant   of   relief   on   the   ground   of  suppression of material facts. It is submitted that as such the design of  the air coolers by the defendant No.1 was converted into Blizzard model  only in the month of February 2017. It is submitted that even otherwise  it makes no difference whether the defendant No.1 is in market since  2016 and/or in 2017 as such the plaintiff is in the market of selling the  Diet series air coolers since 2009. It is submitted that as such in the year  2009 the defendant No.1 was not even born. \n[5.7] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on   behalf   of   the   original   plaintiff   that   as   such   the   plaintiff   has   been  successful   in  proving  prima   facie  at   this   stage   their   goodwill   and  repuation and even with respect to the Diet coolers. \n[5.8] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the original planitiff that while considering the action for  passing off and grant of injunction on the allegation of passing off, mere  representation is enough and the intention is not required to be proved. \n[5.9] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Counsel appearing  on behalf of the original plaintiff that as such the defendant No.1 has not  explained why the defendant No.1 has chosen the tower wall design of  the air cooler and why not other shape. It is submitted that they should  have   adopted   other   shape.   It   is   submitted   that   aforesaid   shows   the  intention on the part of the defendant No.1 in passing off of their goods  deceptively with that of the plaintiff's goods. \n[5.10] It is further submitted that in case of passing off and grant  of injunction likelihood of damages itself is sufficient. It is submitted that  mere likelihood is more than sufficient while granting the injunction. \n[5.11] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Trivedi,   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that the findings recorded by  the   learned   Commercial   Court   while   granting   injunction   more  particularly   the   findings   recorded   in   para   81   onwards   are   on  appreciation of evidence / material on record which are neither perverse  nor   contrary   to   the   evidence   on   record   and   therefore,   the   impugned  order of grant of injunction is not required to be interfered with by this  Court. \nMaking   above   submissions   and   relying   upon   the   following  decisions, it is requested to dismiss the present appeal.\n1.

Ltd. 2008 (3) GLR 2635 (Para 29) [6.0] Heard learned Counsel appearing for respective parties at length. \nAt the outset it is required to be noted that by the impugned order  the learned Commercial Court, City Civil Court, Ahmedabad has partly  allowed   the   Notice   of   Motion   Exhs.6­7   and   has   granted   the   interim  injunction  in  favour of the  original plaintiff  restraining  the  appellants  herein - original defendants by themselves, its Directors, servants etc.  from in any manner using the impugned design including the shape, get­ up, layout, which is identical with or colourably / deceptively similar to  the   plaintiff's  product and from  passing  off their  goods  viz. Maharaja  Whiteline   Blizzard   50,   Maharaja   Whiteline   Blizzard   20,   Maharaja  Blizzard 50DLX and Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard 20 DLX which being a  similar   design   -   tower   design   specially   created   and   designed   by   the  plaintiffs which is deceptively similar to that of plaintiff's product - air  coolers ­ \"Diet\" models. The plaintiffs have instituted the suit against the  defendants for passing off action alleging passing off their products -  produce designs, configurations, including \"Diet\" models, designs etc. of  the plaintiffs.  \n[6.1] Having   found  prima   facie  case   and   balance   of   convenience   etc.  and having found prima facie case that the air­coolers manufactured and  being   sold   by   the   defendants   ­     Maharaja   Whiteline   Blizzard   50,  Maharaja Whiteline Blizzard 20, Maharaja Blizzard 50DLX and Maharaja  Whiteline Blizzard 20 DLX are deceptively similar to that of the design /  tower  models -  Diet  models  designed, manufactured and sold by the  plaintiffs, by impugned order the learned Commercial Court has granted  the injunction against the defendants. \n[6.2] That while considering the impugned order the findings recorded  by   the   learned   Commercial   Court   are   required   to   be   referred   to   and  considered, which are as under: \n(1) That the plaintiff company is in the business of marketing,  selling, trading and exporting a range of air coolers and pioneer in  establishing   or   marketing   or   producing   or   manufacturing   the  plastic body air coolers;\n(2) That   the   definition   of   \"mark\"   under   section   2(z)   of   the  Trade Marks Act include shape of goods;\n(3) That   the   plaintiff   is   operating   under   the   trade   name   of  \"Symphony\"   and   the   company's   total   turn   over  exceeded  approximately Rs.523.98 crores;\n(4) That the plaintiffs, its Directors got design of the questioned  product registered under the provisions of the Design Act, 2000; (5) That the plaintiff is pioneer in manufacturing of air­coolers  etc. and the plaintiff has been given ISO certification;\n       (6)      That design of each model has been registered;\n       (7)      That the defendant has got the design of the air­cooler in \nquestion registered in the year 2015, whereas the plaintiff have  got registration of the design in the year 2009 and since then the  plaintiff   has   been   selling   and   manufacturing   and   exporting   the  products in question;\n(8) That the plaintiff is prior user and the first who introduced  into the market a completely distinct shape which has not been  introduced earlier;\n(9) That   the  plaintiff  had  received   an   award   being  a  Quality  Marks Award - 2014 for his \"Diet\" model 22T and thereby has  created good reputation nationally and internationally.\n[6.3] It   is   also   further   observed   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court   in  paras 99 to 103 as under: \n\"99. It is pertinent to note here that since the issue on hand is  for   consideration   of   action   of   passing   of   and   therefore   the  said action can be said to be a recurring action and based on  Common Law rights. However, the entire issue rests on the  overall   shape,   configuration,   get­up   and   appearance   of   the  products   in   question   and   the   possibility   of   deceit   and  confusion   in   the   minds   of   purchasers.   Thus,   admittedly  considering the  issue on hand which pertains to passing of  action, the plaintif is required to prove that the plaintif is a  prior user, adopter, prior registered proprietor of the design  in question who admittedly appears to have sold the products  in   question   in   the   market   and   its   sales   turnover   runs   into  crores of rupees and sales promotional expenses also in lacs  of   rupees   whereas   the   defendant   No.1   though   appears   to  have been 60 engaged in the manufacturing and selling the  products   of   home   appliances,   however   considering   the  products   in   question   -   disputed   products,   the   defendants  appear to have launched the products as acquainted by the  plaintif since September 2016 (or January 2016). Thus, the  defendants, so far as the products in question are concerned,  seems to be new comer who appears to harp over and to take  the   advantage   of   the   reputation   and   association   of   the  plaintif's products which amounts to an act of passing of. \nCOMPARISON OF BOTH THE PRODUCTS VISUALLY: \n100.   To   meet   with   the   issue   as   raised   by   the   defendants  pertains   to   the   products   in   question   manufactured   and  developed by the defendant No.1, a completely distinct, both  visually and aesthetically from that of the plaintif and no case  for any confusion, much less deceit and also on account of  the shape, configuration on the ground that the product of  the plaintif have attained a secondary meaning and pattern of  the   product   and   resemblance   thereof   with   the   shape,  configuration, pattern of the plaintif's products and the issue  as   to   the   product,   if   placed   side   by   side   as   well   as   on  independent comparison of both the products, it cannot be  said that the product of the defendant No.1 is leading and/or  likely to lead general public to believe that the goods ofered  by defendant No.1 are of the plaintif. 61 Thus, the aforesaid  issues  in  the  form  of  submissions,  are required to be dealt  with   in   compass   of   the   entire   material   placed   for  consideration on record. \n101. It is not in dispute that the whole case of the plaintif  rests   on   the   shape,   configuration,   pattern,   etc.   as   to   the  product in question as disputed by the defendant No.1. At the  outset,   it   is   to   state   that   at   the   joint   request   made   by   the  learned Senior Advocates appearing for the respective parties  seeking   permission   to   produce   their   respective   products  before the Court vide Exh.27 and therefore this Court while  conceding the request, has had an occasion to see both the  products  in question  which  were brought before this  Court  during   the   course   of   hearing   and   therefore   the   question  whether the two are deceptively similar or not, the test, as  held by several High Courts is, what appeals to the eye of the  Judge   on   the   first   impression   and   therefore,   the   first  impression  has  to be  of  a  person with   average  intelligence  and/or imperfect recollection. \n102. Even during the course of hearing, the learned Senior  Advocate   appearing   for   the   defendant   No.1   has   tried   to  distinguish and show the dissimilarities between the products  in question while referring the front view, rear view, upper  view and lower view. However, the said test is to be applied  and pertains to the infringement of the design under Section  22 of the Designs Act, 2000 which at the most may fall under  the category and issue of 62 fraudulent or obvious imitation  thereof   which   amounts   to   an   act   of   piracy   and/or  infringement. Therefore, this  Court in  the  preamble of  this  order has made it categorically clear that several contentions  raised   by   the   learned   Senior   Advocates   appearing   for   the  respective parties which pertains to the infringement of the  design would not be entertained as the entire gamut of the  case on hand is dispute as to passing of which only rests on  the   shape,   configuration   and   overall   appearance   of   the  products in question. In nutshell, a comparison of both the  products show a striking similarity, however eforts seems to  have been made by the learned Senior Advocate appearing  for   the   defendant   No.1   to   show   dissimilarities,   but  considering   the   test   requires   to   be   adopted   is   to   see   the  salient features, overall similarity, is the touch­stone, mark or  product   must   be   viewed   by   observing   overall   structure,  phonetic similarity and idea thereto, visual test of products in  question. In short mark must be compared as a whole instead  of microscopic examination as the products are placed side by  side   only   to   find   out   diference   as   overall   similarity   as  appearing in case on hand, is sufficient. \n103. Apart from the goodwill and turnover of the products in  question   and   in   furtherance   thereof   as   to   the   substantial  goodwill and reputation inheres in the plaintif's products in  question which seems to have been launched way back in the  year 2009 and the 63 very fact has not been disputed by the  defendants.   Not   only   that,   at   the   relevant   time,   no   other  product   as   launched   by   the   plaintif   and   with   the   similar  comparable shape/appearance existed in the market prior to  the introduction thereof by the plaintif. Thus, the product in  question   so   launched   by   the   plaintif   at   the   relevant   time  acquired   a   distinctive   shape   and/or   get­up   and/or   colour  scheme and/or overall appearance (surface pattern) cannot  be disputed.\" \nIt is further observed in paras 105 to 107 as under: \n\"105. In furtherance of the aforesaid aspect, even the product  in   question   introduced   by   the   plaintif   at   the   relevant   time  wherein prior thereto, no such product or similar thereof or  comparable   shape   and   overall   appeals   existed   and   the  gestures   of   the   plaintif   while   launching   such   product  completely amounts to a revolutionary and of distinct shape  which   had   not   been   introduced   earlier   and   therefore,   the  same   can   be   termed   as   a   novelty   itself   of   the   product   in  question which generated a huge sale and popularity. \n106.   Though   the   eforts   seems   to   have   been   made   by   the  defendant   No.1   by   placing   forward   the   ground   as   to   the  product in question being commonly known / design having  overall similar appearance as that of the impugned design of  the   plaintif   having   been   so   granted   in   favour   of   Lesko  Holdings by the USPTO in 2006. However, while perusing the  material in support of its contention, it prima facie appears  that   the   said   image,   the   xerox   copy   of   which   has   been  produced by the defendant No.1, is a body for a vertical fan  whereas the impugned product in question is an air cooler. \n107.   Not   only   that,   the   overall   appearance   of   the   said  product, comparing with the impugned product, stands on a  diferent footing. Thus, the protest so lodged by the defendant  No.1 while placing forward the aforesaid product to disentitle  the claim of the plaintif with regard to the impugned product,  would   not   come   to   the   rescue   of   the   contention   of   the  defendant   No.1   as   the   defendant   No.1   seems   to   have  launched its product admittedly in January 2016 whereas the  product of the plaintif in question, as discussed hereinabove,  was launched in 2009 and at that time, no other product with  the similar or comparable shape and/or overall appearance  existed in the market prior to the introduction thereof by the  plaintif and the very existence amounts to goodwill and/or  reputation   in   the   shape   and/or   overall   appearance   of   the  product in question.\"\n[6.4] Considering   the   findings   recorded   which   are  prima   facie  on  appreciation   of   evidence   /   material   on   record   and   thereafter   having  opined   /   observed   that   the   case   for   passing   off   is   made   out   and  thereafter   the   learned   Commercial   Judge   has   granted   the   interim  injunction as prayed for in terms of para 38A, we are of the opinion that  it cannot be said that the learned Judge has committed any error. The  findings recorded by the learned Commercial Court are on appreciation  of evidence and having found  prima facie  case, balance of convenience  etc. Once having found the deceptive similarity between the products in  question of the plaintiffs and the products in question of the defendants  and having found that the plaintiffs introduced the design first time of a  tower model - Diet model which had earned a reputation, goodwill etc.  and the plaintiff is in prior use of the said design / models and having  given   the   aforesaid   findings,   we   are   of   the   opinion   that   the   case   of  passing off has been made out and therefore, the learned Commercial  Court has rightly granted the injunction referred to hereinabove. \n[6.5] Number   of   decisions   have   been   cited   by   the   learned   Counsel  appearing on behalf of the respective parties referred to hereinabove.  However, all the decisions are required to be considered in the facts and  circumstances   of   the   case   and   a  prima   facie  case   being   made   out,  considering the principles to be considered while granting the case of  passing off. Therefore, we are of the opinion that though we agree with  the proposition of law laid down in the cited decisions relied upon by  the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, same shall not  be applicable to the facts of the case on hand more particularly with  respect   to   the   findings   arrived   at   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court  referred to hereinabove. \n[6.6] We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned  Commercial Court. No interference of this Court is called for against the  impugned interim injunction granted by the learned Commercial Court. \n[7.0] In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, we see no  reason   to   interfere   with   the   impugned   order   passed   by   the   learned  Commercial Court. Under the circumstances, present Appeal From Order  deserves to be dismissed and is, accordingly, dismissed. \nBeing a commercial dispute arising out of the Commercial Courts  Act,   the   learned   Judge,   Commercial   Court   is   directed   to   decide   and  dispose   of   the   suit   at   the   earliest.   All   concerned   are   directed   to  cooperate  the   learned   Commercial   Court  in   early  disposal   of  the   suit  being a commercial dispute. It is observed that findings recorded by the  learned Commercial Court and confirmed by this Court are to be treated  and considered as  prima facie  while deciding applications Exh.6­7 and  the   learned   Commercial   Court   to   decide   and   dispose   of   the   suit   in  accordance with law and on its own merits. \nWith this, present Appeal from Order stands dismissed. \nCIVIL APPLICATION NO.1 OF 2017 In   view   of   dismissal   of   main   Appeal   from   Order,   present   Civil  Application also stands dismissed. \nSd/­          (M.R.

[2.0] the facts leading to the present appeal from order in nut­shell are as under: [2.1] that the respondent herein original plaintiff has instituted commercial trade mark suit no.8/2017 against the appellant herein original defendant in the commercial court, ahmedabad for passing off, seeking permanent injunction and relief of damages. that in the said suit the plaintiff submitted an interim injunction application took out a notice of motion seeking interim injunction restraining the defendants, their agents, partners, proprietors, servants etc. from in any manner using the impugned design including the shape, get­up, layout, which is identical with or colourably / deceptively similar to the plaintiff's product and from passing off their goods viz. maharaja whiteline blizzard 50 and blizzard 50 dlx as also blizzard 20 and blizzard 20 dlx as those of the plaintiff. [2.2] it is the case on behalf of the plaintiff so pleaded in the plaint that earlier the plaintiff company was incorporated in the name of sanskrut comfort systems pvt. ltd. which subsequently came to be converted into a public limited company by passing a special resolution and thereafter the name of the company was changed from sanskrut comfort systems pvt. ltd. to symphony comfort systems ltd. it is the case on behalf of the plaintiff company that plaintiff company is in the business of marketing, selling, trading and exporting of a range of air coolers under the name of \"symphony\" nationally and internationally for high quality products with excellent performance, aesthetic outlook and unique design wherein in the year ending 2015­16, the total turnover of the plaintiff exceeded approximately rs.523.98 crores. 7. it was also averred in the plaint that considering the worldwide business of the plaintif with warehouses servicing almost all states, dealers, retailers and distributors in almost all towns, cities and villages are established and on the basis of the well orchestered effort at constant innovation and consistent performance, the plaintiff company has been honoured with the award by the ministry of commerce and industry, government of india by granting a certificate of recognition as an export house in 2009 which came to be upgraded to a star export house. it was also averred that the plaintiff is also having a well­established research & development division (rdd) comprising of highly qualified and experienced engineers so as to develop better and more efficient products as well as unique and eye catching designs for their air coolers and other consumer products. [2.3] it was further averred and submitted that apart from various models of air coolers sold by the plaintiff, the plaintiff is also selling the \"diet\" model which has a unique design. it was further averred that the plaintiff company and the founder / m.d. shri achal bakeri is the holder of the design registration certificate for the said designs of \"diet\" model under the designs act, 2000 whereby the registrar has duly registered the unique designs of various models for sole and exclusive use of the proprietor and the models in question are \"diet 50t\" which has been registered on 04.02.2009 under classification 23­04 (air cooler) under design registration no.221068; that \"diet 22t\" is also registered on 05.02.2009 under classification 23­04 (air cooler) under design registration no.221084 \"diet 8t\" has been registered on 29.01.2009 under classification 23­04 (air cooler) under design registration no.220948. it is further averred that pursuant to the assignment deed of design, the same have been assigned in favour of the plaintiff company so as to enable the plaintiff company to market the said products under the registered designs. it was further averred that the plaintiff company has been selling and marketing the air coolers in different shapes and models and in order to make the air coolers attractive, eye catching, novel and impressionable to the customers, the plaintiff developed a novel shape, configuration and pattern for the air coolers and the said shape, configuration, ornament, composition of lines and pattern have been registered as per the registration details. it was further averred and the case on behalf of the plaintiff that as the plaintiff came to know that the defendant no.1 is illegally and without any permission or authority manufacturing, selling and marketing air coolers that are the unauthorised replicas and imitations of the air coolers of the plaintiff viz. \"diet\" (variants 50t and 22t as also 50i and 22i), through its respective manufacturing units and retail outlet and thereby passing off its goods i.e. air coolers viz. \"maharaja whiteline blizzard 50, maharaja whiteline blizzard 20\" as well as \"maharaja whiteline blizzard 50 dlx and maharaja whiteline blizzard 20 dlx\", stating and contending that the air coolers manufactured and marketed by defendant no.1 are so strikingly similar to the air coolers of the plaintiff i.e. diet 50t and diet 22t as well as diet 50i and diet 22i which may entail the purchaser / consumer to believe the products of defendant no.1 to be the products of the plaintiff. [2.4] it was further averred in the plaint and it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff company that defendant no.1 has recently launched the aforesaid models as reflects from the model features in february 2017 catalogue and the defendant no.1 has been extensively advertising and offering for sale the impugned air coolers through its website www.maharajawhiteline.com. therefore, it was the case on behalf of the plaintiff that since the plaintiff has established a unique and well­known design which has acquired a secondary meaning by virtue of its use and goodwill generated in the course of trade or business and therefore, the same can be considered as \"trade marks\" under the shape of goods category and the same is required to be protected by an action in the nature of passing off as the overall visual impression which creates in the minds of customers as to the source and origin of the goods is from the shape/aesthetic appearance of the goods and consequently an unwary or a gullible customer may easily get confused between the product of the plaintiff and defendant no.1 due to striking similarity in its shape, pattern and overall get­up. therefore, with above particular averments and contentions the plaintiff has instituted the suit for passing off damages, permanent injunction etc. as observed hereinabove in the said suit the plaintiff has taken out the notice of motion vide exhs.6­7 restraining the defendants, their agents, servants etc. by way of interim injunction restraining them from in any manner using the impugned design including the shape, get­up, layout, which is identical with or colourably / deceptively similar to the plaintiff's product and from passing off their goods viz. maharaja whiteline blizzard 50 and blizzard 50 dlx as also blizzard 20 and blizzard 20 dlx as those of the plaintiff. [2.5] that on being served with the process the defendants appeared before the learned commercial court. the original defendant no.1 filed its written statement and reply to interim injunction application vide exh.19. it was submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that the entire suit and application for interim injunction suffers from suppression of material fact which disentitles the plaintiff to claim any discretionary relief. it was also submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that the plaintiff has miserably failed to establish similarities between its products and the products of the defendant no.1 so as to maintain an action of passing off. [2.6] it was further submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that the defendant no.1 was earlier known as maharaja whiteline industries pvt. ltd., which was subsequently taken over by a group seb, france in the year 2014 and accordingly wholly owned subsidiary of group seb which is one of world's leading small domestic appliances company having global turnover of 5000 million euro (approximately rs.35,000 crores) in the year 2016 which launches more than 300 products and sell over 200 million products every year across the globe with operations spreading out to 150 countries. it was further submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that the defendant no.1 has created a distinct and unmistakable image on the basis of its innovative products in home appliance industries and is also having goodwill and reputation in the market. it was further averred on behalf of the defendant no.1 that for having the aesthetic look, new, novel and creative design to the products in question, the work of conceptualizing and developing the design, shape, etc. as entrusted to a specialized design firm viz. \"story design\" and the responsibility for the design front panel and deco control panel for the air coolers and the adoption thereof have been raised by the defendant no.1. it was further submitted that the defendant no.1 has incurred considerable expenditure in developing, designing, manufacturing, selling and marketing the product in question. it was submitted that therefore the defendant no.1 cannot be said to have merely copied / imitated the design of the plaintiff's products (diet model in the case on hand). [2.7] it was further submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that even prior to the filing of the suit, the plaintiff was aware of the shape as well as design of the products in question developed by defendant no.1 way back in january 2016 and no grievances whatsoever have been ventilated by the plaintiff against the defendant no.1 with regard to the products in question. it was further submitted that even the controller general of patent, design and trademark (authority) was pleased to register the design developed by defendant no.1 under the designs act, 2000 and the certificate to that effect has been issued in favour of the defendant no.1 which is nothing but a prima facie proof of the defendant no.1's originality, uniqueness and distinctiveness and the very fact as to the registration of defendant no.1's design has been suppressed by the plaintif. it was further submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that even the cancelation proceedings initiated by the plaintiff for cancellation of the registered design of defendant no.1 under section 19 of the designs act, 2000 (vice versa) have not been disclosed. it is submitted that therefore, non­disclosure of the aforesaid fact amounts to suppression and concealment of the material fact and therefore, the plaintiff is not entitled to the discretionary relief of interim injunction / injunction. in context of the case of the plaintiff as to the misrepresentation was created in the minds of the purchasers / customers, it was submitted on behalf of the original defendant no.1 that the products in question are materially distinct from each other. it was submitted that there is no true comparison of the competing products. relying upon the chart prepared by the defendant no.1 and produced with the list appended with the written statement, it was submitted that there is no question of any misrepresentation by the defendant no.1. it was submitted that even a look at the competing products through an ordinary purchaser's eye would make it abundantly clear that there is no chance of any confusion or deceit in the minds of general public regarding the origin of the product. referring to the products in question and showing the patterns and the distinctiveness of the products in question, it was submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that there is no possibility of misrepresentation on the part of the defendant no.1 as the defendant no.1 is selling its products in the brand name and trade name \"maharaja whiteline\" which is distinctively visible on each of its products. it was submitted that the brand name is otherwise well­known in the home appliance industry and having a distinct reputation and goodwill among the general public. [2.8] with regard to the issue as to shape and configuration of the products in question, it was submitted on behalf of the defendant no.1 that both the products in question are materially distinct and different from each other as is evident from the height, width, length and overall structure of the products and therefore the same rules out the possibility of the defendant no.1 having indulged in passing off its goods as those of the plaintiff. therefore, it was requested to reject the interim injunction application / notice of motion. [2.9] the interim injunction application was also opposed by the original defendant no.2 by filing detailed reply at exh.30. the defendant no.2 supported the case of the defendant no.1 and made same submissions which were made on behalf of the defendant no.1. [2.10] that thereafter by impugned order the learned commercial court has partly allowed the notice of motion application exhs.6­7 and has granted the temporary injunction in terms of para 38a of the application for interim injunction. clause 38a of the notice of motion exhs.6­7 which has been granted by the learned judge by impugned order as temporary injunction reads as under: \"38a. pending the hearing and final disposal of the present civil suit, this hon'ble court be pleased to restrain each of the defendants by themselves, its directors, servants, representatives, agents, stockists, distributors, retailers etc. from in any manner manufacturing, marketing, selling or advertising for sales thereby passing of the goods viz. maharaja whiteline blizzard 50 and maharaja whiteline blizzard 20 and maharaja whiteline blizzard 50 dlx and maharaja whiteline blizzard 20 dlx;\" that while allowing the notice of motion and granting the injunction in terms of para 38(a) of the notice of motion, the learned judge has observed as under: \"1. that the plaintiff is not only a prior user, but the first who introduced into the market a completely distinct shape which had not been introduced earlier and it is this novelty that has been the engine and cause for numerous sales and the popularity that the plaintif has earned; 2. that the plaintiff has created a good reputation nationally and internationally; 3. that the sales turnover of the plaintiff for the diet model for the year 2009 till 2016 is rs.73,197 lakh in total and that the plaintiff has averred to have spent huge amount on promotion of its business for the year 2014­15 by spending more than rs.3134.23 lakh; 4. that the diet model in question appears to have been registered way back in the year 2009 and therefore, admittedly the plaintiff seems to be a prior user with the goodwill and reputation with respect not only to the other products in question but also with regard to the diet model in question; 5. that as the design registration of the plaintiff and the novelty thereof rests and confined to the surface pattern of the products in question and not to the shape and configuration as submitted by the defendant no.1 cannot be a sole ground to deprive the plaintiff to subserve its legitimate right; 6. that the defendant no.1 appears to have recently launched the product in question in the market as per the invoices issued by the defendant no.1 in favour of the defendant no.2 dated 28.03.2017. even assumed to have launched its product in 2016, then also the product so introduced by the plaintiff is of the year 2009; 7. a comparison of both the products show a striking similarity considering overall structure, phonetic similarity and idea thereto, visual test of products in question.\" making above broad findings / observations the learned commercial court has granted the interim injunction in terms of para 38(a) of the notice of motion exhs.6­7. [2.11] feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court, below notice of motion exhs.6­7, original defendant no.1 has preferred the present appeal from order. [3.0] shri shalin mehta, learned senior advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 and shri kamal trivedi, learned senior advocate has appeared on behalf of the respondent no.1 herein original plaintiff. [4.0] shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case the learned commercial court has materially erred in allowing the notice of motion exh.6­7 and granting the temporary injunction against the appellant herein original defendant no.1 in terms of para 38(a) of the application for interim injunction. [4.1] it is vehemently submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that as such while granting interim injunction application, the learned commercial court has not properly appreciated and considered the fact that as such the plaintiff had not approached the court with clean hands and as such suppressed the material fact more particularly with respect to the date of knowledge of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 in the market with its products in question viz. maharaja whiteline blizzard 50 and blizzard 50 dlx as also blizzard 20 and blizzard 20 dlx. it is vehemently submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that as such the plaintiff made a false statement in the plaint and interim injunction application to the extent of its knowledge vis­a­vis shape and configuration of the appellant's maharaja whiteline blizzard series of air coolers. it is submitted that the planitiff made a false statement that he become aware of the shape and configuration of the appellant's maharaja blizzard series of air coolers in february 2017. it is submitted that the learned commercial court has failed to appreciate that infact in the cancelation petition filed by the original plaintiff against the original defendant no.1's registered design no.269833, it was admitted by the plaintiff about the knowledge of the appellant's products in question and in the plaint misrepresented its date of knowledge with respect to the said products as february 2017. it is submitted that therefore the learned commercial court ought to have rejected the interim injunction application on the said ground alone as it is a settled proposition of law that a party who conceals and suppress facts from the court is not entitled to any relief, much less any equitable relief. [4.2] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that even otherwise the learned commercial court ought to have appreciated that the delay in bringing an action of passing off also disentitles the plaintiff from the equitable relief of injunction. [4.3] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that even otherwise on merits also the learned commercial court has materially erred in granting the interim injunction in terms of para 38(a) of the interim injunction. [4.4] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that to be successful in an action of passing off, the claimant has to establish classic trinity i.e. (1) reputation and goodwill attached to the goods or services that the claimant supplies goodwill being attached to the badge of origin, (ii) misrepresentation (whether or not intentional) by the defendant to the public leading or likely to lead public to believe that the goods or services offered by the defendant are the goods or services of the claimant and (iii) consquent damage to the goodwill of the claimant. it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that it is a settled principle of law that the absence of even one element of passing off disentitles the claimant from any relief. it is submitted that in the present case the plaintiff has infact failed to establish any element of passing off. it is submitted that therefore the plaintiff has no even prima facie case establishing any of the test of passing off and therefore, the impugned order ought not to have been passed by the learned commercial court. [4.5] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that the learned commercial court has failed to appreciate that the plaintiff had miserably failed to establish that the shape of its 'diet 50t', 'diet 22t', 'diet 50i' and 'diet 22i' air coolers has acquired distinctiveness in the minds of the relevant pubilc as being indicative of the source denoting plaintiff's products and no one else. [4.6] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that the learned commercial court has failed to appreciate that the plaintiff has miserably failed to even prima facie establish goodwill in the shape of its 'diet 50t', 'diet 22t', 'diet 50i' and 'diet 22i' air coolers much less that the said that the said shape of the air coolers has become a source indicator of the plaintiff's products and no one else. [4.7] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that the learned commercial court has materially erred in observing and holding that the plaintiff is a prior user of the shape of the air coolers diet series air coolers. it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that even the plaintiff has failed to establish and prove the goodwill in their favour emanating from the shape of the 'diet series' of air coolers in india. it is submitted that whatever the documents of sale and goodwill are produced are that of foreign countries and not in india. it is submitted that therefore the finding recorded by the learned commercial court that the plaintiff has earned the goodwill with respect to 'diet series' of air coolers and therefore, the learned commercial court has materially erred in granting the injunction in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants. [4.8] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that the learned commercial court has erred in not appreciating that the registration of design of the plaintiff in relation to its air coolers is admittedly in the \"surface pattern\", whereas, the registration of design of the defendant no.1 in relation to its air coolers is in the \"shape and configuration\". it is submitted that therefore the entire action of the plaintiff is completely misplaced and therefore, no injunction could have been granted in favour of the plaintiff. [4.9] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that the learned commercial court has materially erred by wrongly placing reliance on the advertisements placed by the plaintiff for appointing distributors and dealers in india. it is submitted that apart from the fact that the said advertisement was not produced alongwith the plaint even the said advertisements are with respect to the air coolers of all the shapes, dimensions and sizes. it is submitted that therefore these advertisements would have no bearing on the mind of the purchasing public qua the shape of the 'diet series' of air coolers as being a source indicated by the plaintiff. it is submitted that similarly the brochure placed on record by the plaintiff contains air coolers of all shapes, dimensions and sizes and therefore, cannot be considered as indicative of the goodwill of the shape of the 'diet series' of air coolers. it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that as such the learned commercial court has materially erred in equating the goodwill and reputation knowledge by the plaintiff with the goodwill and reputation associated with the shape of 'diet series' air coolers. it is submitted that the same cannot be equated or considered on the same footing. it is further submitted that as such the learned commercial court has not properly appreciated the distinction and difference between the goodwill and reputation. it is submitted that goodwill and reputation are both distinct and separate. it is submitted that in a given case the plaintiff might have got the reputation but may not have acquired / got the goodwill with respect to particular goods with respect to the passing off action. [4.10] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that even otherwise the learned commercial court has materially erred in not properly appreciating the fact that the there can be no misrepresentation or confusion in the mind of purchaser when they go to purchase the air coolers, as the appellant herein original defendant no.1 is selling its products which are subject matter of the many order under its own distinct trade mark / name \"maharaja whiteline\" and the distinct name of the product \"blizzard\" is also prominently displayed on the product. it is submitted that trade mark / name which has been in use by the appellant herein original defendant no.1 since the year 1976 and the defendant no.1 has an annual turnover of approximately 231 crores for the year 2015­16 itself and therefore, the defendant no.1 is a well­known brand with a huge reputation and goodwill amongst the public. it is submitted that thus when the appellant original defendant no.1's goodwill is itself immense, the likelihood of public confusing the defendant no.1's good as those of the plaintiff or being associated with the plaintiff is negligible. [4.11] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant no.1 that even otherwise there can be no misrepresentation or confusion in the minds of the purchasing public as the competing products of the defendant no.1 ­ \"maharaja whiteline\" the air coolers are visually and aesthetically different. it is submitted that the impugned products of the defendant no.1 bear no resemblance whatsoever in the shape and configuration, pattern, ornamentation or overall appearance with the products of the plaintiff. it is submitted that in the present case despite the learned judge observing that these similarities exist between competing products which are the subject matter of the present dispute, the learned commercial court has wrongly concluded that the shape, configuration and overall appearance of the products in question of the defendant no.1 maharaja whiteline blizzard series of air coolers are strikingly similar. it is submitted that considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the learned commercial court has wrongly concluded that the plaintiff has a prima facie case, the balance of convenience favours the plaintiff and that irreparable harm or injury would be caused to the plaintiff if the appellant herein original defendant no.1 is not restrained by an order of injunction. making above submissions and relying upon following decisions, it is requested to allow the present appeal and quash and set aside the impugned order of interim injunction passed by the learned commercial court. 1. torrent pharmaceuticals ltd. vs. wockhardt ltd. 2017 scc online bom 318 2. britannia industries ltd. v/s. itc limited 2017 scc online del 7391 3. techno plastic industries vs. dart industries inc. & anr. 2017 scc online madras 1447 4. m/s. smithkline beecham plc. and ors. vs. m/s. hindustan lever limited and ors. 2000 (52) drj 5. toyota jidosha kabushiki kaisha vs. prius auto industries limited and ors.

[6.1] having found prima facie case and balance of convenience etc. and having found prima facie case that the air­coolers manufactured and being sold by the defendants ­ maharaja whiteline blizzard 50, maharaja whiteline blizzard 20, maharaja blizzard 50dlx and maharaja whiteline blizzard 20 dlx are deceptively similar to that of the design / tower models diet models designed, manufactured and sold by the plaintiffs, by impugned order the learned commercial court has granted the injunction against the defendants. [6.2] that while considering the impugned order the findings recorded by the learned commercial court are required to be referred to and considered, which are as under: (1) that the plaintiff company is in the business of marketing, selling, trading and exporting a range of air coolers and pioneer in establishing or marketing or producing or manufacturing the plastic body air coolers; (2) that the definition of \"mark\" under section 2(z) of the trade marks act include shape of goods; (3) that the plaintiff is operating under the trade name of \"symphony\" and the company's total turn over exceeded approximately rs.523.98 crores; (4) that the plaintiffs, its directors got design of the questioned product registered under the provisions of the design act, 2000; (5) that the plaintiff is pioneer in manufacturing of air­coolers etc. and the plaintiff has been given iso certification; (6) that design of each model has been registered; (7) that the defendant has got the design of the air­cooler in question registered in the year 2015, whereas the plaintiff have got registration of the design in the year 2009 and since then the plaintiff has been selling and manufacturing and exporting the products in question; (8) that the plaintiff is prior user and the first who introduced into the market a completely distinct shape which has not been introduced earlier; (9) that the plaintiff had received an award being a quality marks award 2014 for his \"diet\" model 22t and thereby has created good reputation nationally and internationally. [6.3] it is also further observed by the learned commercial court in paras 99 to 103 as under: \"99. it is pertinent to note here that since the issue on hand is for consideration of action of passing of and therefore the said action can be said to be a recurring action and based on common law rights. however, the entire issue rests on the overall shape, configuration, get­up and appearance of the products in question and the possibility of deceit and confusion in the minds of purchasers. thus, admittedly considering the issue on hand which pertains to passing of action, the plaintif is required to prove that the plaintif is a prior user, adopter, prior registered proprietor of the design in question who admittedly appears to have sold the products in question in the market and its sales turnover runs into crores of rupees and sales promotional expenses also in lacs of rupees whereas the defendant no.1 though appears to have been 60 engaged in the manufacturing and selling the products of home appliances, however considering the products in question disputed products, the defendants appear to have launched the products as acquainted by the plaintif since september 2016 (or january 2016). thus, the defendants, so far as the products in question are concerned, seems to be new comer who appears to harp over and to take the advantage of the reputation and association of the plaintif's products which amounts to an act of passing of. comparison of both the products visually: 100. to meet with the issue as raised by the defendants pertains to the products in question manufactured and developed by the defendant no.1, a completely distinct, both visually and aesthetically from that of the plaintif and no case for any confusion, much less deceit and also on account of the shape, configuration on the ground that the product of the plaintif have attained a secondary meaning and pattern of the product and resemblance thereof with the shape, configuration, pattern of the plaintif's products and the issue as to the product, if placed side by side as well as on independent comparison of both the products, it cannot be said that the product of the defendant no.1 is leading and/or likely to lead general public to believe that the goods ofered by defendant no.1 are of the plaintif. 61 thus, the aforesaid issues in the form of submissions, are required to be dealt with in compass of the entire material placed for consideration on record. 101. it is not in dispute that the whole case of the plaintif rests on the shape, configuration, pattern, etc. as to the product in question as disputed by the defendant no.1. at the outset, it is to state that at the joint request made by the learned senior advocates appearing for the respective parties seeking permission to produce their respective products before the court vide exh.27 and therefore this court while conceding the request, has had an occasion to see both the products in question which were brought before this court during the course of hearing and therefore the question whether the two are deceptively similar or not, the test, as held by several high courts is, what appeals to the eye of the judge on the first impression and therefore, the first impression has to be of a person with average intelligence and/or imperfect recollection. 102. even during the course of hearing, the learned senior advocate appearing for the defendant no.1 has tried to distinguish and show the dissimilarities between the products in question while referring the front view, rear view, upper view and lower view. however, the said test is to be applied and pertains to the infringement of the design under section 22 of the designs act, 2000 which at the most may fall under the category and issue of 62 fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof which amounts to an act of piracy and/or infringement. therefore, this court in the preamble of this order has made it categorically clear that several contentions raised by the learned senior advocates appearing for the respective parties which pertains to the infringement of the design would not be entertained as the entire gamut of the case on hand is dispute as to passing of which only rests on the shape, configuration and overall appearance of the products in question. in nutshell, a comparison of both the products show a striking similarity, however eforts seems to have been made by the learned senior advocate appearing for the defendant no.1 to show dissimilarities, but considering the test requires to be adopted is to see the salient features, overall similarity, is the touch­stone, mark or product must be viewed by observing overall structure, phonetic similarity and idea thereto, visual test of products in question. in short mark must be compared as a whole instead of microscopic examination as the products are placed side by side only to find out diference as overall similarity as appearing in case on hand, is sufficient. 103. apart from the goodwill and turnover of the products in question and in furtherance thereof as to the substantial goodwill and reputation inheres in the plaintif's products in question which seems to have been launched way back in the year 2009 and the 63 very fact has not been disputed by the defendants. not only that, at the relevant time, no other product as launched by the plaintif and with the similar comparable shape/appearance existed in the market prior to the introduction thereof by the plaintif. thus, the product in question so launched by the plaintif at the relevant time acquired a distinctive shape and/or get­up and/or colour scheme and/or overall appearance (surface pattern) cannot be disputed.\" it is further observed in paras 105 to 107 as under: \"105. in furtherance of the aforesaid aspect, even the product in question introduced by the plaintif at the relevant time wherein prior thereto, no such product or similar thereof or comparable shape and overall appeals existed and the gestures of the plaintif while launching such product completely amounts to a revolutionary and of distinct shape which had not been introduced earlier and therefore, the same can be termed as a novelty itself of the product in question which generated a huge sale and popularity. 106. though the eforts seems to have been made by the defendant no.1 by placing forward the ground as to the product in question being commonly known / design having overall similar appearance as that of the impugned design of the plaintif having been so granted in favour of lesko holdings by the uspto in 2006. however, while perusing the material in support of its contention, it prima facie appears that the said image, the xerox copy of which has been produced by the defendant no.1, is a body for a vertical fan whereas the impugned product in question is an air cooler. 107. not only that, the overall appearance of the said product, comparing with the impugned product, stands on a diferent footing. thus, the protest so lodged by the defendant no.1 while placing forward the aforesaid product to disentitle the claim of the plaintif with regard to the impugned product, would not come to the rescue of the contention of the defendant no.1 as the defendant no.1 seems to have launched its product admittedly in january 2016 whereas the product of the plaintif in question, as discussed hereinabove, was launched in 2009 and at that time, no other product with the similar or comparable shape and/or overall appearance existed in the market prior to the introduction thereof by the plaintif and the very existence amounts to goodwill and/or reputation in the shape and/or overall appearance of the product in question.\" [6.4] considering the findings recorded which are prima facie on appreciation of evidence / material on record and thereafter having opined / observed that the case for passing off is made out and thereafter the learned commercial judge has granted the interim injunction as prayed for in terms of para 38a, we are of the opinion that it cannot be said that the learned judge has committed any error. the findings recorded by the learned commercial court are on appreciation of evidence and having found prima facie case, balance of convenience etc. once having found the deceptive similarity between the products in question of the plaintiffs and the products in question of the defendants and having found that the plaintiffs introduced the design first time of a tower model diet model which had earned a reputation, goodwill etc. and the plaintiff is in prior use of the said design / models and having given the aforesaid findings, we are of the opinion that the case of passing off has been made out and therefore, the learned commercial court has rightly granted the injunction referred to hereinabove. [6.5] number of decisions have been cited by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties referred to hereinabove. however, all the decisions are required to be considered in the facts and circumstances of the case and a prima facie case being made out, considering the principles to be considered while granting the case of passing off. therefore, we are of the opinion that though we agree with the proposition of law laid down in the cited decisions relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, same shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand more particularly with respect to the findings arrived at by the learned commercial court referred to hereinabove. [6.6] we are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned commercial court. no interference of this court is called for against the impugned interim injunction granted by the learned commercial court. [7.0] in view of the above and for the reasons stated above, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court. under the circumstances, present appeal from order deserves to be dismissed and is, accordingly, dismissed. being a commercial dispute arising out of the commercial courts act, the learned judge, commercial court is directed to decide and dispose of the suit at the earliest. all concerned are directed to cooperate the learned commercial court in early disposal of the suit being a commercial dispute. it is observed that findings recorded by the learned commercial court and confirmed by this court are to be treated and considered as prima facie while deciding applications exh.6­7 and the learned commercial court to decide and dispose of the suit in accordance with law and on its own merits. with this, present appeal from order stands dismissed. civil application no.1 of 2017 in view of dismissal of main appeal from order, present civil application also stands dismissed. sd/­ (m.r. shah, j.) sd/­ (a.y. kogje, j.) further order after the pronouncement of the judgment, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant original defendant requests to extend the interim relief granted earlier. in the facts and circumstances of the case, interim relief granted earlier to continue till 20.08.2018. sd/­ (m.r. shah, j.) sd/­ (a.y. kogje, j.) ajay**"
