Further, the cause of action has arisen when  the plaintiffs came across the defendants'  ready to eat   products in the market. Further, the cause of action has  arisen when the plaintiffs have issued cease and desist   notice dated 05.12.2014 to the defendants and when the   acknowledgment   receipt   slip   was   received   under   the   rubber   stamp   of   the   defendants.   Further,   the  cause   of  action has arisen when the defendants have chosen to  give evasive reply to the notice dated 05.12.2014 issued  HC-NIC Page 3 of 29 Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017 C/AO/422/2016                                   CAV JUDGMENT by the plaintiffs and as and when the copy of the caveat  application is received by the plaintiffs in the third week  of   December,   2014.

That it was the case on behalf of the defendant that the  defendant   does   not   carry   out   its   business   within   the   territorial  jurisdiction   of   Court   at  Ahmedabad   nor   have   any   office   or   any  other representatives or agents within the territorial jurisdiction the  Court   at   Ahmedabad   and   therefore,   for   the   relief   sought   in   the  plaint / suit, Court at Ahmedabad has no territorial jurisdiction. It  was   submitted   that   even   in   the   plaint   also,   the   plaintiff's   also  averred that  \"the defendant carries on business at Bardoli\" which is  beyond  the  territorial   jurisdiction   of  the  Court  at   Ahmedabad.

It was further the case on behalf of the  defendant that the plaintiff's  are not having any business and / or  had   not   entered   into   transactions   with   any   non   parties   as   their  representative,  as the invoices produced by the plaintiffs are false  and   concocted.   It   was   submitted   that   even   the   name   of   the  defendant has been inserted in the invoices  subsequently only with  a   view   to   bring   the   suit   within   the   territorial   jurisdiction   of   the  Ahmedabad   Court.   It   was   submitted   that   even   considering   the  pleadings and averments made by the plaintiffs, it is not the case of  infringement of  trade mark, copyright,  patents etc. and that it is  merely a case of  passing off, and therefore, neither provisions of  Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act nor Section 64 of the Copyright  Act   would   apply.   It   was   submitted   that   even   considering   the  provisions of Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the cause of  action   cannot   be   said   to   have   arisen   within   the   territorial  jurisdiction of the Court at Ahmedabad, as the defendant has not  sold, nor having any retailer, nor carrying on business, nor having  any   registered   office   at   Ahmedabad   within   the   territorial  jurisdiction   of   the   Court   at   Ahmedabad   and   that     essential  characteristics of the business such as i.e. manufacture, packaging,  dispatch,   sales,   receipt   of   orders,   all   admittedly   take   place   at  Bardoli  district  and therefore,  no cause  of  action is  said  to have  arisen   within   the   jurisdiction   of   the   Court   at   Ahmedabad.  Therefore, it was requested to allow the application Exh. 21 and to  return   the   plaint   to   the   plaintiffs   to   present   it   before     the  appropriate Court having jurisdiction to grant such relief. \nHC-NIC                                       Page 6 of 29      Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017\n           C/AO/422/2016                                                                             CAV JUDGMENT\n2.5. The application Exh.21 was vehemently opposed by the  plaintiffs. It was the specific case on behalf of the plaintiffs that as  the suit filed by the plaintiffs is suit for passing off action and as the  defendant's   goods   are   being   sold   in   the   city   of   Ahmedabad,   the  Court at Ahmedabad would have jurisdiction to try and decide the  suit and grant the relief as prayed in the suit. For the aforesaid, the  plaintiffs   relied   upon   two   cash   memos   one   issued   by   the   Alka  Stores and another by Shree Krushna Dudh Ghar (Non Parties at  Ahmedabad). Therefore, it was submitted that in view of provisions  of Section 134 of the Trade Marks and Section 20 of the Code of  Civil Procedure,   a part   of cause of action is said to have arisen  within the jurisdiction of Court at Ahmedabad and therefore, the  Court at Ahmedabad would have jurisdiction to try the suit. \n2.6.

Shri   R.R.   Shah,   learned   advocate   for   the   original  plaintiffs   has   vehemently   submitted   that   while   holding   that   the  Court at Ahmedabad would  not have any territorial jurisdiction to  grant   the   relief   prayed   in   the   suit,   the   learned   Judge   has   not  properly appreciated the cause of action pleaded in the suit/ plaint. \n4.2. It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   R.R.   Shah,   learned  advocate   for   the   original   plaintiff's   that   as   the   goods   of   the  defendant are / were being sold in the city of Ahmedabad and as  the   suit   was   for   passing   off   action   the   Court   within   whose  jurisdiction the goods of the defendants are being sold, the suit for  passing off action would be maintainable.

It   is   further   submitted   that   in   the   present   case   in  support   of   the   case   on   behalf   of   the   plaintiffs   that   goods  manufactured   by   the   defendant   which   are   deceptively   similar   to  that of the plaintiffs are being sold in the city of Ahmedabad, the  plaintiffs   have   produced   the   necessary   evidence   such   as   cash  memo, invoice etc. of Alka Stores and Shree Krushna Dudh Ghar  (non parties).

It is further submitted by Shri Shelat, learned advocate  for   the   defendant   that   even   receipt   of   the   notice   within   the  jurisdiction of the Court would not ipso facto give rise to a cause of  action   for   invoking   the   territorial   jurisdiction   of   the   Court.   It   is  submitted   that   in   the   present   case,   it   is   not   even   the   receipt   of  notice but (1) receipt of acknowledgment of service of notice and  (2)   receipt   of   caveat   application   filed   by   the   respondent.

It is further submitted by Shri Shelat, learned advocate  for the original defendant that in order to show that some part of  the cause of action has arisen in the forum State, the plaintiffs are  required to show that the defendant website targeted the viewers in  HC-NIC Page 13 of 29 Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017 C/AO/422/2016                                   CAV JUDGMENT the forum state and prima facie show any commercial transaction  taken place as a result. It is submitted that in the present case no  such pleadings exist to plead cause of action on the said ground. In  support of his above submission, Shri Shelat, learned advocate for  the defendant has heavily relied upon the following decisions of the  Delhi High Court:\n1.0. Banyan Tree Holding (P) Limited vs. A. Murali Krishna  Reddy and Anr reported in 2010(42) PTC 361 (Del). 2.0.

Now,   so   far   as   reliance   placed   upon   the   invoices  produced by the plaintiffs of Alka Stores and Shree Krushna Dudh  Ghar referred to and produced by the plaintiffs to assert that the  goods   of   the   defendant   are   being   sold   within   the   territorial  jurisdiction of the Court and in turn tried to establish a cause of  action within the limits of the Court at Ahmedabad is concerned, it  is vehemently submitted by Shri Shelat, learned advocate for the  original   defendant   that   said   documents   do   not   in   any   manner  disclose that:­\n(a). Goods   which   are   referred   to   in   the   invoice   are   the  Goods of the defendant.\n(b) That   the   defendant   is  selling   goods   through   the   said  vendors or otherwise within the territorial jurisdiction  of the Court either on a commercial basis or at all.\n(c) That the Goods which are referred to in the invoice are  so marked to be designed to lead purchasers to believe  they are goods of plaintiffs.\nHC-NIC                                       Page 14 of 29     Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017\n           C/AO/422/2016                                                                             CAV JUDGMENT\n\n\n                 (d)      That   transaction   produced   as   proof   is   a   'real \ncommercial transaction' and not a 'trap order' or 'trap  transaction' set up by the plaintiff.\n5.8. It is further submitted that apart from the fact that the  contents of the invoices do not in any manner support the claim of  the plaintiffs, the assessment of the invoices clearly establish that  the same does not show that the defendant is selling any infringing  goods within the jurisdiction of the Court since:\n(1)  The same merely refer to \"Vimal Agro Products\". (2)  The said writing also is evidently overwritten by hand  on the original document and appears unnaturally. (3)  The   purported   label   of   the   goods   referred   to   in   the  invoice, which the plaintiffs believe to be the basis of  their claim for passing off the goods of the defendant as  that of the plaintiffs are also not produced. \n5.9. It is further submitted that even the aforesaid invoices  are not supported by any affidavit of the respective vendors to the  effect   that   the   goods   in   question   are   the   goods   supplied   by   the  defendant to the vendor for sale.\n5.10. It is further submitted that even the said vendors who  as per the case pleaded by the plaintiffs are selling the goods and  passing of the goods of the defendant as that of the plaintiffs are  not impleaded as party defendant in the suit proceedings despite  the Court below having given a specific opportunity to implead the  said vendors.\nHC-NIC                                      Page 15 of 29     Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017\n           C/AO/422/2016                                                                              CAV JUDGMENT\n5.11. It is further submitted that even the aforesaid invoices  are and do not show a genuine commercial transaction and in fact  make   it   evident   that   the   transaction   is   a   set   up   created   by   the  plaintiffs to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court.\n5.12. It is further submitted by Shri Shelat, learned advocate  for   the   defendant   that   in   a   suit   for   passing   of   it   has   to   be  established   that   the   defendant   is   selling   the   goods   which   are  designed to deceive intending purchasers that they are the goods of  the plaintiffs within the jurisdiction of the Court.  In support of his  above submission, he has relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble  Supreme Court in the case Ruston & Hornsby Ltd vs. Zamindara  Engineering Co reported in (1969) 2 SCC 727. \n5.13. It is further submitted that in the present case there are  no material particulars set out in the plaint and documents to show  that the defendant has prima facie:­ \n(i)  Sold and / or even dispatched goods and / or supplied  goods on commercial scale for sale within the jurisdiction  of the Commercial Court at Ahmedabad and\n(ii)  the goods which are so sold / dispatched/ supplied are  such   as   liable   to   deceive   intending   purchasers   into  believing   that   they   were   goods   of   the   plaintiffs.

It is further submitted by Shri Shelat, learned advocate  for   the   original   defendant   that   in   the   present   case   question  regarding the territorial jurisdiction of the Court in the subject suit  for passing off is to be decided considering Section 20 of the Code  of Civil Procedure. It is submitted that considering Section 20 of the  Code of Civil Procedure, the plaintiffs are required to institute suit  where the defendant resides or carries on business. It is submitted  that it is the plaintiffs' own case that the defendant is not resident  of Ahmedabad; that the defendant is having its office at Bardoli,  Dist.   Surat   and   there   is   no   registered   office   or   branch   office   in  Ahmedabad. \n5.15. It is further submitted that even it is the plaintiffs' own  HC-NIC Page 17 of 29 Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017 C/AO/422/2016                                   CAV JUDGMENT case in the plaint that the defendant has its office and carries on  business   at  and  from   Bardoli,   District   Surat.   It   is  submitted  that  there are no pleadings to support the case that the defendant is  \"carrying   on   business\"   within   the   jurisdiction   of   the   Court.   It   is  submitted   that   therefore,   learned   Commercial   Court   has   rightly  allowed   the   application   Exh.21   by   observing   that   for   the   relief  sought   in   the   plaint,   Court   at   Ahmedabad   would   not   have   any  territorial   jurisdiction.   In   support   of   his   above   submissions,   Shri  Shelat, learned advocate has relied upon the following decisions:\n1. Dhodha   House   and   Patel   Field   Marshal   Industries   vs.  S.K.

It is further submitted by Shri Shelat, learned advocate  for the original defendant that in a suit for passing off the cause of  action would arise where the defendant is selling goods as marked  as to be designed or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that  they   are   the   plaintiffs   goods.   It   is   submitted   that   it   is   only   the  factum of sale by the defendant of the infringing goods within the  jurisdiction of the Court which can give rise to any cause of action  for invoking the territorial jurisdiction of the Court. It is submitted  that as it would become evident from a plaint, reading of the plaint  and supporting documents, no cause of action has arisen within the  territorial jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad. \nHC-NIC Page 18 of 29 Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017 C/AO/422/2016                                   CAV JUDGMENT 5.17. It is further submitted by Shri Shelat, learned advocate  for the original defendant that the present appeal arises out of the  order allowing the Order 7 Rule 10 application of the defendant. It  is submitted that the law is clear on the point that the plaint and  documents   need   to   be   looked   into   as   a   whole   and   no   injustice  should be caused to any party because of the cleaver drafting of the  plaint. It is submitted that the averments made in the plaint which  lack pith and substance cannot confer jurisdiction on the Court and  suit   therefore,   cannot   be   entertained.

Heard the learned advocates for the respective parties  length.  At the outset, it is required to be noted that by impugned  order,   the   learned   Commercial   Court,   Ahmedabad   in   exercise   of  powers under Order 7 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908  has returned the plaint to the original plaintiffs to present it before  the appropriate Court having jurisdiction.\n7.0. On   considering   the   impugned   order   passed   by   the  learned Commercial Court, it appears that what has been weighed  with the learned Commercial Court is that;\n(1)  the suit is for permanent injunction and passing off;  (2)   no   cause   of   action   has   arisen   within   the   territorial  jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad;  (3)   that   Section   134   of   the   Trade   Marks   Act   shall   not   be  applicable   as   the   suit   is   only   for   the   permanent  injunction and passing off; \n(4)   that   considering   Section   20   of   the   Code   of   Civil  Procedure as the defendant resides and / or carrying on  the business and / or its registered office at Bardoli, the  Commercial   Court,   Ahmedabad   shall   not   have   any  territorial jurisdiction;\n(5)  that the invoices produced by the plaintiffs in support of  their   case   that   the   goods   of   the   defendant   which  deceptively   similar   to  that   of  the   plaintiffs  are   sold   in  Ahmedabad   i.e.   within   the   territorial   jurisdiction   of  Ahmedabad are not genuine and that the person from  whom the goods of the defendant are purchased are not  joined as party defendant. \nHC-NIC                                     Page 20 of 29     Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017\n           C/AO/422/2016                                                                                 CAV JUDGMENT\n8.0. Therefore,   the short question which is posed for the  consideration   of   this     Court   is   whether   in   the   facts   and  circumstances   of   the   case   and   considering   the   averments   and  pleadings   in   the   plaint/   suit   the   learned   Commercial   Court,  Ahmedabad is justified in passing impugned order in exercise of the  powers under Order 7 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure and  in   returning   the   plaint   to   the   plaintiffs   to   present   it   before   the  appropriate Court having jurisdiction ?\n8.1. While   considering    the   aforesaid  question   /  issue   the  necessary pleadings in the suit / plaint with respect to the cause of  action pleased are required to be referred to, which are in para 31  of the plaint, reads as under:\n\"31. Cause of action: That the cause of action to file the  present suit firstly has arisen when the defendants have   filed   opposition   proceedings   to   plaintiffs'   registration  application   somewhere   in     July,   August,   2014   and  thereafter in the last week of November, 2014 when the   plaintiffs inquired through their field staff as to whether  which   goods   are   manufactured   and   marketed   by   the   defendants. Further, the cause of action has arisen when  the plaintiffs came across the defendants'  ready to eat   products in the market. Further, the cause of action has  arisen when the plaintiffs have issued cease and desist   notice dated 05.12.2014 to the defendants and when the   acknowledgment   receipt   slip   was   received   under   the   rubber   stamp   of   the   defendants.   Further,   the   cause   of   action has arisen when the defendants have chosen to  give evasive reply to the notice dated 05.12.2014 issued   by the plaintiffs and as and when the copy of the caveat  application is received by the plaintiffs in the third week  of   December,   2014.   The   plaintiffs   have  got   knowledge  that the defendants are carrying the business in the city   of Ahmedabad and the cause of action has arisen within   the   territorial   jurisdiction   of   this   Hon'ble   Court.   It   is   further submitted  that the defendants' goods are sold in  HC-NIC Page 21 of 29 Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017 C/AO/422/2016                                   CAV JUDGMENT the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court and the   plaintiffs have purchased the defendants goods in the city   of   Ahmedabad   vide   cash   memo   Nos.2413   dated   19012015 from Alka Stores, Ahmedabad for Rs.730/and  vide   cash   memo   Nos.42   dated   09012015   from  Shree  Krushan   Dudh   Ghar,  Ahmedabad  for   Rs.235/which   is  produced separately with the list. The plaintiffs are also   carrying on their business at Mehsana, Ahmedabad and   elsewhere in different cities in country and the plaintiffs'  goods are also available in the city of Ahmedabad. The   defendants   are   manufacturing   and   marketing   their   products under the trade name /trade mark VIMAl in a  clandestine and surreptitiously manner and as such the   cause of action is continuous and subsisting against the  defendants   from   day   to   day   till   the   defendants   are   restrained from using the key word VIMAL by an order of  this Hon'ble Court. Moreover, the defendants have also   passed off plaintiffs' VIMAL trade mark/ trade name by   using the same or deceptively similar trade name/trading  style   and   guilty   of   passing   off   plaintiffs'   trade   mark/   trade name VIMAL under section 34 of the Trade Marks   Act, 1999 and also under section 20 of the Code of Civil   Procedure,   1908.   The   plaintiffs   say   that   the   cause   of   action has also arised on 03012015 when the website of  the defendant came to be known by the plaintiff  no.2   when   the   reply   at   27122014   was   received   by   the   plaintiffs   on   08012015   and   photocopy   of   the   said  website was taken out on 09012015. The plaintiffs say  that the cause of action is continuous and recurring day  by day.\"\n8.2. It is not in dispute and it is an admitted position that  the original defendant is carrying on its business and is having its  registered office at Bardoli (not within the territorial jurisdiction of  the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad). It is not in dispute that the  suit is for passing off action and for permanent injunction. It is not  in dispute that the plaintiff's are carrying on their business and / or  are having its  registered office within the territorial jurisdiction of  Ahmedabad.   In   light   of   the   aforesaid   facts,   it   is   required   to   be  HC-NIC Page 22 of 29 Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017 C/AO/422/2016                                   CAV JUDGMENT considered whether the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad would have  territorial   jurisdiction   to   entertain   the   suit   and   grant   reliefs   as  prayed in the plaint / suit. \n9.0. Therefore, while considering the aforesaid  issue, the cause of  action pleaded in the suit is required to be considered. The cause of  action pleaded in the suit is reproduced herein above. It is mainly  pleaded   that   as   the   defendant   goods   are   sold   in   the   territorial  jurisdiction   of   the   Court   at   Ahmedabad   and   the   plaintiffs   have  purchased   the   defendant   goods   in   the   City   of   Ahmedabad   vide  cash   memo   Nos.2413   dated   19012015   from   Alka   Stores,  Ahmedabad   for   Rs.730/­   and   vide   cash   memo   Nos.42   dated  09012015   from   Shree   Krushna   Dudh   Ghar,   Ahmedabad   for  Rs.235/­ and therefore, the goods manufactured by the defendant  are   being   sold   within   the   territorial   jurisdiction   of   the   Court   at  Ahmedabad.  However,   it  is  required to  be  noted   and  as  rightly  observed   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court,   the   invoices   relied  upon by the plaintiffs of Alka Stores and Shri Krushna Dudh Ghar,  Ahmedabad did not inspire any confidence and they did not appear  to be genuine. The so called vendors Alka Stores and Shri Krushna  Dudh Ghar, Ahmedabad are not joined as party defendants, though  sufficient   opportunity   was   given   to   the   plaintiffs.   Even   from   the  cash memo's / invoices it does not establish even prima facie that  the goods manufactured by the defendants are being sold within  the territorial jurisdiction of the Court at Ahmedabad. Even, it does  not   suggest   that   except   name   of   the   defendant,   which   seems   to  have  been  written subsequently,  it  is not even established prima  facie   that   the   goods   of   the   defendants   are   being   sold.   It   is   not  HC-NIC Page 23 of 29 Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017 C/AO/422/2016                                   CAV JUDGMENT averred in the plaint that  Alka Stores and Shri Krushna Dudh Ghar,  Ahmedabad are the agents / authorized dealers of the defendants.  It appears that only with a view to get the suit within the territorial  jurisdiction of the Court at Ahmedabad, the plaintiffs have come  out with a illusory cause of action and it appears that as such no  cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of the  Court at Ahmedabad.\n9.1. Considering   the   pleadings   in   the   plaint,   there   are   specific  averments in the plaint with respect to passing off trade mark /  trade name of the plaintiffs. As observed herein above, the plaintiffs  are carrying on their business and are having its registered office  within   the   territorial   jurisdiction   of   the   Commercial   Court,  Ahmedabad.   Under   the   circumstances   and   considering   the  averments in the plaint, more particularly, with respect to passing  off the trade mark / trade name \"Vimal\", Section 134 of the Trade  Marks Act, 1999 would come into play. Section 134 of the Trade  Marks Act, reads as under: \n\"Section   134:    Suit   for   infringement,   etc.,   to   be  instituted before District Court:­ (1)  No Suit:­\n(a) for the infringement of a registered trade mark; or\n(b) relating to any right in a registered trade mark; or\n(c).For passing off arising out of the use by the defendant   of any trade mark which is identical with or deceptively   similar to the plaintiff's trade mark, whether registered   or unregistered, shall be instituted in any court inferior   to a District Court having jurisdiction to try the suit.\n(2)For the purpose of clauses (a) and (b) of sub­section   (1),   a   \"District   Court   having   jurisdiction\"   shall,   notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil   Procedure, 1908  (5 of 1908)  or any other  law for the   HC-NIC Page 24 of 29 Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017 C/AO/422/2016                                   CAV JUDGMENT time being in force, include a District Court within the   local   limits   of   whose   jurisdiction,   at   the   time   of   the   institution   of   the   suit   or   other   proceeding,   the   person   instituting   the   suit   or   proceeding,   or,   where   there   are   more than one such persons any of them, actually and   voluntarily  resides  or  carries  on  business  or  personally   works for gain.\nExplanation.--For   the   purposes   of   sub­section   (2),   \"person\"   includes   the   registered   proprietor   and   the   registered user.\"\n  9.2. Therefore, considering Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act,  plaintiffs can institute suit for passing off arising out of the use by  the defendant of  any trade  mark  which  is identical of any trade  mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's  trade mark, whether registered or unregistered in a District Court  having   jurisdiction   to   try   the   suit   and   as   per   sub­section   (2)   of  Section   134   of   the   Act   for   the   purpose   of  clause   (a)   and  (b)   of  Section   134,   a   District   Court   having   \"jurisdiction\"   shall  notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure,  1908 or any other law for the time being in force, include a District  Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, at the time of  the   institution   of   the   suit   or   other   proceedings,   the   person  instituting the suit or proceedings, resides or carrying on business  or personally works for gain. It appears that in the present case, the  trade mark / trade name \"Vimal\" is not a registered trade mark and  therefore, as rightly observed by the learned Commercial Court that  Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act shall not be of any assistance to  the plaintiffs. \n9.3. Therefore,   for   the   purpose   of   jurisdiction,   with   respect   to  HC-NIC Page 25 of 29 Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017 C/AO/422/2016                                   CAV JUDGMENT passing off  the action Section 20 of the Code  of Civil  Procedure  shall   be   applicable.   Considering   Section   20   of   the   Code   of   Civil  Procedure,   suit   is   required   to   be   instituted   in   the   Court   within  whose   jurisdiction   the   defendant   either   resides   and   /   or   carries  business   and   /   or   is   having   registered   office   and   /   or   even   the  Branch office. As observed herein above, admittedly the defendant  is carrying on business at Bardoli and is also having its registered  office at Bardoli, beyond the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court,  Ahmedabad. \n10. However, it is the case on behalf of the plaintiffs that as the  suit   for   permanent   injunction   and   passing   off   the   trade   mark   /  trade name of the plaintiffs and therefore, the suit for permanent  injunction and passing off shall be maintainable in a Court within  whose jurisdiction the defendant goods are being sold which are  similarly deceptively to that of the plaintiffs. In support of his above  submission,   learned  advocate   for   the  plaintiffs  has  heavily   relied  upon the decision of this Court in the case of Pam Pharmaceuticals  (supra) and in the case of Unilever PLC & Anr (supra).  Learned  advocate for the plaintiff's has also heavily relied upon the decision  of   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in   the   case   of       Saleembhai   and  others (supra) in support of his submission that at this stage only  the   averments   in   the   plaint   are   required   to   be   considered.   The  plaintiffs have heavily relied upon two invoices of Alka Stores and  Shree   Krushna   Dudh   Ghar   in   support   of   their   case   that   as   the  defendant   goods   are   being   sold   in   the   city   of   Ahmedabad,   the  Commercial Court at Ahmedabad shall have jurisdiction. However,  it is required to be noted that along with the plaint, the plaintiffs  HC-NIC Page 26 of 29 Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017 C/AO/422/2016                                   CAV JUDGMENT have not produced the original invoices issued by Alka Stores and  Shree Krushna Dudh Ghar. Even the person / alleged dealers from  whom the goods of the defendant are purchased are also not joined  as   party   defendant.   There   are   no   averments   whatsoever   that   as  such those two dealers are the agents / dealers of the defendant  and   /   or   they   are   selling   the   goods   of   the   defendant   at   the  instruction given by the defendant and / or within the knowledge  of the defendant. It is true that at this stage normally the averments  in the plaint are required to be considered and not the defence.  However, even the averments in the plaint must be supported by  some cogent evidence and / or document. Mere averments in the  plaint   to   bring   the   suit   within   the   territorial   jurisdiction   of   the  Court   shall   not   be   sufficient.   Even   otherwise,   considering   the  invoices   / documents  produced  along with plaint  i.e.  invoices of  Alka   Stores   and   Shree   Krushna   Dudh   Ghar   produced   by   the  plaintiffs to assert that the goods of the defendant are being sold  within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court and in turn tried to  establish   a   cause   of   action   within   the   limits   of   the   Court   at  Ahmedabad, the said documents do not in any manner disclose that  the goods which are referred to in the invoices are the goods of the  defendant. It  also  does   not  disclose   that  the defendant  is  selling  goods through the said vendors or otherwise within the territorial  jurisdiction of the Court either on a commercial basis or at all. It  does not disclose that the transaction produced as proof is a \"real  commercial transaction\" and not a \"trap transaction\" set up by the  plaintiffs. The invoices merely refer to \" Vimal Agro Products\". Even  the said writing seems to be overwritten by hand on the original  document.   The   purported   label   of   the   goods   referred   to   in   the  HC-NIC Page 27 of 29 Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017 C/AO/422/2016                                   CAV JUDGMENT invoices, which the plaintiffs believe to be the basis of their claim  for passing off the goods of the defendant as that of the plaintiffs  are also not produced. The said invoices are also not supported by  any affidavit of the vendor to the effect that the goods in question  are the goods supplied by the defendant to the vendor for sale. The  cause of action pleaded in the plaint is reproduced herein above. It  appears   that   the   plaintiffs   have   invoked   the   jurisdiction   of   the  Commercial   Court   at   Ahmedabad   by   referring   to   the   following  causes in the plaint.\ni. Opposition to the Registration of their Trade­Mark. ii. Receipt   of   acknowledgment   of   their   cease   and   desist  notice.\niii. Receipt of caveat application iv. Website of the respondent.\nv. Purchase of defendants goods in the city of Ahmedabad.\n10.1. None of the aforesaid causes shall confer the jurisdiction in  the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad. Thus, on the basis of cause of  action pleaded in the plaint, it cannot be said that on such causes  pleaded, the Commercial Court, Ahmedabad shall have territorial  jurisdiction. \n10.2. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances and more  particularly, considering Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure  and cause of action pleaded in the plaint, it cannot be said that the  learned  Commercial   Court   has  committed   any  error   in   returning  the plaint to the plaintiffs to present it before the appropriate Court  having jurisdiction. \nHC-NIC                                     Page 28 of 29     Created On Wed Aug 16 05:49:33 IST 2017\n            C/AO/422/2016                                                                         CAV JUDGMENT\n11.

court. it is submitted that in the present case, it is not even the receipt of notice but (1) receipt of acknowledgment of service of notice and (2) receipt of caveat application filed by the respondent. it is submitted that none of the above two facts give rise to any cause of action for filing of the suit. in support of his above submissions, shri shelat, learned advocate has relied upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of oil and natural gas commission vs. utpal kumar basu and ors reported in (1994) 4 scc 711. 5.6. it is further submitted by shri shelat, learned advocate for the original defendant that in order to show that some part of the cause of action has arisen in the forum state, the plaintiffs are required to show that the defendant website targeted the viewers in hc-nic page 13 of 29 created on wed aug 16 05:49:33 ist 2017 c/ao/422/2016 cav judgment the forum state and prima facie show any commercial transaction taken place as a result. it is submitted that in the present case no such pleadings exist to plead cause of action on the said ground. in support of his above submission, shri shelat, learned advocate for the defendant has heavily relied upon the following decisions of the delhi high court: 1.0. banyan tree holding (p) limited vs. a. murali krishna reddy and anr reported in 2010(42) ptc 361 (del). 2.0. hydac fluidtechnik gmbh

limits of the court at ahmedabad is concerned, it is vehemently submitted by shri shelat, learned advocate for the original defendant that said documents do not in any manner disclose that:­ (a). goods which are referred to in the invoice are the goods of the defendant. (b) that the defendant is selling goods through the said vendors or otherwise within the territorial jurisdiction of the court either on a commercial basis or at all. (c) that the goods which are referred to in the invoice are so marked to be designed to lead purchasers to believe they are goods of plaintiffs. hc-nic page 14 of 29 created on wed aug 16 05:49:33 ist 2017 c/ao/422/2016 cav judgment (d) that transaction produced as proof is a 'real commercial transaction' and not a 'trap order' or 'trap transaction' set up by the plaintiff. 5.8. it is further submitted that apart from the fact that the contents of the invoices do not in any manner support the claim of the plaintiffs, the assessment of the invoices clearly establish that the same does not show that the defendant is selling any infringing goods within the jurisdiction of the court since: (1) the same merely refer to \"vimal agro products\". (2) the said writing also is evidently overwritten by hand on the original document and appears unnaturally. (3) the purported label of the goods referred to in the invoice, which the plaintiffs believe to be the basis of their claim for passing off the goods of the defendant as that of the plaintiffs are also not produced. 5.9. it is further submitted that even the aforesaid invoices are not supported by any affidavit of the respective vendors to the effect that the goods in question are the goods

in fact make it evident that the transaction is a set up created by the plaintiffs to invoke the jurisdiction of the court. 5.12. it is further submitted by shri shelat, learned advocate for the defendant that in a suit for passing of it has to be established that the defendant is selling the goods which are designed to deceive intending purchasers that they are the goods of the plaintiffs within the jurisdiction of the court. in support of his above submission, he has relied upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case ruston & hornsby ltd vs. zamindara engineering co

territorial jurisdiction of the court in the subject suit for passing off is to be decided considering section 20 of the code of civil procedure. it is submitted that considering section 20 of the code of civil procedure, the plaintiffs are required to institute suit where the defendant resides or carries on business. it is submitted that it is the plaintiffs' own case that the defendant is not resident of ahmedabad; that the defendant is having its office at bardoli, dist. surat and there is no registered office or branch office in ahmedabad. 5.15. it is further submitted that even it is the plaintiffs' own hc-nic page 17 of 29 created on wed aug 16 05:49:33 ist 2017 c/ao/422/2016 cav judgment case in the plaint that the defendant has its office and carries on business at and from bardoli, district surat. it is submitted that there are no pleadings to support the case that the defendant is \"carrying on business\" within the jurisdiction of the court. it is submitted that therefore, learned commercial court has rightly allowed the application exh.21 by observing that for the relief sought in the plaint, court at ahmedabad would not have any territorial jurisdiction. in support of his above submissions, shri shelat, learned advocate has relied upon the following decisions: 1. dhodha house and patel field marshal industries vs. s.k. maingi & p.m diesel limited

5.16. it is further submitted by shri shelat, learned advocate for the original defendant that in a suit for passing off the cause of action would arise where the defendant is selling goods as marked as to be designed or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are the plaintiffs goods. it is submitted that it is only the factum of sale by the defendant of the infringing goods within the jurisdiction of the court which can give rise to any cause of action for invoking the territorial jurisdiction of the court. it is submitted that as it would become evident from a plaint, reading of the plaint and supporting documents, no cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, ahmedabad. hc-nic page 18 of 29 created on wed aug 16 05:49:33 ist 2017 c/ao/422/2016 cav judgment 5.17. it is further submitted by shri shelat, learned advocate for the original defendant that the present appeal arises out of the order allowing the order 7 rule 10 application of the defendant. it is submitted that the law is clear on the point that the plaint and documents need to be looked into as a whole and no injustice should be caused to any party because of the cleaver drafting of the plaint. it is submitted that the averments made in the plaint which lack pith and substance cannot confer jurisdiction on the court and suit therefore, cannot be entertained. in support of his above submissions, shri shelat, learned advocate for the defendant has relied upon the following decisions. 1.0. t.arivandandam vs. t.v. satypaal and another reported in (1997) 4 scc 467. 2.0. heinz india pvt ltd vs. shrejee remedies reported in 2013(55) ptc 542 (del). 3.0. ltc limited vs. debts recovery appellate tribunal and others reported in (1998) 2 scc 70. 4.0.

required to be noted that by impugned order, the learned commercial court, ahmedabad in exercise of powers under order 7 rule 10 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 has returned the plaint to the original plaintiffs to present it before the appropriate court having jurisdiction. 7.0. on considering the impugned order passed by the learned commercial court, it appears that what has been weighed with the learned commercial court is that; (1) the suit is for permanent injunction and passing off; (2) no cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, ahmedabad; (3) that section 134 of the trade marks act shall not be applicable as the suit is only for the permanent injunction and passing off; (4) that considering section 20 of the code of civil procedure as the defendant resides and / or carrying on the business and / or its registered office at bardoli, the commercial court, ahmedabad shall not have any territorial jurisdiction; (5) that the invoices produced by the plaintiffs in support of their case that the goods of the defendant which deceptively similar to that of the plaintiffs are sold in ahmedabad i.e. within the territorial jurisdiction of ahmedabad are not genuine and that the person from whom the goods of the defendant are purchased are not joined as party defendant. hc-nic page 20 of 29 created on wed aug 16 05:49:33 ist 2017 c/ao/422/2016 cav judgment 8.0. therefore, the short question which is posed for the consideration of this court is whether in the facts and circumstances of the case and considering the averments and pleadings in the plaint/ suit the learned commercial court, ahmedabad is justified in passing impugned order in exercise of the powers under order 7 rule 10 of the code of civil procedure and in returning the plaint to the plaintiffs to present it before the appropriate court having jurisdiction ? 8.1. while considering the aforesaid question / issue the necessary pleadings in the suit / plaint with respect to the cause of action pleased are required to be referred to, which are in para 31 of the plaint, reads as under: \"31. cause of action: that the cause of action to file the present suit firstly has arisen when the defendants have filed opposition proceedings to plaintiffs' registration application somewhere in july, august, 2014 and thereafter in the last week of november, 2014 when the plaintiffs inquired through their field staff as to whether which goods are manufactured and marketed by the defendants. further, the cause of action has arisen when the plaintiffs came across the defendants' ready to eat products in the market. further, the cause of action has arisen when the plaintiffs have issued cease and desist notice dated 05.12.2014 to the defendants and when the acknowledgment receipt slip was received under the rubber stamp of the defendants. further, the cause of action has arisen when the defendants have chosen to give evasive reply to the notice dated 05.12.2014 issued by the plaintiffs and as and when the copy of the caveat application is received by the plaintiffs in the third week of december, 2014. the plaintiffs have got knowledge that the defendants are carrying the business in the city of ahmedabad and the cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of this hon'ble court. it is further submitted that the defendants' goods are sold in hc-nic page 21 of 29 created on wed aug 16 05:49:33 ist 2017 c/ao/422/2016 cav judgment the territorial jurisdiction of this hon'ble court and the plaintiffs have purchased the defendants goods in the city of ahmedabad vide cash memo nos.2413 dated 19012015 from alka stores, ahmedabad for rs.730/and vide cash memo nos.42 dated 09012015 from shree krushan dudh ghar, ahmedabad for rs.235/which is produced separately with the list. the plaintiffs are also carrying on their business at mehsana, ahmedabad and elsewhere in different cities in country and the plaintiffs' goods are also available in the city of ahmedabad. the defendants are manufacturing and marketing their products under the trade name /trade mark vimal in a clandestine and surreptitiously manner and as such the cause of action is continuous and subsisting against the defendants from day to day till the defendants are restrained from using the key word vimal by an order of this hon'ble court. moreover, the defendants have also passed off plaintiffs' vimal trade mark/ trade name by using the same or deceptively similar trade name/trading style and guilty of passing off plaintiffs' trade mark/ trade name vimal under section 34 of the trade marks act, 1999 and also under section 20 of the code of civil procedure, 1908. the plaintiffs say that the cause of action has also arised on 03012015 when the website of the defendant came to be known by the plaintiff no.2 when the reply at 27122014 was received by the plaintiffs on 08012015 and photocopy of the said website was taken out on 09012015. the plaintiffs say that the cause of action is continuous and recurring day by day.\" 8.2. it is not in dispute and it is an admitted position that the original defendant is carrying on its business and is having its registered office at bardoli (not within the territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, ahmedabad). it is not in dispute that the suit is for passing off action and for permanent injunction. it is not in dispute that the plaintiff's are carrying on their business and / or are having its registered office within the territorial jurisdiction of ahmedabad. in light of the aforesaid facts, it is required to be hc-nic page 22 of 29 created on wed aug 16 05:49:33 ist 2017 c/ao/422/2016 cav judgment considered whether the commercial court, ahmedabad would have territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit and grant reliefs as prayed in the plaint / suit. 9.0. therefore, while considering the aforesaid issue, the cause of action pleaded in the suit is required to be considered. the cause of action pleaded in the suit is reproduced herein above. it is mainly pleaded that as the defendant goods are sold in the territorial jurisdiction of the court at ahmedabad and the plaintiffs have purchased the defendant goods in the city of ahmedabad vide cash memo nos.2413 dated 19012015 from alka stores, ahmedabad for rs.730/­ and vide cash memo nos.42 dated 09012015 from shree krushna dudh ghar, ahmedabad for rs.235/­ and therefore, the goods manufactured by the defendant are being sold within the territorial jurisdiction of the court at ahmedabad. however, it is required to be noted and as rightly observed by the learned commercial court, the invoices relied upon by the plaintiffs of alka stores and shri krushna dudh ghar, ahmedabad did not inspire any confidence and they did not appear to be genuine. the so called vendors alka stores and shri krushna dudh ghar, ahmedabad are not joined as party defendants, though sufficient opportunity was given to the plaintiffs. even from the cash memo's / invoices it does not establish even prima facie that the goods manufactured by the defendants are being sold within the territorial jurisdiction of the court at ahmedabad. even, it does not suggest that except name of the defendant, which seems to have been written subsequently, it is not even established prima facie that the goods of the defendants are being sold. it is not hc-nic page 23 of 29 created on wed aug 16 05:49:33 ist 2017 c/ao/422/2016 cav judgment averred in the plaint that alka stores and shri krushna dudh ghar, ahmedabad are the agents / authorized dealers of the defendants. it appears that only with a view to get the suit within the territorial jurisdiction of the court at ahmedabad, the plaintiffs have come out with a illusory cause of action and it appears that as such no cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of the court at ahmedabad. 9.1. considering the pleadings in the plaint, there are specific averments in the plaint with respect to passing off trade mark / trade name of the plaintiffs. as observed herein above, the plaintiffs are carrying on their business and are having its registered office within the territorial jurisdiction of the commercial court, ahmedabad. under the circumstances and considering the averments in the plaint, more particularly, with respect to passing off the trade mark / trade name \"vimal\", section 134 of the trade marks act, 1999 would come into play. section 134 of the trade marks act, reads as under: \"section 134: suit for infringement, etc., to be instituted before district court:­ (1) no suit:­ (a) for the infringement of a registered trade mark; or (b) relating to any right in a registered trade mark; or (c).for passing off arising out of the use by the defendant of any trade mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trade mark, whether registered or unregistered, shall be instituted in any court inferior to a district court having jurisdiction to try the suit. (2)for the purpose of clauses (a) and (b) of sub­section (1), a \"district court having jurisdiction\" shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the code of civil procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) or any other law for the hc-nic page 24 of 29 created on wed aug 16 05:49:33 ist 2017 c/ao/422/2016 cav judgment time being in force, include a district court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, at the time of the institution of the suit or other proceeding, the person instituting the suit or proceeding, or, where there are more than one such persons any of them, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain. explanation.--for the purposes of sub­section (2), \"person\" includes the registered proprietor and the registered user.\" 9.2. therefore, considering section 134 of the trade marks act, plaintiffs can institute suit for passing off arising out of the use by the defendant of any trade mark which is identical of any trade mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trade mark, whether registered or unregistered in a district court having jurisdiction to try the suit and as per sub­section (2) of section 134 of the act for the purpose of clause (a) and (b) of section 134, a district court having \"jurisdiction\" shall notwithstanding anything contained in the code of civil procedure, 1908 or any other law for the time being in force, include a district court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, at the time of the institution of the suit or other proceedings, the person instituting the suit or proceedings, resides or carrying on business or personally works for gain. it appears that in the present case, the trade mark / trade name \"vimal\" is not a registered trade mark and therefore, as rightly observed by the learned commercial court that section 134 of the trade marks act shall not be of any assistance to the plaintiffs. 9.3. therefore, for the purpose of jurisdiction, with respect to hc-nic page 25 of 29 created on wed aug 16 05:49:33 ist 2017 c/ao/422/2016 cav judgment passing off the action section 20 of the code of civil procedure shall be applicable. considering section 20 of the code of civil procedure, suit is required to be instituted in the court within whose jurisdiction the defendant either resides and / or carries business and / or is having registered office and / or even the branch office. as observed herein above, admittedly the defendant is carrying on business at bardoli and is also having its registered office at bardoli, beyond the jurisdiction of the commercial court, ahmedabad. 10. however, it is the case on behalf of the plaintiffs that as the suit for permanent injunction and passing off the trade mark / trade name of the plaintiffs and therefore, the suit for permanent injunction and passing off shall be maintainable in a court within whose jurisdiction the defendant goods are being sold which are similarly deceptively to that of the plaintiffs. in support of his above submission, learned advocate for the plaintiffs has heavily relied upon the decision of this court in the case of pam pharmaceuticals (supra) and in the case of unilever plc & anr (supra). learned advocate for the plaintiff's has also heavily relied upon the decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of saleembhai and others (supra) in support of his submission that at this stage only the averments in the plaint are required to be considered. the plaintiffs have heavily relied upon two invoices of alka stores and shree krushna dudh ghar in support of their case that as the defendant goods are being sold in the city of ahmedabad, the commercial court at ahmedabad shall have jurisdiction. however, it is required to be noted that along with the plaint, the plaintiffs hc-nic page 26 of 29 created on wed aug 16 05:49:33 ist 2017 c/ao/422/2016 cav judgment have not produced the original invoices issued by alka stores and shree krushna dudh ghar. even the person / alleged dealers from whom the goods of the defendant are purchased are also not joined as party defendant. there are no averments whatsoever that as such those two dealers are the agents / dealers of the defendant and / or they are selling the goods of the defendant at the instruction given by the defendant and / or within the knowledge of the defendant. it is true that at this stage normally the averments in the plaint are required to be considered and not the defence. however, even the averments in the plaint must be supported by some cogent evidence and / or document. mere averments in the plaint to bring the suit within the territorial jurisdiction of the court shall not be sufficient. even otherwise, considering the invoices / documents produced along with plaint i.e. invoices of alka stores and shree krushna dudh ghar produced by the plaintiffs to assert that the goods of the defendant are being sold within the territorial jurisdiction of the court and in turn tried to establish a cause of action within the limits of the court at ahmedabad, the said documents do not in any manner disclose that the goods which are referred to in the invoices are the goods of the defendant. it also does not disclose that the defendant is selling goods through the said vendors or otherwise within the territorial jurisdiction of the court either on a commercial basis or at all. it does not disclose that the transaction produced as proof is a \"real commercial transaction\" and not a \"trap transaction\" set up by the plaintiffs. the invoices merely refer to \" vimal agro products\". even the said writing seems to be overwritten by hand on the original document. the purported label of the goods referred to in the hc-nic page 27 of 29 created on wed aug 16 05:49:33 ist 2017 c/ao/422/2016 cav judgment invoices, which the plaintiffs believe to be the basis of their claim for passing off the goods of the defendant as that of the plaintiffs are also not produced. the said invoices are also not supported by any affidavit of the vendor to the effect that the goods in question are the goods supplied by the defendant to the vendor for sale. the cause of action pleaded in the plaint is reproduced herein above. it appears that the plaintiffs have invoked the jurisdiction of the commercial court at ahmedabad by referring to the following causes in the plaint. i. opposition to the registration of their trade­mark. ii. receipt of acknowledgment of their cease and desist notice. iii. receipt of caveat application iv. website of the respondent. v. purchase of defendants goods in the city of ahmedabad. 10.1. none of the aforesaid causes shall confer the jurisdiction in the commercial court, ahmedabad. thus, on the basis of cause of action pleaded in the plaint, it cannot be said that on such causes pleaded, the commercial court, ahmedabad shall have territorial jurisdiction. 10.2. considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances and more particularly, considering section 20 of the code of civil procedure and cause of action pleaded in the plaint, it cannot be said that the learned commercial court has committed any error in returning the plaint to the plaintiffs to present it before the appropriate court having jurisdiction. hc-nic page 28 of 29 created
