SHAH) [1.0] Feeling  aggrieved  and  dissatisfied   with   the  impugned  judgment  and decree passed by the learned Judge, Commercial Court, Vadodara  (hereinafter referred to as \"learned Commercial Court\") in Commercial  HC-NIC Page 1 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 Civil Suit No.10/2016 by which the learned Commercial Court has partly  decreed   the   said   suit   preferred   by   the   respondent   herein   -   original  plaintiff (hereinafter referred to as \"original plaintiff\") and has held that  the original plaintiff is for the recovery of a sum of Rs.9,97,43,298.97  paise   from   the   appellant   herein   -   original   defendant   (hereinafter  referred to as \"original  defendant\")  along  with  interest at the  rate  of  12% per annum from the date of filing of the suit till the date of decree  and at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of decree till realization  of   the   amount,   the   original   defendant   has  preferred  the   present  First  Appeal. \n[2.0] Facts leading to the present First Appeal in nut­shell are as under:\n[2.1] That   the   original   plaintiff   -   Oil   &   Natural   Gas   Corporation,  Vadodara instituted Special Civil Suit No.426/1993 initially before the  learned   Civil   Court   for   the   recovery   of   Rs.9,97,43,298.97   paise   with  interest at the rate of 21% per annum from the date of filing of the suit  till   realization   of   the   decreetal  amount.  That   on   establishment  of  the  Commercial   Court,   Vadodara,   the   aforesaid   Special   Civil   Suit  No.426/1993 came to be transferred to the Commercial Court, Vadodara  which was numbered as Commercial Civil Suit No.10/2016. \n[2.2] It was the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that the original  defendant   was   in   need   of   natural   gas   as   fuel   for   its   Unit   at   Naroda,  Ahmedabad   and   therefore,   the   original   plaintiff   and   the   original  defendant executed a Contract on 03.10.1985 at Vadodara for the period  of 5 years i.e. commencing with effect from 01.06.1986 to 31.05.1991  containing   the   terms   and   conditions,   definitions   and   interpretations  therein. As per the said Agreement, the natural gas was to be supplied  from the field of the original plaintiff to the Unit of original defendant at  HC-NIC Page 2 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 Naroda,   Ahmedabad.   That   the   defendant   agreed   to   purchase   50,000  Standard M3  of gas per day and it was also agreed that if the original  defendant purchase the gas less than 45,000 Standard M3 per day on any  day,   it   shall   have   to   pay   to   the   original   plaintiff   for   this   minimum  quantity. Thus, quantity of 45,000 M3  of gas was termed as minimum  guaranteed off­take for the  each day. The price of the gas was to be  charged and payable as provided in Annexure­I to the Agreement and  according to that the price of 1000 M3 of gas delivered at the Central Gas  Metering   Station,   shall   be   Rs.2878.87   paise   inclusive   of   Royalty   and  exclusive   of   sales   tax,   duties,   levies,   cess,   fees   etc.   as   applicable   and  payable. It was also mentioned in the Annexure­I of the said Agreement  that the price of the gas mentioned will automatically be adjusted and  stand  revised  on pro­rata  basis  from  the  date  of  Ex  Refinery price  of  furnace   oil   for   non­fertilizer   use   charges   which   was   considered   as  Rs.2903.06 per Kilo Liter. It was also the case on behalf of the original  plaintiff that as per Annexure­I of the said Agreement, the price agreed  upon was subject to revision in accordance with the principles as may be  laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.8530/1983  filed   by  the   ONGC  against   the   Association   of   Natural  Gas   consuming  industries   of   Gujarat.   In   the   said   appeal,   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court  passed an interim order to recover price at Rs.1000 per 1000 M3 for the  gas supplied to those industries. It was the case on behalf of the original  plaintiff that thereafter the issue of the price was decided by the MoP,  NG and by its Notification dated 10.01.1987, the price of the gas was  declared at Rs.1400 per 1000 M3  of the gas at landfall Points and for  onshore   gas   was   fixed.   That   the   said   price   was   exclusive   of   Royalty,  taxes, duties and other statutory levies and the said price was applicable  with immediate effect from the date of the Notification. \n[2.3] It was the case on behalf of the plaintiff that as provided in the  HC-NIC Page 3 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 Agreement dated 03.10.1985 the supply of gas was to be commenced  from  01.06.1986,  but due  to certain  reasons the  said  supply was  not  affected and the gas supply was started from 22.04.1989 and therefore,  a   new   Agreement   was   executed   on   29.07.1988   between   the   parties,  amending   only   certain   Clauses   of   the   original   Contract   and   all   other  terms   and   conditions   of   the   Agreement   dated   03.10.1985   remained  unchanged. It was the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that when  the supply of gas was started to the original defendant, the Notification  of the Government of India, fixing the price of natural gas was in force  and even the Civil Appeals pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court  were also not decided and therefore, the original defendant made the  payment   of   the   gas   supplied   to   them   at   the   price   fixed   by   the  Government. According to the original plaintiff it was clearly provided in  the  Notification  that for  expired contract between  the  ONGC and the  consumer with specified price, the consumers will have to pay the price  mentioned in the Agreement and price notified in the Notification will be  applicable on expiry of the said contract / Agreement. \n[2.4] According   to   the   original   plaintiff,   on   04.05.1990   the   Hon'ble  Supreme Court delivered the verdict in Civil Appeal No.8530/1983 and  other Civil Appeals and upheld the right of the ONGC to fix the price and  also  upheld that  for  fixing   the  price  the  ONGC can  also consider  the  price of the furnace oil. That according to the original plaintiff, therefore  the original plaintiff was entitled to charge the price of gas as mentioned  in the Agreement dated 03.10.1985 and the original defendant was also  required to  make  payment of  the  gas  at  the   price  agreed in   the  said  Agreement. It was the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that despite  number of Telex messages and the communication dated 23.08.1990 to  the original defendant to make the payment at the contractual rates and  also   informed   regarding   the   outstanding   huge   amount   because   of  HC-NIC Page 4 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 difference  in  the  government  rates   and  the   contractual   rates,  but  the  original   defendant   neglected   their   request   to   make   the   payment.  Therefore,   the   plaintiff   instituted   the   aforesaid   suit   for   recovery   of  Rs.9,97,43,298.97   paise   (To   recover   Rs.6,02,83,113.44   paise   towards  amount   of   difference   between   the   contractual   price   and   the   actual  payment made by the original defendant and Rs.3,94,60,185.53 paise  towards   amount   of   interest   at   the   rate   of   21%   from   the   original  defendant). \n[2.5] The   suit   was   resisted   by   the   original   defendant   by   filing   the  Written Statement at Exh.22. It was the case on behalf of the original  defendant that the suit for recovery in respect of the amount alleged to  be due was barred by law of limitation. \n[2.6] It was the case on behalf of the original defendant that as per the  contract   the   original   plaintiff   was   to   start   the   gas   supply   from  01.06.1986, but plaintiff did not supply the gas to the original defendant  from the said date and thereby committed breach of fundamental terms  thereof. It was also contended on behalf of the original defendant that as  the original plaintiff commenced the supply of natural gas to the original  defendant   on   22.04.1989   and   on   that   day   the   Notification   dated  31.01.1987 issued by the Government of India was in force, the price of  the natural gas chargeable from the original defendant to the original  plaintiff and payable to the original plaintiff by the original defendant  was Rs.1400 for 1000 Standard M3. It was also denied by the original  defendant   that   under   the   new   Agreement   dated   30.07.1988,   the  provisions  relating  to price  contained  in   the  said  original  Contract  or  unamended Agreement dated 03.10.1987 remained unchanged. It was  contended that the jurisdiction to fix the prices of the natural gas came  to be vested in or exercised by the Government of India from 30.01.1987  HC-NIC Page 5 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 and therefore, no power, authority or jurisdiction vested in the original  plaintiff to charge or recover with effect from 30.01.1987 or in respect of  natural gas supplied from 30.01.1987, any price other than that fixed by  the Government of India by the said Notification dated 30.01.1987 and  which may be fixed thereafter by the Government of India from time to  time. Therefore, it was contended on behalf of the original defendant  that as the plaintiff started supplying gas to the original defendant with  effect   from   22.04.1989,   the   original   defendant   was   liable   to   pay   the  price for supply of natural gas as per the Notification dated 30.01.1987  only   and   therefore,   the   only   price   which   the   original   plaintiff   could  charge or recover from the consumer including the original defendant  was as per the Notification dated 30.01.1987 issued by the Government  of India. The original  defendant also disputed the  liability to pay the  interest on the delayed payment. Therefore, it was requested to dismiss  the suit. \n[2.7] That the learned trial Court framed the following issues at Exh.25. \n1. Whether the plaintiff proves that he is entitled to get relief prays  for?\n2. Whether the plaintiff proves that he is entitled to get interest as  prays for ?\n3. Whether the defendant proves that the plaintiff's suit is barred by  the provisions of the Limitation Act ?\n4.

It   is   submitted   that   in   the   meantime   the   Government   of  India   determined   the   price   for   supply   of   gas   vide   Notification   dated  30.01.1987   to   be   supplied   at   the   rate   of   Rs.1400   and   therefore,   the  ONGC could have charged for supply of gas at the rate of Rs.1400 only  and   therefore,   the   original   defendant   was   liable   to   pay   the   price   for  supply of gas at Rs.1400/­ for 1000 Standard M3 only, which the original  defendant paid. It is submitted that therefore the learned Commercial  Court as such ought not to have decreed the suit. \n[4.3] It   is   submitted   by   Shri   Thakore,   learned   Senior   Advocate  appearing   on   behalf   of   the   original   defendant   that   the   learned  Commercial Court has materially erred in not properly appreciating the  fact that the original Contract dated 03.10.1985 (Exh.40) never came  into effect or commenced, since ONGC did not commence supply of gas  from 01.06.1986. It is submitted that even the ONGC did not commence  supply   of   gas   until   much   after   the   Price   Order   dated   30.01.1987  (Exh.57).   It   is   submitted   by   Shri   Thakore,   learned   Senior   Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original defendant that therefore as such the  original contract / Agreement did not come into effect, more particularly  HC-NIC Page 11 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 when the Price Order dated 30.01.1987 was issued. It is submitted that  therefore,   the   original   Contract   could   not   have   been   termed   as   an  \"unexpired contract\" as on the date of the Price Order dated 30.01.1987.  It is submitted that therefore Clause 4 of the Price Order shall not be  applicable to the present case and the gas price would be governed by  the Price Order. \n[4.4]  It is further submitted by Shri Thakore, learned Senior Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original defendant that as such the intent and  purpose of the Clause 4 of the Price Order dated 30.01.1987 was only to  allow   ONGC   to   charge   the   contractual   price   where   it   was   already  supplying   gas   under   a   contract   which   was   already   in   effect.   It   is  submitted that intention behind the aforesaid Clause in the Price Order  dated 30.01.1987 was to allow ONGC to complete its contracts which  were in the  course of being performed at the  time of issuance of the  Price Order. It is submitted that in the present case the original Contract  was not in effect as on the date of the Price Order dated 30.01.1987 and  therefore, it would be de hors the intent and purpose of the Price Order  dated 30.01.1987 to allow ONGC to charge any price over and above the  Government of India fixed price in respect of the supplies made under a  contract which did not come into effect until much after the said Price  Order. It is further submitted by Shri Thakore, learned Senior Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the term \"unexpired  contracts\" in the context in which it has been placed in Clause 4 of the  Price Order dated 30.01.1987 has to mean only those contracts which  were,   as   on   30.01.1987,   being   performed   or   in   other   words   under  performance or in the course of the performance and some period of  performance was still remaining to be completed. It is submitted that the  words \"unexpired contracts\" cannot refer to the period remaining in the  total period of contract even when such contract and its  performance  HC-NIC Page 12 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 had actually not commenced.  \n[4.5]  It is further submitted by Shri Thakore, learned Senior Advocate  appearing  on  behalf  of  the   original   defendant   that   even   otherwise   in  view   of   and   by   virtue   of   the   subsequent   contract   dated   29.07.1988,  original Contract cannot be said to have been in existence and/or the  same was not to be acted upon. It is submitted that the original Contract  executed was for the sole purpose of supplying natural gas by ONGC to  the original defendant from the field Ramol - Baola and in the manner  stipulated therein. It is submitted that consideration for the same was  the price payable to ONGC by the original defendant in terms of Clause  10   read   with   Annexure­I   thereto.   That   the   gas   price   in   the   original  Contract was mutually agreed upon as consideration for the duration,  place and manner of supply of gas under the original Contract and the  said gas price agreed upon cannot be delinked from what it stood for in  the original Contract. It is submitted that by virtue  of the subsequent  Contract dated 29.07.1988 (Exh.39), the terms of the original Contract  underwent substantial and fundamental changes going to the root of the  contract.   It   is   submitted   that   as   per   the   subsequent   Contract   dated  29.07.1988   (Exh.39),   (a)   duration   of   supply   of   gas,   i.e.,   instead   of  supply   commencing   from   01.06.1986,   it   was   to   commence   from  31.12.1988, and by virtue of this change, more than 2 and ½ years of  gas   supply  got  canceled;   (b)  the  gas   field   from  which  gas   was   to  be  supplied underwent  a complete change, i.e. from Ramol - Baola field, it  was changed to Kalol field; (c) the manner and place of delivery of gas  changed, by virtue of which the passing of the title to the gas would get  altered; (d) the provisions regarding gas transportation were changed. It  is submitted that therefore considering Section 62 of the Indian Contract  Act, on account of alteration or substitution in the original Contract, the  original Contract does not continue or remain in existence any more and  HC-NIC Page 13 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 need not be performed and therefore, the original Contract could not  have been said to be an \"unexpired contract\" as contained in Clause 4 of  the Price Order dated 30.01.1987. It is submitted that therefore Clause 4  of   Price   Order   dated   30.01.1987   which   applies   only   to   \"unexpired  contract\",   would   not   apply   in   the   present   case,   once   the   original  Contract got substituted or altered.  \n[4.6] It   is   submitted   that   therefore   the   learned   Judge   has   materially  erred in treating the term \"unexpired contracts\" as meaning \"contracts in  existence\" and in holding, in effect, that the contracts which were merely  in existence by virtue of their having been signed by the parties, even  though   not   in   effect   and   not   being   performed,   were   to   be   neglected  within Clause 4 of the Price Order dated 30.01.1987. It is submitted that  therefore,   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   materially   erred   in   not  properly appreciating the applicability of principle of Section 62 of the  Indian  Contract  Act and  hence, has  failed to appreciate  that,  when  a  contract   is   substantially   and   fundamentally   altered,   it   is   a   case   of  novation   and   the   original   Contract   cannot   be   treated   as   valid   and  existing. \n[4.7]  It is further submitted by Shri Thakore, learned Senior Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original defendant that even otherwise part of  the   plaintiff's   claim   was   clearly   barred   by   law   of   limitation.   It   is  submitted by Shri Thakore, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf  of the original defendant that the suit was filed on 02.05.1993 in regard  to   a   claim   in   respect   of   the   gas   supply   period   from   22.04.1989   to  31.05.1991. It is submitted that the invoices in respect to the said period  were issued from 13.05.1989 to 04.06.1991 (Exh.70 to Exh.100). It is  submitted that as per the terms of the contracts the payment was to be  made within 10 days of the receipt of the said invoices. It is submitted  HC-NIC Page 14 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 that as such the learned Commercial Court has rightly held that Article  15 of the Limitation Act would not apply to the claim, as there was no  stay  or   injunction   against   the   original   plaintiff   restraining   it   from  instituting the suit. It is submitted that therefore as on the date of the  suit i.e. as on 02.05.1993, all the invoices issued prior to 22.04.1990  were  certainly barred  by  limitation.  It  is  submitted  that  therefore   the  invoices from Exh.70 to Exh.83 were clearly time barred. \n[4.8] It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Thakore,   learned   Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the learned  Commercial Court has materially erred in holding that the extension of  Bank Guarantee on 03.08.1990 and the letter dated 17.08.1990 amounts  to acknowledgment of liability in writing by the original defendant and  therefore, would extend the period of limitation. \n[4.9] It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Thakore,   learned   Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the learned  Commercial   Court   has   overlooked   the   fact   that   section   18   of   the  Limitation Act which pertains to extension of limitation on account of  the acknowledgment would not apply in the present case. It is submitted  that   section  18  of   the  Limitation   Act  would  apply  only  if   there  is  an  \"acknowledgment of liability\" in respect of any property and right. It is  submitted   that   an   \"acknowledgment   of   liability\"   means   a   conscious  admission   of   a   jural   relationship   between   parties   and   a   subsisting  liability (of the person making such acknowledgment) flowing from the  same. Moreover, such acknowledgment or liability  has  to be  made  in  writing, signed by the party against whom the right is claimed or by an  agent duly authorized in this behalf. \nIn support of his above submission, Shri Thakore, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant has relied on the  HC-NIC Page 15 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 decision   of   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in   the   case   of  Krishnappa  Chettiar v. Somiali reported in AIR 1964 SC 227 (Para 14) and in the  case of  Tilak Ram vs. Nathu  reported in  AIR 1967 SC 935 (Para 10)  and in the case of State of Kerala vs. T.M. Chacko reported in (2000) 9  SCC 722 (Para 10). \n[4.10] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Thakore,   learned   Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that insofar as  the Bank Guarantee on 03.08.1990 (Exh.113) is concerned, it was issued  under specific terms of the contract which required issuance of a Bank  Guarantee and hence, (1) it cannot constitute an \"acknowledgment of  liability\", (2) if the said Bank Guarantee is perused, it, in fact, does not  contain   any   \"acknowledgment   of   liability\",   (3)   it   was   issued  guaranteeing payment in respect of 62 days of gas supply and not for the  full   contract   and   hence,   it   cannot   constitute   \"acknowledgment   of  liability\" in regard to the full claim under the contract, (4) it was issued  by Syndicate Bank (Guarantor) to the original plaintiff on a principle to  principle basis and is recognized in law as an independent contract and  therefore, it is not an acknowledgment of liability made in writing and  signed   by   the   original   defendant   or   its   agent   duly   authorized   in   this  behalf.   In   light   of   the   aforesaid   it   is   submitted   that   the   said   Bank  Guarantee cannot extend the period of limitation. \n[4.11] Now,   so   far   as   the   letter   dated   17.08.1990   (Exh.114)   is  concerned, it is submitted that it only encloses the Bank Guarantees to  be   sent   to   the   original   plaintiff   and   does   not   contain   any  \"acknowledgment   of   liability\"   and   it   is   not   issued   by   any   person  authorized   on   behalf   of   the   original   defendant   to   issue   an  \"acknowledgment of liability\" and hence, it is submitted that it does not  contain any words which can be considered as an \"acknowledgment of  HC-NIC Page 16 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 liability\".   It   is   submitted   that   the   said   letter   is   still   not   an  acknowledgment of liability made by the original defendant or its agent  duly authorized in this behalf.\n  [4.12] Shri Thakore, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf  of the original defendant has further submitted that it is not the case (as  pleaded or as proved) of the original plaintiff that any documents on  record constitutes an acknowledgment of liability or that the period of  limitation   got   extended   under   Section   18   of   the   Limitation   Act.   It   is  submitted that therefore the learned Commercial Court could not have  arrived   at   such   a   finding   which   was   not   supported   by   pleadings   and  evidence. \n[4.13] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Thakore,   learned   Senior  Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original defendant that even the  learned Commercial Court has materially erred in awarding the interest  at the rate of 21% per annum till the date of the suit even though no  evidence was led in this regard by the original plaintiff. It is submitted  by Shri Thakore, learned Senior  Advocate  appearing  on  behalf  of  the  original defendant that the principal sum claimed was Rs.6,02,83,113.44  paise and the total claim of Rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise is made in the suit  inclusive of interest at the rate of 21% per annum on the principal sum  of Rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise. \n[4.14] It   is   submitted   that   as   per   Clause   11.02   of   the   original  Contract   (Exh.40),   the   original   defendant   was   required   to   pay   the  interest on delayed payment at the rate of 1% higher than the rate of  interest   payable   by   the   original   plaintiff   on   its   cash   credit   agreement  with State Bank of India from time to time. It is submitted that however  the original plaintiff had not led any evidence as to what was the rate of  interest chargeable by State Bank of India.\nHC-NIC Page 17 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 [4.15] It is submitted that therefore the learned Commercial Court  has materially erred in awarding interest at the rate of 21% till the filing  of the suit, as claimed by the original plaintiff. It is submitted that as  such   the   Court   has   no   jurisdiction   to   award   pre­suit   interest.   It   is  submitted that in any case, even assuming without admitting the Court  has jurisdiction to award pre­suit interest even though as no evidence  was led, the pre­suit interest awarded by the learned Commercial Court  is grossly excessive. \n[4.16] It   is   further   submitted   by   Shri   Thakore,   learned   Senior  Advocate   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   original   defendant   that   even  otherwise   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   materially   erred   in  awarding the interest on interest.\n[4.17] It is vehemently submitted that section 34 of the Code of  Civil Procedure, 1908 confers jurisdiction on the Court to only award the  interest on the principal sum adjudged and not interest on interest. It is  submitted   that   in   the   present   case   the   principal   sum   claimed   was  Rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise  and the total claim of Rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise  as made in the suit was inclusive of the interest at the rate of 12% per  annum on the principal sum of Rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise. It is submitted  that   as   such   there   was   no   provision   in   the   original   Contract   or   the  Contract 29.07.1988 for capitalization interest so as to make it part of  the principal sum. It is submitted that therefore the learned Commercial  Court   has   materially   erred   in   awarding   interest   on   interest   more  particularly interest on Rs.3,94,60,185.53 paise. \nMaking above submissions and relying upon the above decisions,  it is requested to allow the present appeal. \n[5.0] Present First Appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri Ajay Mehta,  learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff. \nHC-NIC Page 18 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 [5.1] It   is   submitted   by   Shri   Mehta,   learned   Advocate   appearing   on  behalf of the original plaintiff that in the facts and circumstances of the  case,   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   not   committed   any   error   in  decreeing the suit (partly). It is submitted that the finding recorded by  the learned Commercial Court that the original defendant is liable to pay  the price for supply of gas as per the original Contract dated 03.10.1985  and   that   the   original   Contract   dated   03.10.1985   can   be   said   to   be  \"unexpired contracts\" and therefore, considering Clause 4 of the Price  Order   dated   30.01.1987,   the   price   mentioned   in   the   Government  Notification   Price   Order   dated   30.01.1987   shall   not   be   applicable,   is  based on appreciation of evidence more particularly on interpretation of  the   documentary   evidence   on   record   more   particularly   the   original  Contract   dated   03.10.1985   (Exh.40);   the   Government   Notification   /  Price   Order   dated   30.01.1987   and   the   modified   Contract   dated  29.07.1998.   It   is   submitted   that   therefore,   finding   recorded   by   the  learned Commercial Court cannot be said to be either perverse and/or  contrary to the evidence on record. \n[5.2] It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Advocate appearing  on behalf of the original plaintiff that the learned Commercial Court has  rightly   directed   the   original   defendant   to   pay   the   price   for   the   gas  supplied   as   per   the   original   Contract   dated   03.10.1985.   It   is   further  submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the  original   plaintiff   that   even   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   rightly  decreed the suit by awarding the interest (pre­suit) at the rate of 21%. It  is submitted that awarding the interest at the rate of 21% at pre­suit is  absolutely in consonance with the terms and conditions of the original  Contract   dated   03.10.1985.   It   is   submitted   that   as   such   the   original  defendant never disputed before the learned Commercial Court that the  rate of interest at the rate of 21% would be 1% more than the rate of  HC-NIC Page 19 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 interest charged by the State Bank of India. It is submitted that when  there were specific pleadings in the suit claiming the interest at the rate  of 21% for pre­suit period and the same was not disputed and/or denied  by the original defendant and/or no other contrary evidence was led, the  learned Commercial Court has rightly awarded the interest at the rate of  21% for pre­suit period. \n[5.3] It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Mehta,   learned   Advocate  appearing   on   behalf   of   the   original   plaintiff   that   in   the   facts   and  circumstances of the case, the learned Commercial Court has rightly held  the suit within the period of limitation. It is submitted that the learned  Commercial Court has rightly held that the suit is not barred by law of  limitation as contended on behalf of the original defendant. \n[5.4] It is further submitted by Shri Mehta, learned Advocate appearing  on behalf of the original plaintiff that in the facts and circumstances of  the case the learned Commercial Court has not committed any error in  awarding the interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of  filing of the suit till the judgment and decree and at the rate of 9% per  annum from the date of judgment and decree till the realization of the  amount. \nMaking above submissions, it is requested to dismiss the present  First Appeal. \n[6.0] Heard learned Counsel appearing for respective parties at length.  We have  perused and considered the impugned judgment and decree  passed by the learned Commercial Court. We have also re­appreciated  the entire evidence on record from the Record & Proceedings received  from   the   learned   Commercial   Court   as   well   as   from   the   paper­book  produced   by  the   learned  Counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   original  defendant. \nHC-NIC Page 20 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 [6.1] The main dispute between the original plaintiff and the original  defendant is whether the original plaintiff is entitled to recover and/or  whether the original defendant is liable to pay the price for supply of  Natural Gas at the rate of Rs.2903.06 per 100 Standard M3  as per the  original Contract dated 03.10.1985 (Exh.40) or as per the Price Order /  Government of India Notification dated 30.01.1987 (Exh.57). It is not in  dispute   that   as   per   the   Contract   /   Agreement   executed   between   the  original plaintiff and original defendant (Exh.40) the price for supply of  Natural Gas was fixed at Rs.2903.06 paise per kilo liter. As per Clause  2.01   of   the   original   Contract   dated   03.10.1985   the   contract   shall  commence into force from 01.06.1986 i.e. the date of commencement of  supply   of   gas   and   the   validity   period   was   5   years   ending   upto  31.05.1991. However, subsequently, the Government of India issued the  notification  / Price Order dated 30.01.1987  determining  the  price for  supply of Natural Gas on Rs.1400 per kilo liter. However, as per Clause 4  the determination of price as per the Price Order / Notification dated  30.01.1987 shall not be applicable to the \"unexpired contracts\". Clause 4  of the Price Order dated 30.01.1987 reads as under:\n\"4. There   are   some   unexpired   contracts   between   ONGC   /  OIL and some consumers with specified prices. These contracts  will   have   to   run   their   course   and   the   prices   now   fixed   will  apply after the contract period expires.\" \nIt   is   true   that   as   per   the   original   Contract   the   date   of  commencement of the supply was 01.06.1986 (as per clause 2.01 of the  original Contract). It is also true that there was no supply of gas from  01.06.1986   and   infact   the   supply   of   gas   started   from   22.04.1989.  However,   it   is   required   to   be   noted   that   some   terms   and   conditions  mentioned   in   the   original   Contract   dated   03.10.1985   came   to   be  modified / substituted by the subsequent Contract dated 29.07.1988 and  HC-NIC Page 21 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 in Article 2.01 the words i.e. \"date  of commencement of supply\" was  substituted   by   \"gas   supply   shall   commence   from   31.12.1988\".   There  were other some changes in para 2. Therefore, it is the case on behalf of  the  original  defendant  that  in  view  of  the  subsequent Contract  dated  29.07.1988, the original Contract dated 03.10.1985 was not acted upon  and there was no supply of gas even on the date of on which the Price  Order   dated   30.01.1987   was   issued   by   the   Government   of   India   and  therefore,   it   cannot   be   said   that   the   original   Contract   was   unexpired  contract as per Clause 4 of the Price Order and therefore, the original  defendant was liable to pay the price for supply of Natural Gas at the  rate   of   Rs.1400   per   1000   Standard   M3  as   per   the   Price   Order   dated  30.01.1987. It is also the case on behalf of the original defendant that  considering Section 62 of the Indian Contract Act there was novation of  contract   more   particularly   in   view   of   the   subsequent   Contract   dated  29.07.1988 and therefore, the original Contract / Agreement was not to  be acted upon and therefore, it cannot be said to be a continued contract  more particularly at the time when the Price Order dated 30.01.1987  was issued by the Government of India. The aforesaid submission seems  to be attractive but has no substance. \nAt the  outset it  is  required to be  noted that  by the  subsequent  Contract executed on 29.07.1988 it cannot be said that a new Contract  came into existence and/or the original Contract (Exh.40) came to be an  end and/or was not to be acted upon. By the subsequent Contract dated  29.07.1988,   some   of   the   terms   and   conditions   only   came   to   be  substituted and the rest of the terms and conditions mentioned in the  original   Contract   continued   to   operate.   In   para   12   of   the   subsequent  Agreement / Contract dated 29.07.1988, it is specifically mentioned that  the amendment in the Contract dated 29.07.1988 shall form part of the  original   Contract   dated   03.10.1985   and   that   all   other   terms   and  HC-NIC Page 22 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 conditions   of   the   Contract   dated   03.10.1985   shall   remain   unchanged  and binding on the parties. Clause 12 of the Contract dated 29.07.1988  reads as under: \n\"12.  The   above   amendment   shall   form   part   of   the   contract  dated  3rd   day   of   October,   One   thousand   nine   hundred   and  eighty five and all other terms and conditions of the contract  dated   3rd   day   of   October,   One   thousand   nine   hundred   and  eighty   five   shall   remain   unchanged   and   binding   on   the  parties.\"\nIn light of the above it cannot be said that the case will fall under  section 62 of the Indian Contract Act and it cannot be said that there  was novation of the original Contract, in light of the subsequent Contract  dated 29.07.1988 as sought to be contended on behalf of the original  defendant. \n[6.2] Under   the   circumstances,   it   cannot   be   said   that   the   original  Contract / Agreement dated 03.10.1985 shall come to an end and/or  was not to be acted upon and/or the same can be said to be a fresh  Agreement / Contract. Under the circumstances, as on 30.01.1987, i.e.  when the Price Order came to be issued by the Government of India the  original Contract / Agreement can be said to be \"unexpired Agreement /  contract\"   and   therefore,   as   per   Clause   4   of   the   Price   Order   dated  30.01.1987, the price determined / mentioned in the Price Order shall  not affect the price mentioned in the original Contract dated 03.10.1985  and   therefore,   the   original   defendant   was   liable   to   pay   the   price   for  supply of gas as per the original Contract / Agreement dated 03.10.1985  and   the   parties   shall   be   governed   by   the   original   Contract   dated  03.10.1985. \n[6.3] Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the original defendant  that   as,   as   per   the   original   Contract   dated   03.10.1985,   the   date   of  commencement of supply was 01.06.1986 and admittedly the gas supply  HC-NIC Page 23 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 was commenced much later i.e. on 22.04.1989 after two years of the  Price Order dated 30.01.1987 and the ONGC did not start supplying gas  on 31.12.1988 (as per the subsequent Contract dated 29.07.1988) and  therefore, there was a breach of the terms of the original contract and  the submission on behalf of the appellant that as the day on which the  Price Order was issued on 30.01.1987, there was no supply of Natural  Gas and consequently the contract was not performed and therefore, the  original   Contract   cannot   be   said   to   be   \"unexpired   contracts\"   is  concerned, the aforesaid has no substance. As per the original Contract  dated 03.10.1985 more particularly Clause 2.01, the period of contract  mentioned   is   for   a   period   of   5   years   commencing   from   01.06.1986  ending   upto   31.05.1991.   Therefore,   as   per   Clause   2.01,   the   contract  shall   come   into   force   from   01.06.1986,   which   was   the   date   of  commencement of the supply of gas and shall remain in force over a  period   of   5   years   ending   upto   31.05.1991.   As   per   the   subsequent  Contract dated 29.07.1988, the date of commencement of supply of gas  was substituted from 01.06.1986 to 31.12.1988. Clause 4 of the Price  Order,   which   is   reproduced   hereinabove,   provides   that   the   prices  mentioned in the said Price Order / Notification shall be applicable after  existing   contract   period   expires.   If   the   submission   on   behalf   of   the  original defendant as mentioned hereinabove is accepted, it would be  adding something in para 4 of the Price Order, which is not there. Under  the circumstances, Contract / Agreement executed between the original  plaintiff   and   the   original   defendant   can   be   said   to   be   \"unexpired  contracts\"   within   Clause   4   of   the   Price   Order   dated   30.01.1987   and  therefore, the price determined / mentioned in the Price Order dated  30.01.1987  shall  not be applicable with  respect to the  contract dated  03.10.1985   and   the   original   defendant   is   liable   to   pay   the   supply   of  Natural Gas at the rate mentioned in the original Contract / Agreement  dated   03.10.1985.   Under   the   circumstances,   no   error   has   been  HC-NIC Page 24 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 committed   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court   in   holding   so   more  particularly in holding that the original defendant is liable to pay the  price or supply of gas as per the original Contract dated 03.10.1985 and  not   as   per   the   Price   Order   dated   30.01.1987.   We   are   in   complete  agreement with the view taken by the learned Commercial Court. \n[6.4] Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the original defendant  that   part   of   the   ONGC's   claim   was   barred   by   law   of   limitation   more  particularly   the   invoices   from   Exh.70   to   Exh.83   were   time   barred   is  concerned,   it   is   required   to   be   noted   that   applying   section   18   of   the  Limitation   Act,   which   pertains   to   extension   period   of   limitation   on  account of acknowledgment, the learned Commercial Court has held the  claim in the suit within the period of limitation. While applying section  18 of the Limitation  Act and holding that the suit claim is within the  period of limitation, the learned Commercial Court has considered the  extension of Bank Guarantee/s which were furnished as per the original  Contract and/or subsequent Contract, as an acknowledgment of the dues  and therefore, considering the date of extension of Bank Guarantee as an  acknowledgment of the dues, applying section 18 of the Limitation Act,  the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   held   the   suit   within   the   period   of  limitation. While deciding the issue with respect to the limitation and  while   dealing   with   issue   No.3,   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has  observed in paras 17 and 18 as under:\n\"17. I have considered the rival submissions of the Ld. Counsel for the  parties. The plaintiff herein claimed payment of bills with effect from  the   date   of   13/05/1989  till   04/06/1991.  Admittedly,  the   suit  has  been   instituted   on   03/05/1993.   Now   the   question   arises   as   to  whether the cause of action to file the present suit arose when the  Hon'ble Supreme Court declared the judgment in Civil Appeal No.  8530/1983  on   4.5.1990.  At   this   juncture,   it   would  not   be   out   of  context (at the cost of repetition) to refer the clauses of Annexrue ­I  of the agreement­contract at Exh. 40.\nHC-NIC Page 25 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 PRICING \"1.  The price of  1000 (one  thousand only ) standard  cubic  meters of GAS delivered at the Central GAS Metering Station /  Sub Station located in the SELLER's premises shall be 2878.87.  (Rupees Two thousand eight seventy eight and paise eighty  seven only).\n2. The price of the GAS mentioned above will automatically be  adjusted and stand revised on pro­rata basis from the date of  the Ex. Refinery Price of Furnace Oil considred is Rs. 2903.06  per KL as advised by the Govt. of India.\n3.  The  price  now  agreed  upon  is  subject  to   the  revision  in  accordance  with  the   principle  as   may  be   laid   down  by   the  Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 8530/83 ONGC VS  Association of  Natural  Gas  Consuming  Industries of  Gujarat  and others pending disposal before the Supreme Court.\"\n17.1 Considering all the three clauses, it is apparent that the price of  the Gas was already fixed by the parties and the said price had to be  adjusted in accordance to the judgment in Civil Appeal No. 8530/83.  Meaning thereby, if the price fixed between the parties is higher than  the price approved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid  appeal,   then   defendant   to   to   made   to   additional   payment   to   the  Plaintiff   on   account   of   differential   amount   but   if   the   Hon'ble  Suprreme Court determined the price below the price fixed by the  Contract,  than  plaintiff   has  to   made  the   adjustment  of   the   excess  amount paid by the defendant. Thus, the judgment of the Hon'ble  Supreme Court has nothing to do with the right of the plaintiff to  recover the price of the Gas in accordance to the aforesaid clause 1 of  the Annexure. Thus, the cause of action had arisen in the favour since  the date of each bill and not from the date of pronouncement of the  judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court on 4.5.1990.\n17.2 As far the plea as to whether in the present case, the Article 1 or  the Article 15 the Limitation Act shall be applicable is concerned, the  plaintiff has not filed any statement of account on records, however,  the suit has been instituted on the basis of the Bills/ Invoces placed  on   paper   book  at   Exh   70   to   101.  Article   1   of   the   Limitation  Act  applies   in   the   cases   where   the   parties   maintained   the   running  account, therefore, in the present case, Article 1 of the Limitation Act  is not applicable. As per agreement, the period of credit was 10 days  to   make   the   payment   of   the   amount   due   and   payable   under   the  invoices.  Article  15  deals  with  the  cases  where  the  goods  sold  on  credit. As per Article 15 of the Limitation Act, the period of limitation  in respect of payment due against the bills is 3 (Three) years from the  date of period of credit expires. The Article 15 of the Limitation Act is  HC-NIC Page 26 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 reproduced herein for the sake of convenience.\n                     Description of Suit                   Period of          Time from which period \n                                                          Limitation               begins to run\n                    15.  For   the   price   of          Three years          When the period of \n                    goods   sold   and                                        credit expires,\n                    delivered to be paid for \n                    after   the   expiry   of   a \n                    fixed period of credit\n17.3  In the present case, the Clause  11.01  deals with the period of  Credit. The same is reproduced herein.\n\"11.01.  The  Seller  shall issue and send  to the Buyer  invoices   covering   the   total   quantity   of   gas   delivered   by   the   Seller   in   accordance with relevant provisions of this contract during each   fortnight for payment. The Buyer shall pay in full within ten   (10)   days   of   the   receipt   of   such   invoices   the   amount   so   mentioned   in   such   invoices.   For   this   purpose   the   fortnight   would   commence   at   0700   hours   of   first   (1st)   day   to   0700   hours   of   sixteenth   (16th)   day   and   0700   hours   of   sixteenth   (16th) day to 0700 hours of 1st day of the succeeding calender   month. In case there is any dispute regarding billing the Buyer   shall   not   withhold   payment.   After   making   full   payment,   the   Buyer shall lodge the claims to the Seller giving full particulars   within a period of fourteen days (14) from the date of making   the payment, and such claims if found correct, the Seller shall   adjust   against   the   next   invoice   of   supply   of   gas.   No   interest   shall accrue on such refunds by the Seller to the Buyer.\" \nThe   perusal   of   the   aforesaid   Clause   of   the   agreement  at   Exh.   40  clearly transpires that the period of credit was 10 days. The case of  the plaintiff falls under Article 15 of the Limitation Act. I have also  considered the judgment of the Hon'ble Madaras High Court in the  case of  A. L. A. R. R. M Arunachallam Chetti  (supra), wherein the  Hon'ble Court held that in ordinary suit upon accounts the limitation  period to recover the money is three years. \n18.  In the present case, the defendant had also furnished the bank  guarantee  at Exh.101, in pursuance to the terms and conditions of  the Agreement­contract at Exh. 40, for a sum of Rs. 89,24,497/­ . The  said Bank Guarantee was extended by the defendant time to time and  lastly   extended   on   03.08.1990   vide   Exh.   113.   Not   only   this,   the  defendant sent the said Extension of Bank Guarantee to the plaintiff  alongwith   the   Letter   dated   17.08.1990   at   Exh.   114.   The   said  extension   of   Bank   Guarantee   took   place   within   the   period   of  HC-NIC Page 27 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 limitation at the behest of the defendant. Thus, in view of section 18  of  the  Limitation Act, said extension of bank guarantee and letter  dated   17.08.1990   at   Exh.   114   amounts   the   acknowledgement   of  liability in writing by the defendant with in the period of limitation,  therefore   it   extend   the   period   of   limitation.   Thus,   I   am   of   the  considered   view   that   the   suit   of   the   plaintiff   is   not   barred   by  limitation. Thus, the present issue is decided against the defendant  and in favour of the plaintiff.\"\n[6.5] From   the   aforesaid   it   appears   that   extension   of   Bank  Gurarantee   on   03.08.1990   (Exh.113)   is   considered   to   be   the  \"acknowledgment of liability\" in writing by the original defendant. There  the learned Commercial Court has committed an error. The extension of  Bank Guarantee which was furnished earlier as per the original Contract,  subsequently   after   the   validity   period   of   the   Bank   Guarantee   had  expired, by no stretch of imagination can be said to be \"acknowledgment  of the liability\" in writing  by the original defendant. Extension of the  original Bank Guarantee which was initially furnished as per the original  Contract cannot be said to be \"acknowledgment of the liability\" and it  will   not   extend   the   period   of   limitation   as   per   Section   18   of   the  Limitation   Act.   Therefore,   we   are   of   the   opinion   that   the   learned  Commercial Court has committed a grave error in applying section 18 of  the Limitation Act treating and/or considering the extension of the Bank  Guarantee   on   03.08.1990   as   an   \"acknowledgment   of   the   liability\"   in  writing by the original defendant and in holding the suit claim within  the period of limitation and consequently has materially erred in holding  that the suit of the plaintiff is not barred by limitation. \n[6.6] As observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of  Tilak  Ram   vs.   Nathu  reported   in  AIR   1967   SC   935   (1),   mere   statement  expressing   jural   relationship   between   the   parties   does   not   constitute  acknowledgment.   Therefore,   the   extension   of   the   Bank   Guarantee  HC-NIC Page 28 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 cannot   be   said   to   be   one   made   with   intention   of   admitting   the   jural  relationship and/or acknowledging the debt. \nIn the case of State of Kerala vs. T.M. Chacko reported in (2000)  9 SCC 722 while considering the scope and ambit of section 18 of the  Limitation   Act   and   while   considering   the   issue   with   respect   to  acknowledgment vis­a­vis section 18 of the Limitation Act, it is observed  by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 10 as under:\n\"10. It may be noted that for treating a writing signed by the   party as an acknowledgment, the person acknowledging must be   conscious   of   his   liability   and   the   commitment   should   be   made   towards that liability. It need not be specific but if necessary facts   which   constitute   the   liability   are   admitted   an   acknowledgment   may be inferred from such an admission.\" \n[6.7] It is the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that as the dispute  with   respect   to   the   pricing   was   pending   before   the   Hon'ble   Supreme  court in Civil Appeal No.8530/1983 and therefore, the cause of action to  file the suit can be said to have arisen when the Hon'ble Supreme Court  declared   the   judgment   in   Civil   Appeal   No.8530/1983   on   04.05.1990  which was in favour of the ONGC and therefore, the suit can be said to  be   within   the   period   of   limitation.   However,   the   aforesaid   is   not  accepted by the learned Commercial Court by observing that considering  section 15 of the Limitation Act, as there was no injunction restraining  the   original   plaintiff   from   filing   the   suit   for   recovery,   the   original  plaintiff cannot get the benefit of the dispute pending before the Hon'ble  Supreme Court. However, it is required to be noted that while deciding  the issue with respect to limitation, what has been mainly weighed with  the learned Commercial Court is the extension of Bank Guarantee and  treating   the   extension   of   Bank   Guarantee   as   \"acknowledgment   of  liability\"   in   writing   by   the   original   defendant   within   the   period   of  limitation   and   applying   section   18   of   the   Limitation   Act,   the   learned  Commercial Court has decided the issue of limitation in favour of the  HC-NIC Page 29 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 original plaintiff and against the original defendant. No other discussion  is there with respect to the case on behalf of the original defendant that  claim with respect to some of the invoices more particularly invoice at  Exh.70   to   Exh.83   were   barred   by   limitation,   more   particularly  considering specific terms and conditions of the original Contract dated  03.10.1985, that the payment was required to be made within a period  of   10   days   from   the   date   of   issuance   of   the   invoices.   Under   the  circumstances, while quashing and setting aside the finding recorded by  the learned Commercial Court on the issue of limitation, the matter is  required to be remanded to the learned Commercial Court to consider  the issue with respect to the limitation afresh and in accordance with  law   and   on   merits   and   on   the   basis   of   the   evidence   already   led.  Therefore,   the   finding   recorded   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court  holding the issue with respect to the limitation in favour of the original  plaintiff deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed  and set aside and the matter is remanded to the learned Commercial  Court   to   decide   the   issue   with   respect   to   the   limitation   afresh   in  accordance  with  law and on  merits  and on  the  basis  of the  evidence  already led. \n[6.8] Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the original defendant  that   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   materially   erred   in   awarding  interest   at   the   rate   of   21%   per   annum   for   the   pre­suit   period   is  concerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that as per the terms  and   conditions   mentioned   in   original   Contract   dated   03.10.1985,   on  delayed payment the ONGC was entitled to the interest at the rate of 1%  higher than the rate of interest payable by the ONGC on its cash credit  agreement with the State Bank of India from time to time. Clause 11.02  of the Contract / Agreement reads as under: \n\"11.02 - The Buyer shall pay interest on all delayed payments at the  HC-NIC Page 30 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 rate of one percent (1%) higher than the rate of interest payable by  the Seller on its cash credit arrangement with the State Bank of India  from time to time. Delayed payment means any payment not received  within the period provided in Clause 11.01 above. The right of Seller  will be independent to the right as per Clause 11.04 hereinabove.\"\n[6.9] In the examination in chief the witness examined on behalf of the  original plaintiff has specifically deposed that as per clause 11.02 of the  Agreement, the original plaintiff is also entitled for interest on all the  delayed payment @ 1% over and above the rate of interest payable by  the ONGC on its cash credit agreement with the State Bank of India and  that   the   original   plaintiff   has   calculated   the   interest   on   the   principal  amount   till   the   date   of   filing   the   suit.   No   question   is   asked   by   the  original defendant in the cross. Even in the written statement also there  is no specific denial with respect to the charging of the interest for the  pre­suit period, at the rate of 21% as claimed by the original plaintiff.  Under the circumstances and in the facts and circumstances of the case  and more particularly, considering the evidence on record, it cannot be  said   that   the   learned   Commercial   Court   has   committed   any   error   in  allowing the claim of the original plaintiff claiming interest at the rate of  21%   per   annum   i.e.   at   the   rate   of   1%   over   and   above   the   interest  payable by the ONGC on its cash credit agreement with the State Bank  of   India   for   pre­suit   period.   Under   the   circumstances,   the   learned  Commercial Court has rightly decreed the suit awarding the interest on  the delayed payment for the pre­suit period as claimed by the original  plaintiff. \n[6.10] Now,   so   far   as   awarding   interest   at   the   rate   of   12%   per  annum from the date of suit till the judgment and decree and at the rate  of 9% per annum from the date of passing the decree till the amount is  realized on the entire amount of  Rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise is concerned,  HC-NIC Page 31 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant is justified  in making a grievance that the learned Commercial Court ought not to  have awarded the interest on interest. It is required to be noted that in  the  suit the  claim of Rs.9,97,43,298.97  paise was bifurcated into two  parts i.e. Rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise towards amount of difference between  the   contractual   price   and   the   actual   payment   made   by   the   original  defendant  and  Rs.3,94,60,185.53   paise   towards  amount of  interest  at  the rate of 21% from the original defendant and therefore, considering  section 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the learned Commercial  Court has committed an error in awarding interest at the rate of 12% per  annum   on   the  entire   amount   of   Rs.9,97,43,298.97   paise.  Considering  section 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the learned Commercial  Court ought to have awarded the interest at the rate of 12% per annum  only on the principal sum of Rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise towards amount of  difference between the contractual price and the actual payment made  by the original defendant only. To the aforesaid extent, the impugned  judgment   and   decree   passed   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court   is  required to be modified. \n[7.0] In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, present  First Appeal succeeds in part.

However, for the reasons stated above, the finding recorded  by the  learned Commercial Court on the issue of limitation  is  hereby  quashed   and   set   aside   and   the   matter   is   remanded   to   the   learned  HC-NIC Page 32 of 33 Created On Sun Aug 13 23:05:43 IST 2017 Commercial   Court,   Vadodara   to   consider   the   issue   with   respect   to  limitation afresh in accordance with law and on merits and on the basis  of the evidence already led.

[2.0] facts leading to the present first appeal in nut­shell are as under: [2.1] that the original plaintiff oil & natural gas corporation, vadodara instituted special civil suit no.426/1993 initially before the learned civil court for the recovery of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise with interest at the rate of 21% per annum from the date of filing of the suit till realization of the decreetal amount. that on establishment of the commercial court, vadodara, the aforesaid special civil suit no.426/1993 came to be transferred to the commercial court, vadodara which was numbered as commercial civil suit no.10/2016. [2.2] it was the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that the original defendant was in need of natural gas as fuel for its unit at naroda, ahmedabad and therefore, the original plaintiff and the original defendant executed a contract on 03.10.1985 at vadodara for the period of 5 years i.e. commencing with effect from 01.06.1986 to 31.05.1991 containing the terms and conditions, definitions and interpretations therein. as per the said agreement, the natural gas was to be supplied from the field of the original plaintiff to the unit of original defendant at hc-nic page 2 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 naroda, ahmedabad. that the defendant agreed to purchase 50,000 standard m3 of gas per day and it was also agreed that if the original defendant purchase the gas less than 45,000 standard m3 per day on any day, it shall have to pay to the original plaintiff for this minimum quantity. thus, quantity of 45,000 m3 of gas was termed as minimum guaranteed off­take for the each day. the price of the gas was to be charged and payable as provided in annexure­i to the agreement and according to that the price of 1000 m3 of gas delivered at the central gas metering station, shall be rs.2878.87 paise inclusive of royalty and exclusive of sales tax, duties, levies, cess, fees etc. as applicable and payable. it was also mentioned in the annexure­i of the said agreement that the price of the gas mentioned will automatically be adjusted and stand revised on pro­rata basis from the date of ex refinery price of furnace oil for non­fertilizer use charges which was considered as rs.2903.06 per kilo liter. it was also the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that as per annexure­i of the said agreement, the price agreed upon was subject to revision in accordance with the principles as may be laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in civil appeal no.8530/1983 filed by the ongc against the association of natural gas consuming industries of gujarat. in the said appeal, the hon'ble supreme court passed an interim order to recover price at rs.1000 per 1000 m3 for the gas supplied to those industries. it was the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that thereafter the issue of the price was decided by the mop, ng and by its notification dated 10.01.1987, the price of the gas was declared at rs.1400 per 1000 m3 of the gas at landfall points and for onshore gas was fixed. that the said price was exclusive of royalty, taxes, duties and other statutory levies and the said price was applicable with immediate effect from the date of the notification. [2.3] it was the case on behalf of the plaintiff that as provided in the hc-nic page 3 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 agreement dated 03.10.1985 the supply of gas was to be commenced from 01.06.1986, but due to certain reasons the said supply was not affected and the gas supply was started from 22.04.1989 and therefore, a new agreement was executed on 29.07.1988 between the parties, amending only certain clauses of the original contract and all other terms and conditions of the agreement dated 03.10.1985 remained unchanged. it was the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that when the supply of gas was started to the original defendant, the notification of the government of india, fixing the price of natural gas was in force and even the civil appeals pending before the hon'ble supreme court were also not decided and therefore, the original defendant made the payment of the gas supplied to them at the price fixed by the government. according to the original plaintiff it was clearly provided in the notification that for expired contract between the ongc and the consumer with specified price, the consumers will have to pay the price mentioned in the agreement and price notified in the notification will be applicable on expiry of the said contract / agreement. [2.4] according to the original plaintiff, on 04.05.1990 the hon'ble supreme court delivered the verdict in civil appeal no.8530/1983 and other civil appeals and upheld the right of the ongc to fix the price and also upheld that for fixing the price the ongc can also consider the price of the furnace oil. that according to the original plaintiff, therefore the original plaintiff was entitled to charge the price of gas as mentioned in the agreement dated 03.10.1985 and the original defendant was also required to make payment of the gas at the price agreed in the said agreement. it was the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that despite number of telex messages and the communication dated 23.08.1990 to the original defendant to make the payment at the contractual rates and also informed regarding the outstanding huge amount because of hc-nic page 4 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 difference in the government rates and the contractual rates, but the original defendant neglected their request to make the payment. therefore, the plaintiff instituted the aforesaid suit for recovery of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise (to recover rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise towards amount of difference between the contractual price and the actual payment made by the original defendant and rs.3,94,60,185.53 paise towards amount of interest at the rate of 21% from the original defendant). [2.5] the suit was resisted by the original defendant by filing the written statement at exh.22. it was the case on behalf of the original defendant that the suit for recovery in respect of the amount alleged to be due was barred by law of limitation. [2.6] it was the case on behalf of the original defendant that as per the contract the original plaintiff was to start the gas supply from 01.06.1986, but plaintiff did not supply the gas to the original defendant from the said date and thereby committed breach of fundamental terms thereof. it was also contended on behalf of the original defendant that as the original plaintiff commenced the supply of natural gas to the original defendant on 22.04.1989 and on that day the notification dated 31.01.1987 issued by the government of india was in force, the price of the natural gas chargeable from the original defendant to the original plaintiff and payable to the original plaintiff by the original defendant was rs.1400 for 1000 standard m3. it was also denied by the original defendant that under the new agreement dated 30.07.1988, the provisions relating to price contained in the said original contract or unamended agreement dated 03.10.1987 remained unchanged. it was contended that the jurisdiction to fix the prices of the natural gas came to be vested in or exercised by the government of india from 30.01.1987 hc-nic page 5 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 and therefore, no power, authority or jurisdiction vested in the original plaintiff to charge or recover with effect from 30.01.1987 or in respect of natural gas supplied from 30.01.1987, any price other than that fixed by the government of india by the said notification dated 30.01.1987 and which may be fixed thereafter by the government of india from time to time. therefore, it was contended on behalf of the original defendant that as the plaintiff started supplying gas to the original defendant with effect from 22.04.1989, the original defendant was liable to pay the price for supply of natural gas as per the notification dated 30.01.1987 only and therefore, the only price which the original plaintiff could charge or recover from the consumer including the original defendant was as per the notification dated 30.01.1987 issued by the government of india. the original defendant also disputed the liability to pay the interest on the delayed payment. therefore, it was requested to dismiss the suit. [2.7] that the learned trial court framed the following issues at exh.25. 1. whether the plaintiff proves that he is entitled to get relief prays for? 2. whether the plaintiff proves that he is entitled to get interest as prays for ? 3. whether the defendant proves that the plaintiff's suit is barred by the provisions of the limitation act ? 4. what order and decree ?

[2.10] that after considering the submissions made by the learned counsel for respective parties and on appreciation of evidence, both oral as well as documentary the learned commercial court has held that the original defendant is liable to pay the price for the natural gas supplied as per the original contract entered into between the parties and as per the specified terms and conditions mentioned in the hc-nic page 9 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 contract/agreement entered into between the parties and the price fixed as per the said government of india notification dated 30.01.1987 shall not be applicable with respect to the unexpired contracts / agreements. the learned commercial court also held that the suit filed by the original plaintiff is not barred by law of limitation as contended on behalf of the original defendant. that, by impugned judgment and decree the learned commercial court has partly decreed the suit and has passed a decree of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise, however with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of filing of the suit till the date of decree and 9% per annum from the date of decree till realization of the amount. [2.11] feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned commercial court, vadodara the original defendant has preferred the present first appeal. [3.0] shri mihir thakore, learned senior advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant herein original defendant and shri ajay mehta, learned advocate, who is on caveat, has appeared on behalf of the respondent herein original plaintiff. record & proceedings of the case is received from the learned commercial court. learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant has also placed on record separate paper­book. [4.0] shri mihir thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case the learned commercial court has materially erred in decreeing the suit. [4.1] it is vehemently submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the learned hc-nic page 10 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 commercial court has materially erred in holding that the original defendant is liable to pay the price for supply of natural gas as per the original contract and not as per the notification issued by the government of india dated 30.01.1987. [4.2] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that admittedly as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985 the ongc was required to supply the natural gas at the price mentioned in the said agreement from 01.06.1986. however the plaintiff did not start the supply of gas as per the agreement dated 03.10.1985 and gas supply was started from 22.04.1989. it is submitted that in the meantime the government of india determined the price for supply of gas vide notification dated 30.01.1987 to be supplied at the rate of rs.1400 and therefore, the ongc could have charged for supply of gas at the rate of rs.1400 only and therefore, the original defendant was liable to pay the price for supply of gas at rs.1400/­ for 1000 standard m3 only, which the original defendant paid. it is submitted that therefore the learned commercial court as such ought not to have decreed the suit. [4.3] it is submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the learned commercial court has materially erred in not properly appreciating the fact that the original contract dated 03.10.1985 (exh.40) never came into effect or commenced, since ongc did not commence supply of gas from 01.06.1986. it is submitted that even the ongc did not commence supply of gas until much after the price order dated 30.01.1987 (exh.57). it is submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that therefore as such the original contract / agreement did not come into effect, more particularly hc-nic page 11 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 when the price order dated 30.01.1987 was issued. it is submitted that therefore, the original contract could not have been termed as an \"unexpired contract\" as on the date of the price order dated 30.01.1987. it is submitted that therefore clause 4 of the price order shall not be applicable to the present case and the gas price would be governed by the price order. [4.4] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that as such the intent and purpose of the clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987 was only to allow ongc to charge the contractual price where it was already supplying gas under a contract which was already in effect. it is submitted that intention behind the aforesaid clause in the price order dated 30.01.1987 was to allow ongc to complete its contracts which were in the course of being performed at the time of issuance of the price order. it is submitted that in the present case the original contract was not in effect as on the date of the price order dated 30.01.1987 and therefore, it would be de hors the intent and purpose of the price order dated 30.01.1987 to allow ongc to charge any price over and above the government of india fixed price in respect of the supplies made under a contract which did not come into effect until much after the said price order. it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the term \"unexpired contracts\" in the context in which it has been placed in clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987 has to mean only those contracts which were, as on 30.01.1987, being performed or in other words under performance or in the course of the performance and some period of performance was still remaining to be completed. it is submitted that the words \"unexpired contracts\" cannot refer to the period remaining in the total period of contract even when such contract and its performance hc-nic page 12 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 had actually not commenced. [4.5] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that even otherwise in view of and by virtue of the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988, original contract cannot be said to have been in existence and/or the same was not to be acted upon. it is submitted that the original contract executed was for the sole purpose of supplying natural gas by ongc to the original defendant from the field ramol baola and in the manner stipulated therein. it is submitted that consideration for the same was the price payable to ongc by the original defendant in terms of clause 10 read with annexure­i thereto. that the gas price in the original contract was mutually agreed upon as consideration for the duration, place and manner of supply of gas under the original contract and the said gas price agreed upon cannot be delinked from what it stood for in the original contract. it is submitted that by virtue of the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988 (exh.39), the terms of the original contract underwent substantial and fundamental changes going to the root of the contract. it is submitted that as per the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988 (exh.39), (a) duration of supply of gas, i.e., instead of supply commencing from 01.06.1986, it was to commence from 31.12.1988, and by virtue of this change, more than 2 and 1⁄2 years of gas supply got canceled; (b) the gas field from which gas was to be supplied underwent a complete change, i.e. from ramol baola field, it was changed to kalol field; (c) the manner and place of delivery of gas changed, by virtue of which the passing of the title to the gas would get altered; (d) the provisions regarding gas transportation were changed. it is submitted that therefore considering section 62 of the indian contract act, on account of alteration or substitution in the original contract, the original contract does not continue or remain in existence any more and hc-nic page 13 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 need not be performed and therefore, the original contract could not have been said to be an \"unexpired contract\" as contained in clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987. it is submitted that therefore clause 4 of price order dated 30.01.1987 which applies only to \"unexpired contract\", would not apply in the present case, once the original contract got substituted or altered. [4.6] it is submitted that therefore the learned judge has materially erred in treating the term \"unexpired contracts\" as meaning \"contracts in existence\" and in holding, in effect, that the contracts which were merely in existence by virtue of their having been signed by the parties, even though not in effect and not being performed, were to be neglected within clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987. it is submitted that therefore, the learned commercial court has materially erred in not properly appreciating the applicability of principle of section 62 of the indian contract act and hence, has failed to appreciate that, when a contract is substantially and fundamentally altered, it is a case of novation and the original contract cannot be treated as valid and existing. [4.7] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that even otherwise part of the plaintiff's claim was clearly barred by law of limitation. it is submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the suit was filed on 02.05.1993 in regard to a claim in respect of the gas supply period from 22.04.1989 to 31.05.1991. it is submitted that the invoices in respect to the said period were issued from 13.05.1989 to 04.06.1991 (exh.70 to exh.100). it is submitted that as per the terms of the contracts the payment was to be made within 10 days of the receipt of the said invoices. it is submitted hc-nic page 14 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 that as such the learned commercial court has rightly held that article 15 of the limitation act would not apply to the claim, as there was no stay or injunction against the original plaintiff restraining it from instituting the suit. it is submitted that therefore as on the date of the suit i.e. as on 02.05.1993, all the invoices issued prior to 22.04.1990 were certainly barred by limitation. it is submitted that therefore the invoices from exh.70 to exh.83 were clearly time barred. [4.8] it is vehemently submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the learned commercial court has materially erred in holding that the extension of bank guarantee on 03.08.1990 and the letter dated 17.08.1990 amounts to acknowledgment of liability in writing by the original defendant and therefore, would extend the period of limitation. [4.9] it is vehemently submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the learned commercial court has overlooked the fact that section 18 of the limitation act which pertains to extension of limitation on account of the acknowledgment would not apply in the present case. it is submitted that section 18 of the limitation act would apply only if there is an \"acknowledgment of liability\" in respect of any property and right. it is submitted that an \"acknowledgment of liability\" means a conscious admission of a jural relationship between parties and a subsisting liability (of the person making such acknowledgment) flowing from the same. moreover, such acknowledgment or liability has to be made in writing, signed by the party against whom the right is claimed or by an agent duly authorized in this behalf. in support of his above submission, shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant has relied on the hc-nic page 15 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 decision of the hon'ble supreme court in the case of krishnappa chettiar v. somiali reported in air 1964 sc 227 (para 14) and in the case of tilak ram vs. nathu reported in air 1967 sc 935 (para 10) and in the case of state of kerala vs. t.m. chacko reported in (2000) 9 scc 722 (para 10). [4.10] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that insofar as the bank guarantee on 03.08.1990 (exh.113) is concerned, it was issued under specific terms of the contract which required issuance of a bank guarantee and hence, (1) it cannot constitute an \"acknowledgment of liability\", (2) if the said bank guarantee is perused, it, in fact, does not contain any \"acknowledgment of liability\", (3) it was issued guaranteeing payment in respect of 62 days of gas supply and not for the full contract and hence, it cannot constitute \"acknowledgment of liability\" in regard to the full claim under the contract, (4) it was issued by syndicate bank (guarantor) to the original plaintiff on a principle to principle basis and is recognized in law as an independent contract and therefore, it is not an acknowledgment of liability made in writing and signed by the original defendant or its agent duly authorized in this behalf. in light of the aforesaid it is submitted that the said bank guarantee cannot extend the period of limitation. [4.11] now, so far as the letter dated 17.08.1990 (exh.114) is concerned, it is submitted that it only encloses the bank guarantees to be sent to the original plaintiff and does not contain any \"acknowledgment of liability\" and it is not issued by any person authorized on behalf of the original defendant to issue an \"acknowledgment of liability\" and hence, it is submitted that it does not contain any words which can be considered as an \"acknowledgment of hc-nic page 16 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 liability\". it is submitted that the said letter is still not an acknowledgment of liability made by the original defendant or its agent duly authorized in this behalf. [4.12] shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant has further submitted that it is not the case (as pleaded or as proved) of the original plaintiff that any documents on record constitutes an acknowledgment of liability or that the period of limitation got extended under section 18 of the limitation act. it is submitted that therefore the learned commercial court could not have arrived at such a finding which was not supported by pleadings and evidence. [4.13] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that even the learned commercial court has materially erred in awarding the interest at the rate of 21% per annum till the date of the suit even though no evidence was led in this regard by the original plaintiff. it is submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that the principal sum claimed was rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise and the total claim of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise is made in the suit inclusive of interest at the rate of 21% per annum on the principal sum of rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise. [4.14] it is submitted that as per clause 11.02 of the original contract (exh.40), the original defendant was required to pay the interest on delayed payment at the rate of 1% higher than the rate of interest payable by the original plaintiff on its cash credit agreement with state bank of india from time to time. it is submitted that however the original plaintiff had not led any evidence as to what was the rate of interest chargeable by state bank of india. hc-nic page 17 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 [4.15] it is submitted that therefore the learned commercial court has materially erred in awarding interest at the rate of 21% till the filing of the suit, as claimed by the original plaintiff. it is submitted that as such the court has no jurisdiction to award pre­suit interest. it is submitted that in any case, even assuming without admitting the court has jurisdiction to award pre­suit interest even though as no evidence was led, the pre­suit interest awarded by the learned commercial court is grossly excessive. [4.16] it is further submitted by shri thakore, learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the original defendant that even otherwise the learned commercial court has materially erred in awarding the interest on interest. [4.17] it is vehemently submitted that section 34 of the code of civil procedure, 1908 confers jurisdiction on the court to only award the interest on the principal sum adjudged and not interest on interest. it is submitted that in the present case the principal sum claimed was rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise and the total claim of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise as made in the suit was inclusive of the interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the principal sum of rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise. it is submitted that as such there was no provision in the original contract or the contract 29.07.1988 for capitalization interest so as to make it part of the principal sum. it is submitted that therefore the learned commercial court has materially erred in awarding interest on interest more particularly interest on rs.3,94,60,185.53 paise. making above submissions and relying upon the above decisions, it is requested to allow the present appeal. [5.0] present first appeal is vehemently opposed by shri ajay mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff. hc-nic page 18 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 [5.1] it is submitted by shri mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned commercial court has not committed any error in decreeing the suit (partly). it is submitted that the finding recorded by the learned commercial court that the original defendant is liable to pay the price for supply of gas as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985 and that the original contract dated 03.10.1985 can be said to be \"unexpired contracts\" and therefore, considering clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987, the price mentioned in the government notification price order dated 30.01.1987 shall not be applicable, is based on appreciation of evidence more particularly on interpretation of the documentary evidence on record more particularly the original contract dated 03.10.1985 (exh.40); the government notification / price order dated 30.01.1987 and the modified contract dated 29.07.1998. it is submitted that therefore, finding recorded by the learned commercial court cannot be said to be either perverse and/or contrary to the evidence on record. [5.2] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that the learned commercial court has rightly directed the original defendant to pay the price for the gas supplied as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985. it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that even the learned commercial court has rightly decreed the suit by awarding the interest (pre­suit) at the rate of 21%. it is submitted that awarding the interest at the rate of 21% at pre­suit is absolutely in consonance with the terms and conditions of the original contract dated 03.10.1985. it is submitted that as such the original defendant never disputed before the learned commercial court that the rate of interest at the rate of 21% would be 1% more than the rate of hc-nic page 19 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 interest charged by the state bank of india. it is submitted that when there were specific pleadings in the suit claiming the interest at the rate of 21% for pre­suit period and the same was not disputed and/or denied by the original defendant and/or no other contrary evidence was led, the learned commercial court has rightly awarded the interest at the rate of 21% for pre­suit period. [5.3] it is vehemently submitted by shri mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned commercial court has rightly held the suit within the period of limitation. it is submitted that the learned commercial court has rightly held that the suit is not barred by law of limitation as contended on behalf of the original defendant. [5.4] it is further submitted by shri mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff that in the facts and circumstances of the case the learned commercial court has not committed any error in awarding the interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of filing of the suit till the judgment and decree and at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of judgment and decree till the realization of the amount. making above submissions, it is requested to dismiss the present first appeal. [6.0] heard learned counsel appearing for respective parties at length. we have perused and considered the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned commercial court. we have also re­appreciated the entire evidence on record from the record & proceedings received from the learned commercial court as well as from the paper­book produced by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant. hc-nic page 20 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 [6.1] the main dispute between the original plaintiff and the original defendant is whether the original plaintiff is entitled to recover and/or whether the original defendant is liable to pay the price for supply of natural gas at the rate of rs.2903.06 per 100 standard m3 as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985 (exh.40) or as per the price order / government of india notification dated 30.01.1987 (exh.57). it is not in dispute that as per the contract / agreement executed between the original plaintiff and original defendant (exh.40) the price for supply of natural gas was fixed at rs.2903.06 paise per kilo liter. as per clause 2.01 of the original contract dated 03.10.1985 the contract shall commence into force from 01.06.1986 i.e. the date of commencement of supply of gas and the validity period was 5 years ending upto 31.05.1991. however, subsequently, the government of india issued the notification / price order dated 30.01.1987 determining the price for supply of natural gas on rs.1400 per kilo liter. however, as per clause 4 the determination of price as per the price order / notification dated 30.01.1987 shall not be applicable to the \"unexpired contracts\". clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987 reads as under: \"4. there are some unexpired contracts between ongc / oil and some consumers with specified prices. these contracts will have to run their course and the prices now fixed will apply after the contract period expires.\" it is true that as per the original contract the date of commencement of the supply was 01.06.1986 (as per clause 2.01 of the original contract). it is also true that there was no supply of gas from 01.06.1986 and infact the supply of gas started from 22.04.1989. however, it is required to be noted that some terms and conditions mentioned in the original contract dated 03.10.1985 came to be modified / substituted by the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988 and hc-nic page 21 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 in article 2.01 the words i.e. \"date of commencement of supply\" was substituted by \"gas supply shall commence from 31.12.1988\". there were other some changes in para 2. therefore, it is the case on behalf of the original defendant that in view of the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988, the original contract dated 03.10.1985 was not acted upon and there was no supply of gas even on the date of on which the price order dated 30.01.1987 was issued by the government of india and therefore, it cannot be said that the original contract was unexpired contract as per clause 4 of the price order and therefore, the original defendant was liable to pay the price for supply of natural gas at the rate of rs.1400 per 1000 standard m3 as per the price order dated 30.01.1987. it is also the case on behalf of the original defendant that considering section 62 of the indian contract act there was novation of contract more particularly in view of the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988 and therefore, the original contract / agreement was not to be acted upon and therefore, it cannot be said to be a continued contract more particularly at the time when the price order dated 30.01.1987 was issued by the government of india. the aforesaid submission seems to be attractive but has no substance. at the outset it is required to be noted that by the subsequent contract executed on 29.07.1988 it cannot be said that a new contract came into existence and/or the original contract (exh.40) came to be an end and/or was not to be acted upon. by the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988, some of the terms and conditions only came to be substituted and the rest of the terms and conditions mentioned in the original contract continued to operate. in para 12 of the subsequent agreement / contract dated 29.07.1988, it is specifically mentioned that the amendment in the contract dated 29.07.1988 shall form part of the original contract dated 03.10.1985 and that all other terms and hc-nic page 22 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 conditions of the contract dated 03.10.1985 shall remain unchanged and binding on the parties. clause 12 of the contract dated 29.07.1988 reads as under: \"12. the above amendment shall form part of the contract dated 3rd day of october, one thousand nine hundred and eighty five and all other terms and conditions of the contract dated 3rd day of october, one thousand nine hundred and eighty five shall remain unchanged and binding on the parties.\" in light of the above it cannot be said that the case will fall under section 62 of the indian contract act and it cannot be said that there was novation of the original contract, in light of the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988 as sought to be contended on behalf of the original defendant. [6.2] under the circumstances, it cannot be said that the original contract / agreement dated 03.10.1985 shall come to an end and/or was not to be acted upon and/or the same can be said to be a fresh agreement / contract. under the circumstances, as on 30.01.1987, i.e. when the price order came to be issued by the government of india the original contract / agreement can be said to be \"unexpired agreement / contract\" and therefore, as per clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987, the price determined / mentioned in the price order shall not affect the price mentioned in the original contract dated 03.10.1985 and therefore, the original defendant was liable to pay the price for supply of gas as per the original contract / agreement dated 03.10.1985 and the parties shall be governed by the original contract dated 03.10.1985. [6.3] now, so far as the submission on behalf of the original defendant that as, as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985, the date of commencement of supply was 01.06.1986 and admittedly the gas supply hc-nic page 23 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 was commenced much later i.e. on 22.04.1989 after two years of the price order dated 30.01.1987 and the ongc did not start supplying gas on 31.12.1988 (as per the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988) and therefore, there was a breach of the terms of the original contract and the submission on behalf of the appellant that as the day on which the price order was issued on 30.01.1987, there was no supply of natural gas and consequently the contract was not performed and therefore, the original contract cannot be said to be \"unexpired contracts\" is concerned, the aforesaid has no substance. as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985 more particularly clause 2.01, the period of contract mentioned is for a period of 5 years commencing from 01.06.1986 ending upto 31.05.1991. therefore, as per clause 2.01, the contract shall come into force from 01.06.1986, which was the date of commencement of the supply of gas and shall remain in force over a period of 5 years ending upto 31.05.1991. as per the subsequent contract dated 29.07.1988, the date of commencement of supply of gas was substituted from 01.06.1986 to 31.12.1988. clause 4 of the price order, which is reproduced hereinabove, provides that the prices mentioned in the said price order / notification shall be applicable after existing contract period expires. if the submission on behalf of the original defendant as mentioned hereinabove is accepted, it would be adding something in para 4 of the price order, which is not there. under the circumstances, contract / agreement executed between the original plaintiff and the original defendant can be said to be \"unexpired contracts\" within clause 4 of the price order dated 30.01.1987 and therefore, the price determined / mentioned in the price order dated 30.01.1987 shall not be applicable with respect to the contract dated 03.10.1985 and the original defendant is liable to pay the supply of natural gas at the rate mentioned in the original contract / agreement dated 03.10.1985. under the circumstances, no error has been hc-nic page 24 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 committed by the learned commercial court in holding so more particularly in holding that the original defendant is liable to pay the price or supply of gas as per the original contract dated 03.10.1985 and not as per the price order dated 30.01.1987. we are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned commercial court. [6.4] now, so far as the submission on behalf of the original defendant that part of the ongc's claim was barred by law of limitation more particularly the invoices from exh.70 to exh.83 were time barred is concerned, it is required to be noted that applying section 18 of the limitation act, which pertains to extension period of limitation on account of acknowledgment, the learned commercial court has held the claim in the suit within the period of limitation. while applying section 18 of the limitation act and holding that the suit claim is within the period of limitation, the learned commercial court has considered the extension of bank guarantee/s which were furnished as per the original contract and/or subsequent contract, as an acknowledgment of the dues and therefore, considering the date of extension of bank guarantee as an acknowledgment of the dues, applying section 18 of the limitation act, the learned commercial court has held the suit within the period of limitation. while deciding the issue with respect to the limitation and while dealing with issue no.3, the learned commercial court has observed in paras 17 and 18 as under: \"17. i have considered the rival submissions of the ld. counsel for the parties. the plaintiff herein claimed payment of bills with effect from the date of 13/05/1989 till 04/06/1991. admittedly, the suit has been instituted on 03/05/1993. now the question arises as to whether the cause of action to file the present suit arose when the hon'ble supreme court declared the judgment in civil appeal no. 8530/1983 on 4.5.1990. at this juncture, it would not be out of context (at the cost of repetition) to refer the clauses of annexrue ­i of the agreement­contract at exh. 40. hc-nic page 25 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 pricing \"1. the price of 1000 (one thousand only ) standard cubic meters of gas delivered at the central gas metering station / sub station located in the seller's premises shall be 2878.87. (rupees two thousand eight seventy eight and paise eighty seven only). 2. the price of the gas mentioned above will automatically be adjusted and stand revised on pro­rata basis from the date of the ex. refinery price of furnace oil considred is rs. 2903.06 per kl as advised by the govt. of india. 3. the price now agreed upon is subject to the revision in accordance with the principle as may be laid down by the hon'ble supreme court in civil appeal no. 8530/83 ongc vs association of natural gas consuming industries of gujarat and others pending disposal before the supreme court.\" 17.1 considering all the three clauses, it is apparent that the price of the gas was already fixed by the parties and the said price had to be adjusted in accordance to the judgment in civil appeal no. 8530/83. meaning thereby, if the price fixed between the parties is higher than the price approved by the hon'ble supreme court in the aforesaid appeal, then defendant to to made to additional payment to the plaintiff on account of differential amount but if the hon'ble suprreme court determined the price below the price fixed by the contract, than plaintiff has to made the adjustment of the excess amount paid by the defendant. thus, the judgment of the hon'ble supreme court has nothing to do with the right of the plaintiff to recover the price of the gas in accordance to the aforesaid clause 1 of the annexure. thus, the cause of action had arisen in the favour since the date of each bill and not from the date of pronouncement of the judgment of the hon'ble apex court on 4.5.1990. 17.2 as far the plea as to whether in the present case, the article 1 or the article 15 the limitation act shall be applicable is concerned, the plaintiff has not filed any statement of account on records, however, the suit has been instituted on the basis of the bills/ invoces placed on paper book at exh 70 to 101. article 1 of the limitation act applies in the cases where the parties maintained the running account, therefore, in the present case, article 1 of the limitation act is not applicable. as per agreement, the period of credit was 10 days to make the payment of the amount due and payable under the invoices. article 15 deals with the cases where the goods sold on credit. as per article 15 of the limitation act, the period of limitation in respect of payment due against the bills is 3 (three) years from the date of period of credit expires. the article 15 of the limitation act is hc-nic page 26 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 reproduced herein for the sake of convenience. description of suit period of time from which period limitation begins to run 15. for the price of three years when the period of goods sold and credit expires, delivered to be paid for after the expiry of a fixed period of credit 17.3 in the present case, the clause 11.01 deals with the period of credit. the same is reproduced herein. \"11.01. the seller shall issue and send to the buyer invoices covering the total quantity of gas delivered by the seller in accordance with relevant provisions of this contract during each fortnight for payment. the buyer shall pay in full within ten (10) days of the receipt of such invoices the amount so mentioned in such invoices. for this purpose the fortnight would commence at 0700 hours of first (1st) day to 0700 hours of sixteenth (16th) day and 0700 hours of sixteenth (16th) day to 0700 hours of 1st day of the succeeding calender month. in case there is any dispute regarding billing the buyer shall not withhold payment. after making full payment, the buyer shall lodge the claims to the seller giving full particulars within a period of fourteen days (14) from the date of making the payment, and such claims if found correct, the seller shall adjust against the next invoice of supply of gas. no interest shall accrue on such refunds by the seller to the buyer.\" the perusal of the aforesaid clause of the agreement at exh. 40 clearly transpires that the period of credit was 10 days. the case of the plaintiff falls under article 15 of the limitation act. i have also considered the judgment of the hon'ble madaras high court in the case of a. l. a. r. r. m arunachallam chetti (supra), wherein the hon'ble court held that in ordinary suit upon accounts the limitation period to recover the money is three years. 18. in the present case, the defendant had also furnished the bank guarantee at exh.101, in pursuance to the terms and conditions of the agreement­contract at exh. 40, for a sum of rs. 89,24,497/­ . the said bank guarantee was extended by the defendant time to time and lastly extended on 03.08.1990 vide exh. 113. not only this, the defendant sent the said extension of bank guarantee to the plaintiff alongwith the letter dated 17.08.1990 at exh. 114. the said extension of bank guarantee took place within the period of hc-nic page 27 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 limitation at the behest of the defendant. thus, in view of section 18 of the limitation act, said extension of bank guarantee and letter dated 17.08.1990 at exh. 114 amounts the acknowledgement of liability in writing by the defendant with in the period of limitation, therefore it extend the period of limitation. thus, i am of the considered view that the suit of the plaintiff is not barred by limitation. thus, the present issue is decided against the defendant and in favour of the plaintiff.\" [6.5] from the aforesaid it appears that extension of bank gurarantee on 03.08.1990 (exh.113) is considered to be the \"acknowledgment of liability\" in writing by the original defendant. there the learned commercial court has committed an error. the extension of bank guarantee which was furnished earlier as per the original contract, subsequently after the validity period of the bank guarantee had expired, by no stretch of imagination can be said to be \"acknowledgment of the liability\" in writing by the original defendant. extension of the original bank guarantee which was initially furnished as per the original contract cannot be said to be \"acknowledgment of the liability\" and it will not extend the period of limitation as per section 18 of the limitation act. therefore, we are of the opinion that the learned commercial court has committed a grave error in applying section 18 of the limitation act treating and/or considering the extension of the bank guarantee on 03.08.1990 as an \"acknowledgment of the liability\" in writing by the original defendant and in holding the suit claim within the period of limitation and consequently has materially erred in holding that the suit of the plaintiff is not barred by limitation. [6.6] as observed by the hon'ble supreme court in the case of tilak ram vs. nathu reported in air 1967 sc 935 (1), mere statement expressing jural relationship between the parties does not constitute acknowledgment. therefore, the extension of the bank guarantee hc-nic page 28 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 cannot be said to be one made with intention of admitting the jural relationship and/or acknowledging the debt. in the case of state of kerala vs. t.m. chacko reported in (2000) 9 scc 722 while considering the scope and ambit of section 18 of the limitation act and while considering the issue with respect to acknowledgment vis­a­vis section 18 of the limitation act, it is observed by the hon'ble supreme court in para 10 as under: \"10. it may be noted that for treating a writing signed by the party as an acknowledgment, the person acknowledging must be conscious of his liability and the commitment should be made towards that liability. it need not be specific but if necessary facts which constitute the liability are admitted an acknowledgment may be inferred from such an admission.\" [6.7] it is the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that as the dispute with respect to the pricing was pending before the hon'ble supreme court in civil appeal no.8530/1983 and therefore, the cause of action to file the suit can be said to have arisen when the hon'ble supreme court declared the judgment in civil appeal no.8530/1983 on 04.05.1990 which was in favour of the ongc and therefore, the suit can be said to be within the period of limitation. however, the aforesaid is not accepted by the learned commercial court by observing that considering section 15 of the limitation act, as there was no injunction restraining the original plaintiff from filing the suit for recovery, the original plaintiff cannot get the benefit of the dispute pending before the hon'ble supreme court. however, it is required to be noted that while deciding the issue with respect to limitation, what has been mainly weighed with the learned commercial court is the extension of bank guarantee and treating the extension of bank guarantee as \"acknowledgment of liability\" in writing by the original defendant within the period of limitation and applying section 18 of the limitation act, the learned commercial court has decided the issue of limitation in favour of the hc-nic page 29 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 original plaintiff and against the original defendant. no other discussion is there with respect to the case on behalf of the original defendant that claim with respect to some of the invoices more particularly invoice at exh.70 to exh.83 were barred by limitation, more particularly considering specific terms and conditions of the original contract dated 03.10.1985, that the payment was required to be made within a period of 10 days from the date of issuance of the invoices. under the circumstances, while quashing and setting aside the finding recorded by the learned commercial court on the issue of limitation, the matter is required to be remanded to the learned commercial court to consider the issue with respect to the limitation afresh and in accordance with law and on merits and on the basis of the evidence already led. therefore, the finding recorded by the learned commercial court holding the issue with respect to the limitation in favour of the original plaintiff deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside and the matter is remanded to the learned commercial court to decide the issue with respect to the limitation afresh in accordance with law and on merits and on the basis of the evidence already led. [6.8] now, so far as the submission on behalf of the original defendant that the learned commercial court has materially erred in awarding interest at the rate of 21% per annum for the pre­suit period is concerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that as per the terms and conditions mentioned in original contract dated 03.10.1985, on delayed payment the ongc was entitled to the interest at the rate of 1% higher than the rate of interest payable by the ongc on its cash credit agreement with the state bank of india from time to time. clause 11.02 of the contract / agreement reads as under: \"11.02 the buyer shall pay interest on all delayed payments at the hc-nic page 30 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 rate of one percent (1%) higher than the rate of interest payable by the seller on its cash credit arrangement with the state bank of india from time to time. delayed payment means any payment not received within the period provided in clause 11.01 above. the right of seller will be independent to the right as per clause 11.04 hereinabove.\" [6.9] in the examination in chief the witness examined on behalf of the original plaintiff has specifically deposed that as per clause 11.02 of the agreement, the original plaintiff is also entitled for interest on all the delayed payment @ 1% over and above the rate of interest payable by the ongc on its cash credit agreement with the state bank of india and that the original plaintiff has calculated the interest on the principal amount till the date of filing the suit. no question is asked by the original defendant in the cross. even in the written statement also there is no specific denial with respect to the charging of the interest for the pre­suit period, at the rate of 21% as claimed by the original plaintiff. under the circumstances and in the facts and circumstances of the case and more particularly, considering the evidence on record, it cannot be said that the learned commercial court has committed any error in allowing the claim of the original plaintiff claiming interest at the rate of 21% per annum i.e. at the rate of 1% over and above the interest payable by the ongc on its cash credit agreement with the state bank of india for pre­suit period. under the circumstances, the learned commercial court has rightly decreed the suit awarding the interest on the delayed payment for the pre­suit period as claimed by the original plaintiff. [6.10] now, so far as awarding interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of suit till the judgment and decree and at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of passing the decree till the amount is realized on the entire amount of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise is concerned, hc-nic page 31 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original defendant is justified in making a grievance that the learned commercial court ought not to have awarded the interest on interest. it is required to be noted that in the suit the claim of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise was bifurcated into two parts i.e. rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise towards amount of difference between the contractual price and the actual payment made by the original defendant and rs.3,94,60,185.53 paise towards amount of interest at the rate of 21% from the original defendant and therefore, considering section 34 of the code of civil procedure, 1908, the learned commercial court has committed an error in awarding interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the entire amount of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise. considering section 34 of the code of civil procedure, 1908, the learned commercial court ought to have awarded the interest at the rate of 12% per annum only on the principal sum of rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise towards amount of difference between the contractual price and the actual payment made by the original defendant only. to the aforesaid extent, the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned commercial court is required to be modified. [7.0] in view of the above and for the reasons stated above, present first appeal succeeds in part. impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned commercial court, vadodara insofar as holding that the party shall be governed by original contract dated 03.10.1985 (exh.40) and that the original defendant is liable to pay price for supply of natural gas at the rate mentioned in the original contract dated 03.10.1985 and not as per the price order dated 30.01.1987 treating the original contract / agreement as \"unexpired contracts\" is hereby confirmed. however, for the reasons stated above, the finding recorded by the learned commercial court on the issue of limitation is hereby quashed and set aside and the matter is remanded to the learned hc-nic page 32 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017 commercial court, vadodara to consider the issue with respect to limitation afresh in accordance with law and on merits and on the basis of the evidence already led. for the reasons stated above the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned commercial court awarding the interest at the rate of 21% per annum on the delayed payment for pre­suit period is hereby confirmed. for the reasons stated above, the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned commercial court, vadodara awarding interest at the rate of 12% from the date of filing of the suit till the date of the decree, on the entire amount of rs.9,97,43,298.97 paise is hereby modified to the extent and it is held that the original plaintiff shall be entitled to the interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the principal sum of rs.6,02,83,113.44 paise. present first appeal is partly allowed to the aforesaid extent. in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs. civil application no.3091/2017 in view of disposal of main first appeal, civil application no.3091/2017 also stands disposed of. sd/­ (m.r. shah, j.) sd/­ (b.n. karia, j.) ajay hc-nic page 33 of 33 created on sun aug 13 23:05:43 ist 2017"
