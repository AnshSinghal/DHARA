This   group   of   petitions   filed   under   the  Arbitration  Act  raise  common   questions  of  facts  and   law   and   hence,   were   heard   together   and   are  dealt   with   by   this   common   order.   The   facts   as  stated in petition under Arbitration Act No.2/17  are made the basis of this order.\n2. The   parties   to   these   petitions   entered   into  different contracts for supply of Indian Rapeseed  Meal   and   more   particularly   the   petitioners   and  respondent no.1 in each of the application.   At  HC-NIC Page 1 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the   outset,   it   deserves   to   be   noted   that   the  other   respondents   in   each   of   the   petitions   are  either partners of the firm or are directors of  the Company.\n3. As   the   dispute   arose   between   the   parties,   the  dispute was referred to Arbitration before GAFTA  Tribunal   in   London.   The   disputes   so   referred  culminated   into   9   original   GAFTA   awards   dated  28.04.2014.   The   respondents   preferred   appeals  challenging the original awards before the Board  of Appeal, GAFTA, London and the appellate board  of GAFTA after hearing the parties was pleased to  uphold   all   the   original   awards   with   some   minor  modification to the amount of damages awarded to  the petitioner on the basis of the calculation of  damages   from   the   exact   date   of   default.     The  record   further   indicates   that   the   respondents  approached   GAFTA   Appeal   Board   seeking  clarification   of   the   awards   which   came   to   be  rejected   by   GAFTA   Appellate   Board   vide  order/communication   dated   26.05.2015.   The  respondents  carried   the  same   further  by  filling  appeals as provided under Sections 68 and 69 of  the English Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996  before the High Court of Justice Queen's Division  Commercial   Court   and   the   Hon'ble   Queen's   Bench  Division of London High Court by an order dated  14.07.2015 refused leave to appeal the awards to  the   respondents.     The   respondents   thereafter  approached the Court of appeal in London against  HC-NIC Page 2 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the   order   passed   by   the   Hon'ble   Queen's   Bench  division   of   London   High   Court   and   by   a   final  order   dated   04.02.2016,   the   Court   of   appeal   in  London refused leave to appeal against the order  dated 14.07.2015 and also disallowed the plea of  the   respondents   to   prefer   an   appeal   before   the  Supreme   Court   of   United   Kingdom.     According   to  the   petitioners,   the   proceedings   attained  finality as per the provisions of UK Arbitration  Act   and   hence,   the   petitioner   filed   individual  applications   for   execution   of   the   awards   as  foreign   awards   before   the   District   Court   at  Gandhidham which came to be registered as Special  Execution   Petitions   No.167/15   to   175/15.     The  record indicates that the learned District Court  at Gandhidham issued notice to the respondents.\n4. At   this   stage,   it   would   be   appropriate   to   note  that   the   petitioner   herein   preferred   petition  under   Section   15(5)   of   the   Commercial   Court,  Commercial   Division   and   Commercial   Appellate  Division of the High Courts Act, 2015 for seeking  clarification   and   appropriate   direction   to  transfer   Special   Execution   Petition   No.167/2015  and allied execution petitions pending before the  District   Court   at   Gandhidham­Kachchh   either   to  the   High   Court   or   to   appropriate   commercial  courts,   commercial   divisions.   The   Hon'ble  Division Bench of this Court in the case reported  in 2017(1) GLH 383 was pleased to observe thus ­ HC-NIC Page 3 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER \"11.00.

BOTH   THE   BUYER   AND   SELLER   HEREBY  ACKNOWLEDGES   FAMILARITY   WITH   THE   NEXT(sic)  OF THE SAID GAFTA CONTRACTS AND AGREE TO BE  BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS\"\n11. The record of the petitions indicate that as the  goods were not supplied as per the terms of the  contract, the arbitration clause was invoked and  as   per   the   arbitration   clause,   the   dispute   so  arising was referred to the Arbitration in London  in   accordance   with   GAFTA   125   Rules.     The   same  came  to  be  registered  as  Arbitration  No.14­711,  which culminated into award dated 28.04.2014.\n12. Mr.   Thakore,   learned   counsel   submitted   that   as  per   the   award   dated   28.04.2014,   the   learned  arbitrators   have   directed   the   sellers,   i.e.,  respondent no.1 to pay forthwith to the buyers a  sum   of   USD   846,750.00   and   also   passed   further  awards   to   the   effect   that   all   the   fees   and  expenses   of   the   arbitration   be   paid   by   the  sellers and if any sum already paid by the buyers  in this respect to be reimbursed by the sellers  on the same conditions as a principal awards as  above.\n13. Mr.   Thakore   further   submitted   that   the   said  awards   dated   28.04.2014   were   challenged   before  the  appellate   forum  being   Appeal  Award  No.4383,  which   came   to   be   rejected   vide   order   dated  HC-NIC Page 8 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER 16.04.2015,   against   which   the   review   was  preferred   by   the   respondents   which   was   also  rejected on 26.05.2015.\n14. Mr.   Thakore   further   submitted   that   the   orders  passed   by   the   appellate   forum   was   further  challenged   before   the   High   Court   of   Justice,  Queen's   Bench   Division   Commercial   Court   of  England,   which   culminated   into   the   order   dated  14.07.2015,  which  was  also  confirmed  in  further  appeal vide order dated 04.02.2016.\n15. Mr.   Thakore   submitted   that   in   light   of   the  aforesaid facts and considering the provisions of  the   Act,   burden   is   upon   the   respondents   to  satisfy this Court and to show that the awards in  question   are   not   enforceable   as   provided   under  Section 48(1) and/or 48(2) of the Act and relied  upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case  of  Shri   Lal   Mahal   Ltd.   vs.   Progetto   Grano   SPA  reported in (2014) 2 SCC 433.\n16. Mr. Thakore submitted that the present petitions  are execution petitions and this Court will have  to   determine   in   two   parts.   Referring   to   the  provisions   of   the   Act   and   more   particularly  Sections 46, 47, 48, it was contended that this  Court will have to determine whether the awards  which   are   foreign   awards   are   enforceable   and  declare it as decree of this Court.\n17. Mr. Thakore submitted that the second stage can  HC-NIC Page 9 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER be kept pending and only after this Court comes  to   the   conclusion   that   the   awards   become  enforceable, then it would become decree of this  Court and then execute it as provided under Order  21   of   the   Civil   Procedure   Code   and   subsequent  stage   can   be   decided   later   and   therefore,   the  present hearing may be limited to the application  of   Section   48   of   the   Act.     At   this   stage,   Mr.  Thakore also relied upon the judgment of the Apex  Court in the case of M/S. Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd  vs   Jindal   Exports   Ltd.   reported   in   2001(6)   SCC \n356.\n18. Mr.  Soparkar,   learned  counsel  appearing  for   the  respective   respondents   raised   the   following  contentions ­\n19. That this Court may decide the issue of Section  47 of the Act first and then decide whether the  awards are enforceable or not.\n20. It was contended that as provided under Section  46   of   the   Act,   the   Arbitration   has   to   be   by   a  party or in relation to contract executed between  whom it is made.  It is not in dispute that only  the   firms   were   party   to   the   contracts.   It   was  contended that Section 47 read with Section 49 of  the   Act   will   have   bearing   on   the   proceedings  inasmuch   as,   individuals   are   not   party   to   the  proceedings   and   therefore   foreign   awards   would  not be binding on them.\nHC-NIC                             Page 10 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017\n                 O/IAAP/2/2017                                            ORDER\n21. It was contended that the provisions of section  49 of the Act provides that the award is to be  made   decree   by   this   Court   which   is   the   first  stage and therefore, the individuals are wrongly  joined and have no locus and even the petitions  do   not   contain   any   averment   to   justify   the  presence of individuals other than the companies.\n22. Referring to the provisions of section 48(2) of  the Act, it was contended by the learned counsel  appearing   for   the   respondent   that   the   damages  would   mean   the   damages   immediate   and   not   for  profiteering.\n23. Referring to the provisions of section 51(3) of  the   U.K.   Sale   of   Goods   Act   as   well   as   section  51(2)   of   the   said   Act,   Mr.   Soparkar   learned  counsel   appearing   for   the   respondent   contended  that it has to be exact damages.   Referring to  the awards in origin as well as the awards passed  by   the   appellate   board   of   GAFTA,   Mr.   Soparkar,  contended   that   the   amount   awarded   is   more   than  its   true   loss   and   it   is   an   unusual   case   which  would shock the conscience of this Court. It was  further   contended   that   even   according   to   the  petitioner,   the   actual   loss   is   much   less   than  what   is   awarded.     It   was   contended   that  approximately,   the   amount   of   13   million   USD   is  awarded for 9 contracts only.\n24. It was also further contended that the High Court  of   England   has   not   confirmed   the   orders   of   the  HC-NIC Page 11 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER Arbitration  awards  passed  by  the  arbitrators  as  well as the appellate arbitration board, but has  refused   to   entertain   the   objections   of   the  respondents by holding that the view taken by the  Arbitration   Tribunal/Board   is   not   obviously  wrong.   By   referring   to   Section   69   of   the   U.K.  Sale of Goods Act and even referring to the order  passed by Court of appeal, it was contended that  the Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal  without hearing and the decision has become final  as per the English law.\n25. Relying   upon   the   judgment   of   the   Apex   Court   in  the   case   of  Shri   Lal   Mahal   Ltd(supra),   Mr.  Soparkar,   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the  respondent contended that the awards in question  have become final only as per English Law and the  provisions   of   section   48   of   the   Act   and   more  particularly   section   48(2)(b)   of   the   Act   would  apply and the respondents have a right to dispute  the   same   as   it   is   against   the   public   policy.  Relying   upon   the   judgment   of   the   Apex   Court   in  the case of Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. vs. General  Electric Co. reported in AIR 1994 SC 860 as well  as   the   judgment   in   the   case   of  Associate  Builders   vs.   Delhi   Development   Authority  reported in (2015) 3 SCC 49 and judgment of the  Calcutta High Court in the case of Gopalchandra  Mukherjee  v.  Food  Corporation  of  India  reported  in   (2017)   SCC   Online   Calcutta   67,   it   was  contended   that   the   awards   would   be   contrary   to  HC-NIC Page 12 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the   public   policy   in   India   and   the   same   are  against fundamental principles of Indian law and  violative   of   morality   and   justice   and   the   same  would shock the conscience of this Court.\n26. It   was   contended   that   mere   violation   of   Indian  law may not satisfy the test that it is against  public policy, but when it is against fundamental  rules   of   legal   system   of   the   country,   such  foreign awards are not enforceable.\n27. Further relying upon the judgment in the case of  Renu   Sagar   (supra)   more   particularly   paragraphs  No.68   to   76,   the   judgment   of   the   Apex   Court  reported in 1994 (suppl.) SCC 465 as well as the  judgment   rendered   in   the   case   of  Laxman   Prasad  v. Prodigy Ele. Ltd. & Anr. reported in (2005) 5  SCC  465   (at   page   477),  it   was   contended   that  test is provided to the effect that whether the  awards in question are violative of Indian law or  whether   it   is   against   the   basic   principles   of  morality   and   justice   and   whether   there   is  flagrant/gross breach of the same.\n28. Explaining   and   elucidating   the   impugned   orders  further, Mr.Soparkar contended that the awards of  the  Arbitration  Tribunal  whereby  as  against   the  direct loss of around 3 million USD, a total loss  including consequential loss of 5 million USD for  14 contracts is being compensated by damages in  sum   exceeding   13   million   USD   for   9   contracts,  which   is   fundamentally   in   violation   of   Indian  HC-NIC Page 13 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER jurisprudence   wherein   compensation   is   always   to  make good damages suffered and not profiteering.\n29. Referring   to   Section   57   of   the   Indian   Sale   of  Goods Act and Section 73 of the Indian Contract  Act,   it   was   contended   by   Mr.   Soparkar   that   the  provision is to pay direct loss and not indirect  loss   and   not   for   profiteering   and   the   parties  cannot be made richer. Mr. Soparkar also further  contended that the parties had entered into back  to back contracts and have adopted the cause and  minimise   the   loss   and   the   petitioners   have  adopted such a cause whereby they have minimised  the loss and therefore the petitioners cannot ask  for more.\n30. Referring   to   Section   73   of   the   Indian   Contract  Act as well as the judgment of the Apex Court in  the case of Messrs. Torjan & Company Vs. RM.N.N.  Nagappa Chettiar reported in AIR 1953 SC 235, it  was   contended   by   Mr.   Soparkar,   learned   counsel  appearing for the respondents that a party cannot  be   awarded   astronomical   profits   that   he   would  have   made.   Mr.   Soparkar   contended   that   if   the  petitioner would have purchased it from the open  market,   to   satisfy   the   back   to   back   contracts  entered into by the petitioner with its proposed  buyer, only in such circumstances, it can claim  for   profit   which   otherwise   is   not   entitled   to.  It was submitted that the petitioner cannot claim  greater amount than penalty which is permissible.\nHC-NIC                             Page 14 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017\n                  O/IAAP/2/2017                                            ORDER\n31. Relying   upon   the   judgments   of   the   Apex   Court  rendered in the cases of  DCM   Decometal   Gmbh   v.  Rohit  Ferro  Tech  Ltd.,  reported in  AIR  1962  SC  366  and  Union of India & Ors. v. Sugauli Sugar  Works Pvt. Ltd.  reported in 1976 (3) SCC 32, it  was   contended   by   Mr.   Soparkar,   learned   counsel  for   the   respondent   that   only   the   loss   due   to  breach   of   contract   and   steps   taken   to   mitigate  such loss can be awarded as damages and nothing  beyond loss. It was contended that it being back  to   back   contract   which   was   known   to   the  petitioner   and   not   having   gone   in   the   market  cannot be permitted to profiteer as if they have  suffered   damage   of   the   profit   as   well   and   this  fundamental basis can be considered only if the  contract   is   performed.     It   was   therefore  contended   that   these   facts   would   shock   the  conscience of the Court and it is against equity  and fairness.\n32. Relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay  High   Court   reported   in  2015   Bombay   CR   204,   it  was   contended   that   in   the   fact   situation,   it  would   be   a   case   of   unjust   enrichment   which   is  against fundamental policy of Indian law and the  petitioner cannot be permitted to make profit out  of the breach of contract.\n33. Relying   upon   the   judgment   of   the   Calcutta   High  Court in the case of Usha Beltron Ltd. v. Nand  Kishore Parasramka & Anr., reported in AIR 2001  HC-NIC Page 15 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER Calcutta   137,   it   was   contended   that   in   these  facts   and   circumstances   this   Court   can   go   into  this   aspect   as   the   same   would   shock   the  conscience of the Court.\n34. Mr.   Soparkar   further   contended   that   the  fundamental  policy  of  the   Indian  Law  prescribes  that no one can profiteer from breach of contract  and breach of contract cannot result into profit  and therefore, there is violation of fundamental  policy of Indian law.\n35. It   was   reiterated   that   even   as   per   the   justice  and morality would it be just if a person would  profit, for example Rs.65 crores, which profit he  would   not   have   made   if   the   contract   would   have  been   executed.   It   was   contended   that   it   is   a  penalty   and   therefore,   this   Court   may   not  entertain   these   petitions   on   the   aforesaid  grounds.     It   was   contended   that   the   awards   are  against the fundamental policy of Indian law and  therefore it is not a fit case wherein this Court  would come to the conclusion that it is a deemed  decree of this Court as provided under section 49  of   the   Act   and   none   of   the   conditions   are  satisfied and the impugned awards are against the  fundamental   policy   of   Indian   law,   morality,  justice   and   profiteering   may   not   be   permitted  under section 49 of the Act and therefore, this  Court may be pleased to reject these petitions.\n36. Mr.   Mehul   S.   Shah,   learned   Senior   Counsel  HC-NIC Page 16 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER appearing   for   the   respective   respondents   has  taken   this   Court   through   the   judgments   of   the  Apex   Court   in   Renu   Sagar   (supra)   and   has  contended as under ­\n37. That Sections 34 and 48 of the Act were similar  and the judgments of the Apex Court in  Shri Lal  Mahal   Ltd.   (supra)  clarified   the   situation   and  provided   for   test   and   guide   as   well   as   the  parameters   to   be   followed   as   to   what   would   be  against public policy of Indian law, morality and  justice.\n38. It   was   further   contended   that   looking   at   the  awards   as   it   is,   it   cannot   be   said   that   the  respondents   are   liable   under   damages   and   such  damages   could   ever   be   awarded.   It   was   further  contended  that  keeping  in  mind  both  rationality  and   principles   of   damages,   the   impugned   awards  cannot be executed as the same are not accepted  by the Indian law and in the instant case, the  test   provided   by   the   aforesaid   judgments   are  apparently  not  fulfilled  and   allowing  the  award  as it is, it would be allowing unjust enrichment  of the award once it is deemed to be decree of  this Court and that valid and germane defence is  available   to   the   respondents   before   the   awards  are considered to be decree.\n39. Referring to the emails, which in fact have been  referred   to   by   Mr.   Soparkar,   it   was   contended  that   the   actual   loss   is   lesser   than   what   is  HC-NIC Page 17 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER awarded.     It   was   contended   that   the   award   of  damages   in   such   contract   matter   is   to   mitigate  the   loss   and   on   facts,   it   has   been   found   that  only deposits have been forfeited.\n40. Relying upon the judgments of the Apex Court in  the cases of  Centrotrade   Minerals   &   Metal   Inc.  v.   Hindustan   Copper   Ltd.,  reported in  (2017)   2  SCC 228, Maula Bux v. Union of India reported in  (1969)   2   SCC   554   and   Fateh   Chand   v.   Balkishan  Dass  reported   in  AIR   1963   SC   1405,   Mr.   Shah  contended   that   no   evidence   is   led   for   actual  loss.     It   was   further   contended   by   Mr.   Shah,  learned counsel appearing for the respondent that  it is not permissible for any judicial authority  to award damages by just applying some measures  suggested by the claimants which may be applied  for   in   given   facts   of   the   case   that   there   is  definite  pleading,  evidence  and   finding.  It  was  contended that if that is not  so, the authority  has   to   find   out   actual   damages   from   the   facts  resulting from the breach of the contract. It was  therefore contended that this is not a fit case  for considering the impugned award as decree of  this Court.\n41. Mr. Rashesh S. Sanjanwala learned senior counsel  assisted   by   Mr.   Sahil   M.   Shah,   learned   counsel  has adopted the arguments adopted by Mr. Soparkar  and   Mr.   Mehul   Shah,   learned   senior   counsels  appearing for the respective respondents.\nHC-NIC                            Page 18 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017\n                 O/IAAP/2/2017                                           ORDER\n42. The learned counsels appearing for the respective  respondents  have   also  further  contended  that  it  is   found   from   the   record   that   there   were   13  contracts   for   which   notice   for   arbitration   has  been   given.     It   was   further   pointed   out   that  pursuant   to   the   said   notice,   reference   was   so  made   and   the   Tribunal   was   constituted   and   the  Tribunal   has   proceeded   only   in   reference   to   9  cases   and   other   cases   are   remaining.     It   was  further   contended   that   the   claims   sought   to   be  raised   by   similar   companies   are   common,   but   in  five   cases,   it   has   come   on   record.     It   was  further   contended   that   the   14   cases   could   have  been   simultaneously   decided.   It   was   contended  that there would have been all chances of award,  which  are  likely  to  have  contradictory  findings  on merits as well as in law though arising from  similar contract, stipulation and same date.  It  was apprehended that there would be likelihood of  contradiction   on   merits   and   in   law.     It   was  further   pointed   out   that   the   petitioner   has  sought   for   extension   of   time   for   production   of  documents   and   therefore   pursuant   to   the  extension, if now these cases are taken up, the  resultant effect in law would be that again there  would   be   contradictory   findings   and   therefore,  the present petitions are premature.\n43. Mr.  Mihir  J.  Thakore,  learned  counsel   appearing  for   the   petitioner   in   his   further   reply   has  HC-NIC Page 19 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER contended as under ­\n44. That prima facie, the awards are just and proper.\n45. That the issues which are raised cannot be looked  into.\n46. Referring   to   the   proposal   e­mail   dated  12.06.2012,   16.07.2012   as   well   as   email   dated  21.07.2012,   it   was   contended   that   there   was   no  response.\n47. Referring to the same from the awards in origin,  it was contended that as noted by the Tribunal,  the   proposals   were   given   to   resolve   the   matter  and it was contended that the Tribunal has read  the   same   and   that   all   such   offers   were   without  prejudice   offers   to   resolve   the   issue   and   the  same cannot be seen at the stage of enforcement  of the award.\n48. Mr.   Thakore,   referring   to   the   provisions   of  section 51(2) and 51(3) of the U.K. Sale of Goods  Act, contended that the same has been considered  by the Tribunal as well as in the appeal award  and even the aspect of actual loss in light of  the   provision   of   section   51(3)   has   been  considered by the Arbitral appellate Tribunal and  the same is overruled. Referring to para 10.15 of  the award,  Mr. Thakore contended that the aspect  of   back   to   back   contract   is   concluded   by   the  Tribunal   and   the   Tribunal   has   come   to   the  HC-NIC Page 20 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER definite conclusion that the contract in question  were  not \"inextricably linked\"and  that the  case  is governed by section 51(3)of the U.K. Sale of  Goods   Act.   It   is   further   contended   by   Mr.  Thakore, learned counsel for the petitioner that  these findings given by the Arbitration Tribunal  as   well   as   the   appellate   Tribunal   are   given   on  interpretation of the facts under English law. \n49. It   was   contended   that   as   per   the   provisions   of  the   Act   and   even   as   provided   under   sections   28  and   48   of   the   Act,   this   Court   cannot   entail  review on merits and same is not contemplated by  the Act and this Court also cannot challenge the  validity.     Only   enforcement   can   be   challenged.  Mr. Thakore also relied upon the judgment of the  Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  ONGC   v.   Saw   Pipes  reported in 2003(5) SCC 705.\n50. Mr. Thakore further contended that the issue of  damages   has   been   considered   by   the   Tribunal   in  detail   as   per   the   clauses.   It   was   also   further  contended   that   section   69   of   the   English  Arbitration Act, 1996 provides for an appeal on  the   point   of   law   and   sub­section   (2)   thereof  provides for leave of the Court which prescribes  that appeal would be with the leave of the Court  when it found that the award is obviously wrong.  It   was   contended   that   as   held   by   the   Hon'ble  Queen's Division Bench of London High Court, the  first   question   to   be   considered   as   per   the  HC-NIC Page 21 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER English  law  was  whether  requirement  of  sections  69(3)(a)   &   (b)   are   made   out   or   not   and   the  Hon'ble Bench has come to the conclusion that the  decision   of   the   Board   was   not   obviously   wrong.  It   was   therefore   contended   that   on   such  satisfaction   only   High   Court   can   deal   with   the  matter.\n51. Mr.   Thakore   further   contended   that   the   parties  have agreed for applicability of English law and  the seat of arbitration would be London and once  having  accepted  English  law,   challenge  would  be  limited as provided under Sections 68 and 69 of  the   English   Arbitration   Act,   1996.   It   was  contended   that   the   Tribunal   has   come   to   the  conclusion the there are no special circumstances  as to why section 51(3) of the UK Sale of Goods  Act should not be applied and the petitioner has  lost market value of the goods. Referring to the  judgment of the review before the High Court as  well as to the Court of appeal, it was contended  by   Mr.   Thakore   that   the   proceedings   ended   in  England.\n52. Mr.   Thakore   contended   that   the   judgment   of   the  Apex   Court   in   Saw   Pipe   (supra)   clarifies   the  distinct   jurisdiction   between   sections   34   and  section 48 of the Act and the same is in context  with the provisions of section 34 of the Act and  the Hon'ble Court was quite conscious of the fact  that   the   judgment   of   three   judges   cannot   be  overruled.\nHC-NIC                            Page 22 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017\n                  O/IAAP/2/2017                                            ORDER\n53. Referring   to   the   judgment   in   the   case   of   Renu  Sagar   (supra),   Mr.   Thakore   contended   that   the  contention   that   the   award   is   contrary   to   the  English law is not available.   Mr. Thakore also  further  contended  that  whether  section  51(2)  of  the   English   law   or   51(3)   of   the   English   law  should be applied cannot be looked into by this  Court nor it would enable any party to argue the  same. Referring further to the observations made  in   the   case   of   Renu   Sagar   (supra),   it   was  contended that the argument that it is a case of  unjust enrichment is also not permissible.   Mr.  Thakore   also   contended   that   the   parties   have  agreed   to   English   law   and   it   is   analysed  accordingly.\n54. Mr.   Thakore   contended   that   section   21   of   the  Arbitration   Act   is   in   part   I   of   the   Act   and  applies   only   to   domestic   arbitration   and  international   arbitration   in   India   and   no  exceptions are carved out in respect of foreign  awards.   Mr.   Thakore   further   submitted   that  section 48 is to be interpreted narrowly and by  virtue of amendment in section 48 of the Act, now  issues   are   kept   beyond   doubt.   It   was   further  contended   that   this   Court   cannot   go   into   the  correctness   of   the   award   and   the   case   of   the  respondent   that   it   was   back   to   back  contract/order, and that it could have been sold  in open market cannot be examined by this Court.\nHC-NIC                             Page 23 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017\n                  O/IAAP/2/2017                                            ORDER\n55. Mr.   Thakore   further   contended   that   the   other  contentions   raised   as   regards   profiteering   that  the Tribunal has given more than six times than  what is suffered by the petitioner and that the  award is against the fundamental policy of Indian  law,   morality   and   justice,   is   to   be   given   a  narrow   meaning   once   the   Tribunal   has   correctly  examined as per the English law and found that no  further   enquiry   would   be   necessary.     It   was  therefore   submitted   that   this   Court   may   be  pleased to hold that the awards in question are  enforceable and are not against the provisions of  section   48(2)   of   the   Act   and   declare   it   to   be  decree of this Court.\n56. Mr. Mihir Thakore, learned counsel appearing for  the   petitioner   has   also   relied   upon   the  provisions   of   section   51(3)   of   the   UK   Sale   of  Goods Act and the relevant observations made by  the  GAFTA  Appellate  Board   and  more   particularly  paragraphs 10.3 to 10.5, 10.12 to 10.17 and has  contended that the findings given in the awards  cannot be reviewed on the ground of fundamental  policy of Indian law particularly in view of the  explanation 2 of section 48(2) of the Act and has  further   referred   to   and   relied   upon   the   order  passed by the GAFTA appellate board on the plea  of   clarification   by   the   respondents   dated  26.05.2015   as   well   as   the   order   passed   by   the  Queen's Bench, division of London on 14.07.2015.\n57. It was further contended that even the reliance  HC-NIC Page 24 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER placed upon the judgment of Bunge vs. Nidera of  the Queen's Bench was found by the Bench that the  said   case   would   not   apply   to   the   arbitration  proceedings  before  GAFTA.   Referring  to  section  48(1)(a),   48(1)(b)(c)(d)(e)   as   well   as   section  48(2)(a),   section   48(2)(b)   of   the   Act,   it   was  submitted that the scope of inquiry by this Court  would not permit or allow a review on merits of  the   dispute   and   the   scope   of   inquiry   on   the  ground of public policy under section 48 of the  Act in relation to foreign award is much narrower  than public policy as contained under section 34  of the Act, which deals with domestic awards and  not foreign awards. \n58. It   was   also   submitted   that   the   judgment   in   the  case of Saw Pipes (supra) would not apply to the  present   case   as   the   Hon'ble   Apex   Court   has  considered the domestic award and the provisions  of section 34 of the Act for enforcement of such  domestic award. \n59. Relying upon the amendment, whereby explanations  1 and 2 have been inserted w.e.f. 23.10.2015, it  was contended that in view of such amendment, the  scope of inquiry by this Court on the ground of  public policy has further become limited and the  awards which are found to be in conflict with the  public   policy   of   India   where   the   making   of   the  awards was induced by fraud or corruption or is  violative of sections 75 or 81 of the Act, or the  HC-NIC Page 25 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER award   is   in   contravention   of   the   fundamental  policy of Indian law, or is in contravention with  the   most   basic   notions   of   morality   and   justice  can be reviewed by this Court.   It was further  submitted   that   on   the   contrary,   it   has   been  provided  that   whether  there  is  contravention  in  the   public   policy   in   Indian   shall   not   entail   a  review on the merits of the dispute.   Thus, the  scope and purview of section 48 is very limited.\n60. It was further submitted that the awards are in  consonance with the public policy of the India as  provided under section 48(2)(b) of the Act.\n61. It was contended that the parties had agreed that  the English law will apply.   The GAFTA Tribunal  has   correctly   applied   section   51(3)   of   the   UK  Sale of Goods Act and the awards cannot be said  to   be   contrary   to   the   fundamental   policy   of  India.\n62. It   was   further   submitted   that   the   contention  raised by the respondent before this Court that  only direct loss suffered by the petitioner as a  result   of   the   breach   of   contract   as   prescribed  under section 51(2) of the UK Sale of Goods Act  executed   by   it   with   its   Korean   sub­buyer   and  other   direct   losses   cannot   be   included   and   the  difference   in   the   value   cannot   be   awarded   as  provided under section 51(3) of the Act cannot be  re­agitated   before   this   Court   as   the   same   is   a  question   of   fact   and   the   same   would   amount   to  HC-NIC Page 26 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER review of the merits of the dispute which is not  permissible under section 48(2) of the Act.   It  was  submitted   that  GAFTA  Tribunal  has   correctly  applied as provided under section 51(3) of the UK  Sales of Goods Act, which has become final right  upto   the   Queen's   Bench   as   referred   to  hereinabove, which cannot be reviewed as the same  would amount to review on merits of the dispute.\n63. It was also contended that the contention raised  by   the   respondents   that   the   enforcement   of   the  present   awards   would   lead   to   a   situation   of  unjust enrichment making the awards unenforceable  by this Court as the same would be contrary to  the fundamental policy of Indian law as it is in  violation   of   sections   73   and   74   of   the   Indian  Contract   Act   would   not   amount   to   violation   of  fundamental policy of India.\n64. The learned counsel for the petitioner has relied  upon the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the  case of  Cruz City Mauritius Holdings v. Unitech  Ltd. reported in (2017) SCC Online Del. 7810 and  other decisions of various High Court to buttress  his argument that mere violation of provision of  Indian   law   would   not   amount   to   violation   of  fundamental   policy   of   India.     It   has   been  contended   that   the   respondents   have   failed   to  demonstrate  that   the  awards  amount  to  violation  fundamental   policy   of   India   and   merely   because  the Tribunal has held that section 51(3) of the  HC-NIC Page 27 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER UK   Sale   of   Goods   Act   applies,   which   is   a  different   measure   of   determination   of   loss,   it  cannot   be   said   that   the   awards   are   contrary   to  the fundamental policy of Indian law and the most  basic principles of justice and morality.\n65. Relying  upon  the  provisions  of  section  28(1)(b)  clause (1) of the Act, it was submitted that the  Act itself mandates that an arbitral tribunal of  an international commercial arbitration in India  is   required   to   apply   the   law   governing   the  disputes   as   that   is   chosen   by   the   parties   and  therefore, it was contended that the enforcement  of the award would not be against the most basic  principles of justice and morality.   The learned  counsel   for   the   petitioner   has   further   relied  upon   the   judgments   of   the   Bombay   High   Court   as  well as Delhi High Court in the case of  Etizen  Bulk   &   Ashapura   Minechem   Ltd   (2016(2)   ArbLR  113(Bom),   M/s.   Lois   Dreyfus   Commodities   v.  Sakuma   Exports   Ltd   (2015   6   Bom   CR   258),  Sideralba  S.P.  A v. Shree  Precoated  Steels   Ltd  (Arbitration Petition No.84 of 2013, High Court  of Bombay) and Xstrata Coal Marketing v. Dalmia  Bharat   (Cement)   Ltd   (236   (2017)   DLT   524)  to  buttress his argument that the issue of damages  or unjust enrichment amounts to a review of the  merits of the disputes and is beyond the scope of  purview permitted under section 48 of the Act.\n66. On   the   aforesaid   grounds,   it   was   therefore  HC-NIC Page 28 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER submitted   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the  petitioner   that   9   Arbitration   Awards   are  appropriate,   just   and   proper   and   enforceable  under the Indian law.\n67. Mr. Soparkar, learned counsel for the respondents  has  reiterated  the  arguments   which  were  already  canvassed.   Mr.  Soparkar  further  contended  that  the   present   awards   are   not   merely   violative   of  Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act but it is  also such that it would shock the conscience of  the Court and has given further example, which is  enumerated as below ­ If A agrees to sell the goods to B at Rs.95   and B would be selling it further to C, to  make   a   profit   of   Rs.3   on   it,   and   deposits   Rs.2 with C as security; then in the event   of   default   by   A,   B   ought   to   be   awarded   a   maximum   compensation   of   Rs.5   (i.e.   Rs.   3  towards   loss   of   profit   and   Rs.2   towards  forfeiture of deposit by C).  However, if B   is   awarded   a   compensation   of   Rs.105,   by  calculating   the   difference   between   the   market   price   (say   Rs.   200   on   the   date   of  default)   and   the   contract   price   (i.e.   Rs.95),   the   B   would   be   making   a   colossal  profit out of the breach of contract by A,   which   cannot   be   permitted.     Even   if   the  contract   would   have   been   performed   by   A,  then B would have earned profit of Rs.3 and   not Rs.105.  Grant of Rs.105 to B, would be  something   which   would   shock   the   conscience   of this Hon'ble Court and would be against  the public policy of India.  \n68. To buttress the aforesaid argument, Mr. Soparkar  has relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in  the case of  Gherulal Parekh v. Mahadeodas Maiya  HC-NIC Page 29 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER reported  in AIR 1959 SC 781  and in the case of  Murlidhar   Agarwal   vs.   State   of   UP   (1974   2   SCC  472  and  Central   Inlald   Water   vs.   Brojo   Nath  Ganguly reported in 1986 (2) SCC 156.\n69. It   was   also   further   contended   that   the  respondents are not seeking review of the award  passed   by   the   arbitral   tribunal   and   by  explanations 1 and 2 of section 48(2), the only  limitation imposed by the legislature is not to  enter   into   merits   of   the   award.   However,   this  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  determine  whether   the  foreign award is violative of fundamental policy  of India or not and further it was contended that  there   is   no   limitation   imposed   upon   by   the  legislature for entering into the merits of the  award   by   this   Court   and   that   this   Court   has  jurisdiction to test the award on the ground of  morality and justice and this Court has to decide  as to what would be just and moral.\n70. It   was   submitted   that   the   argument   of   the  petitioner   that   if   the   respondent   would   have  supplied goods then they would have breached the  contracts with the Korean buyers and would have  sold the said goods at the market price, thereby  making   a   profit   out   of   it,   is   nothing   but   a  speculative argument and cannot be considered by  this   Court   and   it   was   therefore   submitted   that  execution of the awards deserves to be refused by  this   Court   in   view   of   the   objections   raised   by  HC-NIC Page 30 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the   respondents   in   the   objections   filed   under  sections   47   and   48   of   the   Act   as   well   as   the  submissions made.\n71. No   other   or   further   submissions   have   been   made  and   as   noted   hereinabove,   the   aforesaid  discussion   also   includes   written   submissions  which are submitted by both the sides.\n72. Before reverting to the submissions made by the  learned   counsel   appearing   for   the   parties,   it  would   be   appropriate   to   refer   to   the   relevant  provisions of the Act ­ The Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 Section 2(1)(f) 'international   commercial   arbitration'  means an arbitration relating to disputes  arising   out   of   legal   relationships,  whether contractual or not, considered as  commercial   under   the   law   in   force   in  Indian   and   where   at   least   one   of   the   parties is­\n(i)an individual who is a national of, or  habitually resident in, any country other  than India; or\n(ii) a   body   corporate   which   is  incorporated   in   any   country   other   than  India;\n(iii) an   association   or   a   body   of  individuals   whose   central   management   and  control is exercised in any country other  than India; or HC-NIC Page 31 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER\n(iv) the   Government   of   a   foreign  country;\nSection 47.

In order to understand the controversy with which  this   Court   is   concerned   at   this   stage   is   that,  admittedly   there   were   contracts   between   the  petitioner and the respondent No.1 in particular,  which is described in detail hereinabove. It is  also   an   admitted   position   that   as   per   the   said  contract, the parties have agreed that \"seat of  arbitration would be London\".  Thus,  the  parties  as   per   the   arbitration   clause   provided   in   the  contract,   were   relegated   to   arbitration   as   per  the GAFTA Rules, which culminated into awards in  origin by three arbitrators dated 28.04.2014. It  is also an admitted position that the respondents  preferred appeals challenging the original awards  before the Board of Appeal, GAFTA, London and the  appellate   board   of   GAFTA   after   hearing   the  parties   was   pleased   to   uphold   all   the   original  awards   on   16.04.2015.     Thereafter,   the  respondents approached GAFTA Appeal Board seeking  HC-NIC Page 35 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER clarification   of   the   awards   which   came   to   be  rejected   by   GAFTA   Appellate   Board   vide  order/communication   dated   26.05.2015.   The  respondents   carried   the   same   further   by   filing  appeals as provided under sections 68 and 69 of  the English Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996  before the High Court of Justice Queen's Division  Commercial   Court   and   the   Hon'ble   Queen's   Bench  Division of London High Court by an order dated  14.07.2015 refused leave to appeal the awards to  the   respondents.     The   respondents   thereafter  approached the Court of appeal in London against  the   order   passed   by   the   Hon'ble   Queen's   Bench  division   of   London   High   Court   and   by   a   final  order   dated   04.02.2016,   the   Court   of   appeal   in  London refused the appeal against the order dated  14.07.2015   and   also   disallowed   the   plea   of   the  respondents   to   prefer   an   appeal   before   the  Supreme Court of United Kingdom.\n74. At the outset, it deserves to be noted that the  learned   counsel   for   the   respondents   did   raise  objection  that  the  applications   did  not  satisfy  the requirement of section 47. At this stage, it  deserves   to   be   noted   that   the   petitioner   had  approached   the   Hon'ble   Division   Bench   of   this  Court under section 15(1) of the Commercial Court  Act   and   the   Hon'ble   Division   of   the   this   Court  held   that   the   execution   petitions   which   were  pending  before  the  District  Court  at  Gandhidham  should   be   transferred   to   this   Court   under  HC-NIC Page 36 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER Commercial   Court,   Commercial   Division   and  Commercial Appellate Division of the High Courts  Act, 2015.\n75. It   further   deserves   to   be   noted   that   the  respondent herein contended that the applications  are not maintainable as the conditions of Section  47   of   the   Act   are   not   satisfied,   more  particularly   as   the   petitioner   did   not   produce  the certified copy of the award or notarized copy  of   the   award.   The   applicants   preferred   Civil  Application   (O.J)   NO.400/2017  and   allied  applications  and   have   produced   notarized   copies  of the awards and this Hon'ble Court has passed  the following order: \n\"Heard   learned   counsels   appearing   for  the parties. \nBy   this   application,   the   applicant   has  prayed   for   brining   on   record   the   true  copy of the award passed by the Arbitral   Tribunal.\nHaving   heard   learned   counsels   for   the  parties,   the   applications   are   allowed.  The   true   copy   of   award   in   each   application   is   taken   on   record.  Applications disposed of accordingly.\"\n76. It   may   be   noted   that   section   47   lays   down   the  procedural   requirement,   which   the   party   has  applied   for   enforcement   of   a   foreign   award   and  such   provision   is   based   upon   Article   IV   of  Newyork Convention. It also deserves to be noted  that   before   effective   stage   of   execution,   the  duly notarised copy has been brought on record.\nHC-NIC                              Page 37 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017\n                  O/IAAP/2/2017                                             ORDER\n77. In light of the aforesaid therefore, it cannot be  said that the conditions of the said sections are  not satisfied. \n78. Upon   considering   the   submissions   made   by   the  learned counsel appearing for the parties and on  perusal of the record and proceedings as well as  the   judgments   which   are   relied   upon   by   the  learned   counsel   appearing   for   the   respective  parties,   it   is   an   admitted   position   that   the  parties   entered   into   a   contract   for   supply   of  Indian   Rapeseed   Meal   and   in   the   arbitration  clause, it is clearly provided that the seat of  arbitration   would   be   at   London   and   it   would   be  according to the GAFTA 125 Arbitration Rules and  the same would be governed by English law.\n79. Both   the   sides   have   taken   this   Court   to   the  relevant   observations   made   by   the   learned  Arbitrators   as   well   as   Arbitral   Board.     The  contention  raised  by  the  respondent  that   actual  loss is far less than what is granted is to be  seen and appreciated in light of the provisions  of   section   51   of   the   UK   Sale   Goods   Act   as   the  parties   had   agreed   that   the   English   law   will  apply. It is a matter of record that the findings  arrived   at   by   the   Arbitration   Tribunal   and   the  conclusion   arrived   at   by   the   appellate   board  entirely touches the merits of the case. As far  as merits are concerned, the same cannot be re­ appreciated by this Court while dealing with the  HC-NIC Page 38 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER execution petitions with the Indian law and the  findings given are on interpretation of facts of  the   case   and   as   per   the   English   law   and   this  Court   cannot   review   the   same   on   merits   and   its  validity   cannot   be   examined   by   this   Court   in  these proceedings and thus, as per the agreement  between the parties, for applicability of English  law,   the   same   is   analysed   by   the   Courts   in  England.\n80. Therefore, in opinion of this Court, the awards  in   question   which   are   foreign   awards   can   be  examined in light of the provisions of section 48  of the Act only. The aforesaid view is also found  from   the   explanation   2   of   section   48(2)   of   the  Act   that   while   examining   whether   there   is  contravention   with   the   fundamental   policy   of  Indian law, the same shall not entail review on  merits.\n81. The learned counsel for the respondents has also  contended that the High Court of Justice Queen's  Division  Commercial   Court  has  not  confirmed   the  findings   of   the   Tribunal   as   well   as   the  arbitration   appellate   board,   but   has   refused  leave as it was found that the Tribunal was not  obviously  wrong.   At  this  juncture,  reference  be  made to the provisions of section 69 of the UK  Arbitration   Act,   which   provides   for   leave   to  appeal.   From bare reading of the order of the  Queen's   Bench   Division   Court   of   appeal,   it   is  observed   that   the   awards   were   not   obviously  HC-NIC Page 39 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER wrong.     Therefore,   it   cannot   be   said   that   the  awards have not become final and thus, the appeal  preferred by the respondent was disallowed and as  per the English law the awards have become final.  The  facts  clearly  establish  that  the  respondent  Company   exhausted   all   remedies   that   were  available   for   challenging   the   awards/order­in­ origin, available under English law.\n82. The objections raised by the learned counsel for  the respondents are on the following grounds in  light of the provisions of section 48 of the Act­\n1.   That   the   impugned   awards   are   against   the  fundamental public policy of Indian law.  \n2. The awards are in contravention to the public  policy of Indian law.\n3.   That   the   awards   are   against   the   basic  principles   of   morality   and   justice   and   are   in  flagrant and gross breach of the same.  \n4.   That   it   is   such   that   it   would   shock   the  conscience of this Court.\n5. That the awards are exhaustive in nature and  no one can profit from breach of the contract and  is  against   the  provisions   of  section  73  of  the  Indian Contract Act and violative of fundamental  policy of Indian law.  \n6.  That   the  damages   which  are  awarded  are  more  HC-NIC Page 40 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER than the actual loss.\n7. That by the impugned awards, damages which are  awarded are irrational and against the principles  of damages as are accepted by Indian law.\n83. In   light   of   the   aforesaid   facts   which   arise   in  this group of petitions and as contended by the  learned counsel appearing for the respondents in  particular,  this   Court  is  therefore  called  upon  to examine on the aspect that the enforcement of  the   awards   in   question   would   be   contrary   to  public   policy   of   India.   It   is   also   further  contended   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the  respondents based upon the provisions of section  48(2) Explanation 1 clause (2) that the impugned  awards are in contravention with the fundamental  policy   of   India   and   clause   (3),   that   it   is   in  conflict   with   basic   notion   of   morality   and  justice.   Section   48   came   to   be   amended   and  Explanations   1   and   2   as   it   stands   today,   have  been   substituted   by   Act   3   of   2016   w.e.f.  23.10.2015   and   explanation   2   further   provides  that   the   test   as   to   whether   there   is  contravention   with   the   fundamental   policy   of  Indian law shall not entail a review on merits of  the dispute.  \n84. The first limb of argument which is put forward  by the learned counsel for the respondents is to  the effect that the impugned awards are contrary  to   the   public   policy   of   India.     The   basis   for  HC-NIC Page 41 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER that contention is that the awards prescribe for  more   than   actual   loss.   It   is   also   further  contended that the High Court of Justice Queen's  Division   Commercial   Court   has   only   refused   to  entertain   the   appeal   only   by   holding   that   the  view taken by the arbitral board is not obviously  wrong.     It   is   also   contended   that   the   impugned  awards   are   violative   of   Indian   law   inasmuch   as  that against direct loss of 3 million dollars and  total consequential loss of 5 million dollars for  14 contracts, the petitioner is being compensated  by   damages   in   sum   of   13   million   dollars   for   9  contracts   and   the   same   is   fundamentally   in  violation   of   Indian   jurisprudence   wherein  compensation   is   always   to   make   good   damages  suffered and not profiteering.\n85. In furtherance of the said contention it is also  contended by the respondents that if the impugned  awards are permitted to be implemented then the  same   would   amount   to   unjust   enrichment.   It   was  also further contended that though the petitioner  has   not   gone   to   market,   cannot   be   permitted   to  profiteer   and   as   it   was   back   to   back   contract,  only loss of profit can be awarded and therefore,  it   is   against   the   fundamental   policy   of   Indian  law   and   also   against   morality   and   justice.   The  respondents have also contended that it is also  in   breach   of   section   73   of   the   Indian   Contract  Act   and   therefore   it   is   in   violation   of  fundamental policy of Indian law and the awards  HC-NIC Page 42 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER are   exhaustive   in   nature   which   would   shock   the  conscience   of   this   Court.     Relying   upon   the  judgments which are dealt with in this judgment  separately,   it   is   contended   that   it   is   not  permissible  for  any  judicial   authority  to  award  damages   by   just   applying   the   same   measure  suggested by the claimant which may be applied in  given   facts   of   case   and   in   fact   the   actual  damages   found   on   such   appreciation   of   evidence  only be granted.\n86. Over   and   above,   it   is   evident   from   the  contentions  which  are  raised   by  the  respondents  that they have on basis of the findings arrived  at   by   the   Arbitration   Tribunal   as   well   as  appellate   board,   it   is   contended   that   the  impugned   awards   are   against   the   fundamental  policy   of   Indian   law   and   therefore,   are   not  enforceable and cannot be deemed to be a decree  of   this   Court   and   the   petitions   are   therefore  required to be dismissed.\n87. The   aforesaid   contentions   are   denied   by   the  learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   and   it   is  contended that the scope of inquiry under section  48 of the Act is limited and the same does not  allow a review of the merits of the dispute.  It  is also contended that mere violation of sections  73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act would not  amount   to   violation   of   fundamental   policy   of  Indian   law.     It   is   also   contended   that   the  HC-NIC Page 43 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER contentions   raised   by   the   respondents   that   the  awards   would   allow   unjust   enrichment   and   would  allow   review   of   the   merits   is   wholly   misplaced  and therefore, it is contended that 9 arbitration  awards   are   appropriate,   just   and   proper   and  enforceable under Indian law.   Thus, this Court  cannot review the awards on merits.\n88. Learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   has   relied  upon the judgment of the Apex Court rendered in  the   case   of  Fuerst   Day   Lawson   Ltd.   Vs.   Jindal  Exports  Ltd., reported  in   [(2001) 6 SCC 356],  wherein   the   Apex   Court   in   paragraphs   31   and   32  has observed thus:­  \"31.   Prior   to   the   enforcement   of   the   Act,  the Law of Arbitration in this country was   substantially contained in three enactments  namely   (1)   The   Arbitration   Act,   1940,   (2)   The   Arbitration   (Protocol   and   Convention)  Act,   1937   and   (3)   The   Foreign   Awards  (Recognition   and   Enforcement)   Act,   1961.   A  party holding a foreign award was required  to   take   recourse   to   these   enactments.  Preamble   of   the   Act   makes   it   abundantly   clear   that   it   aims   at   to   consolidate   and  amend   Indian   laws   relating   to   domestic  arbitration,   international   commercial  arbitration   and   enforcement   of   foreign  arbitral awards. The object of the Act is to   minimize   supervisory   role   of   court   and   to   give speedy justice. In this view, the stage   of approaching court for making award a rule   of   court   as   required   in   Arbitration   Act,  1940 is dispensed with in the present Act.   If   the   argument   of   the   respondent   is  accepted, one of the objects of the Act will   be   frustratedand   defeated.   Under   the   old  Act,   after   making   award   and   prior   to  HC-NIC Page 44 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER execution, there was a procedure for filing   and making an award a rule of court i.e. a   decree.  Since  the object  of  the  act is to  provide   speedy   and   alternative   solution   of  the   dispute,   the   same   procedure   cannot   be   insisted   under   the   new   Act   when   it   is  advisedly   eliminated.   If   separate  proceedings   are   to   be   taken,   one   for  deciding   the   enforceability   of   a   foreign  award   and   the   other   thereafter   for  execution,   it   would   only   contribute   to  protracting the litigation and adding to the  sufferings of a litigant in terms of money,   time and energy. Avoiding such difficulties  is one of the objects of the Act as can be  gathered   from   the   scheme   of   the   Act   and  particularly   looking   to   the   provisions  contained in Sections 46 to 49 in relation   to enforcement of foreign award. In para 40   of   the   Thyssen   judgment   already   extracted  above,   it   is   stated   that   as   a   matter   of   fact, there is not much difference between  the provisions of the 1961 Act and the Act  in   the   matter   of   enforcement   of   foreign   award. The only difference as found is that   while under the Foreign Award Act a decree   follows, under the new Act the foreign award   is already stamped as the decree. Thus, in   our view, a party holding foreign award can   apply   for   enforcement   of   it   but   the   court   before   taking   further   effective   steps   for  the execution of the award has to proceed in   accordance   with   Sections   47   to   49.   In   one   proceeding there may be different stages. In  the first stage the Court may have to decide   about the enforceability of the award having  regard   to   the   requirement   of   the   said  provisions.   Once   the   court   decides   that  foreign award is enforceable, it can proceed  to   take   further   effective   steps   for  execution   of   the   same.   There   arises   no  question of making foreign award as a rule   of   court/decree   again.   If   the   object   and  purpose   can   be   served   in   the   same  proceedings, in our view, there is no need   to   take   two   separate   proceedings   resulting  HC-NIC Page 45 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER in   multiplicity   of   litigation.   It   is   also   clear from objectives contained in para 4 of   the   St   atement   of   Objects   and   Reasons,  Sections 47 to 49 and Scheme of the Act that   every final arbitral award is to be enforced   as   if   it   were   a   decree   of   the   court.   The   submission that the execution petition could  not   be   permitted   to   convert   as   an  application   under   Section   47   is   technical  and is of no consequence in the view we have   taken.   In   our   opinion,   for   enforcement   of   foreign   award   there   is   no   need   to   take  separate   proceedings,   one   for   deciding   the  enforceability of the award to make rule of   the court or decree and the other to take up   execution thereafter. In one proceeding, as  already stated above, the court enforcing a   foreign   award   can   deal   with   the   entire  matter. Even otherwise, this procedure does  not prejudice a party in the light of what  is   stated   in   para   40   of   the   Thyssen  judgment.\n32.   Part   II   of   the   Act   relates   to  enforcement   of   certain   foreign   awards.  Chapter 1 of this Part deals with New York  Convention   Awards.   Section   46   of   the   Act  speaks   as   to   when   a   foreign   award   is   binding.   Section   47   states   as   to   what  evidence   the   party   applying   for   the   enforcement   of   a   foreign   award   should  produce before the court. Section 48 states  as   to   the   conditions   for   enforcement   of  foreign   awards.   As   per   Section   49,   if   the  Court is satisfied that a foreign award is  enforceable   under   this   Chapter,   the   award  shall be deemed to be a decree of that court   and   that   court   has   to   proceed   further   to  execute   the   foreign   award   as   a   decree   of  that   court.   If   the   argument   advanced   on  behalf   of   the   respondent   is   accepted,   the  very purpose of the Act in regard to speedy   and   effective   execution   of   foreign   award  will   be   defeated.   Thus   none   of   the  contentions   urged   on   behalf   of   the  respondent merit acceptance so as to uphold  the impugned judgment and order. We have no  HC-NIC Page 46 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER hesitation or impediment in concluding that   the   impugned   judgment   and   order   cannot   be  sustained.\"\n89. The   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  Renusagar   Power  Co. Ltd. (Supra), has observed thus:­ \n40. We are, therefore, of the opinion that  the enforcement of the Arbitral award is not  barred   by   S.   7(1)(a)(ii)   of   the   Foreign  Awards Act on the ground that Renusagar was  unable   to   present   its   case   before   the  Arbitral Tribunal.\nIII. Objection to the Enforceability of the  Award on the Ground that it is Contrary to  the Public Policy of the State of New York.\n41.  Shri  Venugopal  has  urged  that   although  under sub­clause (b) of clause (2) of Art. V  of  the   New   York   Convention  the   recognition  and enforcement of an arbitral award can be  refused   if   the   competent   authority   in   the  country where recognition and enforcement is  sought   finds   that   the   recognition   or  enforcement  of  the   award   would   be   contrary  to the public policy of that country, i.e.,   the country where the award is sought to be   enforced,   a   departure   has   been   made   in   S.  7(i)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act which  prescribes that the foreign award may not be  enforced   under   the   said   Act   if   the   Court  dealing with the case is satisfied that the   enforcement  of  the   award   would   be   contrary  to   public   policy.   The   submission   of   Shri  Venugopal is that in S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the  Act.   the   Parliament   has   deliberately  refrained   from   using   the   words   \"public  policy   of   India\"   which   implies   that   the  words \"public policy\" are not restricted to  the public policy of India but would cover  the public policy of the country whose law  governs   the   contract   or   of   the   country   of  the place of arbitration and the enforcement  of   an   award   would   be   refused   if   it   is   HC-NIC Page 47 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER contrary   to   such   public   policy.   In   this  context   Shri   Venugopal   has   invited   our  attention   to   the   provisions   of   S.   7(1)   of  the   Arbitration   (Protocol   and   Convention)  Act,   1937   wherein   the   words   used   are   \"and  enforcement thereof must not be contrary to  the   public   policy   or   law   of   india\".  According to Shri Venugopal while under the  1937   Act,   objections   to   enforcement   are  limited to the public policy of India or law  of India, there is no such limitation in S.   7(l)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act. Shri  Venugopal   has   also   placed   reliance   on   the  decision   of   this   Court   in   V/o   Tractoroexport. Moscow v. Tarapore and Co.,  (1970) 3 SCR 53 : (AIR  1971 SC 1) wherein  this   Court   has   held   that   there   was   clear  deviation   from   the   rigid   and   strict   rule  that the courts must stay a suit whenever an  international   commercial   arbitration   as  contemplated   by   the   Protocol   and   the  Conventions, was to take place and that it  was open to the legislature to deviate from   the terms of the Protocol and the Convention  and   that   it   appears   to   have   given   only   a  limited effect to the provisions of the 1958  Convention.  We  find   it   difficult  to  accept  this contention. It cannot be held that by  not using the words \"Public policy of India\" \nand only using the words \"public policy\" in  S.   7(l)(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act,  Parliament   intended   to   'deviate   from   the  provisions   of   the   New   York   Convention  contained   in   Art.   V(2)(b)   which   uses   the  words   \"public   policy   of   that   country\" \nimplying public policy of the country where  recognition and enforcement is sought. That   Parliament   did   not   intend   to   deviate   from  the   terms   of   the   New   York   Convention   is  borne   out   by   the   amendment   which   was  introduced   in   the   Act   by   Act   47   of   1973   after   the   decision   of   this   Court   in   Tractoroexport case (supra) whereby S. 3 was  substituted to bring it in accord with the  provisions   of   the  New   York  Convention.  The  Foreign Awards Act has been enacted to give   HC-NIC Page 48 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER effect   to   the   New   York   Convention   which  seeks   to   remedy   the   defects   in   the   Geneva  Convention of 1927 that hampered the speedy  settlement   of   disputes   rough   arbitration.  The   Foreign   Awards   Act   therefore,   intended  to reduce the time taken in recognition and   enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. The   New   York   Contention   seeks   to   achieve   this  objective by dispensing with the requirement  of the leave enforce the award by the Courts  where the ward is made and thereby avoid the  problem   of   \"double   exequatur\".   It   also  restricts   the   cope   of   enquiry   before   the  Court enforcing he award by eliminating the  requirement   that   he   award   should   not   be  contrary to the principals of the law of the  country   in   which   it   sought   to   be   relied  upon.   Enlarging   the   field   of   enquiry   to  include   public   policy   of   the   Courts   whose  law governs the contract or oil he country  of  place  of  arbitration,   would   run   counter  to the expressed intent of the legislation. \n42.   With   regard   to   the   provisions   of   the   Arbitration   (Protocol   and   Convention)   Act,  937,   it   may  be  stated   that  S.  7(1)   of   the  said   Act,   as   originally   enacted.   read   as   under :\n\"7.   Conditions   For   Enforcement   of   Foreign  Awards.   ­(1)   In   order   that   a   foreign   ward  may   be   enforceable   under   this   Act   it   must  have ­\n(a) been made in pursuance of an agreement   for arbitration which was valid under he law   by which it was governed,\n(b) been made by the tribunal provided for n   the agreement or constituted in manner greed  upon by the parties,\n(c)   been   made   in   conformity   with   the   law  covering with the arbitration procedure.,\n(d) become final the country in which it was   made, HC-NIC Page 49 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER\n(e)   been  in  respect   of   a  matter   which   may  lawfully   be   referred   to   arbitration   under  the law of British India, and   the   enforcement   thereof   must   not   be   contrary to the public policy or the law of  British India.\n(2) A foreign award shall not be enforceable  under this Act if the Court dealing with the   case is satisfied that­\n  (a)   the   award   has   been   annulled   in   the   country in which it was made, or\n(b) the party against whom it is sought to  enforce   the   award   was   not   given   notice   of  the   arbitration   proceedings   in   sufficient  time to enable him to present his case, or  was under some legal incapacity and was not   properly represented or,\n(c)   the   award   does   not   deal   with   all   the  questions referred or contains decisions on  matters   beyond   the   scope   of   the   agreement  for arbitration :\nProvided   that,   if   the   award   does   not   deal  with   all  questions   referred   the   Court   may,  if   it   thinks   fit,   either   postpone   the  enforcement   of   the   award   or   order   its  enforcement   subject   to   the   giving   of   such  security by the person seeking to enforce it  as the Court may think fit.\n(3)   If   a   party   seeking   to   resist   the   enforcement  of  a   foreign   award   proves   that  there   is   any   ground   other   than   the   non­ existence   of   the   conditions   specified   in  clauses (a), (b) and (c) of sub­sec.

(2),  entitling him to contest the validity of the  award,   the   Court   may,   if   it   thinks   fit,  either   refuse   to   enforce   the   award   or  adjourn   the   hearing   until   after   the   expiration of such period as appears to the   Court to be reasonably sufficient to enable  HC-NIC Page 50 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER that   party   to   take   the   necessary   steps   to  have   the   award   annulled   by   the   competent  tribunal.\"\n43.   By   Indian   Independence   (Adaptation   of  Central Acts and Ordinances) Order 1948, the  words   \"British   India\"   were   substituted   by  the words \"the Provinces\", which words were  substituted by the words \"the States\" by the  Adaptation   of   Laws   Order,   1950.   By   Part   B  States   (Laws)   Act,   1951,   the   words   \"the  States\"   were   substituted   by   the   word  \"India\". The aforesaid amendments introduced  from   time   to   time   indicate   that   the   words  \"public policy\" and \"the law of India\" are  independent   of   each   other   and   the   words  \"public   policy\"   are   not   qualified   by   the  words \"of India\" which follow the word \"law\"  because there was no separate public policy  for   each   Province   or   State   in   India.   This  means   that   even   in   the   Protocol   and  Convention   Act  of  1937   the  legislature  had  used the words \"Public Policy\" only and by  the said words it was intended to mean \"the   public   policy   of   India\".   The   New   York  Convention   has   further   curtailed   the   scope  of enquiry by excluding contravention of law  of the Court in which the award is sought to   be   enforced   as   a   ground   for   refusing  recognition   and   enforcement   of   a   foreign   award.   The   words   \"law   of   India\"   have,  therefore, been omitted in S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of  the   Foreign   Awards   Act.   It   cannot,  therefore, be said that by using the words  \"Public Policy\" only S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the.  Foreign Awards Act seeks to make a departure  from   the   provisions   contained   in   the  Protocol and Convention Act of 1937 and, by  using the words \"Public Policy\". without any  qualification,   Parliament   intended   to  broaden the scope of enquiry so as to cover   public policy of other countries, i.e., the  country   whose   law   governs   the   contract   or  the country of the place of arbitration. In  the U.K., the Arbitration Act, 1975 has been  enacted to give effect to the provisions of  HC-NIC Page 51 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the New York Convention. Section 5(3) of the  said Act provides as under :\n\"Enforcement of a Convention award may also  be refused if the award is in respect of a  matter which is not capable of settlement by  arbitration, or if it would be contrary to  public policy to enforce the award.\"\n45. We are, therefore, of the view that the   words \"public policy\" used in S. 7(l)(b)(ii)  of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act   refer   to   the  public   policy   of   India   and  the   recognition  and enforcement of the award of the Arbitral  Tribunal cannot be questioned on the ground  that it is contrary to the public policy of   the State of New York.\n47. The need for applying the touchstone of  public policy has been thus explained by Sir  William Holdsworth ­ \"In fact, a body of law like the common law,   which has grown up gradually with the growth  of   the   nation,   necessarily   acquires   some   fixed principles, and if it is to maintain  these   principles   it   must   be   able,   on   the  ground of public policy or some other like  ground,   to   suppress   practices   which,   under  ever   new   disguises,   seek   to   weaken   or  negative   them\".   (History   of   English   Law,  Vol. III p. 55).\n48. Since the doctrine of public policy is  somewhat open­textured and flexible, judges  in   England   have   shown   certain   degree   of  reluctance   to   invoke   it   in   domestic   law.  There   are   two   conflicting   positions   which  are   referred   as   the   'narrow   view'   and   the  'broad   view'.   According  to  the   narrow   view  Courts   cannot   create   new   heads   of   public  policy   whereas   the   broad   view   countenances  judicial   law   making   in   this   areas.   (See  Chitty on Contracts, 26th Ed. Vol. I, para  1133, pp. 685­686). Similar is the trend of  the decision in India. In Gherulal Parakh v.  Mahadeodas   Maiya,   1959   Suppl   (2)   SCR   392: \n(AIR   1959   SC   781)   this   Court   favoured   the  HC-NIC Page 52 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER narrow view when it said :\n\" ..........though the heads are not closed  and   though   theoretically   it   may   be  permissible   to   evolve   a   new   head   under  exceptional   circumstances   of   a   changing  world, it is admissible in the interest of  stability of society not to make any attempt  to   discover   new   heads   in   these   days\"   (p. \n440) (of SCR) : (at p. 795 of AIR).\n49.   In   later   decisions   this   Court   has,  however, leaned towards the broad view. (See  Murlidhar Agarwal v. State of U.P. (1975) 1  SCR 575 at p. 584 : (AIR 1974 SC 1924 at p.   1930)   :   Central   Inland   Water   Transport  Corporation   v.   Brojo   Nath   Ganguly   (supra)  (1986 (2) SCR 278 at p. 373 : (AIR 1986 SC  1571 at p. 1612); Rattanchand Hira Chand v.  Askar Nawaz Jung (1991)3 SCC 67 at pp. 76­77  : (1991 AIR SCW 496 at pp. 502­03).\n50.   In   the   field   of   private   international  law,   Courts   refuse   to   apply   a   rule   of  foreign law or recognise a foreign judgment  or a foreign arbitral award if it is found  that   the   same   is   contrary   to   the   public  policy of the country in which it is sought   to   be   invoked   or   enforced.   The   English  Courts follow the following principles: \n\"Exceptionally,   the   English   court   will   not  enforce or recognise a right conferred or a  duty imposed by a foreign law where, on the   facts   of   the   particular   case,   enforcement  or, as the case may be, recognition, would  be   contrary   to   a   fundamental   policy   of  English   law.   The   Court   has,   therefore,  refused   in   certain   cases   to   apply   foreign  law where to do so would in the particular  circumstances   be   contrary   to   the   interests  of the united Kingdom or contrary to justice  or   morality\".   (see   Halsbury's   Laws   of  England, IV Ed., vol. 8, para 418).\n57.   In   Deutsche   Schachtbau­und  Tiefbohrgesellschaft   m.b.H.   v.   R.As   al­ Khaimah   National   Oil   Co.   (1987)   2   All   ER  HC-NIC Page 53 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER 769,   decided   by   the   Court   of   Appeal.   Sir  John Donaldson M.R. has said :\n\"Consideration of public policy can never be  exhaustively   defined,   hut   they   should   be  approached with extreme caution. As Burrough  J. remarked in Richardson v. Mellish, (1824)  2 Bing 229 at 252, (1824­34) All ER Rep 258  at 266. It is never argued at all but when  other points fail. It has to be shown that  there is some element of illegality or that   the   enforcement   of   the   award   would   be  clearly   injurious   to   the   public   good   or,  possibly,   that   enforcement   would   be   wholly  offensive   to   the   ordinary   reasonable   and  fully informed member of the public on whose  behalf   the   powers   of   the   State   are  exercised.\n63.In   view   of   the   absence   of   a   workable   definition of \"international public policy\" \nwe   find   it   difficult   to   construe   the  expression   \"public   policy\"   in   Article   V(2)\n(b)   of   the   New   York   Convention   to   mean  international public policy. In our opinion   the   said   expression   must   be   construed   to  mean   the   doctrine   of   public   policy   as  applied by the Courts in which the foreign  award   is   sought   to   be   enforced. \nConsequently, the expression 'public policy'  in Section 7(l)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards  Act means the doctrine of public policy as  applied by the Courts in India. This raises   the question whether the narrower concept of  public policy as applicable in the field of  public   international   law   should   be   applied  or   the   wider   concept   of   public   policy   as  applicable in the field of municipal law.\n65.   This   would   imply   that   the   defence   of  'public policy which is permissible under S.  7(l)(b)(ii) should be construed narrowly. In  this context, it would also be of relevance  to   mention   that   under   Article   I(e)   of   the  Geneva   Convention   Act   of   1927,   it   is  permissible   to   raise   objection   to   the  enforcement of arbitral award on the ground  HC-NIC Page 54 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER that   the  recognition  or  enforcement  of  the  award is contrary to the public policy or to   the principles of the law of the country in   which it is sought to be relied upon. To the   same effect is the provision in S. 7(1) of  the   Protocol   and   Convention   Act   of   1937  which  requires  that   the  enforcement  of  the  foreign   award   must   not   be   contrary   to   the  public policy or the law of India. Since the  expression \"public policy\" covers the field   not   covered   by   the   words   \"and   the   law   of  India\"   which   follow   the   said   expression,   contravention of law alone will not attract  the bar of public policy and something more  than contravention of law is required. \n66.   Article   V(2)(b)   of   the   New   York   Convention of 1958 and Section 7 (l)(b)(ii)  of the Foreign Awards Act do not postulate  refusal of recognition and enforcement of a  foreign   award   on   the   ground   that   it   is  contrary   to   the   law   of   the   country   of  enforcement  and   the   ground  of  challenge   is  confined to the recognition and enforcement   being contrary to the public policy of the  country   in   which   the   award   is   set   to   be   enforced. There is nothing to indicate that  the   expression   \"public   policy\"   in   Article  V(2)(b)   of   the   New   York   Convention   and  Section   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards  Act is not used in the same sense in which  it   was   used   in   Article   1(c)   of   the   Geneva  Convention of 1927 and Section 7(l) of the  Protocol   and   Convention   Act   of   1937.   This  would  mean   that   \"public  policy\"   in   Section  7(l)(b)(ii)   has   been   used   in   a   narrower  sense   and   in   order   to   attract   the   bar   of  public   policy   the  enforcement  of  the   award  must   invoke   something   more   than   the   violation   of   the   law   of   India.   Since   the  Foreign   Awards   Act   is   concerned   with  recognition   and   enforcement   of   foreign  awards which are governed by the principles  of private international law, the expression  \"public   policy\"   in   Section   7(l)(b)(ii)   of  the   Foreign  Awards   Act   must   necessarily   be  HC-NIC Page 55 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER construed   in   the   sense   the   doctrine   of  public   policy   is   applied   in   the   field   of  private international law. Applying the said  criteria   it   must   be   held   that   the  enforcement   of   a   foreign   award   would   be  refused on the ground that it is contrary to  public   policy   if   such   enforcement   would   be  contrary to (i) fundamental policy of Indian  law or (ii) the interests of India or (iii)   justice or morality.\n99.   In   Indian   law   the   principle   of   unjust  enrichment   finds   recognition   in   the   Indian  Contract Act, 1872 (Ss. 70 and 72).\n100. We do not consider it necessary to go  into   the  question  whether   the  principle   of  unjust   enrichment   is   a   part   of   the   public  policy of India since we are of the opinion   that   even   if   it   be   assumed   that   unjust  enrichment   is   contrary   to   public  policy   of  India, Renusagar cannot succeed because the  unjust   enrichment   must   relate   to   the  enforcement   of   the   award   and   not   to   its  merits   in   view   of   the   limited   scope   of  enquiry   in   proceedings   for   the   enforcement  of a foreign award under the Foreign Awards   Act.   The   objections   raised   by   Renusagar  based on unjust enrichment do not relate to  the enforcement of the award because it is  not   the   case   of   Renusagar   that   General  Electric   has   already   received   the   amount   awarded   under   the  arbitration  award  and   is  seeking   to   obtain  enforcement  of  the   award  to obtain further payment and would thus be  unjustly   enriching   itself.   The   objections  about unjust enrichment raised by Renusagar   go to the merits of the award, that is, with   regard   to   the   quantum   awarded   by   the  and   7,   which   is   beyond   the   scope   of   the   objections   that   can   be   raised  u/S.   7(l)(b)\n(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act.   To   hold  otherwise   would   mean   that   in   every   case  where the arbitrators award an amount which  is higher than the amount that should have  been   awarded,   the   award   would   be   open   to  HC-NIC Page 56 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER challenge   on   the   ground   of   unjust  enrichment. Such a course is not permissible  under   the   New   York   Convention   and   the  Foreign   Awards   Act.   We   have,   however,  examined the objections raised by Renusagar   relating to unjust enrichment even on merits  and   we   are   not   satisfied   that   the   amounts  awarded under items Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 7 are  so   excessive   as   to   result   in   unjust  enrichment of General Electric.\"\n90. Similarly, the Apex Court in the case of Shri Lal  Mahal   Ltd.   (supra),   has   considered   the  provisions of Section 48 of the Act in relation  to foreign award and has observed thus:­   \"19.   Having   regard   to   clause   (b)   of   sub­ section (2) of Section 48 of the 1996 Act,  we   shall   immediately   examine   what   is   the  scope of enquiry before the court in which  foreign award, as defined in Section 44, is  sought   to   be   enforced.   This   has   become  necessary as on behalf of the appellant it  was   vehemently   contended   that   in   light   of  the   two   decisions   of   this   Court   in  Saw  Pipes1 and Phulchand Exports2, the Court can  refuse to enforce a foreign award if it is  contrary to the contract between the parties   and/or is patently illegal. It was argued by  Mr.   Rohinton   F.   Nariman,   learned   senior   counsel   for   the   appellant,   that   the  expression   \"public   policy   of   India\"   in  Section 48(2)(b) is an expression of wider   import   than   the   expression   \"public   policy\"  \nin Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards  (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961. The  expansive   construction   given   by   this   Court   to the term \"public policy of India\" in Saw  Pipes1  must   also   apply   to   the   use   of   the   same   term   \"public   policy   of   India\"   in   Section 48(2)(b). \n20. Mr.   Jayant   K.   Mehta,   learned   counsel  HC-NIC Page 57 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER for   the   respondent,   on   the   other   hand,  placed   heavy   reliance   upon  the   decision   of  this Court in  Renusagar3  and submitted that  what   has   been   stated   by   this   Court   while  interpreting   Section   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the  Foreign Awards Act in that case is equally  applicable   to   Section   48(2)(b)   of   the   1996  Act and the expression 1 Oil and Natural Gas  Corporation  \"public   policy   of   India\"   in  Section 48(2)(b) must receive narrow meaning  than Section 34.  Saw Pipes1  never meant to  give   wider   meaning   to   the   expression,  \"public policy of India\" insofar as Section  48 was concerned.   According to Mr. Jayant  K.  Mehta,  Phulchand  Exports2  does   not  hold  that   all   that   is   found   in   paragraph   74   in  Saw   Pipes1  is   applicable   to   Section   48(2)\n(b).   He   argued   that   in   any   case   both  Saw  Pipes1  and  Phulchand Exports2  are decisions  by a two­Judge Bench of this Court whereas  Renusagar3  is   a   decision   of   three­Judge  Bench and if there is any inconsistency in  the   decisions   of   this   Court   in  Saw   Pipes1  and  Phulchand Exports2  on the one hand and  Renusagar3  on   the   other,  Renusagar3  must  prevail as this is a decision by the larger   Bench.\n21. The   three   decisions   of   this   Court   in  Renusagar3,  Saw Pipes  and  Phulchand Exports  need a careful and close examination by us.   We shall first deal with Renusagar.\n22. It   is   not   necessary   to   narrate   in  detail the facts in Renusagar3 . Suffice it  to   say   that   Arbitral   Tribunal,   GAFTA   in  Paris passed an award in favour of General  Electric   Company   (GEC)   against   Renusagar.  GEC   sought   to   enforce   the   award   passed   in  its favour by filing an arbitration petition  under Section 5 of the Foreign Awards Act in  the   Bombay   High   Court.   Renusagar   contested  the proceedings for enforcement of the award  filed   by   GEC   in   the   Bombay   High   Court   on  diverse   grounds.   Inter   alia,   one   of   the  objections raised by Renusagar was that the  HC-NIC Page 58 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER enforcement of the award was contrary to the  public policy of India. The Single Judge of  the   Bombay   High  Court   overruled   the  objections   of   Renusagar.   It   was   held   that  the award was enforceable and on that basis   a   decree   in   terms   of   the   award   was   drawn.  Renusagar   filed   an   intra­court   appeal   but  that   was  dismissed   as   not   maintainable.   It  was   from   these   orders   that   the   matter  reached   this   Court.   On   behalf   of   the  parties,   multifold   arguments   were   made.   A  three­Judge   Bench   of   this   Court   noticed  diverse   provisions,   including   Section   7(1)\n(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act   which  provided   that   a   foreign   award   may   not   be  enforced if the court dealing with the case   was   satisfied   that   the   enforcement   of   the  award would be contrary to public policy. \n23. Of   the   many   questions   framed   for   determination,   the   two   questions   under  consideration were; one, \"Does Section 7(1)\n(b)(ii) of the  Foreign Awards Act preclude   enforcement   of   the   award   of   the   Arbitral  Tribunal, GAFTA for the reason that the said  award   is   contrary   to   the   public   policy   of  the State of New York?\" and the other \"what  is meant by public policy in Section 7(1)(b)\n(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act?\". This Court  held that the words \"public policy\" used in   Section   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards  Act   meant   public   policy   of   India.   The  argument   that   the   recognition   and  enforcement   of   the   award   of   the   Arbitral  Tribunal,   GAFTA   can   be   questioned   on   the  ground   that   it   is   contrary   to   the   public  policy of the State of New York was negated.  A   clear   and   fine   distinction   was   drawn   by  this Court while applying the rule of public  policy between a matter governed by domestic  laws   and   a   matter   involving   conflict   of  laws. It has been held in unambiguous terms   that   the   application   of   the   doctrine   of  \"public  policy\"in  the   field  of  conflict  of  laws   is   more   limited   than   that   in   the  domestic   law   and   the   courts   are   slower   to  HC-NIC Page 59 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER invoke   public   policy   in   cases   involving   a  foreign   element   than   when  purely   municipal  legal issues are involved. \n24. Explaining   the   concept   of   \"public  policy\" vis­a­vis the enforcement of foreign  awards in Renusagar , this Court in paras 65  and 66 (pgs. 681­ 682) of the Report stated: \n65.   This   would   imply   that   the   defence   of  public   policy   which   is   permissible   under  Section   7(1)(b)(ii)   should   be   construed  narrowly. In this context, it would also be  of  relevance   to   mention  that   under   Article  I(e) of the Geneva Convention Act of 1927,  it is permissible to raise objection to the   enforcement of arbitral award on the ground  that   the  recognition  or  enforcement  of  the  award is contrary to the public policy or to   the principles of the law of the country in   which it is sought to be relied upon. To the   same effect is the provision in Section 7(1)  of   the   Protocol   &   Convention   Act   of   1937  which  requires  that   the  enforcement  of  the  foreign   award   must   not   be   contrary   to   the  public policy or the law of India. Since the  expression \"public policy\" covers the field  not   covered   by   the   words   \"and   the   law   of   India\"   which   follow   the   said   expression,   contravention of law alone will not attract  the bar of public policy and something more  than contravention of law is required.\n66.  . . . . . . . . This would mean that   \"public policy\" in Section 7(1)( b )( i i )  has   been   used   in   a   narrower   sense   and   in  order   to   attract   the   bar   of   public   policy  the   enforcement   of   the   award     must   invoke  something more than the violation of the law  of   India.   Since   the   Foreign   Awards   Act   is  concerned   with   recognition   and   enforcement  of foreign awards which are governed by the   principles of private international law, the  expression   \"public   policy\"   in   Section   7(1)\n(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act   must  necessarily   be  construed   in   the   sense   the  HC-NIC Page 60 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER doctrine of public policy is applied in the   field of private international law. Applying  the said criteria it must be held that the  enforcement   of   a   foreign   award   would   be  refused on the ground that it is contrary to  public   policy   if   such   enforcement   would   be  contrary   to   (  i  )   fundamenta   lpolicy   of  Indian   law;   or   (  i   i  )   the   interests   of  India; or ( ii i ) justice or morality.\n25. In  Saw   Pipes1,   the   ambit   and   scope   of  the court's jurisdiction under Section 34 of   the   1996   Act   was   under   consideration.   The  issue   was   whether   the   court   would   have  jurisdiction   under   Section   34   to   set   aside  an   award   passed   by   the   Arbitral   Tribunal,  GAFTA   which   was   patently   illegal   or   in  contravention of the provisions of the 1996  Act   or   any   other   substantive   law   governing  the parties or was against the terms of the   contract. This Court considered the meaning   that could be assigned to the phrase \"public   policy of India\" occurring in Section 34(2)\n(b)(ii). Alive to the subtle distinction in  the   concept   of   'enforcement   of   the   award'   and   'jurisdiction   of   the   court   in   setting  aside   the   award'   and   the   decision   of   this  Court in  Renusagar3, this Court held in  Saw  Pipes1  that   the   term   \"public   policy   of  India\"   in   Section   34   was   required   to   be  interpreted   in   the   context   of   the   jurisdiction of the court where the validity  of the award is challenged before it becomes  final and executable in contradistinction to  the enforcement of an award after it becomes  final. Having that distinction in view, with  regard   to   Section   34   this   Court   said   that   the expression \"public policy of India\" was  required   to   be   given   a   wider   meaning.  Accordingly, for the purposes of Section 34,  this   Court   added   a   new   category   -   patent  illegality   -   for   setting   aside   the   award.  While adding this category for setting aside  the   award   on   the   ground   of   patent  illegality,   the   Court  clarified   that  illegality must go to the root of the matter  HC-NIC Page 61 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER and if the illegality is of trivial nature  it   cannot   be   held   that   award   is   against  public policy. Award could also be set aside  if it was so unfair and unreasonable that it  shocks the conscience of the court.\n26. From the discussion made by this Court  in Saw Pipes in paragraph 18 of the Report,  it   can   be   safely   observed   that   while  accepting   the   narrow   meaning   given   to   the  expression \"public policy\" in  Renusagar3  in  the matters of enforcement of foreign award,  there   was   departure   from   the   said   meaning  for the purposes of the jurisdiction of the   Court   in   setting   aside   the   award   under  Section 34.\n27. In   our   view,   what   has   been   stated   by  this  Court   in  Renusagar3  with  reference  to  Section   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards  Act   must   equally   apply   to   the   ambit   and  scope of Section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 Act.  In  Renusagar3  it   has   been   expressly  exposited   that   the   expression   \"public  policy\"   in   Section   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act   refers   to   the   public  policy   of   India.   The   expression   \"public  policy\" used in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) was held  to   mean   \"public   policy   of   India\".   A   distinction   in   the   rule   of   public   policy  between   a   matter   governed   by   the   domestic  law and a matter involving conflict of laws   has been noticed in Renusagar. For all this  there is no reason why Renusagar  should not  apply as regards the scope of inquiry under   Section   48(2)(b).   Following  Renusagar,   we  think that for the purposes of Section 48(2)\n(b), the expression \"public policy of India\"  \nmust   be   given   narrow   meaning   and   the  enforcement   of   foreign   award   would   be  refused on the ground that it is contrary to  public policy of India if it is covered by  one   of   the   three   categories   enumerated   in  Renusagar3.   Although   the   same   expression  'public   policy   of   India'   is   used   both   in  Section 34(2(b)(ii) and Section 48(2)(b) and  HC-NIC Page 62 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the concept of 'public policy in India' is  same in nature in both the Sections but, in   our view, its application differs in degree  insofar as these two Sections are concerned.  The application of 'public policy of India'  doctrine  for   the   purposes   of   Section   48(2)\n(b) is more limited than the application of  the   same   expression   in   respect   of   the  domestic arbitral award.\n  28. We   are   not   persuaded   to   accept   the  submission   of   Mr.  Rohinton  F.  Nariman   that  the  expression  \"public  policy  of  India\"   in  Section   48(2)(b)   is   an   expression   of   wider  import  than  the  \"public  policy\"  in  Section  7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the   Foreign   Awards   Act.   We  have   no   hesitation   in   holding   that  Renusagar3  must   apply   for   the   purposes   of  Section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 Act. Insofar as  the   proceeding   for   setting   aside   an   award  under   Section   34   is   concerned,   the  principles   laid   down   in  Saw   Pipes1  would  govern the scope of such proceedings.\n29. We accordingly hold that enforcement of  foreign award would be refused under Section  48(2)(b)  only   if   such   enforcement   would   be  contrary to (I) fundamental policy of Indian  law; or (2) the interests of India; or (3)  justice or morality. The wider meaning given  to  the  expression  \"public  policy  of  India\" \noccurring   in   Section   34(2)(b)(ii)   in  Saw  Pipes1  is not applicable where objection is  raised   to   the   enforcement   of   the   foreign  award under Section 48(2)(b).\n30. It is true that in Phulchand Exports, a  two­Judge   Bench   of   this   Court   speaking  through one of us (R.M. Lodha, J.) accepted   the   submission   made   on   behalf   of   the  appellant therein that the meaning given to  the  expression  \"public  policy  of  India\"   in  Section 34 in Saw Pipes1 must be applied to  the   same   expression   occurring   in   Section   48(2)(b) of the 1996 Act. However, in what  we have discussed above it must be held that  HC-NIC Page 63 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the statement in paragraph 16 of the Report   that the expression \"public policy of India  used in Section 48(2)(b) has to be given a  wider   meaning   and   the   award   could   be   set  aside, if it is patently illegal\" does not  lay down correct law and is overruled.\n34.   Mr.   Rohinton   F.   Nariman   vehemently  contended that once parties had agreed that  certification by an inspecting agency would   be   final,   it   was   not   open   to   the   Arbitral  Tribunal, GAFTA as well as Board of Appeal,  to go behind that certificate and disregard  it   even   if   the   certificate   was   inaccurate  (which   was   not   the   case).   In   this   regard,   reliance was placed on two judgments of the  English   courts,   namely,  Agroexport  and  Alfred   C.   Toepfer.  He   submitted   that   House  of Lords in  Gill & Duffus  has affirmed the  decision in Alfred C. Toepfer. It was, thus,  submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal, GAFTA   and   the   Board   of   Appeal   having   disregarded  the   finality   of   the   certificate   issued   by  S.G.S.   India,   the   awards   were   plainly   contrary   to   contract   and,   therefore,   not   enforceable   in   India.   It   was   submitted   on  behalf of the appellant that it was not an  issue   in   dispute   and   not   the   buyers'   case  before   the   Arbitral   Tribunal,   GAFTA   and/or   the   Board   of   Appeal   that   the   procedure  adopted by SGS India was not in conformity  with   the   contract.   It   was,   therefore,   not  open   to   the   Board   of   Appeal   to   render   a   finding which went beyond the scope of the  buyers' very case.Accordingly, it was argued  that   the   Board   of   Appeal   dealt   with   the   questions not referred to it and which were  never   in   dispute   and,   therefore,   award  cannot be enforced because it is contrary to  Section 48(1)(c) of the 1996 Act as well.\n42.   The   challenge   to   the   enforceability   of  the   foreign   awards   passed   by   the   Board   of   Appeal is mainly laid by the sellers on the   ground   that   the   Board   of   Appeal   has   gone  beyond the terms of the contract by ignoring   the   certificate   of   quality   obtained   at   the  HC-NIC Page 64 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER load   port   from   the   buyers'   nominated  certifying agency, i.e., SGS India which was   final   under   the   contract.   The   Board   of  Appeal,   while   dealing   with   the   question  whether the SGS India certificate was issued   by the contractual party and in contractual  form, noticed the clause in the contract in  respect of quality and condition and it held   that SGS India was an acceptable certifying  party   under   the   contract.   As   regards   the  other   part   of   that   clause   that   provided,  \"certificate   and   quality   showed   in   the  certificate will be the result of an average   samples taken jointly at port of loading by  the   representatives   of   the   sellers   and   the  buyers\",   the   Board   of   Appeal   recorded   its  finding as follows:\n\"The   SGS   India   certificate   shows   that   an  inspection   took   place   at   the   suppliers   godowns   inland,   and   representative   samples  taken. Sealed samples were inspected lotwise   and   the   cargo   meeting   the   contractual  specifications was allowed to be bagged for  dispatch   to   Kandla.   Continuous   supervision  of loading into the vessel was also carried   out   at   the   port.   The   samples   drawn  periodically   were   reduced   and   composite  samples   were   sealed;   one   sealed   sample   of  each   lot   was   handed   over   to   the   supplier,   one sealed sample of each lot was analysed   by   SGS   and   the   remaining   samples   were  retained by SGS for a period of three months  unless   and   until   instructions   to   the  contrary were given.\nThe   analysis   section   of   the   certificate  states   that   \"The   above   samples   have   been  analysed   and   the   weighted   average   Pre­ shipment and Shipment results are as under:\nWe   find   that   this   procedure   was   not   in  conformity   with   the   requirements   of   the  Contract, which required the result to be of   an average sample taken at port of loading,   not the weighted average of pre­shipment and   shipment   samples.   Accordingly   the  HC-NIC Page 65 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER certificate is uncontractual and its results   are not final. In consequence the Board is   obliged   to   evaluate   all   the   evidence  presented,   including   the   evidence   of   the  uncontractual   SGS   India   certificate   to  decide whether or not the goods were of the   contractual   description,   i.e.   Durum   wheat  Indian origin.\"\n43. Thus,   having   held   that   SGS   India   was  the contractual agency, the Board of Appeal  further   held   that   the   sellers   failed   to  establish that the SGS India certificate was   in   contractual   form.   Two   fundamental   flaws  in the certification by SGS India were noted   by   the   Board   of   Appeal,   one,   SGS   India's  certification did not follow the contractual   specified   mode   of   sampling   and   the   other,  the analysis done by SGS India was doubtful.   The   Board   of   Appeal   then   sifted   the  documentary   evidence   let   in   by   the   parties  and   finally   concluded   that   wheat   loaded   on  the   vessel   Haci   Resit   Kalkavan   was   soft  wheat and the sellers were in breach of the   description condition of the contract.\n44.   It   is   pertinent   to   state   that   the  sellers had challenged the award (no. 3782)  passed   by   the   Board   of   Appeal   in   the   High  Court   of   Justice   at   London.   The   three  decisions; (i)  Agroexport5  by Queen's Bench  Division, (ii)  Toepfer6  by Court of Appeal,  and (iii) Gill & Duffus7 by House of Lords,  were   holding   the   field   at   the   time   of  consideration of sellers' appeal by the High  Court of Justice at London. In  Agroexport  ,  it   has   been   held   that   an   award   founded   on  evidence   of   analysis   made   other   than   in  accordance with contract terms  cannot stand  and   deserves   to   be   set   aside   as   evidence  relied   upon   was   inadmissible.   The   Court   of  Appeal in  Toepfer  has laid down that where   seller   and   buyer   have   agreed   that   a  certificate at loading as to the quality of  goods   shall   be   final   and   binding   on   them,   the buyer will be precluded from recovering  HC-NIC Page 66 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER damages from the seller, even if, the person   giving the certificate has been negligent in   making it.  Toepfer  has been approved by the  House of Lords in  Gill & Duffus7. The High  Court of Justice at London can be assumed to  have   full   knowledge   of   the   legal   position  exposited in Agroexport5 , Toepfer6 and Gill  &   Duffus7  yet   it   found   no   ground   or  justification   for   setting   aside   the   award   (no. 3782) passed by the Board of Appeal. If  a ground supported by the decisions of that   country   was   not   good   enough   for   setting  aside the award by the court competent to do  so, a fortiori, such ground can hardly be a   good ground for refusing enforcement of the  award. Accordingly, we are not persuaded to  accept   the   submission   of   Mr.   Rohinton   F.  Nariman that Delhi High Court ought to have   refused to enforce the foreign awards as the   Board   of   Appeal   has   wrongly   rejected   the  certificate   of   quality   obtained   from   the  buyers'   nominated   certifying   agency   and  taken   into   consideration   inadmissible  evidence   in   the   nature   of   certificates   obtained by the buyers' for the purposes of  forwarding contract.\n43. Moreover,   Section   48   of   the   1996   Act  does   not   give   an   opportunity   to   have   a  'second   look'   at   the   foreign   award   in   the  award   ­   enforcement   stage.   The   scope   of  inquiry   under   Section   48   does   not   permit  review   of   the   foreign   award   on   merits.  Procedural   defects   (like   taking   into  consideration   inadmissible   evidence   or  ignoring/rejecting the evidence which may be   of binding nature) in the course of foreign   arbitration   do   not   lead   necessarily   to   excuse   an   award   from   enforcement   on   the  ground of public policy.\n47. While considering the enforceability of  foreign awards, the court does not exercise  appellate   jurisdiction   over   the   foreign  award   nor   does   it   enquire   as   to   whether,  while   rendering   foreign   award,   some   error   HC-NIC Page 67 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER has   been   committed.   Under   Section   48(2)(b)  the   enforcement   of   a   foreign   award   can   be   refused only if such enforcement is found to   be   contrary   to   (1)   fundamental   policy   of  Indian law; or (2) the interests of India;   or   (3)   justice   or   morality.   The   objections  raised by the appellant do not fall in any  of   these   categories   and,   therefore,   the  foreign awards cannot be held to be contrary   to   public   policy   of   India   as   contemplated  under Section 48(2)(b).\n48.   The   contention   of   the   learned   senior  counsel for the appellant that the Board of  Appeal dealt with the questions not referred   to it and which were never in dispute and,  therefore,   these   awards   cannot   be   enforced  being contrary to Section 48(1)(c) is devoid   of   any   substance   and   is   noted   to   be  rejected.\"\n91. On the aforesaid aspects, learned counsel for the  petitioner   has   also   relied   upon   the   following  judgments of the Bombay High Court and Calcutta  High Court :­  \n(i)  Jaldhi   Overseas   Pvt.   FZC   V.   Vinergy  International Private Ltd. [2016 SCC Online  Cal 2299].\n(ii) Noble Resources Ltd. V. Twenty First Century  Wire Roads Ltd.

Shriram   EPC   Ltd.   &  Ors. [MANU/TN/0458/2017] HC-NIC Page 68 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER\n92. Learned   counsel   for   the   respondents   has   also  relied   upon   the   judgment   passed   in   the   case   of  Hadley   Vs.   Baxendale   [156   Eng.   Rep.   145],  and  contended that as there was back to back contract  which was known to the parties, loss of profits  cannot be awarded as awarded by learned Tribunal.  Firstly,   the   said   aspect   touches   the   merits   of  the awards directly and therefore, it is beyond  the scope of inquiry that this Court is entitled  to make under Section 48 of the Act and secondly,  even   if   the   awards   in   question   are   considered,  there is finding of the fact that there was no  back to back contract and therefore, with respect  to   the   said   judgments,   the   same   will   have   no  application   to   the   facts   of   the   case   on   hand.  Learned   counsel   for   the   respondents   has   relied  upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case  of Union of India & Ors. Vs. Sugauli Sugar Works  (P) Ltd. [(1976) 93 SCC 32], and contended that,  in case of breach of contract, as far as possible  the   injured   party   should   be   placed   in   as   good  situation as if the contract had been performed  and while awarding damages by breach of contract,  the rule as to market price is intended to secure  only   an   indemnity   to   the   purchaser.   Even   this  aspect   would   touch   the   merits   of   the   awards   in  question   and   the   facts   of   that   case   were  different   and   distinct,   whereas   in   the   case   on  hand, the awards being governed by the provisions  of   UK   Sale   of   Goods   Act   with   respect   the  HC-NIC Page 69 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER aforesaid judgment would not be applicable to the  present case. \n93. Similarly,   learned   counsel   for   the   respondents  has also relied upon the judgment rendered in the  case   of  Messrs.   Trojan   &   Company   Vs.   RM.  N.N.Nagappa   Chettiar   [AIR   1953   SC   235]  and has  contended   that   in   case   of   breach   of   contract,  measure of damages cannot be the amount of loss  ultimately  sustained  by  the  represented.  In  the  case on hand, as stated hereinabove, the parties  had agreed for applicability of English law and  the   issues   of   quantum   of   damages   that   were  awarded   by   learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   would   not  only   touch   the   merits   of   the   awards,   but   the  awards   are   passed   as   per   the   law   applicable   in  England   and   therefore,   the   aforesaid   judgment  also would not render any assistance to the case  of the respondents. \n94. Learned   counsel   for   the   respondents   has   also  relied   upon   the   judgment   of   Apex   Court   in   the  case of  Murlidhar  Chiranjilal  Vs.  Harishchandra  Dwarkadas   &   Anr.  [AIR   1962   SC   366]  and   has  contended that there is breach of Sections 73 and  74   of   the   Indian   Contract   Act,   as   already   held  above,   the   case   on   hand   is   for   enforcement   of  foreign award and even if, there is any alleged  breach of Indian Law, the same would not amount  to contravention of fundamental policy of Indian  Law and hence, the said judgment would also not  HC-NIC Page 70 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER apply to the facts of the present case. \n95. The   respondents   have   also   relied   upon   the  judgment   of   the   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  Associate   Builders   (supra),   wherein   the   Apex  Court while considering the aspect of fundamental  policy of Indian Law, interest of India, justice  and   morality   and   patently   illegal   i.e  contravention   of   substantial   law   of   India   and  contravention   of   arbitration   and   Conciliation  Act,   1996   and   contravention   of   terms   of   the  contract, has observed thus:­ \n27. Coming   to   each   of   the   heads   contained   in   the   Saw   Pipes   judgment,   we   will   first  deal   with   the   head   \"fundamental   policy   of  Indian Law\".  It has already been seen from   the Renusagar judgment that violation of the  Foreign Exchange Act and disregarding orders  of   superior   courts   in   India   would   be  regarded   as   being   contrary   to   the  fundamental policy of Indian law. To this it  could   be   added   that   the   binding   effect   of  the   judgment   of   a   superior   court   being  disregarded   would   be   equally   violative   of  the fundamental policy of Indian law.\n28. In   a   recent   judgment,  ONGC   Ltd.   v.  Western   Geco   International   Ltd.,   2014   (9)  SCC   263,   this   Court   added   three   other  distinct and fundamental juristic principles  which   must   be   understood   as   a   part   and   parcel   of   the   fundamental   policy   of   Indian  law. The Court held­ \"35.  What   then   would   constitute   the  \"fundamental policy of Indian law\" is the  question. The decision in ONGC [ONGC Ltd.  v. Saw Pipes Ltd., (2003) 5 SCC 705] does   not   elaborate   that   aspect.   Even   so,   the  expression must, in our opinion, include  all   such   fundamental   principles   as  HC-NIC Page 71 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER providing   a   basis   for   administration   of  justice   and   enforcement   of   law   in   this  country.   Without   meaning   to   exhaustively  enumerate   the   purport   of   the   expression  \"fundamental   policy   of   Indian   law\",   we  may   refer   to   three   distinct   and   fundamental juristic principles that must  necessarily   be   understood   as   a   part   and  parcel   of   the   fundamental   policy   of  Indian law. The first and foremost is the   principle   that   in   every   determination  whether   by   a   court   or   other   authority  that   affects  the   rights   of   a  citizen  or  leads   to   any   civil   consequences,   the  court or authority concerned is bound to  adopt what is in legal parlance called a  \"judicial   approach\"   in   the   matter.   The  duty to adopt a judicial approach arises  from   the   very   nature   of   the   power  exercised   by   the   court   or   the   authority  does   not   have   to   be   separately   or  additionally   enjoined   upon   the   fora  concerned.   What   must   be   remembered   is  that   the   importance   of   a   judicial  approach   in   judicial   and   quasi­judicial  determination   lies   in   the   fact   that   so  long   as   the   court,   tribunal   or   the   authority   exercising   powers   that   affect  the rights or obligations of the parties  before   them   shows   fidelity   to   judicial  approach,   they   cannot   act   in   an  arbitrary,   capricious   or   whimsical  manner.   Judicial   approach   ensures   that  the   authority   acts   bona   fide   and   deals  with   the   subject   in   a   fair,   reasonable  and   objective   manner   and   that   its  decision   is   not   actuated   by   any  extraneous   consideration.   Judicial  approach   in   that   sense   acts   as   a   check  against flaws and faults that can render  the   decision   of   a   court,   tribunal   or  authority vulnerable to challenge. \n38.  Equally   important   and   indeed  fundamental   to   the   policy   of   Indian   law  is the principle that a court and so also   HC-NIC Page 72 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER a   quasijudicial   authority   must,   while  determining the rights and obligations of  parties   before   it,   do   so   in   accordance  with   the   principles   of   natural   justice.  Besides   the   celebrated   audi   alteram  partem   rule   one   of   the   facets   of   the  principles of natural justice is that the  court/authority   deciding   the   matter   must  apply its mind to the attendant facts and  circumstances while taking a view one way  or the other. Non­application of mind is  a   defect   that   is   fatal   to   any  adjudication. Application of mind is best  demonstrated   by   disclosure   of   the   mind  and   disclosure   of   mind   is   best   done   by  recording   reasons   in   support   of   the  decision which the court or authority is  taking.   The   requirement   that   an  adjudicatory   authority   must   apply   its  mind is, in that view, so deeply embedded  in   our   jurisprudence   that   it   can   be  described   as   a   fundamental   policy   of   Indian law.\n39. No less important is the principle  now   recognised   as   a   salutary   juristic  fundamental in administrative law that a  decision   which   is   perverse   or   so   irrational   that   no   reasonable   person  would   have   arrived   at   the   same   will   not  be   sustained   in   a   court   of   law. \nPerversity   or   irrationality   of   decisions  is tested on the touchstone of Wednesbury  principle   [Associated   Provincial   Picture  Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corpn., (1948)  1   KB   223:   (1947)   2   All   ER   680   (CA)]   of  reasonableness. Decisions that fall short  of   the   standards   of   reasonableness   are   open to challenge in a court of law often   in   writ   jurisdiction   of   the   superior  courts but no less in statutory processes  wherever the same are available.\n40. It is neither necessary nor proper  for   us   to   attempt   an   exhaustive  enumeration of what would constitute the  fundamental   policy   of   Indian   law   nor   is   HC-NIC Page 73 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER it   possible   to   place   the   expression   in  the straitjacket of a definition. What is   important in the context of the case at  hand   is   that   if   on   facts   proved   before  them   the   arbitrators   fail   to   draw   an  inference which ought to have been drawn  or if they have drawn an inference which  is on the face of it, untenable resulting   in   miscarriage   of   justice,   the  adjudication   even   when   made   by   an   Arbitral   Tribunal   that   enjoys  considerable   latitude   and   play   at   the  joints in making awards will be open to  challenge   and   may   be   cast   away   or  modified   depending   upon   whether   the  offending   part   is   or   is   not   severable   from the rest.\"\n29. It is clear that the juristic principle  of   a   \"judicial   approach\"   demands   that   a  decision be fair, reasonable and objective.  On the obverse side, anything arbitrary and  whimsical   would   obviously   not   be   a  determination   which   would   either   be   fair,  reasonable or objective.\nInterest of India\n35. The next ground on which an award may   be set aside is that it is contrary to the  interest of India. Obviously, this concerns  itself with India as a member of the world  community   in   its   relations   with   foreign   powers. As at present advised, we need not  dilate   on   this   aspect   as   this   ground   may  need to evolve on a case by case basis.\nJustice\n36. The   third   ground   of   public   policy   is,  if an award is against justice or morality.  These are two different concepts in law. An  award   can   be   said     to   be   against   justice  only   when   it   shocks   the   conscience   of   the  court. An illustration of this can be given.  A claimant  is content with restricting his  claim,   let   us   say   to   Rs.   30   lakhs   in   a  statement of claim before the arbitrator and  HC-NIC Page 74 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER at no point does he seek to claim anything  more.   The   arbitral   award   ultimately   awards   him 45 lakhs without any acceptable reason  or   justification.   Obviously,   this   would  shock   the   conscience   of   the   court   and   the  arbitral   award   would   be   liable   to   be   set  aside on the ground that it is contrary to  \"justice\".\nMorality\n37. The other ground is of \"morality\". Just  as   the   expression   \"public   policy\"   also  occurs in Section 23 of the Indian Contract  Act, so does the expression \"morality\". Two  illustrations   to   the   said   section   are  interesting for they explain to us the scope  of the expression \"morality\".\n\"(j)   A,   who   is   B's   Mukhtar,   promises   to  exercise his influence, as such, with B in  favour   of   C,   and   C   promises   to   pay   1,000  rupees to A. The agreement is void, because  it   is   immoral.   (k)   A   agrees   to   let   her   daughter to hire to B for concubinage. The  agreement   is   void,   because   it   is   immoral,   though   the   letting   may   not   be   punishable  under the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860).\" \n39.   This   Court   has   confined   morality   to  sexual morality so far as section 23 of the   Contract   Act   is   concerned,   which   in   the  context of an arbitral award would mean the  enforcement   of   an   award   say   for   specific   performance   of   a   contract   involving  prostitution. \"Morality\" would, if it is to  go beyond sexual morality necessarily cover  such agreements as are not illegal but would  not be enforced given the prevailing mores  of   the   day.   However,   interference   on   this   ground   would   also   be   only   if   something   shocks the court's conscience.\"\n96. At the outset, it deserves to be noted that in  the case of Associates Builders (supra), the case  before the Apex Court was of domestic award and  the Apex Court has examined the aspect of award,  which was contrary to the fundamental policy of  HC-NIC Page 75 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER Indian Law or contrary to the Interest of India,  contrary to Justice or Morality or was Patently  Illegal as provided under Section 34 of the Act,  wherein the scope is wider than Section 48 of the  Act. It is not the case of the respondents that,  the  impugned  awards  are  passed  disregarding   the  order   of   Superior   Court   in   India.   As   per   the  facts revealed in the instant case, the parties  had agreed to the applicability of English law.  All   the   parties   were   heard   before   the   Arbitral  Tribunal   as   well   as   the   appellate   Board   and   in  fact,  the  respondents  carried  the  order  further  before   the   Superior   Courts   in   England   and   have  failed.   It   is   also   not   the   case   of   the  respondents that principle of audi alteram partem  has   been   breached.   As   held   hereinabove,   in  inquiry   under   Section   48   of   the   Act   read   with  Explanations 1 and 2 to Section 48 of the Act,  the respondents have failed to establish that the  awards are in  contravention with the fundamental  policy of the Indian Law or that the same is in  conflict   with   basic   notion   of   morality   or  justice.   Explanation   2   of   Section   48   plays   a  vital role and is an important aspect which has  to be borne in mind by this Court while examining  the foreign awards at the stage of enforcement.  Thus, all the parties were heard at every stage,  more particularly the respondents cannot make any  grievance   that   any   ex   parte   award   is   passed   at  any stage and therefore, considering Explanation  2 to Section 48(2) of the Act, this Court cannot  HC-NIC Page 76 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER entail any inquiry into the review on the merits  of   the   dispute   and   as   stated   earlier,   the   Apex  Court in the case of Associates Builders (supra)  has examined the domestic awards. \n97. In   light   of   the   aforesaid   provisions   of   law  applicable i.e. UK Sale of Goods Act, even if the  principle as held by the Apex Court in the case  of  Associates  Builder  (supra),  are applied, the  grounds   raised   by   the   respondents   do   not  constitute   even   remotely   that   there   is   any  contravention to the fundamental policy of India  or there is basic notion of morality or justice. \n98. Hypothetical   example   which   was   relied   upon   by  learned counsel for the respondents may be good  when Indian Law is to be applied and therefore,  in the instant case, it cannot be said that the  impugned   awards   are   against   public   policy   of  India or that they are against the principles of  morality and justice. \n99. In the facts of this case, it cannot be said that  the   awards   are   such   that   it   would   shock   the  conscience of the Court and the parties are bound  by the agreement and the aspect whether it shocks  conscience of the Court depends on the facts of  each   case   and   when   the   parties   had   agreed   for  applicability   of   English   Law   and   Arbitration  under the GAFTA Rules at London, the contention  that   the   award   is   punitive   award   cannot   now   be  considered   under   Section   48   of   the   Act.   The  HC-NIC Page 77 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER parties   were   aware   about   the   provisions   of  Section 51(1) and 51(3) of UK sale of Goods act  which   has   been   considered   by   learned   Arbitral  Tribunal.\n100. Learned counsel for the respondent has also  relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the  case   of  Oil   &   natural   Gas   Corporation   Ltd.,  [(2003)   5   SCC   705],  wherein the Apex Court has  observed thus:­  \"12. Hence, the jurisdiction or the power of  the   Arbitral   Tribunal   is   prescribed   under  the Act and if the award is dehors the said  provisions, it would be, on the face of it,   illegal. The decision of the Tribunal  must  be   within   the   bounds   of   its   jurisdiction   conferred under the Act or the contract. In  exercising   jurisdiction,   the   Arbitral  Tribunal   cannot   act   in   breach   of   some  provision   of   substantive   law   or   the   provisions of the Act.\n13. The question, therefore, which requires  consideration is whether the award could be  set aside, if the Arbitral Tribunal has not  followed the mandatory procedure prescribed  under S. 24, 28 or 31(3), which affects the   rights of the parties? Under sub­section (1)\n(a)   of   S.   28   there   is   a   mandate   to   the  Arbitral Tribunal to decide the dispute in  accordance with the substantive law for the  time   being   in   force   in   India.   Admittedly,  substantive   law   would   include   the   Indian  Contract Act,  the Transfer of Property Act  and   other   such   laws   in   force.   Suppose,   if  the   award   is   passed   in   violation   of   the   provisions of  the Transfer of Property Act  or in violation of the Indian Contract Act,  the question would be ­ whether such award  could   be   set   aside?   Similarly,   under   sub­ section   (3),   Arbitral   Tribunal   is   directed   HC-NIC Page 78 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER to decide the dispute in accordance with the  terms of the contract and also after taking  into   account   the   usage   of   the   trade  applicable   to   the   transaction.   If   Arbitral   Tribunal ignores  the terms of the contract  or   usage   of   the   trade   applicable   to   the   transaction, whether the said award could be  interfered? Similarly, if the award is non­ speaking   one   and   is   in   violation   of   S.  31(3), can such award be set aside? In our  view,   reading   S.   34   conjointly   with   other  provisions of the Act, it appears that the  legislative intent could not be that if the  award is in contravention of the provisions  of   the   Act,   still   however,   it   couldn't   be  set aside by the Court. If it is held that  such award could not be interfered, it would  be contrary to basic concept of justice. If  the Arbitral Tribunal has  not followed the  mandatory   procedure   prescribed   under   the  Act, it would mean that it has acted beyond   its jurisdiction and thereby the award would  be patently illegal which could be set aside  under S. 34.\n15. Result is ­ if the award is contrary to   the   substantive   provisions   of   law   or   the  provisions of the Act or against the terms  of   the   contract,   it   would   be   patently  illegal, which could be interfered under S. \n34.   However,   such   failure   of   procedure  should be patent affecting the rights of the  parties.\n16.   The   next   clause   which   requires  interpretation   is   Cl.   (ii)   of   sub­section  (2)(b)   of   S.   34   which   inter   alia   provides  that the Court may set aside arbitral award  if it is in conflict with the 'Public Policy   of   India.'   The   phrase   'Public   Policy   of  India' is not defined under the Act. Hence,  the   said   term   is   required   to   be   given  meaning in context and also considering the  purpose   of   the   section   and   scheme   of   the  Act.   It   has   been   repeatedly   stated   by  various   authorities   that   the   expression  'public   policy'   does   not   admit   of   precise  HC-NIC Page 79 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER definition and may vary from generation to  generation and from time to time. Hence, the  concept 'public policy' is considered to be  vague,   susceptible   to   narrow   or   wider  meaning depending upon the context in which  it is used. Lacking precedent the Court has  to   give   its   meaning   in   the   light   and   principles   underlying   the   Arbitration   Act,  Contract Act and constitutional provisions.\n18. Further, in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v.  General   Electric   Co.   (1994   Supp   (1)   SCC \n644), this Court considered S. 7(1) of the  Arbitration   (Protocol   and   Convention)   Act,  1937   which   inter   alia   provided   that   a  foreign award may not be enforced under the  said Act, if the Court dealing with the case  is   satisfied   that   the   enforcement   of   the  award will be contrary to the public policy.  After   elaborate   discussion,   the   Court  arrived at the conclusion that public policy  comprehended   in   S.   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the  Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement)  Act,   1961   is   the   'Public   Policy   of   India'  and does not cover the public policy of any   other   country.   For   giving   meaning   to   the  term   'Public   Policy,'   the   Court   observed  thus :­ \"66.   Article   5(2)(b)   of   the   New   York   Convention of 1958 and S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the  Foreign Awards Act do not postulate refusal  of recognition and enforcement of a foreign  award on the ground that it is contrary to  the   law   of   the   country   of   enforcement   and  the ground of challenge is confined to the  recognition   and   enforcement   being   contrary  to the public policy of the country in which   the   award   is   set   to   be   enforced.   There   is  nothing   to   indicate   that   the   expression   \"public policy\" in Art. 5(2)(b) of the New  York   Convention   and   S.   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the  Foreign Awards Act is not used in the same  sense in which it was used in Art. 1(c) of  the Geneva Convention of 1927 and S. 7(1) of  the   Protocol   and   Convention   Act   of   1937.  This would mean that \"public policy\" in S.  HC-NIC Page 80 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER 7(1)(b)(ii)   has   been   used   in   a   narrower  sense   and   in   order   to   attract   to   bar   of   public policy  the enforcement of the award  must   invoke   something   more   than   the   violation   of   the   law   of   India.   Since   the  Foreign   Awards   Act   is   concerned   with   recognition   and   enforcement   of   foreign  awards which are governed by the principles  of private international law, the expression  \"public   policy\"   in   S.   7(1)(b)(ii)   of   the  Foreign   Awards   Act   must   necessarily   be  construed   in   the   sense   the   doctrine   of   public   policy   is   applied   in   the   field   of  private international law. Applying the said  criteria   it   must   be   held   that   the  enforcement   of   a   foreign   award   would   be  refused on the ground that it is contrary to   public policy  if such enforcement would be  contrary to (i) fundamental policy of Indian  law;   or   (ii)   the   interests   of   India;   or  \n(iii) justice or morality.\"\n18. The Court finally held that :­ \"76. Keeping in view the aforesaid  objects  underlying FERA and the principles governing  enforcement   of   exchange   control   laws  followed in other countries, we are of the  view that the provisions contained in  FERA  have been enacted to safeguard the economic  interests of India and any violation of the  said   provisions   would   be   contrary   to   the  public   policy   of   India   as   envisaged   in   S.  7(1)(b)(ii) of the Act.\"\n20.   Mr.   Desai   submitted   that   the   narrow  meaning given to the term 'public policy' in  Renusagar's case is in context of the fact  that   the   question   involved   in   the   said   matter was with regard to the execution of  the   award   which   had   attained   finality.   It  was not a case where validity of the award  is   challenged   before   a   forum   prescribed   under the Act. He submitted that the scheme  of S. 34 which deals with setting aside the   domestic   arbitral   award   and   S.   48   which  deals with enforcement of foreign award are  HC-NIC Page 81 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER not identical. A foreign award by definition  is   subject   to   double   exequatur.   This   is  recognised inter alia by S. 48(1) and there  is no parallel provision to this clause in  S. 34. For this, he referred to Lord Mustill  and   Stewart   C.   Boyd   QC's   \"Commercial   Arbitration\" 2001 wherein (at page 90) it is  stated as under :­ \"Mutual   recognition   of   awards   is   the   glue  which   holds   the   international   arbitrating  community   together,   and   this   will   only   be  strong if the enforcing Court is willing to  trust, as the convention assumes that  they  will   trust,   the   supervising   authorities   of   the chosen venue. It follows that if, and to  the   extent   that   the   award   has   been   struck  down   in   the   local   Court   it   should   be   a   matter   of   theory   and   practice   be   treated   when   enforcement   is   sought   as   if   to   the   extent it did not exist.\"\n21.   He   further   submitted   that   in   foreign   arbitration, the  award would  be subject to  being   set   aside   or   suspended   by   the  competent   authority   under   the   relevant   law   of   that   country   whereas   in   the   domestic  arbitration the only recourse is to S. 34. The   aforesaid   submission   of   the   learned   senior counsel requires to be accepted. From  the   judgments   discussed   above,   it   can   be  held that the term 'public policy of India'  is required to be interpreted in the context  of the jurisdiction of the Court where the  validity   of   award   is   challenged   before   it   becomes final and executable. The concept of  enforcement   of   the   award   after   it   becomes  final is different and  the jurisdiction of  the   Court   at   that   stage   could   be   limited.  Similar is the position with regard to the  execution of a decree. It is settled law as   well as it is provided under Code of Civil  Procedure that once the decree has attained  finality, in an execution proceeding, it may  be challenged  only on limited grounds  such  as the decree being without jurisdiction or  HC-NIC Page 82 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER nullity.   But   in   a   case   where   the   judgment  and   decree   is   challenged   before   the   appellate   Court   or   the   Court   exercising   revisional jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of  such Court would be wider. Therefore, in a  case   where   the   validity   of   award   is  challenged there is no necessity of giving a  narrower meaning to the term 'public policy  of India.' On the contrary, wider meaning is  required to be given so that the 'patently  illegal   award'   passed   by   the   Arbitral  Tribunal   could   be   set   aside.   If   narrow   meaning as  contended by the learned senior  counsel   Mr.   Dave   is   given,   some   of   the  provisions   of   the   Arbitration   Act   would   become   nugatory.   Take   for   illustration   a  case wherein there is a specific provision  in the contract that for delayed payment of  the   amount   due   and   payable,   no   interest  would   be   payable,   still   however,   if   the  arbitrator   has   passed   an   award   granting   interest, it would be against the terms of  the   contract   and   thereby   against   the   provision   of   S.   28(3)   of   the   Act   which  specifically   provides   that   \"Arbitral  Tribunal shall decide in accordance with the  terms of the contract.\" Further, where there  is a specific usage of the trade that if the  payment   is   made   beyond   a   period   of   one  month, then the party would be required to  pay   the   said   amount   with   interest   at   the  rate   of   15   per   cent.   Despite   the   evidence  being produced on record for such usage, if  the   arbitrator   refuses   to   grant   such   interest on the ground of equity, such award  would also  be in  violation of sub­sections  (2)   and   (3)   of   S.   28.   Section   28(2)  specifically provides that arbitrator shall  decide ex aequo et bono (according to what  is just and good) only if the parties have  expressly   authorised   him   to   do   so.  Similarly, if the award is patently against  the statutory provisions of substantive law  which   is   in   force   in   India   or   is   passed   without giving an opportunity of hearing to  the   parties   as   provided   under   S.   24   or   HC-NIC Page 83 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER without   giving   any   reason   in   a   case   where  parties have not agreed that no reasons are  to   be   recorded,   it   would   be   against   the   statutory provisions. In all such cases, the  award   is   required   to   be   set   aside   on   the  ground of 'patent illegality.\"\n101. In the above cited judgment, the Apex Court  has considered the aspect relating to enforcement  of domestic award as provided under Section 34 of  the   Act   and   hence,   the   same   would   not   be  applicable to the case on hand. \n102. Learned counsel for the respondents has also  placed reliance on the following judgments :­ \n(i)   Central   Inland   Water   Transport   Corporation  Limited   &   Anr.   Vs.

Thus,   having   agreed   to   the   applicability   of  English   law   and   the   learned   Tribunal   having  applied the provisions of UK Sale of Goods Act as  well as GAFTA Rules, the same would not mean that  there is any contravention of fundamental policy  of India and as the facts unfold from the record  of the petitions, admittedly the awards have been  upheld   by   the   Appellate   Board   as   well   as   the  Courts in England.\nHC-NIC                              Page 84 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017\n                   O/IAAP/2/2017                                           ORDER\n104. This   group   of   petitions   are   considered   at   this  stage to determine whether the awards in question  are enforceable and whether the awards are deemed  to   be   decree   by   this   Court   as   provided   under  Section 49 of the Act. As far as this aspect is  concerned,  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  have  contended   that   the   aforesaid   first   part   may   be  decided   first   by   this   Court   and   accordingly,  following the ratio laid down by the Apex Court  in   the   case   of  Fuerst   Day   Lawson   Ltd.(supra),  keeping the petitions pending, by this order only  1st part, viz., whether the awards in question are  deemed   to   be   decree   of   this   Court   or   not   as  provided under the Act is hereby decided. \n105. While   considering   the   jurisdiction   of   the  Executing Court to execute the foreign awards as  provided   under   Section   7   (1)(b)(ii)   of   the  Foreign Awards Act, the Apex Court has held that  objections about unjust enrichment may relate to  the   merits   of   the   award,   which   is   beyond   the  scope of the objections that can be raised under  Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act and  it has been accordingly held that such course is  not permissible under the New York Convention and  under   the   Foreign   Awards   Act.   Provisions   of  Section 48 of the Act materially corresponds to  Section 7 of the Foreign Awards Act. In the case  on   hand   also,   the   parties   agreed   for  applicability   of   English   Law   and   Arbitration  HC-NIC Page 85 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER under   the   GAFTA   Rules   at   London.   The   awards  clearly postulate that the Arbitral Tribunal and  the Appellate Board have granted damages as per  the   provisions   of   UK   Sale   of   Goods   Act   while  interpreting Sections 51(1) and 51 (3) of the UK  Sale of Goods Act and therefore, the contention  raised   by   the   respondents   that   the   damages  awarded by learned Tribunal is more than actual  loss   and   therefore,   the   same   would   amount   to  unjust   enrichment,   which   in   turn   would   be   in  contravention   of   the   fundamental   policy   of   the  Indian Law and would mean that this Court has to  go into the merits of the awards with regard to  quantum awarded by  learned Arbitral Tribunal and  following the ratio laid down by the Apex Court  in the case of Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. (supra),  the same would be beyond the scope. \n106. In the case on hand, it is an admitted position  that   the   petitions   relate   to   foreign   awards,  which   have   attained   finality   under   the   English  Law. Thus, as held by the Apex Court in the case  of   Shri   Lal   Mahal   Limited   (supra)   and   more  particularly, even after amendment of 2015, scope  of inquiry is very limited on the aspect that it  is in contravention of the fundamental policy of  the   Indian   Law   or   that   it   is   in   conflict   with  public law and this Court cannot entail review on  merits into the dispute. The contention raised by  the respondents in opinion of this Court, would  amount to inquiry into the merits. It is not the  HC-NIC Page 86 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER case   of   the   respondents   that   the   awards   in  question were induced by fraud or corruption or  is violative of Sections 75 and 84 of the Act. It  is   an   admitted   position   that   the   parties   had  agreed for applicability of English law and all  Appellate  authorities  and  the  Courts  in  England  have   upheld   the   awards   in­origin   passed   by   the  Arbitral Tribunal as well as the Appellate Board  and therefore, considering the ratio laid down by  the   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  Shri   Lal   Mahal  Limited   (supra),  read   with   explanation   2   of  Section 48 even in limited scope of inquiry, in  the facts of the case, none of the grounds raised  by   the   respondents   would   establish   that   the  awards in question are in contravention with the  fundamental policy of the Indian law. \n107. Following   the   ratio   laid   down   by   the   Hon'ble  Supreme   Court,   Bombay   High   Court   and   Calcutta  High Court, scope of inquiry under Section 48 of  the   Act   is   very   limited   and   this   Court   cannot  adjudicate   upon   the   merits   of   the   case   or   to  review the findings on merits rendered by learned  Arbitral   Tribunal   as   well   as   the   Courts   in  England. \n108. Considering   the   facts   of   the   case   on   hand,  learned   Arbitral   Tribunal   as   well   as   the  Appellate Board after hearing all the parties and  after   considering   applicable   law,   more  particularly   provisions   of   Section   51(1)   and  51(3) of the UK Sale of Goods Act, have passed  HC-NIC Page 87 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the awards. Following the ratio laid down by the  Apex Court in the cases of Shri Lal Mahal Limited  (supra), as well as the judgment of Bombay High  Court and Culcutta High Court as referred above,  section   48   of   the   Act   does   not   give   additional  opportunity   to   have   second   look   of   the   foreign  award, at the stage of enforcing of the foreign  award and this Court, therefore, is not empowered  to look into the aspect whether the provisions of  Section 51(2) or Section 51 (3) of the UK Sale of  Goods   Act   would   apply   and   on   that   count,   it  cannot   be   gainsaid   that   the  same   is   in  contravention with the fundamental policy of the  Indian Law or that it is against the morality and  also that the same would shock the conscience of  this Court. \n109. Considering the contention of learned counsel for  the respondents that the impugned awards are in  breach   of   Sections   73   and   74   of   the   Indian  Contract Act and therefore, the same would amount  to contravention of fundamental policy of Indian  Law, deserves to be negatived. At this stage, it  would be appropriate to refer to the judgment of  the Delhi High Court rendered in the case of Cruz  City Mauritius Holdings Vs. Unitech Ltd., [2017  SCC   Online   Del   7810],   wherein   it   has   observed  thus:­ \"96. It plainly follows from the above that  a   contravention   of   a   provision   of   law   is  insufficient to invoke the defence of public  HC-NIC Page 88 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER policy when it becomes to enforcement of a  foreign   award.   Contravention   of   any  provision of an enactment is not synonymous  to   contravention   of   fundamental   policy   of  Indian   Law.   The   expression   fundamental  policy   of   Indian   laws   refers   to   the  principles   and   the   legislative   policy   of  which Indian statutes and laws are founded.  The expression \"fundamental policy\" connotes   the basic and substratal rationable, values   and   principles   whcih   form   the   bedrock   of  laws in our country.\n97. It is necessary to bear in mind that a  foreign award may be based on foreign law,  which   may   be   at   variance   with   a  corresponding   Indian   statute.   And,   if   the  expression   \"fundamental   policy   of   Indian  law\"   is   considered   as   a   reference   to   a  provision of the Indian statue, as is sought  to   be   contended   on   behalf   of   Unitech,   the  basic purpose of the New York Convention to  enforce   foreign   awards   would   stand  frustrated.   One   of   the   principal   objective  of   the   New   York   Convention   is   to   ensure  enforcement   of   awards   notwithstanding   that  the awards are not rendered in conformity to  the   national   laws.   Thus,   the   objections   to  enforcement  on  the   ground   of   public  policy  must be such that offend the core values of   a   member  state's   national   policy  and   which  it   cannot   be   expected   to   compromise.   The  expression \"fundamental policy of law\" must  be interpreted in that perspective and must  mean   only   the   fundamental   and   substratal  legislative   policy   and   not   a   provision   of  any enactment. \n99. The   explanations   to   section   48(2)   of  the   Act   as   amended   introduced   by   the  Arbitration   adn   Conciliation   (Amendment)  Act,   2015   have   brought   about   a   material  change and further narrowed the scope of the  public policy defence: first, explanation 1  has sought to replace the inclusive scope of  the pre­amendment provision by an exhaustive  HC-NIC Page 89 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER one; second, interest of India is no longer   included in the scope of public policy; and   third,   it   has   been   expressly   provided,  although   the   same   was   authoritatively  settled   by   the   Supreme   Court   in   Renusagar  Power Co.  Ltd. V. Central Electric Co. That   examiantion   of   whether   the   arbitral   award  offends   the   Fundamental   policy   of   Indian   Law, does not entail a review on merits.\"\n110. Considering the provisions of Section 28(1)(b)(1)  of the Act and the facts of the case on hand, the  parties had agreed that the arbitration would be  as   per   the   GAFTA   rules   and   the   seat   of  arbitration   would   be   at   London   and   the   parties  had also agreed that the English law would apply,  now cannot be permitted to argue again on merits  as is sought to be done indirectly by contending  that the impugned awards are in contravention of  fundamental policy of the Indian Law and morality  and that the same would shock the conscience of  the   Court   on   the   grounds   that   are   contended   by  the   respondents,   more   particularly   the   ground  that   there   is   violation   of   the   provisions   of  Sections   73   and   74   of   the   Indian   Contract   Act.  The parties to the contract were aware about the  contracts   and   the   date   on   which   the   contracts  were   entered   between   the   parties   and   that   they  have   agreed   to   be   governed   by   English   law   and  learned Tribunal having applied the provisions of  UK   Sale   of   Goods   Act,   which   have   attained  finality  in  the  learned  Tribunal,  the   Appellate  Board as well as the Courts in England, the same  cannot be now re­examined on merits by contending  HC-NIC Page 90 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER that   it   is   violative   of   fundamental   policy   of  Indian Law and morality.\n111. Thus, in the case on hand, only because learned  Arbitral Tribunal while applying Section 51(3) of  the UK Sale of Goods Act has awarded a particular  quantum of amount, mere violation of Sections 73  and   74   of   the   Indian   Contract   Act,   therefore,  would not amount to contravention of  fundamental  policy of the Indian Law. \n112. In  light  of  the  aforesaid  contention  therefore,  for examining whether it is in contravention with  the fundamental policy of Indian law, it deserves  to be noted at the outset that by Explanation 2,  which   is   inserted/substituted   by   Act   3   of   2016  w.e.f.   23.10.2015   clearly   postulates   that   such  inquiry   is   very   narrow   and   the   same   shall   not  entail a review on merits of the dispute and it  carries   a   narrow   meaning   in   comparison   to   the  provisions of section 34(2)(b) of the Act.\n113. Government   of   India   in   the   publication   titled  Legal   Glossary   prepared   by   Ministry   of   Law   &  Company   Affairs,   in   1983   Edition   has   defined  expression   \"Public   Policy\"   as   principles   in  accordance   with   which   action   of   men   and  commodities need to be regulated to achieve the  good of entire community or public.   (Reference  to  law  relating  to  Arbitration  and   Conciliation  by Dr. P.C.

Again, referring to the facts which arise in this  group   of   petitions,   the   parties   entered   into   a  contract for supply of Indian Rapeseed Meal and  have   determined   and   selected   appropriate   law,  i.e., the parties have agreed for arbitration and  has also agreed for applicability of English law.  The   parties   participated   in   arbitration  proceedings   which  culminated   into   an   award   by  arbitral board and confirmed in appeal under the  GAFTA   Rules   and   the   leave   to   appeal   was   not  granted.     Having   accepted   the   applicability   of  English   law,   the   awards   are   based   on   the  provisions of English law, i.e., UK Sale of Goods  Act. The contention that the actual loss is less  than   the   damages   which   is   awarded   by   the  arbitrator   is   a   matter   of   fact   and   the   merits  which are considered by the arbitrator as per the  English   law   and   further   by   the   English   courts  taking  into  consideration  the  provisions  of  the  UK Sale of Goods Act.  Therefore, the contention  that the awards in question are in contravention  with   section   73   of   the   Contract   Act   would   not  take   the   case   of   the   respondents   any   further.  Considering   the   binding   decision   of   the   Apex  Court in the case of Renu Sagar (supra) and Shri  Lal Mahal Ltd. (supra), the award of damages as  per   the   English   Law   and   the   applicability   of  section   51(3)   of   the   UK   Sale   of   Goods   Act   is  entirely in the arena of the merits of the award  and the same cannot be reopened, re­examined or  re­appreciated by this Court.\nHC-NIC                             Page 92 of 96     Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017\n                 O/IAAP/2/2017                                            ORDER\n115. Having   agreed   to   the   applicability   of   a  particular   law   under   English   law   and   having  participated in the proceedings, the same cannot  be   re­opened   by   this   Court   while   deciding   the  issue under sections 47, 48 and 49 of the Act at  the instance of the respondents and following the  explanation 2 of section 48 therefore, even while  examining   the   aspect   whether   the   awards   are   in  contravention   with   the   fundamental   policy   of  India, the same shall not entail a review on the  merits of the dispute.  It is not the case of the  respondents   that   the   contracts   entered   into  between the parties were against any Indian law  or was in contravention of the fundamental policy  of Indian Law, neither there is any other breach  of Indian law for entering into such contracts.  In   opinion   of   this   Court,   the   contracts   were  entered   into   between   the   respondents   who   are  Indian   suppliers   and   the   petitioner   who   was   a  foreign   buyer,   which   is   legal   and   proper.   Both  the   parties   agreed   that   the   English   law   would  apply   and   though   the   transaction   of   contract  cannot be examined by this Court, suffice it to  say   that   such   contracts   did   not   contravene   any  other   law   as   applicable   in   India   or   any  fundamental   policy   of   Indian   law.     In   facts   of  the case, it cannot be said that enforcement of  the awards would be injury to the public good or  possibly,   that   enforcement   would   be   wholly  offensive   to   the   ordinary/reasonable   and   fully  HC-NIC Page 93 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER informed member of the public.\n116. Therefore   on   the   grounds   which   are   raised   to  buttress the contention that the impugned awards  are against the fundamental policy of Indian law,  more or less touches the merits of the award and  enforcement of the award cannot be denied merely  on   the   alleged   ground   that   it   is   against   the  provisions of section 73 of Indian Contract Act.  Even the contention that inspite of actual  loss  occurred,   a   sum   of   Rs.   13   Million   dollars   is  awarded   for   9   contracts   is   based   upon   the  applicability  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  UK   Sale   of   Goods   Act,   which   was   agreed   by   the  parties to be made applicable and on such ground,  it cannot be said that the impugned awards are in  any way violative of fundamental policy of Indian  law.  It is not the case of the respondents that  the enforcement of the awards would result into  breach   of   any   public   policy   of   India   and  therefore,   the   contention   raised   by   the  respondents to say that the impugned awards are  against   the   fundamental   policy   of   Indian   law  deserves   to   be   negatived.     Even   examining   the  other limb of argument that the impugned awards  are   against   the   morality   and   would   shock   the  conscience of this Court, it deserves to be noted  that   the   breach   came   to   be   initiated   with   the  non­supply   of   goods   agreed   by   the   respondents  themselves.    Having  agreed  for  applicability  of  English law and the awards having been based upon  HC-NIC Page 94 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the provisions of UK Sale of Goods Act and more  particularly   applicability   of   section   51(3)   of  the said Act, it cannot be said that the impugned  awards are against morality or that it shocks the  conscience   of   this   Court.   In   a   commercial  transaction   which  was   entered   into   between   the  parties   as   normal   businessmen   and   both   the  parties having agreed to a particular course and  applicability   of   arbitration   clause     with  applicability of English law, it cannot be said  that   the   impugned   awards   lack   morality   or   it  would shock the conscience of this Court.\n117. Considering the aforesaid as well as taking into  consideration the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble  Apex Court as well as judgments of the other High  Courts, all contentions raised by the respondents  that   the   impugned   awards   are   against   the  fundamental   policy   of   Indian   law   and   that   the  same   lacks   morality   and   that   the   same   is   in  contravention with a particular provision of the  Indian law and that it shocks the conscience of  this   Court   deserve   to   be   negatived.   Even   the  contention   that   other   arbitral   proceedings  relating   to   the   similar   contracts   are   still  pending   wherein   the   petitioners   have   sought  adjournment time and again even for production of  documents   in   opinion   of   this   Court   would   not  affect   the   enforceability   of   the   awards   in  question.\n118. In   facts   of   the   aforesaid   case   therefore,   this  HC-NIC Page 95 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER Court   finds   that   the   awards   in   question   have  become   final   as   per   the   English   law   and   this  Court   is   satisfied   that   the   awards   in   question  are   enforceable   and   it   is   hereby   held   that   the  awards   shall   be   deemed   to   be   decree   of   this  Court. \n119.

firm or are directors of the company. 3. as the dispute arose between the parties, the dispute was referred to arbitration before gafta tribunal in london. the disputes so referred culminated into 9 original gafta awards dated 28.04.2014. the respondents preferred appeals challenging the original awards before the board of appeal, gafta, london and the appellate board of gafta after hearing the parties was pleased to uphold all the original awards with some minor modification to the amount of damages awarded to the petitioner on the basis of the calculation of damages from the exact date of default. the record further indicates that the respondents approached gafta appeal board seeking clarification of the awards which came to be rejected by gafta appellate board vide order/communication dated 26.05.2015. the respondents carried the same further by filling appeals as provided under sections 68 and 69 of the english arbitration & conciliation act, 1996 before the high court of justice

prefer an appeal before the supreme court of united kingdom. according to the petitioners, the proceedings attained finality as per the provisions of uk arbitration act and hence, the petitioner filed individual applications for execution of the awards as foreign awards before the district court at gandhidham which came to be registered as special execution petitions no.167/15 to 175/15. the record indicates that the learned district court at gandhidham issued notice to the respondents. 4. at this stage, it would be appropriate to note that the petitioner herein preferred petition under section

submitted that the present petitions are execution petitions and this court will have to determine in two parts. referring to the provisions of the act and more particularly sections 46, 47, 48, it was contended that this court will have to determine whether the awards which are foreign awards are enforceable and declare it as decree of this court. 17. mr. thakore submitted that the second stage can hc-nic page 9 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order be kept pending and only after this court comes to the conclusion that the awards become enforceable, then it would become decree of this court and then execute it as provided under order 21 of the civil procedure code and subsequent stage can be decided later and therefore, the present hearing may be limited to the application of section 48 of the act. at this stage, mr. thakore also relied upon the judgment of the apex court in the case of m/s. fuerst day lawson ltd vs jindal exports ltd. reported in 2001(6) scc 356. 18. mr. soparkar, learned counsel appearing for the respective respondents raised the following contentions ­ 19. that this court may decide the issue of section 47 of the act first and then decide whether the awards are enforceable or not. 20. it was contended that as provided under section 46 of the act, the arbitration has to be by a party or in relation to contract executed between whom it is made. it is not in dispute that only the firms were party to the contracts. it was contended that section 47 read with section 49 of the act will have bearing on the proceedings inasmuch as, individuals are not party to the proceedings and therefore foreign awards would not be binding on them. hc-nic page 10 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order 21. it was contended that the provisions of section 49 of the act provides that the award is to be made decree by this court which is the first stage and therefore, the individuals are wrongly joined and have no locus and even the petitions do not contain any averment to justify the presence of individuals other than the companies. 22. referring to the provisions of section 48(2) of the act, it was contended by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent that the damages would mean the damages immediate and not for profiteering. 23. referring to the provisions of section 51(3) of the u.k. sale of goods act as well as section 51(2) of the said act, mr. soparkar learned counsel appearing for the respondent contended that it has to be exact damages. referring to the awards in origin as well as the awards passed by the appellate board of gafta, mr. soparkar, contended that the amount awarded is more than its true loss and it is an unusual case which would shock the conscience of this court. it was further contended that even according to the petitioner, the actual loss is much less than what is awarded. it was contended that approximately, the amount of 13 million usd is awarded for 9 contracts only. 24. it was also further contended that the high court of england has not confirmed the orders of the hc-nic page 11 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order arbitration awards passed by the arbitrators as well as the appellate arbitration board, but has refused to entertain the objections of the respondents by holding that the view taken by the arbitration tribunal/board is not obviously wrong. by referring to section 69 of the u.k. sale of goods act and even referring to the order passed by court of appeal, it was contended that the court of appeal refused permission to appeal without hearing and the decision has become final as per the english law. 25. relying upon the judgment of the apex court in the case of shri lal mahal ltd(supra), mr. soparkar, learned counsel appearing for the respondent contended that the awards in question have become final only as per english law and the provisions of section 48 of the act and more particularly section 48(2)(b) of the act would apply and the respondents have a right to dispute the same as it is against the public policy. relying upon the judgment of the apex court in the case of renusagar power co. ltd. vs. general electric co. reported in air 1994 sc 860 as well as the judgment in the case of associate builders vs. delhi development authority reported in (2015) 3 scc 49 and judgment of the calcutta high court in the case of gopalchandra mukherjee v. food corporation of india reported in (2017) scc online calcutta 67, it was contended that the awards would be contrary to hc-nic page 12 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order the public policy in india and the same are against fundamental principles of indian law and violative of morality and justice and the same would shock the conscience of this court. 26. it was contended that mere violation of indian law may not satisfy the test that it is against public policy, but when it is against fundamental rules of legal system of the country, such foreign awards are not enforceable. 27. further relying upon the judgment in the case of renu sagar (supra) more particularly paragraphs no.68 to 76, the judgment of the apex court reported in 1994 (suppl.) scc 465 as well as the judgment rendered in the case of laxman prasad v. prodigy ele. ltd. & anr. reported in (2005) 5 scc 465 (at page 477), it was contended that test is provided to the effect that whether the awards in question are violative of indian law or whether it is against the basic principles of morality and justice and whether there is flagrant/gross breach of the same. 28. explaining and elucidating the impugned orders further, mr.soparkar contended that the awards of the arbitration tribunal whereby as against the direct loss of around 3 million usd, a total loss including consequential loss of 5 million usd for 14 contracts is being compensated by damages in sum exceeding 13 million usd for 9 contracts, which is fundamentally in violation of indian hc-nic page 13 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order jurisprudence wherein compensation is always to make good damages suffered and not profiteering. 29. referring to section 57 of the indian sale of goods act and section 73 of the indian contract act, it was contended by mr. soparkar that the provision is to pay direct loss and not indirect loss and not for profiteering and the parties cannot be made richer. mr. soparkar also further contended that the parties had entered into back to back contracts and have adopted the cause and minimise the loss and the petitioners have adopted such a cause whereby they have minimised the loss and therefore the petitioners cannot ask for more. 30. referring to section 73 of the indian contract act as well as the judgment of the apex court in the case of messrs. torjan & company vs. rm.n.n. nagappa chettiar reported in air 1953 sc 235, it was contended by mr. soparkar, learned counsel appearing for the respondents that a party cannot be awarded astronomical profits that he would have made. mr. soparkar contended that if the petitioner would have purchased it from the open market, to satisfy the back to back contracts entered into by the petitioner with its proposed buyer, only in such circumstances, it can claim for profit which otherwise is not entitled to. it was submitted that the petitioner cannot claim greater amount than penalty which is permissible. hc-nic page 14 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order 31. relying upon the judgments of the apex court rendered in the cases of dcm decometal gmbh v. rohit ferro tech ltd., reported in air 1962 sc 366 and union of india & ors. v. sugauli sugar works pvt. ltd. reported in 1976 (3) scc 32, it was contended by mr. soparkar, learned counsel for the respondent that only the loss due to breach of contract and steps taken to mitigate such loss can be awarded as damages and nothing beyond loss. it was contended that it being back to back contract which was known to the petitioner and not having gone in the market cannot be permitted to profiteer as if they have suffered damage of the profit as well and this fundamental basis can be considered only if the contract is performed. it was therefore contended that these facts would shock the conscience of the court and it is against equity and fairness. 32. relying upon the judgment of the hon'ble bombay high court reported in 2015 bombay cr 204, it was contended that in the fact situation, it would be a case of unjust enrichment which is against fundamental policy of indian law and the petitioner cannot be permitted to make profit out of the breach of contract. 33. relying upon the judgment of the calcutta high court in the case of usha beltron ltd. v. nand kishore parasramka & anr., reported in air 2001 hc-nic page 15 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order calcutta 137, it was contended that in these facts and circumstances this court can go into this aspect as the same would shock the conscience of the court. 34. mr. soparkar further contended that the fundamental policy of the indian law prescribes that no one can profiteer from breach of contract and breach of contract cannot result into profit and therefore, there is violation of fundamental policy of indian law. 35. it was reiterated that even as per the justice and morality would it be just if a person would profit, for example rs.65 crores, which profit he would not have made if the contract would have been executed. it was contended that it is a penalty and therefore, this court may not entertain these petitions on the aforesaid grounds. it was contended that the awards are against the fundamental policy of indian law and therefore it is not a fit case wherein this court would come to the conclusion that it is a deemed decree of this court as provided under section 49 of the act and none of the conditions are satisfied and the impugned awards are against the fundamental policy of indian law, morality, justice and profiteering may not be permitted under section 49 of the act and therefore, this court may be pleased to reject these petitions. 36. mr. mehul s. shah, learned senior counsel hc-nic page 16 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order appearing for the respective respondents has taken this court through the judgments of the apex court in renu sagar (supra) and has contended as under ­ 37. that sections 34 and 48 of the act were similar and the judgments of the apex court in shri lal mahal ltd. (supra) clarified the situation and provided for test and guide as well as the parameters to be followed as to what would be against public policy of indian law, morality and justice. 38. it was further contended that looking at the awards as it is, it cannot be said that the respondents are liable under damages and such damages could ever be awarded. it was further contended that keeping in mind both rationality and principles of damages, the impugned awards cannot be executed as the same are not accepted by the indian law and in the instant case, the test provided by the aforesaid judgments are apparently not fulfilled and allowing the award as it is, it would be allowing unjust enrichment of the award once it is deemed to be decree of this court and that valid and germane defence is available to the respondents before the awards are considered to be decree. 39. referring to the emails, which in fact have been referred to by mr. soparkar, it was contended that the actual loss is lesser than what is hc-nic page 17 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order awarded. it was contended that the award of damages in such contract matter is to mitigate the loss and on facts, it has been found that only deposits have been forfeited. 40. relying upon the judgments of the apex court in the cases of centrotrade minerals & metal inc. v. hindustan copper ltd., reported in (2017) 2 scc 228, maula bux v. union of india reported in (1969) 2 scc 554 and fateh chand v. balkishan dass reported in air 1963 sc 1405, mr. shah contended that no evidence is led for actual loss. it was further contended by mr. shah, learned counsel appearing for the respondent that it is not permissible for any judicial authority to award damages by just applying some measures suggested by the claimants which may be applied for in given facts of the case that there is definite pleading, evidence and finding. it was contended that if that is not so, the authority has to find out actual damages from the facts resulting from the breach of the contract. it was therefore contended that this is not a fit case for considering the impugned award as decree of this court. 41. mr. rashesh s. sanjanwala learned senior counsel assisted by mr. sahil m. shah, learned counsel has adopted the arguments adopted by mr. soparkar and mr. mehul shah, learned senior counsels appearing for the respective respondents. hc-nic page 18 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order 42. the learned counsels appearing for the respective respondents have also further contended that it is found from the record that there were 13 contracts for which notice for arbitration has been given. it was further pointed out that pursuant to the said notice, reference was so made and the tribunal was constituted and the tribunal has proceeded only in reference to 9 cases and other cases are remaining. it was further contended that the claims sought to be raised by similar companies are common, but in five cases, it has come on record. it was further contended that the 14 cases could have been simultaneously decided. it was contended that there would have been all chances of award, which are likely to have contradictory findings on merits as well as in law though arising from similar contract, stipulation and same date. it was apprehended that there would be likelihood of contradiction on merits and in law. it was further pointed out that the petitioner has sought for extension of time for production of documents and therefore pursuant to the extension, if now these cases are taken up, the resultant effect in law would be that again there would be contradictory findings and therefore, the present petitions are premature. 43. mr. mihir j. thakore, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in his further reply has hc-nic page 19 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order contended as under ­ 44. that prima facie, the awards are just and proper. 45. that the issues which are raised cannot be looked into. 46. referring to the proposal e­mail dated 12.06.2012, 16.07.2012 as well as email dated 21.07.2012, it was contended that there was no response. 47. referring to the same from the awards in origin, it was contended that as noted by the tribunal, the proposals were given to resolve the matter and it was contended that the tribunal has read the same and that all such offers were without prejudice offers to resolve the issue and the same cannot be seen at the stage of enforcement of the award. 48. mr. thakore, referring to the provisions of section 51(2) and 51(3) of the u.k. sale of goods act, contended that the same has been considered by the tribunal as well as in the appeal award and even the aspect of actual loss in light of the provision of section 51(3) has been considered by the arbitral appellate tribunal and the same is overruled. referring to para 10.15 of the award, mr. thakore contended that the aspect of back to back contract is concluded by the tribunal and the tribunal has come to the hc-nic page 20 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order definite conclusion that the contract in question were not \"inextricably linked\"and that the case is governed by section 51(3)of the u.k. sale of goods act. it is further contended by mr. thakore, learned counsel for the petitioner that these findings given by the arbitration tribunal as well as the appellate tribunal are given on interpretation of the facts under english law. 49. it was contended that as per the provisions of the act and even as provided under sections 28 and 48 of the act, this court cannot entail review on merits and same is not contemplated by the act and this court also cannot challenge the validity. only enforcement can be challenged. mr. thakore also relied upon the judgment of the apex court in the case of ongc v. saw pipes reported in 2003(5) scc 705. 50. mr. thakore further contended that the issue of damages has been considered by the tribunal in detail as per the clauses. it was also further contended that section 69 of the english arbitration act, 1996 provides for an appeal on the point of law and sub­section (2) thereof provides for leave of the court which prescribes that appeal would be with the leave of the court when it found that the award is obviously wrong. it was contended that as held by the hon'ble queen's division bench of london high court, the first question to be considered as per the hc-nic page 21 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order english law was whether requirement of sections 69(3)(a) & (b) are made out or not and the hon'ble bench has come to the conclusion that the decision of the board was not obviously wrong. it was therefore contended that on such satisfaction only high court can deal with the matter. 51. mr. thakore further contended that the parties have agreed for applicability of english law and the seat of arbitration would be london and once having accepted english law, challenge would be limited as provided under sections 68 and 69 of the english arbitration act, 1996. it was contended that the tribunal has come to the conclusion the there are no special circumstances as to why section 51(3) of the uk sale of goods act should not be applied and the petitioner has lost market value of the goods. referring to the judgment of the review before the high court as well as to the court of appeal, it was contended by mr. thakore that the proceedings ended in england. 52. mr. thakore contended that the judgment of the apex court in saw pipe (supra) clarifies the distinct jurisdiction between sections 34 and section 48 of the act and the same is in context with the provisions of section 34 of the act and the hon'ble court was quite conscious of the fact that the judgment of three judges cannot be overruled. hc-nic page 22 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order 53. referring to the judgment in the case of renu sagar (supra), mr. thakore contended that the contention that the award is contrary to the english law is not available. mr. thakore also further contended that whether section 51(2) of the english law or 51(3) of the english law should be applied cannot be looked into by this court nor it would enable any party to argue the same. referring further to the observations made in the case of renu sagar (supra), it was contended that the argument that it is a case of unjust enrichment is also not permissible. mr. thakore also contended that the parties have agreed to english law and it is analysed accordingly. 54. mr. thakore contended that section 21 of the arbitration act is in part i of the act and applies only to domestic arbitration and international arbitration in india and no exceptions are carved out in respect of foreign awards. mr. thakore further submitted that section 48 is to be interpreted narrowly and by virtue of amendment in section 48 of the act, now issues are kept beyond doubt. it was further contended that this court cannot go into the correctness of the award and the case of the respondent that it was back to back contract/order, and that it could have been sold in open market cannot be examined by this court. hc-nic page 23 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order 55. mr. thakore further contended that the other contentions raised as regards profiteering that the tribunal has given more than six times than what is suffered by the petitioner and that the award is against the fundamental policy of indian law, morality and justice, is to be given a narrow meaning once the tribunal has correctly examined as per the english law and found that no further enquiry would be necessary. it was therefore submitted that this court may be pleased to hold that the awards in question are enforceable and are not against the provisions of section 48(2) of the act and declare it to be decree of this court. 56. mr. mihir thakore, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has also relied upon the provisions of section 51(3) of the uk sale of goods act and the relevant observations made by the gafta appellate board and more particularly paragraphs 10.3 to 10.5, 10.12 to 10.17 and has contended that the findings given in the awards cannot be reviewed on the ground of fundamental policy of indian law particularly in view of the explanation 2 of section 48(2) of the act and has further referred to and relied upon the order passed by the gafta appellate board on the plea of clarification by the respondents dated 26.05.2015 as well as the order passed by the queen's bench, division of london on 14.07.2015. 57. it was further contended that even the reliance hc-nic page 24 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order placed upon the judgment of bunge vs. nidera of the queen's bench was found by the bench that the said case would not apply to the arbitration proceedings before gafta. referring to section 48(1)(a), 48(1)(b)(c)(d)(e) as well as section 48(2)(a), section 48(2)(b) of the act, it was submitted that the scope of inquiry by this court would not permit or allow a review on merits of the dispute and the scope of inquiry on the ground of public policy under section 48 of the act in relation to foreign award is much narrower than public policy as contained under section 34 of the act, which deals with domestic awards and not foreign awards. 58. it was also submitted that the judgment in the case of saw pipes (supra) would not apply to the present case as the hon'ble apex court has considered the domestic award and the provisions of section 34 of the act for enforcement of such domestic award. 59. relying upon the amendment, whereby explanations 1 and 2 have been inserted w.e.f. 23.10.2015, it was contended that in view of such amendment, the scope of inquiry by this court on the ground of public policy has further become limited and the awards which are found to be in conflict with the public policy of india where the making of the awards was induced by fraud or corruption or is violative of sections 75 or 81 of the act, or the hc-nic page 25 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order award is in contravention of the fundamental policy of indian law, or is in contravention with the most basic notions of morality and justice can be reviewed by this court. it was further submitted that on the contrary, it has been provided that whether there is contravention in the public policy in indian shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute. thus, the scope and purview of section 48 is very limited. 60. it was further submitted that the awards are in consonance with the public policy of the india as provided under section 48(2)(b) of the act. 61. it was contended that the parties had agreed that the english law will apply. the gafta tribunal has correctly applied section 51(3) of the uk sale of goods act and the awards cannot be said to be contrary to the fundamental policy of india. 62. it was further submitted that the contention raised by the respondent before this court that only direct loss suffered by the petitioner as a result of the breach of contract as prescribed under section 51(2) of the uk sale of goods act executed by it with its korean sub­buyer and other direct losses cannot be included and the difference in the value cannot be awarded as provided under section 51(3) of the act cannot be re­agitated before this court as the same is a question of fact and the same would amount to hc-nic page 26 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order review of the merits of the dispute which is not permissible under section 48(2) of the act. it was submitted that gafta tribunal has correctly applied as provided under section 51(3) of the uk sales of goods act, which has become final right upto the queen's bench as referred to hereinabove, which cannot be reviewed as the same would amount to review on merits of the dispute. 63. it was also contended that the contention raised by the respondents that the enforcement of the present awards would lead to a situation of unjust enrichment making the awards unenforceable by this court as the same would be contrary to the fundamental policy of indian law as it is in violation of sections 73 and 74 of the indian contract act would not amount to violation of fundamental policy of india. 64. the learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment of the delhi high court in the case of cruz city mauritius holdings v. unitech ltd. reported in (2017) scc online del. 7810 and other decisions of various high court to buttress his argument that mere violation of provision of indian law would not amount to violation of fundamental policy of india. it has been contended that the respondents have failed to demonstrate that the awards amount to violation fundamental policy of india and merely because the tribunal has held that section 51(3) of the hc-nic page 27 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order uk sale of goods act applies, which is a different measure of determination of loss, it cannot be said that the awards are contrary to the fundamental policy of indian law and the most basic principles of justice and morality. 65. relying upon the provisions of section 28(1)(b) clause (1) of the act, it was submitted that the act itself mandates that an arbitral tribunal of an international commercial arbitration in india is required to apply the law governing the disputes as that is chosen by the parties and therefore, it was contended that the enforcement of the award would not be against the most basic principles of justice and morality. the learned counsel for the petitioner has further relied upon the judgments of the bombay high court as well as delhi high court in the case of etizen bulk & ashapura minechem ltd (2016(2) arblr 113(bom), m/s. lois dreyfus commodities v. sakuma exports ltd (2015 6 bom cr 258), sideralba s.p. a v. shree precoated steels ltd (arbitration petition no.84 of 2013, high court of bombay) and xstrata coal marketing v. dalmia bharat (cement) ltd (236 (2017) dlt 524) to buttress his argument that the issue of damages or unjust enrichment amounts to a review of the merits of the disputes and is beyond the scope of purview permitted under section 48 of the act. 66. on the aforesaid grounds, it was therefore hc-nic page 28 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that 9 arbitration awards are appropriate, just and proper and enforceable under the indian law. 67. mr. soparkar, learned counsel for the respondents has reiterated the arguments which were already canvassed. mr. soparkar further contended that the present awards are not merely violative of section 73 of the indian contract act but it is also such that it would shock the conscience of the court and has given further example, which is enumerated as below ­ if a agrees to sell the goods to b at rs.95 and b would be selling it further to c, to make a profit of rs.3 on it, and deposits rs.2 with c as security; then in the event of default by a, b ought to be awarded a maximum compensation of rs.5 (i.e. rs. 3 towards loss of profit and rs.2 towards forfeiture of deposit by c). however, if b is awarded a compensation of rs.105, by calculating the difference between the market price (say rs. 200 on the date of default) and the contract price (i.e. rs.95), the b would be making a colossal profit out of the breach of contract by a, which cannot be permitted. even if the contract would have been performed by a, then b would have earned profit of rs.3 and not rs.105. grant of rs.105 to b, would be something which would shock the conscience of this hon'ble court and would be against the public policy of india. 68. to buttress the aforesaid argument, mr. soparkar has relied upon the judgment of the apex court in the case of gherulal parekh v. mahadeodas maiya hc-nic page 29 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order reported in air 1959 sc 781 and in the case of murlidhar agarwal vs. state of up (1974 2 scc 472 and central inlald water vs. brojo nath ganguly reported in 1986 (2) scc 156. 69. it was also further contended that the respondents are not seeking review of the award passed by the arbitral tribunal and by explanations 1 and 2 of section 48(2), the only limitation imposed by the legislature is not to enter into merits of the award. however, this court has jurisdiction to determine whether the foreign award is violative of fundamental policy of india or not and further it was contended that there is no limitation imposed upon by the legislature for entering into the merits of the award by this court and that this court has jurisdiction to test the award on the ground of morality and justice and this court has to decide as to what would be just and moral. 70. it was submitted that the argument of the petitioner that if the respondent would have supplied goods then they would have breached the contracts with the korean buyers and would have sold the said goods at the market price, thereby making a profit out of it, is nothing but a speculative argument and cannot be considered by this court and it was therefore submitted that execution of the awards deserves to be refused by this court in view of the objections raised by hc-nic page 30 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order the respondents in the objections filed under sections 47 and 48 of the act as well as the submissions made. 71. no other or further submissions have been made and as noted hereinabove, the aforesaid discussion also includes written submissions which are submitted by both the sides. 72. before reverting to the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties, it would be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of the act ­ the arbitration & conciliation act, 1996 section 2(1)(f) 'international commercial arbitration' means an arbitration relating to disputes arising out of legal relationships, whether contractual or not, considered as commercial under the law in force in indian and where at least one of the parties is­ (i)an individual who is a national of, or habitually resident in, any country other than india; or (ii) a body corporate which is incorporated in any country other than india; (iii) an association or a body of individuals whose central management and

the award is a foreign award. (2) if the award or agreement to be produced under sub­section (1) is in a foreign language, the party seeking to enforce the award shall produce a translation into english certified as correct by a diplomatic or consular agent of the country to which that party belongs or certified as correct in such other manner as may be sufficient according to the law in force in india. explanation.--in this section and in the sections following, \"court\" means the high court having original jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject­ matter of the arbitral award if the same had been the subject­matter of a suit on its original civil jurisdiction and in other cases, in the high court having jurisdiction to hear appeals from decrees of courts subordinate to such high court]. section 48. conditions for enforcement of foreign awards.-hc-nic page 32 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order (1) enforcement of a foreign award may be refused, at the request of the party against whom it is invoked, only if that party furnishes to the court proof that-(a) the parties to the agreement referred to in section 44 were, under the law applicable to them, under some incapacity, or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made; or (b) the party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (c) the award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration: provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that part of the award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be enforced; or (d) the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or (e) the award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made. hc-nic page 33 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order (2) enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the court finds that-(a) the subject­matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of india; or (b) the enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of india. explanation 1.--for the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the public policy of india, only if,­ (i)the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81; or (ii)it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law; or (iii)it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice. explanation 2.­ for the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute. (3) if an application for the setting aside or suspension of the award has been made to a competent authority referred to in clause (e) of sub­section (1) the court may, if it considers it proper, adjourn the decision on the enforcement of the award and may also, on the application of the party claiming enforcement of the award, order the other party to give suitable security.\" sale of goods act, 1979 section 51.

(2)the measure of damages is estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the seller's breach of contract. (3) where there is an available market for the goods in question the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered or (if no time was fixed) at the time of the refusal to deliver.\" 73. in order to understand the controversy with which this court is concerned at this stage is that, admittedly there were contracts between the petitioner and the respondent no.1 in particular, which is described in detail hereinabove. it is also an admitted position that as per the said contract, the parties have agreed that \"seat of arbitration would be london\". thus, the parties as per the arbitration clause provided in the contract, were relegated to arbitration as per the gafta rules, which culminated into awards in origin by three arbitrators dated 28.04.2014. it is also an admitted position that the respondents preferred appeals challenging the original awards before the board of appeal, gafta, london and the appellate board of gafta after hearing the parties was pleased to uphold all the original awards on 16.04.2015. thereafter, the respondents approached gafta appeal board seeking hc-nic page 35 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order clarification of the awards which came to be rejected by gafta appellate board vide order/communication dated 26.05.2015. the respondents carried the same further by filing appeals as provided under sections 68 and 69 of the english arbitration & conciliation act, 1996 before the high court of justice queen's division commercial court and the hon'ble queen's bench division of london high court by an order dated 14.07.2015 refused leave to appeal the awards to the respondents. the respondents thereafter approached the court of appeal in london against the order passed by the hon'ble queen's bench division of london high court and by a final order dated 04.02.2016, the court of appeal in london refused the appeal against the order dated 14.07.2015 and also disallowed the plea of the respondents to prefer an appeal before the supreme court of united kingdom. 74. at the outset, it deserves to be noted that the learned counsel for the respondents did raise objection that the applications did not satisfy the requirement of section 47. at this stage, it deserves to be noted that the petitioner had approached the hon'ble division bench of this court under section 15(1) of the commercial court act and the hon'ble division of the this court held that the execution petitions which were pending before the district court at gandhidham should be transferred to this court under hc-nic page 36 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order commercial court, commercial division and commercial appellate division of the high courts act, 2015. 75. it further deserves to be noted that the respondent herein contended that the applications are not maintainable as the conditions of section 47 of the act are not satisfied, more particularly as the petitioner did not produce the certified copy of the award or notarized copy of the award. the applicants preferred civil application (o.j) no.400/2017 and allied applications and have produced notarized copies of the awards and this hon'ble court has passed the following order: \"heard learned counsels appearing for the parties. by this application, the applicant has prayed for brining on record the true copy of the award passed by the arbitral tribunal. having heard learned counsels for the parties, the applications are allowed. the true copy of award in each application is taken on record. applications disposed of accordingly.\" 76. it may be noted that section 47 lays down the procedural requirement, which the party has applied for enforcement of a foreign award and such provision is based upon article iv of newyork convention. it also deserves to be noted that before effective stage of execution, the duly notarised copy has been brought on record. hc-nic page 37 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order 77. in light of the aforesaid therefore, it cannot be said that the conditions of the said sections are not satisfied. 78. upon considering the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties and on perusal of the record and proceedings as well as the judgments which are relied upon by the learned counsel appearing for the respective parties, it is an admitted position that the parties entered into a contract for supply of indian rapeseed meal and in the arbitration clause, it is clearly provided that the seat of arbitration would be at london and it would be according to the gafta 125 arbitration rules and the same would be governed by english law. 79. both the sides have taken this court to the relevant observations made by the learned arbitrators as well as arbitral board. the contention raised by the respondent that actual loss is far less than what is granted is to be seen and appreciated in light of the provisions of section 51 of the uk sale goods act as the parties had agreed that the english law will apply. it is a matter of record that the findings arrived at by the arbitration tribunal and the conclusion arrived at by the appellate board entirely touches the merits of the case. as far as merits are concerned, the same cannot be re­ appreciated by this court while dealing with the hc-nic page 38 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order execution petitions with the indian law and the findings given are on interpretation of facts of the case and as per the english law and this court cannot review the same on merits and its validity cannot be examined by this court in these proceedings and thus, as per the agreement between the parties, for applicability of english law, the same is analysed by the courts in england. 80. therefore, in opinion of this court, the awards in question which are foreign awards can be examined in light of the provisions of section 48 of the act only. the aforesaid view is also found from the explanation 2 of section 48(2) of the act that while examining whether there is contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law, the same shall not entail review on merits. 81. the learned counsel for the respondents has also contended that the high court of justice queen's division commercial court has not confirmed the findings of the tribunal as well as the arbitration appellate board, but has refused leave as it was found that the tribunal was not obviously wrong. at this juncture, reference be made to the provisions of section 69 of the uk arbitration act, which provides for leave to appeal. from bare reading of the order of the queen's bench division court of appeal, it is observed that the awards were not obviously hc-nic page 39 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order wrong. therefore, it cannot be said that the awards have not become final and thus, the appeal preferred by the respondent was disallowed and as per the english law the awards have become final. the facts clearly establish that the respondent company exhausted all remedies that were available for challenging the awards/order­in­ origin, available under english law. 82. the objections raised by the learned counsel for the respondents are on the following grounds in light of the provisions of section 48 of the act­ 1. that the impugned awards are against the fundamental public policy of indian law. 2. the awards are in contravention to the public policy of indian law. 3. that the awards are against the basic principles of morality and justice and are in flagrant and gross breach of the same. 4. that it is such that it would shock the conscience of this court. 5. that the awards are exhaustive in nature and no one can profit from breach of the contract and is against the provisions of section 73 of the indian contract act and violative of fundamental policy of indian law. 6. that the damages which are awarded are more hc-nic page 40 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order than the actual loss. 7. that by the impugned awards, damages which are awarded are irrational and against the principles of damages as are accepted by indian law. 83. in light of the aforesaid facts which arise in this group of petitions and as contended by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents in particular, this court is therefore called upon to examine on the aspect that the enforcement of the awards in question would be contrary to public policy of india. it is also further contended by the learned counsel for the respondents based upon the provisions of section 48(2) explanation 1 clause (2) that the impugned awards are in contravention with the fundamental policy of india and clause (3), that it is in conflict with basic notion of morality and justice. section 48 came to be amended and explanations 1 and 2 as it stands today, have been substituted by act 3 of 2016 w.e.f. 23.10.2015 and explanation 2 further provides that the test as to whether there is contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law shall not entail a review on merits of the dispute. 84. the first limb of argument which is put forward by the learned counsel for the respondents is to the effect that the impugned awards are contrary to the public policy of india. the basis for hc-nic page 41 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order that contention is that the awards prescribe for more than actual loss. it is also further contended that the high court of justice queen's division commercial court has only refused to entertain the appeal only by holding that the view taken by the arbitral board is not obviously wrong. it is also contended that the impugned awards are violative of indian law inasmuch as that against direct loss of 3 million dollars and total consequential loss of 5 million dollars for 14 contracts, the petitioner is being compensated by damages in sum of 13 million dollars for 9 contracts and the same is fundamentally in violation of indian jurisprudence wherein compensation is always to make good damages suffered and not profiteering. 85. in furtherance of the said contention it is also contended by the respondents that if the impugned awards are permitted to be implemented then the same would amount to unjust enrichment. it was also further contended that though the petitioner has not gone to market, cannot be permitted to profiteer and as it was back to back contract, only loss of profit can be awarded and therefore, it is against the fundamental policy of indian law and also against morality and justice. the respondents have also contended that it is also in breach of section 73 of the indian contract act and therefore it is in violation of fundamental policy of indian law and the awards hc-nic page 42 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order are exhaustive in nature which would shock the conscience of this court. relying upon the judgments which are dealt with in this judgment separately, it is contended that it is not permissible for any judicial authority to award damages by just applying the same measure suggested by the claimant which may be applied in given facts of case and in fact the actual damages found on such appreciation of evidence only be granted. 86. over and above, it is evident from the contentions which are raised by the respondents that they have on basis of the findings arrived at by the arbitration tribunal as well as appellate board, it is contended that the impugned awards are against the fundamental policy of indian law and therefore, are not enforceable and cannot be deemed to be a decree of this court and the petitions are therefore required to be dismissed. 87. the aforesaid contentions are denied by the learned counsel for the petitioner and it is contended that the scope of inquiry under section 48 of the act is limited and the same does not allow a review of the merits of the dispute. it is also contended that mere violation of sections 73 and 74 of the indian contract act would not amount to violation of fundamental policy of indian law. it is also contended that the hc-nic page 43 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order contentions raised by the respondents that the awards would allow unjust enrichment and would allow review of the merits is wholly misplaced and therefore, it is contended that 9 arbitration awards are appropriate, just and proper and enforceable under indian law. thus, this court cannot review the awards on merits. 88. learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment of the apex court rendered in the case of fuerst day lawson ltd. vs. jindal exports ltd., reported in [(2001) 6 scc 356], wherein the apex court in paragraphs 31 and 32 has observed thus:­ \"31. prior to the enforcement of the act, the law of arbitration in this country was substantially contained in three enactments namely (1) the arbitration act, 1940, (2) the arbitration (protocol and convention) act, 1937 and (3) the foreign awards (recognition and enforcement) act, 1961. a party holding a foreign award was required to take recourse to these enactments. preamble of the act makes it abundantly clear that it aims at to consolidate and amend indian laws relating to domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. the object of the act is to minimize supervisory role of court and to give speedy justice. in this view, the stage of approaching court for making award a rule of court as required in arbitration act, 1940 is dispensed with in the present act. if the argument of the respondent is accepted, one of the objects of the act will be frustratedand defeated. under the old act, after making award and prior to hc-nic page 44 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order execution, there was a procedure for filing and making an award a rule of court i.e. a decree. since the object of the act is to provide speedy and alternative solution of the dispute, the same procedure cannot be insisted under the new act when it is advisedly eliminated. if separate proceedings are to be taken, one for deciding the enforceability of a foreign award and the other thereafter for execution, it would only contribute to protracting the litigation and adding to the sufferings of a litigant in terms of money, time and energy. avoiding such difficulties is one of the objects of the act as can be gathered from the scheme of the act and particularly looking to the provisions contained in sections 46 to 49 in relation to enforcement of foreign award. in para 40 of the thyssen judgment already extracted above, it is stated that as a matter of fact, there is not much difference between the provisions of the 1961 act and the act in the matter of enforcement of foreign award. the only difference as found is that while under the foreign award act a decree follows, under the new act the foreign award is already stamped as the decree. thus, in our view, a party holding foreign award can apply for enforcement of it but the court before taking further effective steps for the execution of the award has to proceed in accordance with sections 47 to 49. in one proceeding there may be different stages. in the first stage the court may have to decide about the enforceability of the award having regard to the requirement of the said provisions. once the court decides that foreign award is enforceable, it can proceed to take further effective steps for execution of the same. there arises no question of making foreign award as a rule of court/decree again. if the object and purpose can be served in the same proceedings, in our view, there is no need to take two separate proceedings resulting hc-nic page 45 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order in multiplicity of litigation. it is also clear from objectives contained in para 4 of the st atement of objects and reasons, sections 47 to 49 and scheme of the act that every final arbitral award is to be enforced as if it were a decree of the court. the submission that the execution petition could not be permitted to convert as an application under section 47 is technical and is of no consequence in the view we have taken. in our opinion, for enforcement of foreign award there is no need to take separate proceedings, one for deciding the enforceability of the award to make rule of the court or decree and the other to take up execution thereafter. in one proceeding, as already stated above, the court enforcing a foreign award can deal with the entire matter. even otherwise, this procedure does not prejudice a party in the light of what is stated in para 40 of the thyssen judgment. 32. part ii of the act relates to enforcement of certain foreign awards. chapter 1 of this part deals with new york convention awards. section 46 of the act speaks as to when a foreign award is binding. section 47 states as to what evidence the party applying for the enforcement of a foreign award should produce before the court. section 48 states as to the conditions for enforcement of foreign awards. as per section 49, if the court is satisfied that a foreign award is enforceable under this chapter, the award shall be deemed to be a decree of that court and that court has to proceed further to execute the foreign award as a decree of that court. if the argument advanced on behalf of the respondent is accepted, the very purpose of the act in regard to speedy and effective execution of foreign award will be defeated. thus none of the contentions urged on behalf of the respondent merit acceptance so as to uphold the impugned judgment and order. we have no hc-nic page 46 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order hesitation or impediment in concluding that the impugned judgment and order cannot be sustained.\" 89. the apex court in the case of renusagar power co. ltd. (supra), has observed thus:­ 40. we are, therefore, of the opinion that the enforcement of the arbitral award is not barred by s. 7(1)(a)(ii) of the foreign awards act on the ground that renusagar was unable to present its case before the arbitral tribunal. iii. objection to the enforceability of the award on the ground that it is contrary to the public policy of the state of new york. 41. shri venugopal has urged that although under sub­clause (b) of clause (2) of art. v of the new york convention the recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award can be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that the recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country, i.e., the country where the award is sought to be enforced, a departure has been made in s. 7(i)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act which prescribes that the foreign award may not be enforced under the said act if the court dealing with the case is satisfied that the enforcement of the award would be contrary to public policy. the submission of shri venugopal is that in s. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the act. the parliament has deliberately refrained from using the words \"public policy of india\" which implies that the words \"public policy\" are not restricted to the public policy of india but would cover the public policy of the country whose law governs the contract or of the country of the place of arbitration and the enforcement of an award would be refused if it is hc-nic page 47 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order contrary to such public policy. in this context shri venugopal has invited our attention to the provisions of s. 7(1) of the arbitration (protocol and convention) act, 1937 wherein the words used are \"and enforcement thereof must not be contrary to the public policy or law of india\". according to shri venugopal while under the 1937 act, objections to enforcement are limited to the public policy of india or law of india, there is no such limitation in s. 7(l)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act. shri venugopal has also placed reliance on the decision of this court in v/o tractoroexport. moscow v. tarapore and co., (1970) 3 scr 53 : (air 1971 sc 1) wherein this court has held that there was clear deviation from the rigid and strict rule that the courts must stay a suit whenever an international commercial arbitration as contemplated by the protocol and the conventions, was to take place and that it was open to the legislature to deviate from the terms of the protocol and the convention and that it appears to have given only a limited effect to the provisions of the 1958 convention. we find it difficult to accept this contention. it cannot be held that by not using the words \"public policy of india\" and only using the words \"public policy\" in s. 7(l)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act, parliament intended to 'deviate from the provisions of the new york convention contained in art. v(2)(b) which uses the words \"public policy of that country\" implying public policy of the country where recognition and enforcement is sought. that parliament did not intend to deviate from the terms of the new york convention is borne out by the amendment which was introduced in the act by act 47 of 1973 after the decision of this court in tractoroexport case (supra) whereby s. 3 was substituted to bring it in accord with the provisions of the new york convention. the foreign awards act has been enacted to give hc-nic page 48 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order effect to the new york convention which seeks to remedy the defects in the geneva convention of 1927 that hampered the speedy settlement of disputes rough arbitration. the foreign awards act therefore, intended to reduce the time taken in recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. the new york contention seeks to achieve this objective by dispensing with the requirement of the leave enforce the award by the courts where the ward is made and thereby avoid the problem of \"double exequatur\". it also restricts the cope of enquiry before the court enforcing he award by eliminating the requirement that he award should not be contrary to the principals of the law of the country in which it sought to be relied upon. enlarging the field of enquiry to include public policy of the courts whose law governs the contract or oil he country of place of arbitration, would run counter to the expressed intent of the legislation. 42. with regard to the provisions of the arbitration (protocol and convention) act, 937, it may be stated that s. 7(1) of the said act, as originally enacted. read as under : \"7. conditions for enforcement of foreign awards. ­(1) in order that a foreign ward may be enforceable under this act it must have ­ (a) been made in pursuance of an agreement for arbitration which was valid under he law by which it was governed, (b) been made by the tribunal provided for n the agreement or constituted in manner greed upon by the parties, (c) been made in conformity with the law covering with the arbitration procedure., (d) become final the country in which it was made, hc-nic page 49 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order (e) been in respect of a matter which may lawfully be referred to arbitration under the law of british india, and the enforcement thereof must not be contrary to the public policy or the law of british india. (2) a foreign award shall not be enforceable under this act if the court dealing with the case is satisfied that­ (a) the award has been annulled in the country in which it was made, or (b) the party against whom it is sought to enforce the award was not given notice of the arbitration proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to present his case, or was under some legal incapacity and was not properly represented or, (c) the award does not deal with all the questions referred or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the agreement for arbitration : provided that, if the award does not deal with all questions referred the court may, if it thinks fit, either postpone the enforcement of the award or order its enforcement subject to the giving of such security by the person seeking to enforce it as the court may think fit. (3) if a party seeking to resist the enforcement of a foreign award proves that there is any ground other than the non­ existence of the conditions specified in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of sub­sec. (1), or the existence of the conditions specified in clauses (b) and (c) of sub­sec. (2), entitling him to contest the validity of the award, the court may, if it thinks fit, either refuse to enforce the award or adjourn the hearing until after the expiration of such period as appears to the court to be reasonably sufficient to enable hc-nic page 50 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order that party to take the necessary steps to have the award annulled by the competent tribunal.\" 43. by indian independence (adaptation of central acts and ordinances) order 1948, the words \"british india\" were substituted by the words \"the provinces\", which words were substituted by the words \"the states\" by the adaptation of laws order, 1950. by part b states (laws) act, 1951, the words \"the states\" were substituted by the word \"india\". the aforesaid amendments introduced from time to time indicate that the words \"public policy\" and \"the law of india\" are independent of each other and the words \"public policy\" are not qualified by the words \"of india\" which follow the word \"law\" because there was no separate public policy for each province or state in india. this means that even in the protocol and convention act of 1937 the legislature had used the words \"public policy\" only and by the said words it was intended to mean \"the public policy of india\". the new york convention has further curtailed the scope of enquiry by excluding contravention of law of the court in which the award is sought to be enforced as a ground for refusing recognition and enforcement of a foreign award. the words \"law of india\" have, therefore, been omitted in s. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act. it cannot, therefore, be said that by using the words \"public policy\" only s. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the. foreign awards act seeks to make a departure from the provisions contained in the protocol and convention act of 1937 and, by using the words \"public policy\". without any qualification, parliament intended to broaden the scope of enquiry so as to cover public policy of other countries, i.e., the country whose law governs the contract or the country of the place of arbitration. in the u.k., the arbitration act, 1975 has been enacted to give effect to the provisions of hc-nic page 51 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order the new york convention. section 5(3) of the said act provides as under : \"enforcement of a convention award may also be refused if the award is in respect of a matter which is not capable of settlement by arbitration, or if it would be contrary to public policy to enforce the award.\" 45. we are, therefore, of the view that the words \"public policy\" used in s. 7(l)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act refer to the public policy of india and the recognition and enforcement of the award of the arbitral tribunal cannot be questioned on the ground that it is contrary to the public policy of the state of new york. 47. the need for applying the touchstone of public policy has been thus explained by sir william holdsworth ­ \"in fact, a body of law like the common law, which has grown up gradually with the growth of the nation, necessarily acquires some fixed principles, and if it is to maintain these principles it must be able, on the ground of public policy or some other like ground, to suppress practices which, under ever new disguises, seek to weaken or negative them\". (history of english law, vol. iii p. 55). 48. since the doctrine of public policy is somewhat open­textured and flexible, judges in england have shown certain degree of reluctance to invoke it in domestic law. there are two conflicting positions which are referred as the 'narrow view' and the 'broad view'. according to the narrow view courts cannot create new heads of public policy whereas the broad view countenances judicial law making in this areas. (see chitty on contracts, 26th ed. vol. i, para 1133, pp. 685­686). similar is the trend of the decision in india. in gherulal parakh v. mahadeodas maiya, 1959 suppl (2) scr 392: (air 1959 sc 781) this court favoured the hc-nic page 52 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order narrow view when it said : \" .though the heads are not closed and though theoretically it may be permissible to evolve a new head under exceptional circumstances of a changing world, it is admissible in the interest of stability of society not to make any attempt to discover new heads in these days\" (p. 440) (of scr) : (at p. 795 of air). 49. in later decisions this court has, however, leaned towards the broad view. (see murlidhar agarwal v. state of u.p. (1975) 1 scr 575 at p. 584 : (air 1974 sc 1924 at p. 1930) : central inland water transport corporation v. brojo nath ganguly (supra) (1986 (2) scr 278 at p. 373 : (air 1986 sc 1571 at p. 1612); rattanchand hira chand v. askar nawaz jung (1991)3 scc 67 at pp. 76­77 : (1991 air scw 496 at pp. 502­03). 50. in the field of private international law, courts refuse to apply a rule of foreign law or recognise a foreign judgment or a foreign arbitral award if it is found that the same is contrary to the public policy of the country in which it is sought to be invoked or enforced. the english courts follow the following principles: \"exceptionally, the english court will not enforce or recognise a right conferred or a duty imposed by a foreign law where, on the facts of the particular case, enforcement or, as the case may be, recognition, would be contrary to a fundamental policy of english law. the court has, therefore, refused in certain cases to apply foreign law where to do so would in the particular circumstances be contrary to the interests of the united kingdom or contrary to justice or morality\". (see halsbury's laws of england, iv ed., vol. 8, para 418). 57. in deutsche schachtbau­und tiefbohrgesellschaft m.b.h. v. r.as al­ khaimah national oil co. (1987) 2 all er hc-nic page 53 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order 769, decided by the court of appeal. sir john donaldson m.r. has said : \"consideration of public policy can never be exhaustively defined, hut they should be approached with extreme caution. as burrough j. remarked in richardson v. mellish, (1824) 2 bing 229 at 252, (1824­34) all er rep 258 at 266. it is never argued at all but when other points fail. it has to be shown that there is some element of illegality or that the enforcement of the award would be clearly injurious to the public good or, possibly, that enforcement would be wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public on whose behalf the powers of the state are exercised. 63.in view of the absence of a workable definition of \"international public policy\" we find it difficult to construe the expression \"public policy\" in article v(2) (b) of the new york convention to mean international public policy. in our opinion the said expression must be construed to mean the doctrine of public policy as applied by the courts in which the foreign award is sought to be enforced. consequently, the expression 'public policy' in section 7(l)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act means the doctrine of public policy as applied by the courts in india. this raises the question whether the narrower concept of public policy as applicable in the field of public international law should be applied or the wider concept of public policy as applicable in the field of municipal law. 65. this would imply that the defence of 'public policy which is permissible under s. 7(l)(b)(ii) should be construed narrowly. in this context, it would also be of relevance to mention that under article i(e) of the geneva convention act of 1927, it is permissible to raise objection to the enforcement of arbitral award on the ground hc-nic page 54 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order that the recognition or enforcement of the award is contrary to the public policy or to the principles of the law of the country in which it is sought to be relied upon. to the same effect is the provision in s. 7(1) of the protocol and convention act of 1937 which requires that the enforcement of the foreign award must not be contrary to the public policy or the law of india. since the expression \"public policy\" covers the field not covered by the words \"and the law of india\" which follow the said expression, contravention of law alone will not attract the bar of public policy and something more than contravention of law is required. 66. article v(2)(b) of the new york convention of 1958 and section 7 (l)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act do not postulate refusal of recognition and enforcement of a foreign award on the ground that it is contrary to the law of the country of enforcement and the ground of challenge is confined to the recognition and enforcement being contrary to the public policy of the country in which the award is set to be enforced. there is nothing to indicate that the expression \"public policy\" in article v(2)(b) of the new york convention and section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act is not used in the same sense in which it was used in article 1(c) of the geneva convention of 1927 and section 7(l) of the protocol and convention act of 1937. this would mean that \"public policy\" in section 7(l)(b)(ii) has been used in a narrower sense and in order to attract the bar of public policy the enforcement of the award must invoke something more than the violation of the law of india. since the foreign awards act is concerned with recognition and enforcement of foreign awards which are governed by the principles of private international law, the expression \"public policy\" in section 7(l)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act must necessarily be hc-nic page 55 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order construed in the sense the doctrine of public policy is applied in the field of private international law. applying the said criteria it must be held that the enforcement of a foreign award would be refused on the ground that it is contrary to public policy if such enforcement would be contrary to (i) fundamental policy of indian law or (ii) the interests of india or (iii) justice or morality. 99. in indian law the principle of unjust enrichment finds recognition in the indian contract act, 1872 (ss. 70 and 72). 100. we do not consider it necessary to go into the question whether the principle of unjust enrichment is a part of the public policy of india since we are of the opinion that even if it be assumed that unjust enrichment is contrary to public policy of india, renusagar cannot succeed because the unjust enrichment must relate to the enforcement of the award and not to its merits in view of the limited scope of enquiry in proceedings for the enforcement of a foreign award under the foreign awards act. the objections raised by renusagar based on unjust enrichment do not relate to the enforcement of the award because it is not the case of renusagar that general electric has already received the amount awarded under the arbitration award and is seeking to obtain enforcement of the award to obtain further payment and would thus be unjustly enriching itself. the objections about unjust enrichment raised by renusagar go to the merits of the award, that is, with regard to the quantum awarded by the and 7, which is beyond the scope of the objections that can be raised u/s. 7(l)(b) (ii) of the foreign awards act. to hold otherwise would mean that in every case where the arbitrators award an amount which is higher than the amount that should have been awarded, the award would be open to hc-nic page 56 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order challenge on the ground of unjust enrichment. such a course is not permissible under the new york convention and the foreign awards act. we have, however, examined the objections raised by renusagar relating to unjust enrichment even on merits and we are not satisfied that the amounts awarded under items nos. 2, 3, 4 and 7 are so excessive as to result in unjust enrichment of general electric.\" 90. similarly, the apex court in the case of shri lal mahal ltd. (supra), has considered the provisions of section 48 of the act in relation to foreign award and has observed thus:­ \"19. having regard to clause (b) of sub­ section (2) of section 48 of the 1996 act, we shall immediately examine what is the scope of enquiry before the court in which foreign award, as defined in section 44, is sought to be enforced. this has become necessary as on behalf of the appellant it was vehemently contended that in light of the two decisions of this court in saw pipes1 and phulchand exports2, the court can refuse to enforce a foreign award if it is contrary to the contract between the parties and/or is patently illegal. it was argued by mr. rohinton f. nariman, learned senior counsel for the appellant, that the expression \"public policy of india\" in section 48(2)(b) is an expression of wider import than the expression \"public policy\" in section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards (recognition and enforcement) act, 1961. the expansive construction given by this court to the term \"public policy of india\" in saw pipes1 must also apply to the use of the same term \"public policy of india\" in section 48(2)(b). 20. mr. jayant k. mehta, learned counsel hc-nic page 57 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order for the respondent, on the other hand, placed heavy reliance upon the decision of this court in renusagar3 and submitted that what has been stated by this court while interpreting section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act in that case is equally applicable to section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 act and the expression 1 oil and natural gas corporation \"public policy of india\" in section 48(2)(b) must receive narrow meaning than section 34. saw pipes1 never meant to give wider meaning to the expression, \"public policy of india\" insofar as section 48 was concerned. according to mr. jayant k. mehta, phulchand exports2 does not hold that all that is found in paragraph 74 in saw pipes1 is applicable to section 48(2) (b). he argued that in any case both saw pipes1 and phulchand exports2 are decisions by a two­judge bench of this court whereas renusagar3 is a decision of three­judge bench and if there is any inconsistency in the decisions of this court in saw pipes1 and phulchand exports2 on the one hand and renusagar3 on the other, renusagar3 must prevail as this is a decision by the larger bench. 21. the three decisions of this court in renusagar3, saw pipes and phulchand exports need a careful and close examination by us. we shall first deal with renusagar. 22. it is not necessary to narrate in detail the facts in renusagar3 . suffice it to say that arbitral tribunal, gafta in paris passed an award in favour of general electric company (gec) against renusagar. gec sought to enforce the award passed in its favour by filing an arbitration petition under section 5 of the foreign awards act in the bombay high court. renusagar contested the proceedings for enforcement of the award filed by gec in the bombay high court on diverse grounds. inter alia, one of the objections raised by renusagar was that the hc-nic page 58 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order enforcement of the award was contrary to the public policy of india. the single judge of the bombay high court overruled the objections of renusagar. it was held that the award was enforceable and on that basis a decree in terms of the award was drawn. renusagar filed an intra­court appeal but that was dismissed as not maintainable. it was from these orders that the matter reached this court. on behalf of the parties, multifold arguments were made. a three­judge bench of this court noticed diverse provisions, including section 7(1) (b)(ii) of the foreign awards act which provided that a foreign award may not be enforced if the court dealing with the case was satisfied that the enforcement of the award would be contrary to public policy. 23. of the many questions framed for determination, the two questions under consideration were; one, \"does section 7(1) (b)(ii) of the foreign awards act preclude enforcement of the award of the arbitral tribunal, gafta for the reason that the said award is contrary to the public policy of the state of new york?\" and the other \"what is meant by public policy in section 7(1)(b) (ii) of the foreign awards act?\". this court held that the words \"public policy\" used in section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act meant public policy of india. the argument that the recognition and enforcement of the award of the arbitral tribunal, gafta can be questioned on the ground that it is contrary to the public policy of the state of new york was negated. a clear and fine distinction was drawn by this court while applying the rule of public policy between a matter governed by domestic laws and a matter involving conflict of laws. it has been held in unambiguous terms that the application of the doctrine of \"public policy\"in the field of conflict of laws is more limited than that in the domestic law and the courts are slower to hc-nic page 59 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order invoke public policy in cases involving a foreign element than when purely municipal legal issues are involved. 24. explaining the concept of \"public policy\" vis­a­vis the enforcement of foreign awards in renusagar , this court in paras 65 and 66 (pgs. 681­ 682) of the report stated: 65. this would imply that the defence of public policy which is permissible under section 7(1)(b)(ii) should be construed narrowly. in this context, it would also be of relevance to mention that under article i(e) of the geneva convention act of 1927, it is permissible to raise objection to the enforcement of arbitral award on the ground that the recognition or enforcement of the award is contrary to the public policy or to the principles of the law of the country in which it is sought to be relied upon. to the same effect is the provision in section 7(1) of the protocol & convention act of 1937 which requires that the enforcement of the foreign award must not be contrary to the public policy or the law of india. since the expression \"public policy\" covers the field not covered by the words \"and the law of india\" which follow the said expression, contravention of law alone will not attract the bar of public policy and something more than contravention of law is required. 66. . . . . . . . . this would mean that \"public policy\" in section 7(1)( b )( i i ) has been used in a narrower sense and in order to attract the bar of public policy the enforcement of the award must invoke something more than the violation of the law of india. since the foreign awards act is concerned with recognition and enforcement of foreign awards which are governed by the principles of private international law, the expression \"public policy\" in section 7(1) (b)(ii) of the foreign awards act must necessarily be construed in the sense the hc-nic page 60 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order doctrine of public policy is applied in the field of private international law. applying the said criteria it must be held that the enforcement of a foreign award would be refused on the ground that it is contrary to public policy if such enforcement would be contrary to ( i ) fundamenta lpolicy of indian law; or ( i i ) the interests of india; or ( ii i ) justice or morality. 25. in saw pipes1, the ambit and scope of the court's jurisdiction under section 34 of the 1996 act was under consideration. the issue was whether the court would have jurisdiction under section 34 to set aside an award passed by the arbitral tribunal, gafta which was patently illegal or in contravention of the provisions of the 1996 act or any other substantive law governing the parties or was against the terms of the contract. this court considered the meaning that could be assigned to the phrase \"public policy of india\" occurring in section 34(2) (b)(ii). alive to the subtle distinction in the concept of 'enforcement of the award' and 'jurisdiction of the court in setting aside the award' and the decision of this court in renusagar3, this court held in saw pipes1 that the term \"public policy of india\" in section 34 was required to be interpreted in the context of the jurisdiction of the court where the validity of the award is challenged before it becomes final and executable in contradistinction to the enforcement of an award after it becomes final. having that distinction in view, with regard to section 34 this court said that the expression \"public policy of india\" was required to be given a wider meaning. accordingly, for the purposes of section 34, this court added a new category patent illegality for setting aside the award. while adding this category for setting aside the award on the ground of patent illegality, the court clarified that illegality must go to the root of the matter hc-nic page 61 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order and if the illegality is of trivial nature it cannot be held that award is against public policy. award could also be set aside if it was so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of the court. 26. from the discussion made by this court in saw pipes in paragraph 18 of the report, it can be safely observed that while accepting the narrow meaning given to the expression \"public policy\" in renusagar3 in the matters of enforcement of foreign award, there was departure from the said meaning for the purposes of the jurisdiction of the court in setting aside the award under section 34. 27. in our view, what has been stated by this court in renusagar3 with reference to section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act must equally apply to the ambit and scope of section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 act. in renusagar3 it has been expressly exposited that the expression \"public policy\" in section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act refers to the public policy of india. the expression \"public policy\" used in section 7(1)(b)(ii) was held to mean \"public policy of india\". a distinction in the rule of public policy between a matter governed by the domestic law and a matter involving conflict of laws has been noticed in renusagar. for all this there is no reason why renusagar should not apply as regards the scope of inquiry under section 48(2)(b). following renusagar, we think that for the purposes of section 48(2) (b), the expression \"public policy of india\" must be given narrow meaning and the enforcement of foreign award would be refused on the ground that it is contrary to public policy of india if it is covered by one of the three categories enumerated in renusagar3. although the same expression 'public policy of india' is used both in section 34(2(b)(ii) and section 48(2)(b) and hc-nic page 62 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order the concept of 'public policy in india' is same in nature in both the sections but, in our view, its application differs in degree insofar as these two sections are concerned. the application of 'public policy of india' doctrine for the purposes of section 48(2) (b) is more limited than the application of the same expression in respect of the domestic arbitral award. 28. we are not persuaded to accept the submission of mr. rohinton f. nariman that the expression \"public policy of india\" in section 48(2)(b) is an expression of wider import than the \"public policy\" in section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act. we have no hesitation in holding that renusagar3 must apply for the purposes of section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 act. insofar as the proceeding for setting aside an award under section 34 is concerned, the principles laid down in saw pipes1 would govern the scope of such proceedings. 29. we accordingly hold that enforcement of foreign award would be refused under section 48(2)(b) only if such enforcement would be contrary to (i) fundamental policy of indian law; or (2) the interests of india; or (3) justice or morality. the wider meaning given to the expression \"public policy of india\" occurring in section 34(2)(b)(ii) in saw pipes1 is not applicable where objection is raised to the enforcement of the foreign award under section 48(2)(b). 30. it is true that in phulchand exports, a two­judge bench of this court speaking through one of us (r.m. lodha, j.) accepted the submission made on behalf of the appellant therein that the meaning given to the expression \"public policy of india\" in section 34 in saw pipes1 must be applied to the same expression occurring in section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 act. however, in what we have discussed above it must be held that hc-nic page 63 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order the statement in paragraph 16 of the report that the expression \"public policy of india used in section 48(2)(b) has to be given a wider meaning and the award could be set aside, if it is patently illegal\" does not lay down correct law and is overruled. 34. mr. rohinton f. nariman vehemently contended that once parties had agreed that certification by an inspecting agency would be final, it was not open to the arbitral tribunal, gafta as well as board of appeal, to go behind that certificate and disregard it even if the certificate was inaccurate (which was not the case). in this regard, reliance was placed on two judgments of the english courts, namely, agroexport and alfred c. toepfer. he submitted that house of lords in gill & duffus has affirmed the decision in alfred c. toepfer. it was, thus, submitted that the arbitral tribunal, gafta and the board of appeal having disregarded the finality of the certificate issued by s.g.s. india, the awards were plainly contrary to contract and, therefore, not enforceable in india. it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that it was not an issue in dispute and not the buyers' case before the arbitral tribunal, gafta and/or the board of appeal that the procedure adopted by sgs india was not in conformity with the contract. it was, therefore, not open to the board of appeal to render a finding which went beyond the scope of the buyers' very case.accordingly, it was argued that the board of appeal dealt with the questions not referred to it and which were never in dispute and, therefore, award cannot be enforced because it is contrary to section 48(1)(c) of the 1996 act as well. 42. the challenge to the enforceability of the foreign awards passed by the board of appeal is mainly laid by the sellers on the ground that the board of appeal has gone beyond the terms of the contract by ignoring the certificate of quality obtained at the hc-nic page 64 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order load port from the buyers' nominated certifying agency, i.e., sgs india which was final under the contract. the board of appeal, while dealing with the question whether the sgs india certificate was issued by the contractual party and in contractual form, noticed the clause in the contract in respect of quality and condition and it held that sgs india was an acceptable certifying party under the contract. as regards the other part of that clause that provided, \"certificate and quality showed in the certificate will be the result of an average samples taken jointly at port of loading by the representatives of the sellers and the buyers\", the board of appeal recorded its finding as follows: \"the sgs india certificate shows that an inspection took place at the suppliers godowns inland, and representative samples taken. sealed samples were inspected lotwise and the cargo meeting the contractual specifications was allowed to be bagged for dispatch to kandla. continuous supervision of loading into the vessel was also carried out at the port. the samples drawn periodically were reduced and composite samples were sealed; one sealed sample of each lot was handed over to the supplier, one sealed sample of each lot was analysed by sgs and the remaining samples were retained by sgs for a period of three months unless and until instructions to the contrary were given. the analysis section of the certificate states that \"the above samples have been analysed and the weighted average pre­ shipment and shipment results are as under: we find that this procedure was not in conformity with the requirements of the contract, which required the result to be of an average sample taken at port of loading, not the weighted average of pre­shipment and shipment samples. accordingly the hc-nic page 65 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order certificate is uncontractual and its results are not final. in consequence the board is obliged to evaluate all the evidence presented, including the evidence of the uncontractual sgs india certificate to decide whether or not the goods were of the contractual description, i.e. durum wheat indian origin.\" 43. thus, having held that sgs india was the contractual agency, the board of appeal further held that the sellers failed to establish that the sgs india certificate was in contractual form. two fundamental flaws in the certification by sgs india were noted by the board of appeal, one, sgs india's certification did not follow the contractual specified mode of sampling and the other, the analysis done by sgs india was doubtful. the board of appeal then sifted the documentary evidence let in by the parties and finally concluded that wheat loaded on the vessel haci resit kalkavan was soft wheat and the sellers were in breach of the description condition of the contract. 44. it is pertinent to state that the sellers had challenged the award (no. 3782) passed by the board of appeal in the high court of justice at london. the three decisions; (i) agroexport5 by queen's bench division, (ii) toepfer6 by court of appeal, and (iii) gill & duffus7 by house of lords, were holding the field at the time of consideration of sellers' appeal by the high court of justice at london. in agroexport , it has been held that an award founded on evidence of analysis made other than in accordance with contract terms cannot stand and deserves to be set aside as evidence relied upon was inadmissible. the court of appeal in toepfer has laid down that where seller and buyer have agreed that a certificate at loading as to the quality of goods shall be final and binding on them, the buyer will be precluded from recovering hc-nic page 66 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order damages from the seller, even if, the person giving the certificate has been negligent in making it. toepfer has been approved by the house of lords in gill & duffus7. the high court of justice at london can be assumed to have full knowledge of the legal position exposited in agroexport5 , toepfer6 and gill & duffus7 yet it found no ground or justification for setting aside the award (no. 3782) passed by the board of appeal. if a ground supported by the decisions of that country was not good enough for setting aside the award by the court competent to do so, a fortiori, such ground can hardly be a good ground for refusing enforcement of the award. accordingly, we are not persuaded to accept the submission of mr. rohinton f. nariman that delhi high court ought to have refused to enforce the foreign awards as the board of appeal has wrongly rejected the certificate of quality obtained from the buyers' nominated certifying agency and taken into consideration inadmissible evidence in the nature of certificates obtained by the buyers' for the purposes of forwarding contract. 43. moreover, section 48 of the 1996 act does not give an opportunity to have a 'second look' at the foreign award in the award ­ enforcement stage. the scope of inquiry under section 48 does not permit review of the foreign award on merits. procedural defects (like taking into consideration inadmissible evidence or ignoring/rejecting the evidence which may be of binding nature) in the course of foreign arbitration do not lead necessarily to excuse an award from enforcement on the ground of public policy. 47. while considering the enforceability of foreign awards, the court does not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the foreign award nor does it enquire as to whether, while rendering foreign award, some error hc-nic page 67 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order has been committed. under section 48(2)(b) the enforcement of a foreign award can be refused only if such enforcement is found to be contrary to (1) fundamental policy of indian law; or (2) the interests of india; or (3) justice or morality. the objections raised by the appellant do not fall in any of these categories and, therefore, the foreign awards cannot be held to be contrary to public policy of india as contemplated under section 48(2)(b). 48. the contention of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that the board of appeal dealt with the questions not referred to it and which were never in dispute and, therefore, these awards cannot be enforced being contrary to section 48(1)(c) is devoid of any substance and is noted to be rejected.\" 91. on the aforesaid aspects, learned counsel for the petitioner has also relied upon the following judgments of the bombay high court and calcutta high court :­ (i) jaldhi overseas pvt. fzc v. vinergy international private ltd. [2016 scc online cal 2299]. (ii) noble resources ltd. v. twenty first century wire roads ltd. [2015 scc online bom 4677] (iii)integrated sales services ltd. v. arun dev [2017 (1) mhlj 681]. (iv) canadian commercial corporation v. coal india ltd. [2016 scc online cal 5031]. (v) gea egi contracting/engineering co. ltd. v. bharat heavy electricals ltd. [233 (2016) dlt 661]. (vi) rio glass solar sa v. shriram epc ltd. & ors. [manu/tn/0458/2017] hc-nic page 68 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order 92. learned counsel for the respondents has also relied upon the judgment passed in the case of hadley vs. baxendale [156 eng. rep. 145], and contended that as there was back to back contract which was known to the parties, loss of profits cannot be awarded as awarded by learned tribunal. firstly, the said aspect touches the merits of the awards directly and therefore, it is beyond the scope of inquiry that this court is entitled to make under section 48 of the act and secondly, even if the awards in question are considered, there is finding of the fact that there was no back to back contract and therefore, with respect to the said judgments, the same will have no application to the facts of the case on hand. learned counsel for the respondents has relied upon the judgment of the apex court in the case of union of india & ors. vs. sugauli sugar works (p) ltd. [(1976) 93 scc 32], and contended that, in case of breach of contract, as far as possible the injured party should be placed in as good situation as if the contract had been performed and while awarding damages by breach of contract, the rule as to market price is intended to secure only an indemnity to the purchaser. even this aspect would touch the merits of the awards in question and the facts of that case were different and distinct, whereas in the case on hand, the awards being governed by the provisions of uk sale of goods act with respect the hc-nic page 69 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order aforesaid judgment would not be applicable to the present case. 93. similarly, learned counsel for the respondents has also relied upon the judgment rendered in the case of messrs. trojan & company vs. rm. n.n.nagappa chettiar [air 1953 sc 235] and has contended that in case of breach of contract, measure of damages cannot be the amount of loss ultimately sustained by the represented. in the case on hand, as stated hereinabove, the parties had agreed for applicability of english law and the issues of quantum of damages that were awarded by learned arbitral tribunal would not only touch the merits of the awards, but the awards are passed as per the law applicable in england and therefore, the aforesaid judgment also would not render any assistance to the case of the respondents. 94. learned counsel for the respondents has also relied upon the judgment of apex court in the case of murlidhar chiranjilal vs. harishchandra dwarkadas & anr. [air 1962 sc 366] and has contended that there is breach of sections 73 and 74 of the indian contract act, as already held above, the case on hand is for enforcement of foreign award and even if, there is any alleged breach of indian law, the same would not amount to contravention of fundamental policy of indian law and hence, the said judgment would also not hc-nic page 70 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order apply to the facts of the present case. 95. the respondents have also relied upon the judgment of the apex court in the case of associate builders (supra), wherein the apex court while considering the aspect of fundamental policy of indian law, interest of india, justice and morality and patently illegal i.e contravention of substantial law of india and contravention of arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 and contravention of terms of the contract, has observed thus:­ 27. coming to each of the heads contained in the saw pipes judgment, we will first deal with the head \"fundamental policy of indian law\". it has already been seen from the renusagar judgment that violation of the foreign exchange act and disregarding orders of superior courts in india would be regarded as being contrary to the fundamental policy of indian law. to this it could be added that the binding effect of the judgment of a superior court being disregarded would be equally violative of the fundamental policy of indian law. 28. in a recent judgment, ongc ltd. v. western geco international ltd., 2014 (9) scc 263, this court added three other distinct and fundamental juristic principles which must be understood as a part and parcel of the fundamental policy of indian law. the court held­ \"35. what then would constitute the \"fundamental policy of indian law\" is the question. the decision in ongc [ongc ltd. v. saw pipes ltd., (2003) 5 scc 705] does not elaborate that aspect. even so, the expression must, in our opinion, include all such fundamental principles as hc-nic page 71 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order providing a basis for administration of justice and enforcement of law in this country. without meaning to exhaustively enumerate the purport of the expression \"fundamental policy of indian law\", we may refer to three distinct and fundamental juristic principles that must necessarily be understood as a part and parcel of the fundamental policy of indian law. the first and foremost is the principle that in every determination whether by a court or other authority that affects the rights of a citizen or leads to any civil consequences, the court or authority concerned is bound to adopt what is in legal parlance called a \"judicial approach\" in the matter. the duty to adopt a judicial approach arises from the very nature of the power exercised by the court or the authority does not have to be separately or additionally enjoined upon the fora concerned. what must be remembered is that the importance of a judicial approach in judicial and quasi­judicial determination lies in the fact that so long as the court, tribunal or the authority exercising powers that affect the rights or obligations of the parties before them shows fidelity to judicial approach, they cannot act in an arbitrary, capricious or whimsical manner. judicial approach ensures that the authority acts bona fide and deals with the subject in a fair, reasonable and objective manner and that its decision is not actuated by any extraneous consideration. judicial approach in that sense acts as a check against flaws and faults that can render the decision of a court, tribunal or authority vulnerable to challenge. 38. equally important and indeed fundamental to the policy of indian law is the principle that a court and so also hc-nic page 72 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order a quasijudicial authority must, while determining the rights and obligations of parties before it, do so in accordance with the principles of natural justice. besides the celebrated audi alteram partem rule one of the facets of the principles of natural justice is that the court/authority deciding the matter must apply its mind to the attendant facts and circumstances while taking a view one way or the other. non­application of mind is a defect that is fatal to any adjudication. application of mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of the mind and disclosure of mind is best done by recording reasons in support of the decision which the court or authority is taking. the requirement that an adjudicatory authority must apply its mind is, in that view, so deeply embedded in our jurisprudence that it can be described as a fundamental policy of indian law. 39. no less important is the principle now recognised as a salutary juristic fundamental in administrative law that a decision which is perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would have arrived at the same will not be sustained in a court of law. perversity or irrationality of decisions is tested on the touchstone of wednesbury principle [associated provincial picture houses ltd. v. wednesbury corpn., (1948) 1 kb 223: (1947) 2 all er 680 (ca)] of reasonableness. decisions that fall short of the standards of reasonableness are open to challenge in a court of law often in writ jurisdiction of the superior courts but no less in statutory processes wherever the same are available. 40. it is neither necessary nor proper for us to attempt an exhaustive enumeration of what would constitute the fundamental policy of indian law nor is hc-nic page 73 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order it possible to place the expression in the straitjacket of a definition. what is important in the context of the case at hand is that if on facts proved before them the arbitrators fail to draw an inference which ought to have been drawn or if they have drawn an inference which is on the face of it, untenable resulting in miscarriage of justice, the adjudication even when made by an arbitral tribunal that enjoys considerable latitude and play at the joints in making awards will be open to challenge and may be cast away or modified depending upon whether the offending part is or is not severable from the rest.\" 29. it is clear that the juristic principle of a \"judicial approach\" demands that a decision be fair, reasonable and objective. on the obverse side, anything arbitrary and whimsical would obviously not be a determination which would either be fair, reasonable or objective. interest of india 35. the next ground on which an award may be set aside is that it is contrary to the interest of india. obviously, this concerns itself with india as a member of the world community in its relations with foreign powers. as at present advised, we need not dilate on this aspect as this ground may need to evolve on a case by case basis. justice 36. the third ground of public policy is, if an award is against justice or morality. these are two different concepts in law. an award can be said to be against justice only when it shocks the conscience of the court. an illustration of this can be given. a claimant is content with restricting his claim, let us say to rs. 30 lakhs in a statement of claim before the arbitrator and hc-nic page 74 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order at no point does he seek to claim anything more. the arbitral award ultimately awards him 45 lakhs without any acceptable reason or justification. obviously, this would shock the conscience of the court and the arbitral award would be liable to be set aside on the ground that it is contrary to \"justice\". morality 37. the other ground is of \"morality\". just as the expression \"public policy\" also occurs in section 23 of the indian contract act, so does the expression \"morality\". two illustrations to the said section are interesting for they explain to us the scope of the expression \"morality\". \"(j) a, who is b's mukhtar, promises to exercise his influence, as such, with b in favour of c, and c promises to pay 1,000 rupees to a. the agreement is void, because it is immoral. (k) a agrees to let her daughter to hire to b for concubinage. the agreement is void, because it is immoral, though the letting may not be punishable under the indian penal code (xlv of 1860).\" 39. this court has confined morality to sexual morality so far as section 23 of the contract act is concerned, which in the context of an arbitral award would mean the enforcement of an award say for specific performance of a contract involving prostitution. \"morality\" would, if it is to go beyond sexual morality necessarily cover such agreements as are not illegal but would not be enforced given the prevailing mores of the day. however, interference on this ground would also be only if something shocks the court's conscience.\" 96. at the outset, it deserves to be noted that in the case of associates builders (supra), the case before the apex court was of domestic award and the apex court has examined the aspect of award, which was contrary to the fundamental policy of hc-nic page 75 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order indian law or contrary to the interest of india, contrary to justice or morality or was patently illegal as provided under section 34 of the act, wherein the scope is wider than section 48 of the act. it is not the case of the respondents that, the impugned awards are passed disregarding the order of superior court in india. as per the facts revealed in the instant case, the parties had agreed to the applicability of english law. all the parties were heard before the arbitral tribunal as well as the appellate board and in fact, the respondents carried the order further before the superior courts in england and have failed. it is also not the case of the respondents that principle of audi alteram partem has been breached. as held hereinabove, in inquiry under section 48 of the act read with explanations 1 and 2 to section 48 of the act, the respondents have failed to establish that the awards are in contravention with the fundamental policy of the indian law or that the same is in conflict with basic notion of morality or justice. explanation 2 of section 48 plays a vital role and is an important aspect which has to be borne in mind by this court while examining the foreign awards at the stage of enforcement. thus, all the parties were heard at every stage, more particularly the respondents cannot make any grievance that any ex parte award is passed at any stage and therefore, considering explanation 2 to section 48(2) of the act, this court cannot hc-nic page 76 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order entail any inquiry into the review on the merits of the dispute and as stated earlier, the apex court in the case of associates builders (supra) has examined the domestic awards. 97. in light of the aforesaid provisions of law applicable i.e. uk sale of goods act, even if the principle as held by the apex court in the case of associates builder (supra), are applied, the grounds raised by the respondents do not constitute even remotely that there is any contravention to the fundamental policy of india or there is basic notion of morality or justice. 98. hypothetical example which was relied upon by learned counsel for the respondents may be good when indian law is to be applied and therefore, in the instant case, it cannot be said that the impugned awards are against public policy of india or that they are against the principles of morality and justice. 99. in the facts of this case, it cannot be said that the awards are such that it would shock the conscience of the court and the parties are bound by the agreement and the aspect whether it shocks conscience of the court depends on the facts of each case and when the parties had agreed for applicability of english law and arbitration under the gafta rules at london, the contention that the award is punitive award cannot now be considered under section 48 of the act. the hc-nic page 77 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order parties were aware about the provisions of section 51(1) and 51(3) of uk sale of goods act which has been considered by learned arbitral tribunal. 100. learned counsel for the respondent has also relied upon the judgment of the apex court in the case of oil & natural gas corporation ltd., [(2003) 5 scc 705], wherein the apex court has observed thus:­ \"12. hence, the jurisdiction or the power of the arbitral tribunal is prescribed under the act and if the award is dehors the said provisions, it would be, on the face of it, illegal. the decision of the tribunal must be within the bounds of its jurisdiction conferred under the act or the contract. in exercising jurisdiction, the arbitral tribunal cannot act in breach of some provision of substantive law or the provisions of the act. 13. the question, therefore, which requires consideration is whether the award could be set aside, if the arbitral tribunal has not followed the mandatory procedure prescribed under s. 24, 28 or 31(3), which affects the rights of the parties? under sub­section (1) (a) of s. 28 there is a mandate to the arbitral tribunal to decide the dispute in accordance with the substantive law for the time being in force in india. admittedly, substantive law would include the indian contract act, the transfer of property act and other such laws in force. suppose, if the award is passed in violation of the provisions of the transfer of property act or in violation of the indian contract act, the question would be ­ whether such award could be set aside? similarly, under sub­ section (3), arbitral tribunal is directed hc-nic page 78 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order to decide the dispute in accordance with the terms of the contract and also after taking into account the usage of the trade applicable to the transaction. if arbitral tribunal ignores the terms of the contract or usage of the trade applicable to the transaction, whether the said award could be interfered? similarly, if the award is non­ speaking one and is in violation of s. 31(3), can such award be set aside? in our view, reading s. 34 conjointly with other provisions of the act, it appears that the legislative intent could not be that if the award is in contravention of the provisions of the act, still however, it couldn't be set aside by the court. if it is held that such award could not be interfered, it would be contrary to basic concept of justice. if the arbitral tribunal has not followed the mandatory procedure prescribed under the act, it would mean that it has acted beyond its jurisdiction and thereby the award would be patently illegal which could be set aside under s. 34. 15. result is ­ if the award is contrary to the substantive provisions of law or the provisions of the act or against the terms of the contract, it would be patently illegal, which could be interfered under s. 34. however, such failure of procedure should be patent affecting the rights of the parties. 16. the next clause which requires interpretation is cl. (ii) of sub­section (2)(b) of s. 34 which inter alia provides that the court may set aside arbitral award if it is in conflict with the 'public policy of india.' the phrase 'public policy of india' is not defined under the act. hence, the said term is required to be given meaning in context and also considering the purpose of the section and scheme of the act. it has been repeatedly stated by various authorities that the expression 'public policy' does not admit of precise hc-nic page 79 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order definition and may vary from generation to generation and from time to time. hence, the concept 'public policy' is considered to be vague, susceptible to narrow or wider meaning depending upon the context in which it is used. lacking precedent the court has to give its meaning in the light and principles underlying the arbitration act, contract act and constitutional provisions. 18. further, in renusagar power co. ltd. v. general electric co. (1994 supp (1) scc 644), this court considered s. 7(1) of the arbitration (protocol and convention) act, 1937 which inter alia provided that a foreign award may not be enforced under the said act, if the court dealing with the case is satisfied that the enforcement of the award will be contrary to the public policy. after elaborate discussion, the court arrived at the conclusion that public policy comprehended in s. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards (recognition and enforcement) act, 1961 is the 'public policy of india' and does not cover the public policy of any other country. for giving meaning to the term 'public policy,' the court observed thus :­ \"66. article 5(2)(b) of the new york convention of 1958 and s. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act do not postulate refusal of recognition and enforcement of a foreign award on the ground that it is contrary to the law of the country of enforcement and the ground of challenge is confined to the recognition and enforcement being contrary to the public policy of the country in which the award is set to be enforced. there is nothing to indicate that the expression \"public policy\" in art. 5(2)(b) of the new york convention and s. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act is not used in the same sense in which it was used in art. 1(c) of the geneva convention of 1927 and s. 7(1) of the protocol and convention act of 1937. this would mean that \"public policy\" in s. hc-nic page 80 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order 7(1)(b)(ii) has been used in a narrower sense and in order to attract to bar of public policy the enforcement of the award must invoke something more than the violation of the law of india. since the foreign awards act is concerned with recognition and enforcement of foreign awards which are governed by the principles of private international law, the expression \"public policy\" in s. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act must necessarily be construed in the sense the doctrine of public policy is applied in the field of private international law. applying the said criteria it must be held that the enforcement of a foreign award would be refused on the ground that it is contrary to public policy if such enforcement would be contrary to (i) fundamental policy of indian law; or (ii) the interests of india; or (iii) justice or morality.\" 18. the court finally held that :­ \"76. keeping in view the aforesaid objects underlying fera and the principles governing enforcement of exchange control laws followed in other countries, we are of the view that the provisions contained in fera have been enacted to safeguard the economic interests of india and any violation of the said provisions would be contrary to the public policy of india as envisaged in s. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the act.\" 20. mr. desai submitted that the narrow meaning given to the term 'public policy' in renusagar's case is in context of the fact that the question involved in the said matter was with regard to the execution of the award which had attained finality. it was not a case where validity of the award is challenged before a forum prescribed under the act. he submitted that the scheme of s. 34 which deals with setting aside the domestic arbitral award and s. 48 which deals with enforcement of foreign award are hc-nic page 81 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order not identical. a foreign award by definition is subject to double exequatur. this is recognised inter alia by s. 48(1) and there is no parallel provision to this clause in s. 34. for this, he referred to lord mustill and stewart c. boyd qc's \"commercial arbitration\" 2001 wherein (at page 90) it is stated as under :­ \"mutual recognition of awards is the glue which holds the international arbitrating community together, and this will only be strong if the enforcing court is willing to trust, as the convention assumes that they will trust, the supervising authorities of the chosen venue. it follows that if, and to the extent that the award has been struck down in the local court it should be a matter of theory and practice be treated when enforcement is sought as if to the extent it did not exist.\" 21. he further submitted that in foreign arbitration, the award would be subject to being set aside or suspended by the competent authority under the relevant law of that country whereas in the domestic arbitration the only recourse is to s. 34. the aforesaid submission of the learned senior counsel requires to be accepted. from the judgments discussed above, it can be held that the term 'public policy of india' is required to be interpreted in the context of the jurisdiction of the court where the validity of award is challenged before it becomes final and executable. the concept of enforcement of the award after it becomes final is different and the jurisdiction of the court at that stage could be limited. similar is the position with regard to the execution of a decree. it is settled law as well as it is provided under code of civil procedure that once the decree has attained finality, in an execution proceeding, it may be challenged only on limited grounds such as the decree being without jurisdiction or hc-nic page 82 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order nullity. but in a case where the judgment and decree is challenged before the appellate court or the court exercising revisional jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of such court would be wider. therefore, in a case where the validity of award is challenged there is no necessity of giving a narrower meaning to the term 'public policy of india.' on the contrary, wider meaning is required to be given so that the 'patently illegal award' passed by the arbitral tribunal could be set aside. if narrow meaning as contended by the learned senior counsel mr. dave is given, some of the provisions of the arbitration act would become nugatory. take for illustration a case wherein there is a specific provision in the contract that for delayed payment of the amount due and payable, no interest would be payable, still however, if the arbitrator has passed an award granting interest, it would be against the terms of the contract and thereby against the provision of s. 28(3) of the act which specifically provides that \"arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract.\" further, where there is a specific usage of the trade that if the payment is made beyond a period of one month, then the party would be required to pay the said amount with interest at the rate of 15 per cent. despite the evidence being produced on record for such usage, if the arbitrator refuses to grant such interest on the ground of equity, such award would also be in violation of sub­sections (2) and (3) of s. 28. section 28(2) specifically provides that arbitrator shall decide ex aequo et bono (according to what is just and good) only if the parties have expressly authorised him to do so. similarly, if the award is patently against the statutory provisions of substantive law which is in force in india or is passed without giving an opportunity of hearing to the parties as provided under s. 24 or hc-nic page 83 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order without giving any reason in a case where parties have not agreed that no reasons are to be recorded, it would be against the statutory provisions. in all such cases, the award is required to be set aside on the ground of 'patent illegality.\" 101. in the above cited judgment, the apex court has considered the aspect relating to enforcement of domestic award as provided under section 34 of the act and hence, the same would not be applicable to the case on hand. 102. learned counsel for the respondents has also placed reliance on the following judgments :­ (i) central inland water transport corporation limited & anr. vs. brojo nath ganguly & anr. [(1986) 3 scc 156]. (iii) gherulal parakh vs. mahadeodas maliya & ors. [air 1959 sc 781]. (iii) thyssen krupp materials ag vs. the steel authority of india [2017 scc online del 7997] (iv) usha beltron ltd. vs. nand kishore parasramka & anr. [2001 sc online cal 255] 103. thus, having agreed to the applicability of english law and the learned tribunal having applied the provisions of uk sale of goods act as well as gafta rules, the same would not mean that there is any contravention of fundamental policy of india and as the facts unfold from the record of the petitions, admittedly the awards have been upheld by the appellate board as well as the courts in england. hc-nic page 84 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order 104. this group of petitions are considered at this stage to determine whether the awards in question are enforceable and whether the awards are deemed to be decree by this court as provided under section 49 of the act. as far as this aspect is concerned, learned counsel for the parties have contended that the aforesaid first part may be decided first by this court and accordingly, following the ratio laid down by the apex court in the case of fuerst day lawson ltd.(supra), keeping the petitions pending, by this order only 1st part, viz., whether the awards in question are deemed to be decree of this court or not as provided under the act is hereby decided. 105. while considering the jurisdiction of the executing court to execute the foreign awards as provided under section 7 (1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act, the apex court has held that objections about unjust enrichment may relate to the merits of the award, which is beyond the scope of the objections that can be raised under section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the foreign awards act and it has been accordingly held that such course is not permissible under the new york convention and under the foreign awards act. provisions of section 48 of the act materially corresponds to section 7 of the foreign awards act. in the case on hand also, the parties agreed for applicability of english law and arbitration hc-nic page 85 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order under the gafta rules at london. the awards clearly postulate that the arbitral tribunal and the appellate board have granted damages as per the provisions of uk sale of goods act while interpreting sections 51(1) and 51 (3) of the uk sale of goods act and therefore, the contention raised by the respondents that the damages awarded by learned tribunal is more than actual loss and therefore, the same would amount to unjust enrichment, which in turn would be in contravention of the fundamental policy of the indian law and would mean that this court has to go into the merits of the awards with regard to quantum awarded by learned arbitral tribunal and following the ratio laid down by the apex court in the case of renusagar power co. ltd. (supra), the same would be beyond the scope. 106. in the case on hand, it is an admitted position that the petitions relate to foreign awards, which have attained finality under the english law. thus, as held by the apex court in the case of shri lal mahal limited (supra) and more particularly, even after amendment of 2015, scope of inquiry is very limited on the aspect that it is in contravention of the fundamental policy of the indian law or that it is in conflict with public law and this court cannot entail review on merits into the dispute. the contention raised by the respondents in opinion of this court, would amount to inquiry into the merits. it is not the hc-nic page 86 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order case of the respondents that the awards in question were induced by fraud or corruption or is violative of sections 75 and 84 of the act. it is an admitted position that the parties had agreed for applicability of english law and all appellate authorities and the courts in england have upheld the awards in­origin passed by the arbitral tribunal as well as the appellate board and therefore, considering the ratio laid down by the apex court in the case of shri lal mahal limited (supra), read with explanation 2 of section 48 even in limited scope of inquiry, in the facts of the case, none of the grounds raised by the respondents would establish that the awards in question are in contravention with the fundamental policy of the indian law. 107. following the ratio laid down by the hon'ble supreme court, bombay high court and calcutta high court, scope of inquiry under section 48 of the act is very limited and this court cannot adjudicate upon the merits of the case or to review the findings on merits rendered by learned arbitral tribunal as well as the courts in england. 108. considering the facts of the case on hand, learned arbitral tribunal as well as the appellate board after hearing all the parties and after considering applicable law, more particularly provisions of section 51(1) and 51(3) of the uk sale of goods act, have passed hc-nic page 87 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order the awards. following the ratio laid down by the apex court in the cases of shri lal mahal limited (supra), as well as the judgment of bombay high court and culcutta high court as referred above, section 48 of the act does not give additional opportunity to have second look of the foreign award, at the stage of enforcing of the foreign award and this court, therefore, is not empowered to look into the aspect whether the provisions of section 51(2) or section 51 (3) of the uk sale of goods act would apply and on that count, it cannot be gainsaid that the same is in contravention with the fundamental policy of the indian law or that it is against the morality and also that the same would shock the conscience of this court. 109. considering the contention of learned counsel for the respondents that the impugned awards are in breach of sections 73 and 74 of the indian contract act and therefore, the same would amount to contravention of fundamental policy of indian law, deserves to be negatived. at this stage, it would be appropriate to refer to the judgment of the delhi high court rendered in the case of cruz city mauritius holdings vs. unitech ltd., [2017 scc online del 7810], wherein it has observed thus:­ \"96. it plainly follows from the above that a contravention of a provision of law is insufficient to invoke the defence of public hc-nic page 88 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order policy when it becomes to enforcement of a foreign award. contravention of any provision of an enactment is not synonymous to contravention of fundamental policy of indian law. the expression fundamental policy of indian laws refers to the principles and the legislative policy of which indian statutes and laws are founded. the expression \"fundamental policy\" connotes the basic and substratal rationable, values and principles whcih form the bedrock of laws in our country. 97. it is necessary to bear in mind that a foreign award may be based on foreign law, which may be at variance with a corresponding indian statute. and, if the expression \"fundamental policy of indian law\" is considered as a reference to a provision of the indian statue, as is sought to be contended on behalf of unitech, the basic purpose of the new york convention to enforce foreign awards would stand frustrated. one of the principal objective of the new york convention is to ensure enforcement of awards notwithstanding that the awards are not rendered in conformity to the national laws. thus, the objections to enforcement on the ground of public policy must be such that offend the core values of a member state's national policy and which it cannot be expected to compromise. the expression \"fundamental policy of law\" must be interpreted in that perspective and must mean only the fundamental and substratal legislative policy and not a provision of any enactment. 99. the explanations to section 48(2) of the act as amended introduced by the arbitration adn conciliation (amendment) act, 2015 have brought about a material change and further narrowed the scope of the public policy defence: first, explanation 1 has sought to replace the inclusive scope of the pre­amendment provision by an exhaustive hc-nic page 89 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order one; second, interest of india is no longer included in the scope of public policy; and third, it has been expressly provided, although the same was authoritatively settled by the supreme court in renusagar power co. ltd. v. central electric co. that examiantion of whether the arbitral award offends the fundamental policy of indian law, does not entail a review on merits.\" 110. considering the provisions of section 28(1)(b)(1) of the act and the facts of the case on hand, the parties had agreed that the arbitration would be as per the gafta rules and the seat of arbitration would be at london and the parties had also agreed that the english law would apply, now cannot be permitted to argue again on merits as is sought to be done indirectly by contending that the impugned awards are in contravention of fundamental policy of the indian law and morality and that the same would shock the conscience of the court on the grounds that are contended by the respondents, more particularly the ground that there is violation of the provisions of sections 73 and 74 of the indian contract act. the parties to the contract were aware about the contracts and the date on which the contracts were entered between the parties and that they have agreed to be governed by english law and learned tribunal having applied the provisions of uk sale of goods act, which have attained finality in the learned tribunal, the appellate board as well as the courts in england, the same cannot be now re­examined on merits by contending hc-nic page 90 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order that it is violative of fundamental policy of indian law and morality. 111. thus, in the case on hand, only because learned arbitral tribunal while applying section 51(3) of the uk sale of goods act has awarded a particular quantum of amount, mere violation of sections 73 and 74 of the indian contract act, therefore, would not amount to contravention of fundamental policy of the indian law. 112. in light of the aforesaid contention therefore, for examining whether it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of indian law, it deserves to be noted at the outset that by explanation 2, which is inserted/substituted by act 3 of 2016 w.e.f. 23.10.2015 clearly postulates that such inquiry is very narrow and the same shall not entail a review on merits of the dispute and it carries a narrow meaning in comparison to the provisions of section 34(2)(b) of the act. 113. government of india in the publication titled legal glossary prepared by ministry of law & company affairs, in 1983 edition has defined expression \"public policy\" as principles in accordance with which action of men and commodities need to be regulated to achieve the good of entire community or public. (reference to law relating to arbitration and conciliation by dr. p.c. markanda, 9th edition). hc-nic page 91 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order 114. again, referring to the facts which arise in this group of petitions, the parties entered into a contract for supply of indian rapeseed meal and have determined and selected appropriate law, i.e., the parties have agreed for arbitration and has also agreed for applicability of english law. the parties participated in arbitration proceedings which culminated into an award by arbitral board and confirmed in appeal under the gafta rules and the leave to appeal was not granted. having accepted the applicability of english law, the awards are based on the provisions of english law, i.e., uk sale of goods act. the contention that the actual loss is less than the damages which is awarded by the arbitrator is a matter of fact and the merits which are considered by the arbitrator as per the english law and further by the english courts taking into consideration the provisions of the uk sale of goods act. therefore, the contention that the awards in question are in contravention with section 73 of the contract act would not take the case of the respondents any further. considering the binding decision of the apex court in the case of renu sagar (supra) and shri lal mahal ltd. (supra), the award of damages as per the english law and the applicability of section 51(3) of the uk sale of goods act is entirely in the arena of the merits of the award and the same cannot be reopened, re­examined or re­appreciated by this court. hc-nic page 92 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order 115. having agreed to the applicability of a particular law under english law and having participated in the proceedings, the same cannot be re­opened by this court while deciding the issue under sections 47, 48 and 49 of the act at the instance of the respondents and following the explanation 2 of section 48 therefore, even while examining the aspect whether the awards are in contravention with the fundamental policy of india, the same shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute. it is not the case of the respondents that the contracts entered into between the parties were against any indian law or was in contravention of the fundamental policy of indian law, neither there is any other breach of indian law for entering into such contracts. in opinion of this court, the contracts were entered into between the respondents who are indian suppliers and the petitioner who was a foreign buyer, which is legal and proper. both the parties agreed that the english law would apply and though the transaction of contract cannot be examined by this court, suffice it to say that such contracts did not contravene any other law as applicable in india or any fundamental policy of indian law. in facts of the case, it cannot be said that enforcement of the awards would be injury to the public good or possibly, that enforcement would be wholly offensive to the ordinary/reasonable and fully hc-nic page 93 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order informed member of the public. 116. therefore on the grounds which are raised to buttress the contention that the impugned awards are against the fundamental policy of indian law, more or less touches the merits of the award and enforcement of the award cannot be denied merely on the alleged ground that it is against the provisions of section 73 of indian contract act. even the contention that inspite of actual loss occurred, a sum of rs. 13 million dollars is awarded for 9 contracts is based upon the applicability of the relevant provisions of the uk sale of goods act, which was agreed by the parties to be made applicable and on such ground, it cannot be said that the impugned awards are in any way violative of fundamental policy of indian law. it is not the case of the respondents that the enforcement of the awards would result into breach of any public policy of india and therefore, the contention raised by the respondents to say that the impugned awards are against the fundamental policy of indian law deserves to be negatived. even examining the other limb of argument that the impugned awards are against the morality and would shock the conscience of this court, it deserves to be noted that the breach came to be initiated with the non­supply of goods agreed by the respondents themselves. having agreed for applicability of english law and the awards having been based upon hc-nic page 94 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order the provisions of uk sale of goods act and more particularly applicability of section 51(3) of the said act, it cannot be said that the impugned awards are against morality or that it shocks the conscience of this court. in a commercial transaction which was entered into between the parties as normal businessmen and both the parties having agreed to a particular course and applicability of arbitration clause with applicability of english law, it cannot be said that the impugned awards lack morality or it would shock the conscience of this court. 117. considering the aforesaid as well as taking into consideration the ratio laid down by the hon'ble apex court as well as judgments of the other high courts, all contentions raised by the respondents that the impugned awards are against the fundamental policy of indian law and that the same lacks morality and that the same is in contravention with a particular provision of the indian law and that it shocks the conscience of this court deserve to be negatived. even the contention that other arbitral proceedings relating to the similar contracts are still pending wherein the petitioners have sought adjournment time and again even for production of documents in opinion of this court would not affect the enforceability of the awards in question. 118. in facts of the aforesaid case therefore, this hc-nic page 95 of 96 created on sat aug 12 13:46:18 ist 2017 o/iaap/2/2017 order court finds that the awards in question have become final as per the english law and this court is satisfied that the awards in question are enforceable and it is hereby held that the awards shall be deemed to be decree of this court. 119. the parties shall complete the pleadings within a period of four weeks. the petitions be listed for further hearing on 11.09.2017.
